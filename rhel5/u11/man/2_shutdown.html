<p>NAME shutdown - shut down part of a full-duplex
connection</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int shutdown(int s, int how);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The shutdown() call causes all or part of a
full-duplex connection on the socket associated with s to be
shut down. If how is SHUT_RD, fur- ther receptions will be
disallowed. If how is SHUT_WR, further trans- missions will
be disallowed. If how is SHUT_RDWR, further receptions and
transmissions will be disallowed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF s is not a valid descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTCONN The specified socket is not connected.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK s is a file, not a socket.</p>

<p>NOTES The constants SHUT_RD, SHUT_WR, SHUT_RDWR have the
value 0, 1, 2, respectively, and are defined in
&lt;sys/socket.h&gt; since glibc-2.1.91.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001, 4.4BSD (the shutdown()
function call first appeared in 4.2BSD).</p>
