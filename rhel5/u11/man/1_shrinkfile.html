<p>NAME shrinkfile - shrink a file on a line boundary</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS shrinkfile [ -n ] [ -m maxsize ] [ -s size ] [
-v ] file...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The shrinkfile program shrinks files to a
given size if the size is larger than maxsize, preserving
the data at the end of the file. Trun- cation is performed
on line boundaries, where a line is a series of . There is
no line length restric- bytes ending with a newline, 0 tion
and files may contain any binary data.</p>

<p>Temporary files are created in the &lt;pathtmp in
inn.conf&gt; directory. The TMPDIR environment variable may
be used to specify a different directory.</p>

<p>A newline will be added to any non-empty file that does
not end with a newline. The maximum file size will not be
exceeded by this addition.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s By default, size is assumed to be zero and
files are truncated to zero bytes. By default, maxsize is
the same as size. If maxsize is less than size, maxsize is
reset to size. The -s flag may be used to change the
truncation size. Because the program truncates only on line
boundaries, the final size may be smaller then the specified
truncation size. The size and max- size parameter may end
with a k , m, or g, indicating kilobyte (1024), megabyte
(1048576) or gigabyte (1073741824) lengths. Uppercase
letters are also allowed. The maximum file size is
2147483647 bytes.</p>

<p>-v If the -v flag is used, then shrinkfile will print a
status line if a file was shrunk.</p>

<p>-n If the -n flag is used, then shrinkfile will exit 0
if any file is larger than maxsize and exit 1 otherwise. No
files will be altered.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Example usage:</p>

<p>shrinkfile -s 4m curds shrinkfile -s 1g -v whey
shrinkfile -s 500k -m 4m -v curds whey if shrinkfile -n -s
100m whey; then echo whey is way too big; fi</p>
