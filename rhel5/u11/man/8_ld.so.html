<p>LD.SO(8) Linux Programmer s Manual LD.SO(8)</p>

<p>NAME ld.so, ld-linux.so* - dynamic linker/loader</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The programs ld.so and ld-linux.so* find and
load the shared libraries needed by a program, prepare the
program to run, and then run it.</p>

<p>Linux binaries require dynamic linking (linking at run
time) unless the -static option was given to ld during
compilation.</p>

<p>The program ld.so handles a.out binaries, a format used
long ago; ld- linux.so* handles ELF (/lib/ld-linux.so.1 for
libc5, /lib/ld-linux.so.2 for glibc2), which everybody has
been using for years now. Otherwise both have the same
behaviour, and use the same support files and pro- grams
ldd(1), ldconfig(8) and /etc/ld.so.conf.</p>

<p>The shared libraries needed by the program are searched
for in various places:</p>

<p>o (ELF only) Using the DT_RPATH dynamic section
attribute of the binary if present and DT_RUNPATH attribute
does not exist. Use of DT_RPATH is deprecated.</p>

<p>o Using the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Except
if the executable is a set-user-ID/set-group-ID binary, in
which case it is ignored.</p>

<p>o (ELF only) Using the DT_RUNPATH dynamic section
attribute of the binary if present.</p>

<p>o From the cache file /etc/ld.so.cache which contains a
compiled list of candidate libraries previously found in the
augmented library path. If, however, the binary was linked
with -z node- flib linker option, libraries in the default
library paths are skipped.</p>

<p>o In the default path /lib, and then /usr/lib. If the
binary was linked with -z nodeflib linker option, this step
is skipped.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS The dynamic linker can be run either indirectly
through running some dynamically linked program or library
(in which case no command line options to the dynamic linker
can be passed and, in the ELF case, the dynamic linker which
is stored in the .interp section of the program is executed)
or directly by running:</p>

<p>/lib/ld-linux.so.* [OPTIONS] [PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS]]</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS --list List all dependencies and
how they are resolved.</p>

<p>--verify Verify that program is dynamically linked and
this dynamic linker can handle it.</p>

<p>--library-path PATH Override LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable setting (see below).</p>

<p>--ignore-rpath LIST Ignore RPATH and RUNPATH information
in object names in LIST. This option has been supported by
glibc2 for about one hour. Then it was renamed into:</p>

<p>--inhibit-rpath LIST</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT There are four important environment
variables.</p>

<p>LD_LIBRARY_PATH A colon-separated list of directories in
which to search for ELF libraries at execution-time. Similar
to the PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>LD_PRELOAD A whitespace-separated list of additional,
user-specified, ELF shared libraries to be loaded before all
others. This can be used to selectively override functions
in other shared libraries. For set-user-ID/set-group-ID ELF
binaries, only libraries in the standard search directories
that are also set- user-ID will be loaded.</p>

<p>LD_BIND_NOW (libc5; glibc since 2.1.1) If set to
non-empty string, causes the dynamic linker to resolve all
symbols at program startup instead of deferring function
call resolval to the point when they are first referenced.
This is useful when using a debug- ger.</p>

<p>LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS (ELF only) If set to non-empty
string, causes the program to list its dynamic library
dependencies, as if run by ldd(1), instead of running
normally.</p>

<p>Then there are lots of more or less obscure variables,
many obsolete or only for internal use.</p>

<p>LD_WARN (ELF only)(glibc since 2.1.3) If set to
non-empty string, warn about unresolved symbols.</p>

<p>LD_NOWARN (a.out only)(libc5) Suppress warnings about
a.out libraries with incompatible minor version numbers.</p>

<p>LD_BIND_NOT (glibc since 2.1.95) Do not update the GOT
(global offset table) and PLT (procedure linkage table)
after resolving a symbol.</p>

<p>LD_DEBUG (glibc since 2.1) Output verbose debugging
information about the dynamic linker. If set to all prints
all debugging information it has, if set to help prints a
help message about which cate- gories can be specified in
this environment variable.</p>

<p>LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT (glibc since 2.1) File where LD_DEBUG
output should be fed into, default is standard output.
LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT is ignored for set- user-ID/set-group-ID
binaries.</p>

<p>LD_VERBOSE (glibc since 2.1) If set to non-empty string,
output symbol ver- sioning information about the program if
querying information about the program (ie. either
LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS has been set, or --list or --verify
options have been given to the dynamic linker).</p>

<p>LD_PROFILE (glibc since 2.1) Shared object to be
profiled.</p>

<p>LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT (glibc since 2.1) File where
LD_PROFILE output should be stored, default is standard
output. LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT is ignored for
set-user-ID/set-group-ID binaries.</p>

<p>LD_AOUT_LIBRARY_PATH (libc5) Version of LD_LIBRARY_PATH
for a.out binaries only. Old versions of ld-linux.so.1 also
supported LD_ELF_LIBRARY_PATH.</p>

<p>LD_AOUT_PRELOAD (libc5) Version of LD_PRELOAD for a.out
binaries only. Old ver- sions of ld-linux.so.1 also
supported LD_ELF_PRELOAD.</p>

<p>LD_SHOW_AUXV (glibc since 2.1) Show auxiliary array
passed up from the ker- nel.</p>

<p>LD_HWCAP_MASK (glibc since 2.1) Mask for hardware
capabilities.</p>

<p>LD_ORIGIN_PATH (glibc since 2.1) Path where the binary
is found (for non-set- user-ID programs).</p>

<p>LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK (glibc since 2.1.91) Allow weak symbols
to be overridden (reverting to old glibc behaviour).</p>

<p>LD_KEEPDIR (a.out only)(libc5) Dont ignore the directory
in the names of a.out libraries to be loaded. Use of this
option is strongly discouraged.</p>

<p>LDD_ARGV0 (libc5) argv[0] to be used by ldd(1) when none
is present.</p>

<p>FILES /lib/ld.so a.out dynamic linker/loader
/lib/ld-linux.so.{1,2} ELF dynamic linker/loader
/etc/ld.so.cache File containing a compiled list of
directories in which to search for libraries and an ordered
list of candidate libraries. /etc/ld.so.preload File
containing a whitespace separated list of ELF shared
libraries to be loaded before the program. lib*.so* shared
libraries</p>

<p>NOTES The ld.so functionality is available for
executables compiled using libc version 4.4.3 or greater.
ELF functionality is available since Linux 1.1.52 and
libc5.</p>
