<p>METAFLAC(1) METAFLAC(1)</p>

<p>NAME metaflac - program to list, add, remove, or edit
metadata in one or more FLAC files.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS metaflac [ options ] [ operations ] FLACfile
...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Use metaflac to list, add, remove, or edit
metadata in one or more FLAC files. You may perform one
major operation, or many shorthand opera- tions at a
time.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --preserve-modtime Preserve the original
modification time in spite of edits.</p>

<p>--with-filename Prefix each output line with the FLAC
file name (the default if more than one FLAC file is
specified).</p>

<p>--no-filename Do not prefix each output line with the
FLAC file name (the default if only one FLAC file is
specified).</p>

<p>--dont-use-padding By default metaflac tries to use
padding where possible to avoid rewriting the entire file if
the metadata size changes. Use this option to tell metaflac
to not take advantage of padding this way.</p>

<p>SHORTHAND OPERATIONS --show-md5sum Show the MD5
signature from the STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-min-blocksize Show the minimum block size from
the STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-max-blocksize Show the maximum block size from
the STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-min-framesize Show the minimum frame size from
the STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-max-framesize Show the maximum frame size from
the STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-sample-rate Show the sample rate from the
STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-channels Show the number of channels from the
STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-bps Show the # of bits per sample from the
STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-total-samples Show the total # of samples from
the STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--show-vendor-tag Show the vendor string from the
VORBIS_COMMENT block.</p>

<p>--show-tag=name Show all tags where the the field name
matches name .</p>

<p>--remove-tag=name Remove all tags whose field name is
name.</p>

<p>--remove-first-tag=name Remove first tag whose field
name is name.</p>

<p>--remove-all-tags Remove all tags, leaving only the
vendor string.</p>

<p>--set-tag=field Add a tag. The field must comply with
the Vorbis comment spec, of the form &quot;NAME=VALUE&quot;.
If there is currently no tag block, one will be created.</p>

<p>--import-tags-from=file Import tags from a file. Use -
for stdin. Each line should be of the form NAME=VALUE.
Multi-line comments are currently not supported. Specify
--remove-all-tags and/or --no-utf8-con- vert before
--import-tags-from if necessary.</p>

<p>--export-tags-to=file Export tags to a file. Use - for
stdin. Each line will be of the form NAME=VALUE. Specify
--no-utf8-convert if necessary.</p>

<p>--import-cuesheet-from=file Import a cuesheet from a
file. Use - for stdin. Only one FLAC file may be specified.
A seekpoint will be added for each index point in the
cuesheet to the SEEKTABLE unless --no-cued- seekpoints is
specified.</p>

<p>--export-cuesheet-to=file Export CUESHEET block to a
cuesheet file, suitable for use by CD authoring software.
Use - for stdout. Only one FLAC file may be specified on the
command line.</p>

<p>--add-replay-gain Calculates the title and album
gains/peaks of the given FLAC files as if all the files were
part of one album, then stores them in the VORBIS_COMMENT
block. The tags are the same as those used by vorbisgain.
Existing ReplayGain tags will be replaced. If only one FLAC
file is given, the album and title gains will be the same.
Since this operation requires two passes, it is always
executed last, after all other operations have been
completed and written to disk. All FLAC files speci- fied
must have the same resolution, sample rate, and number of
channels. The sample rate must be one of 8, 11.025, 12, 16,
22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, or 48 kHz.</p>

<p>--add-seekpoint={#|X|#x|#s} Add seek points to a
SEEKTABLE block. Using #, a seek point at that sample number
is added. Using X, a placeholder point is added at the end
of a the table. Using #x, # evenly spaced seek points will
be added, the first being at sample 0. Using #s, a seekpoint
will be added every # seconds (# does not have to be a whole
number; it can be, for example, 9.5, meaning a seekpoint
every 9.5 seconds). If no SEEKTABLE block exists, one will
be created. If one already exists, points will be added to
the existing table, and any duplicates will be turned into
place- holder points. You may use many --add-seekpoint
options; the resulting SEEKTABLE will be the unique-ified
union of all such values. Example: --add-seekpoint=100x
--add-seekpoint=3.5s will add 100 evenly spaced seekpoints
and a seekpoint every 3.5 sec- onds.</p>

<p>--add-padding=length Add a padding block of the given
length (in bytes). The overall length of the new block will
be 4 + length; the extra 4 bytes is for the metadata block
header.</p>

<p>MAJOR OPERATIONS --list List the contents of one or more
metadata blocks to stdout. By default, all metadata blocks
are listed in text format. Use the following options to
change this behavior:</p>

<p>--block-number=#[,#[...]] An optional comma-separated
list of block numbers to dis- play. The first block, the
STREAMINFO block, is block 0.</p>

<p>--block-type=type[,type[...]]</p>

<p>--except-block-type=type[,type[...]] An optional
comma-separated list of block types to be included or
ignored with this option. Use only one of --block-type or
--except-block-type. The valid block types are: STREAMINFO,
PADDING, APPLICATION, SEEKTABLE, VORBIS_COMMENT. You may
narrow down the types of APPLI- CATION blocks displayed as
follows:</p>

<p>APPLICATION:abcd The APPLICATION block(s) whose textual
repre- sentation of the 4-byte ID is &quot;abcd&quot;
APPLICATION:0xXXXXXXXX The APPLICATION block(s) whose
hexadecimal big- endian representation of the 4-byte ID is
&quot;0xXXXXXXXX&quot;. For the example &quot;abcd&quot;
above the hex- adecimal equivalalent is 0x61626364</p>

<p>Note: if both --block-number and --[except-]block-type
are specified, the result is the logical AND of both
arguments.</p>

<p>--application-data-format=hexdump|text If the
application block you are displaying contains binary data
but your --data-format=text, you can display a hex dump of
the application data contents instead using
--application-data-format=hexdump.</p>

<p>--remove Remove one or more metadata blocks from the
metadata. Unless --dont-use-padding is specified, the blocks
will be replaced with padding. You may not remove the
STREAMINFO block.</p>

<p>--block-number=#[,#[...]]</p>

<p>--block-type=type[,type[...]]</p>

<p>--except-block-type=type[,type[...]] See --list above
for usage.</p>

<p>Note: if both --block-number and --[except-]block-type
are specified, the result is the logical AND of both
arguments.</p>

<p>--remove-all Remove all metadata blocks (except the
STREAMINFO block) from the metadata. Unless
--dont-use-padding is specified, the blocks will be replaced
with padding.</p>

<p>--merge-padding Merge adjacent PADDING blocks into
single blocks.</p>

<p>--sort-padding Move all PADDING blocks to the end of the
metadata and merge them into a single block.</p>
