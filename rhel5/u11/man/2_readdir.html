<p>READDIR(2) Linux Programmer s Manual READDIR(2)</p>

<p>NAME readdir - read directory entry</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;linux/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;linux/dirent.h&gt;</p>

<p>int readdir(unsigned int fd, struct dirent *dirp,
unsigned int count);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is not the function you are interested
in. Look at readdir(3) for the POSIX conforming C library
interface. This page documents the bare kernel system call
interface, which can change, and which is superseded by
getdents(2).</p>

<p>readdir() reads one dirent structure from the directory
pointed at by fd into the memory area pointed to by dirp.
The parameter count is ignored; at most one dirent structure
is read.</p>

<p>The dirent structure is declared as follows:</p>

<p>struct dirent { long d_ino; /* inode number */ off_t
d_off; /* offset to this dirent */ unsigned short d_reclen;
/* length of this d_name */ char d_name [NAME_MAX+1]; /*
filename (null-terminated) */ }</p>

<p>d_ino is an inode number. d_off is the distance from the
start of the directory to this dirent. d_reclen is the size
of d_name, not counting the null terminator. d_name is a
null-terminated filename.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, 1 is returned. On end of
directory, 0 is returned. On error, -1 is returned, and
errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF Invalid file descriptor fd.</p>

<p>EFAULT Argument points outside the calling process s
address space.</p>

<p>EINVAL Result buffer is too small.</p>

<p>ENOENT No such directory.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR File descriptor does not refer to a
directory.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is Linux specific.</p>

<p>NOTES Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system
call; call it using syscall(2).</p>
