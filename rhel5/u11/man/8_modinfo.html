<p>modinfo(8) modinfo(8)</p>

<p>NAME modinfo program to show information about a Linux
Kernel module</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS modinfo [-0] [-F field] [modulename|filename
...]</p>

<p>modinfo -V</p>

<p>modinfo -h</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION modinfo extracts information from the Linux
Kernel modules given on the command line. If the module name
is not a filename, then the /lib/mod- ules/version directory
is searched, as done by modprobe(8).</p>

<p>modinfo by default lists each attribute of the module in
form fieldname : value, for easy reading. The filename is
listed the same way (although its not really an
attribute).</p>

<p>This version of modinfo can understand modules of any
Linux Kernel architecture.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V --version Print the modinfo version. Note
BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY below: you might be printing the
version of modinfo.old.</p>

<p>-F --field Only print this field value, one per line.
This is most use- ful for scripts. Field names are
case-insenitive. Common fields (which may not be in every
module) include author, description, license, param,
depends, and alias. There are often multiple param, alias
and depends fields. The special field filename lists the
filename of the mod- ule.</p>

<p>-0 --null Use the ASCII zero character to separate field
values, instead of a new line. This is useful for scripts,
since a new line can theoretically appear inside a
field.</p>

<p>-a -d -l -p -n These are shortcuts for author,
description, license. param and filename respectively, to
ease the transition from the old modutils modinfo.</p>

<p>BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY This version of modinfo is for
kernel modules 2.5.48 and above. If it detects a kernel with
support for old-style modules, it will attempt to run
modprobe.old in its place, so it is completely transparent
to the user.</p>

<p>Note that the output of this version of modinfo is
simpler and more regular than the older version: scripts
attempting to use the default output may get confused with
complex fields.</p>

<p>You can force the new modinfo to always be used, by
setting the NEW_MODINFO environment variable.</p>
