<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) MAKEDEV(8) Linux
Programmer s Manual MAKEDEV(8)</p>

<p>NAME MAKEDEV - create devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /sbin/MAKEDEV -V /sbin/MAKEDEV [ -d directory ]
[ -D directory ] [ -c configdir ] [ -m maxdevices ] [-a]
[-n] [-v] [-i] [-M] [-S] [-u] [-x] device ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION MAKEDEV is a program that will create the
devices in /dev used to interface with drivers in the
kernel.</p>

<p>Note that programs giving the error ENOENT: No such file
or direc- tory normally means that the device file is
missing, whereas ENODEV: No such device normally means the
kernel does not have the driver configured or loaded.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V Print out version and exit.</p>

<p>-a Always create devices, even if they already exist and
have the proper permissions and file context. The default
behavior is to only (re-)create device nodes which appear to
be missing or whose permissions differ from the configured
values.</p>

<p>-m maxdevices Create no more than the specified number
of devices for any specification in a configuration
file.</p>

<p>-n Do not actually update the devices, just print the
actions that would be performed.</p>

<p>-M Create symlinks, directories, and sockets belonging
to the cur- rent user, and print out the list of devices
which would be cre- ated in a format which is understood by
RPM.</p>

<p>-S Do not actually update the devices, just print the
actions that would be performed in a format which can be fed
to a shell.</p>

<p>-d directory Create the devices under directory instead
of the default (usu- ally /dev).</p>

<p>-D directory Compute file contexts for device creation
as if the directory specified for the -d flag were the
specified directory. This is useful if the -d flag is being
used to populate a chrooted device directory.</p>

<p>-u Print the ownership and permissions for devices
instead of cre- ating them. The information is formatted for
use by udev.</p>

<p>-x Create exactly the named device. By default, device
names which have the specified device name as the initial
portion of their name are also created. For example,
specifying &quot;tty&quot; will also trigger the creation of
&quot;tty1&quot;, &quot;tty2&quot;, and so on.</p>

<p>-v Be verbose. Print out the actions as they are
performed. This is the same output as produced by the -n
option.</p>

<p>-i Ignore errors parsing configuration files.</p>

<p>CUSTOMIZATION Since there is currently no
standardization in what names are used for system users and
groups, it is possible that you may need to modify MAKEDEV s
configuration files to reflect your site s settings.</p>

<p>DEVICES Certain devices are required for minimal
functionality. These are: mem - access to physical memory;
null - null device (infinite sink); port - access to I/O
ports; zero - null byte source (infinite source); core -
symlink to /proc/kcore (for kernel debugging); full - always
returns ENOSPACE on write; ram - ramdisk; tty - to access
the controlling tty of a process.</p>

<p>Virtual Terminals</p>

<p>console This creates the devices associated with the
console. These are the virtual terminals ttyx, where x can
be from 0 though 63. The device tty0 is the currently active
VT, and is also known as console. For each VT, there are two
devices: vcsx and vcsax, which can be used to generate
screen-dumps of the VT (vcsx is just the text, and vcsax
includes the attributes).</p>

<p>Serial Devices</p>

<p>ttyS{0..63} Serial ports.</p>

<p>Pseudo Terminals</p>

<p>pty[p-s] Each possible argument will create a bank of 16
master and slave pairs. The current kernel (1.2) is limited
to 64 such pairs. The master pseudo-terminals are
pty[p-s][0-9a-f], and the slaves are tty[p-s][0-9a-f].</p>

<p>Parallel Ports</p>

<p>lp Standard parallel ports. The devices are created lp0,
lp1, and lp2.</p>

<p>Bus Mice</p>

<p>busmice The various bus mice devices. This creates the
following devices: logimouse (Logitech bus mouse), psmouse
(PS/2-style mouse), msmouse (Microsoft Inport bus mouse) and
atimouse (ATI XL bus mouse) and jmouse (J-mouse).</p>

<p>Joystick Devices</p>

<p>js Joystick. Creates js0 and js1.</p>

<p>Disk Devices</p>

<p>fd[0-7] Floppy disk devices. The device fdx is the
device which autode- tects the format, and the additional
devices are fixed format (whose size is indicated in the
name). The other devices are named as fdxLn. The single
letter L identifies the type of floppy disk (d = 5.25&quot;
DD, h = 5.25&quot; HD, D = 3.5&quot; DD, H = 3.5&quot; HD, E
= 3.5&quot; ED). The number n represents the capacity of
that format in K. Thus the standard formats are fdxd360,
fdxh1200, fdxD720, fdxH1440, and fdxE2880.</p>

<p>For more information see Alain Knaff s fdutils
package.</p>

<p>Devices fd0* through fd3* are floppy disks on the first
con- troller, and devices fd4* through fd7* are floppy disks
on the second controller.</p>

<p>hd[a-d] AT hard disks. The device hdx provides access to
the whole disk, with the partitions being hdx[0-20]. The
four primary partitions are hdx1 through hdx4, with the
logical partitions being numbered from hdx5 though hdx20. (A
primary partition can be made into an extended partition,
which can hold 4 logical partitions). By default, only the
devices for 4 logical parti- tions are made. The others can
be made by uncommenting them.</p>

<p>Drives hda and hdb are the two on the first controller.
If using the new IDE driver (rather than the old HD driver),
then hdc and hdd are the two drives on the secondary
controller. These devices can also be used to acess IDE
CDROMs if using the new IDE driver.</p>

<p>xd[a-d] XT hard disks. Partitions are the same as IDE
disks.</p>

<p>sd[a-z], sd[a-c][a-z], sdd[a-x] SCSI hard disks. The
partitions are similar to the IDE disks, but there is a
limit of 11 logical partitions (sdx5 through sdx15). This is
to allow there to be 128 SCSI disks.</p>

<p>loop Loopback disk devices. These allow you to use a
regular file as a block device. This means that images of
filesystems can be mounted, and used as normal. This creates
16 devices loop0 through loop15.</p>

<p>Tape Devices</p>

<p>st[0-7] SCSI tapes. This creates the rewinding tape
device stx and the non-rewinding tape device nstx.</p>

<p>qic QIC-80 tapes. The devices created are rmt8, rmt16,
tape-d, and tape-reset.</p>

<p>ftape Floppy driver tapes (QIC-117). There are 4 methods
of access depending on the floppy tape drive. For each of
access methods 0, 1, 2 and 3, the devices rftx (rewinding)
and nrftx (non- rewinding) are created. For compatability,
devices ftape and nftape are symlinks to rft0 and nrft0
respectively.</p>

<p>CDROM Devices</p>

<p>scd[0-7] SCSI CD players.</p>

<p>sonycd Sony CDU-31A CD player.</p>

<p>mcd Mitsumi CD player.</p>

<p>cdu535 Sony CDU-535 CD player.</p>

<p>lmscd LMS/Philips CD player.</p>

<p>sbpcd{,1,2,3} Sound Blaster CD player. The kernel is
capable of supporting 16 CDROMs, each of which is accessed
as sbpcd[0-9a-f]. These are assigned in groups of 4 to each
controller. sbpcd is a symlink to sbpcd0.</p>

<p>Scanner</p>

<p>logiscan Logitech ScanMan32 &amp; ScanMan 256.</p>

<p>m105scan Mustek M105 Handscanner.</p>

<p>ac4096 A4Tek Color Handscanner.</p>

<p>Audio</p>

<p>sound This creates the audio devices used by the sound
driver. These include mixer, sequencer, dsp, and audio.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous</p>

<p>sg Generic SCSI devices. The devices created are sga
through sgh and sg0 through sg7. These allow arbitary
commands to be sent to any SCSI device. This allows for
querying information about the device, or controlling SCSI
devices that are not one of disk, tape or CDROM (e.g.
scanner, CD-R, CD-RW).</p>

<p>fd To allow an arbitary program to be fed input from
file descrip- tor x, use /dev/fd/x as the file name. This
also creates /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout, and /dev/stderr.
(Note, these are just symlinks into /proc/self/fd).</p>

<p>ibcs2 Devices (and symlinks) needed by the IBCS2
emulation.</p>

<p>apm Devices for power management.</p>

<p>Network Devices Linux used to have devices in /dev for
controlling network devices, but that is no longer the case.
To see what network devices are known by the kernel, look in
/proc/net/dev.</p>

<p>Other Devices Note that the list of devices above is not
exhaustive. MAKEDEV can create more devices nodes. Its aim
is to be able to create everything listed in the devices.txt
file distributed with Linux 2.4.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION MAKEDEV doesnt actually know anything
about devices. It reads all of the information from files
stored in /etc/makedev.d. MAKEDEV will read any and all
files in the subdirectory, skipping over subdirectories,
symbolic links, and device nodes, processing lines in the
files like so:</p>

<p>devices [b|c] mode owner group major minor inc count fmt
[base] count devices will be created, with permissions set
to mode and owned by owner and group. The first device will
be named fmt, and additional devices will be created if
count is larger than 1. If fmt contains a C-style formatting
string, it will be filled with the sum of base and zero.
Subsequent devices will be filled with the sum of base and n
* inc, where n is the order this device is being created in.
If the format string did not already include a format
specifier, a &quot;%d&quot; will automatically be appended
to it to make this work.</p>

<p>symbolic links l linkname target A symbolic link
pointing to target named linkname will be cre- ated.</p>

<p>aliases a alias value Any commands that create devices
for alias will also include devices that would be crated for
value.</p>

<p>macros =macro expansion Indicates a macro which can be
referenced as $macro in subsequent configuration
statements.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION CONFLICTS In the event that the set of
configuration files contains multiple rules for a given
device name, MAKEDEV will use all of them. The end result is
typically that the last rule given (either by virtue of
being listed below all other matching rules in the same
file, or by being listed in a file which is read after all
others which contain alternate rules) will apply. MAKEDEV
reads the set of configuration files in sorted order, so
this misfeature can be exploited dependably.</p>

Mathiasen &lt;device@lanana.org&gt;.</p>

<p>BUGS Lets hope not. If were lucky, any problems we ll
find will be con- fined to the configuration files, which
were written by examining the devices.txt file. If your
system uses udev, conflicts between devices.txt and the
in-kernel data which udev uses for naming devices may crop
up. If you find any bugs, please file them in the bug
database at http://bugzilla.redhat.com/ against the
&quot;MAKEDEV&quot; compo- nent.</p>
