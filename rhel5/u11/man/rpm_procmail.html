<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) PROCMAIL(1)
PROCMAIL(1)</p>

<p>NAME procmail - autonomous mail processor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS procmail [-ptoY] [-f fromwhom] [parameter=value
| rcfile] ... procmail [-toY] [-f fromwhom] [-a argument]
... -d recipient ... procmail [-ptY] -m [parameter=value]
... rcfile [argument] ... procmail [-toY] [-a argument] -z
procmail -v</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For a quick start, see NOTES at the end.</p>

<p>Procmail should be invoked automatically over the
.forward file mecha- nism as soon as mail arrives.
Alternatively, when installed by a sys- tem administrator
(and in the standard Red Hat Linux configuration), it can be
invoked from within the mailer immediately. When invoked, it
first sets some environment variables to default values,
reads the mail message from stdin until an EOF, separates
the body from the header, and then, if no command line
arguments are present, it starts to look for a file named
$HOME/.procmailrc. According to the processing recipes in
this file, the mail message that just arrived gets dis-
tributed into the right folder (and more). If no rcfile is
found, or processing of the rcfile falls off the end,
procmail will store the mail in the default system
mailbox.</p>

<p>If no rcfiles and no -p have been specified on the
command line, proc- mail will, prior to reading
$HOME/.procmailrc, interpret commands from /etc/procmailrc
(if present). Care must be taken when creating
/etc/procmailrc, because, if circumstances permit, it will
be executed with root privileges (contrary to the
$HOME/.procmailrc file of course).</p>

<p>If running suid root or with root privileges, procmail
will be able to perform as a functionally enhanced,
backwards compatible mail delivery agent.</p>

<p>Procmail can also be used as a general purpose mail
filter, i.e., pro- visions have been made to enable procmail
to be invoked in a special sendmail rule.</p>

<p>The rcfile format is described in detail in the
procmailrc(5) man page.</p>

<p>The weighted scoring technique is described in detail in
the proc- mailsc(5) man page.</p>

<p>Examples for rcfile recipes can be looked up in the
procmailex(5) man page.</p>

<p>Signals TERMINATE Terminate prematurely and requeue the
mail.</p>

<p>HANGUP Terminate prematurely and bounce the mail.</p>

<p>INTERRUPT Terminate prematurely and bounce the mail.</p>

<p>QUIT Terminate prematurely and silently lose the
mail.</p>

<p>ALARM Force a timeout (see TIMEOUT).</p>

<p>USR1 Equivalent to a VERBOSE=off.</p>

<p>USR2 Equivalent to a VERBOSE=on.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v Procmail will print its version number,
display its compile time configuration and exit.</p>

<p>-p Preserve any old environment. Normally procmail
clears the envi- ronment upon startup, except for the value
of TZ. However, in any case: any default values will
override any preexisting environment variables, i.e.,
procmail will not pay any attention to any prede- fined
environment variables, it will happily overwrite them with
its own defaults. For the list of environment variables that
procmail will preset see the procmailrc(5) man page. If both
-p and -m are specified, the list of preset environment
variables shrinks to just: LOGNAME, HOME, SHELL, ORGMAIL and
MAILDIR.</p>

<p>-t Make procmail fail softly, i.e., if procmail cannot
deliver the mail to any of the destinations you gave, the
mail will not bounce, but will return to the mailqueue.
Another delivery- attempt will be made at some time in the
future.</p>

<p>-f fromwhom Causes procmail to regenerate the leading
From line with fromwhom as the sender (instead of -f one
could use the alternate and obsolete -r). If fromwhom
consists merely of a single -, then procmail will only
update the timestamp on the From line (if present, if not,
it will generate a new one).</p>

<p>-o Instead of allowing anyone to generate From lines,
simply over- ride the fakes.</p>

<p>-Y Assume traditional Berkeley mailbox format, ignore
any Content- Length: fields.</p>

<p>-a argument This will set $1 to be equal to argument.
Each succeeding -a argument will set the next number
variable ($2, $3, etc). It can be used to pass meta
information along to procmail. This is typi- cally done by
passing along the $@x information from the sendmail mailer
rule.</p>

<p>-d recipient ... This turns on explicit delivery mode,
delivery will be to the local user recipient. This, of
course, only is possible if proc- mail has root privileges
(or if procmail is already running with the recipients euid
and egid). Procmail will setuid to the intended recipients
and delivers the mail as if it were invoked by the recipient
with no arguments (i.e., if no rcfile is found, delivery is
like ordinary mail). This option is incompatible with
-p.</p>

<p>-m Turns procmail into a general purpose mail filter. In
this mode one rcfile must be specified on the command line.
After the rcfile, procmail will accept an unlimited number
of arguments. If the rcfile is an absolute path starting
with /etc/procmailrcs/ without backward references (i.e. the
parent directory cannot be mentioned) procmail will, only if
no security violations are found, take on the identity of
the owner of the rcfile (or sym- bolic link). For some
advanced usage of this option you should look in the
EXAMPLES section below.</p>

<p>-z This turns on LMTP mode, wherein procmail acts as an
RFC2033 LMTP server. Delivery takes place in the same manner
and under the same restrictions as the delivery mode enabled
with -d. This option is incompatible with -p and -f.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Any arguments containing an = are considered
to be environment vari- able assignments, they will all be
evaluated after the default values have been assigned and
before the first rcfile is opened.</p>

<p>Any other arguments are presumed to be rcfile paths
(either absolute, or if they start with ./ relative to the
current directory; any other relative path is relative to
$HOME, unless the -m option has been given, in which case
all relative paths are relative to the current directory);
procmail will start with the first one it finds on the com-
mand line. The following ones will only be parsed if the
preceding ones have a not matching HOST-directive entry, or
in case they should not exist.</p>

<p>If no rcfiles are specified, it looks for
$HOME/.procmailrc. If not even that can be found, processing
will continue according to the default settings of the
environment variables and the ones specified on the command
line.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Examples for rcfile recipes can be looked up in
the procmailex(5) man page. A small sample rcfile can be
found in the NOTES section below.</p>

<p>Skip the rest of this EXAMPLES section unless you are a
system adminis- trator who is vaguely familiar with
sendmail.cf syntax.</p>

<p>The -m option is typically used when procmail is called
from within a rule in the sendmail.cf file. In order to be
able to do this it is convenient to create an extra procmail
mailer in your sendmail.cf file (in addition to the perhaps
already present local mailer that starts up procmail). To
create such a procmail mailer I d suggest something
like:</p>

<p>Mprocmail, P=/usr/bin/procmail, F=mSDFMhun, S=11, R=21,
A=procmail -m $h $g $u</p>

<p>This enables you to use rules like the following (most
likely in rule- set 0) to filter mail through the procmail
mailer (please note the leading tab to continue the rule,
and the tab to separate the com- ments):</p>

<p>R$*&lt;@some.where&gt;$* $#procmail
$@/etc/procmailrcs/some.rc $:$1@some.where.procmail$2
R$*&lt;@$*.procmail&gt;$* $1&lt;@$2&gt;$3 Already filtered,
map back</p>

<p>And /etc/procmailrcs/some.rc could be as simple as:</p>

<p>SENDER = &quot;&lt;$1&gt;&quot; # fix for empty sender
addresses SHIFT = 1 # remove it from $@</p>

<p>:0 # sink all junk mail * ^Subject:.*junk /dev/null</p>

<p>:0 w # pass along all other mail ! -oi -f
&quot;$SENDER&quot; &quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p>Do watch out when sending mail from within the
/etc/procmailrcs/some.rc file, if you send mail to addresses
which match the first rule again, you could be creating an
endless mail loop.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd to set the recipients LOGNAME, HOME
and SHELL variable defaults</p>

<p>/var/mail/$LOGNAME system mailbox; both the system
mailbox and the immediate directory it is in will be created

simply $LOCKEXT as locallockfile.</p>

<p>Couldnt read &quot;x&quot; Procmail was unable to open
an rcfile or it was not a regular file, or procmail couldnt
open an MH directory to find the highest numbered file.</p>

<p>Couldn t unlock &quot;x&quot; Lockfile was already gone,
or write permission to the directory where the lockfile is
has been denied.</p>

<p>Deadlock attempted on &quot;x&quot; The locallockfile
specified on this recipe is equal to a still active
$LOCKFILE.</p>

<p>Denying special privileges for &quot;x&quot; Procmail
will not take on the identity that comes with the rcfile
because a security viola- tion was found (e.g. -p or
variable assignments on the command line) or procmail had
insuffi- cient privileges to do so.</p>

<p>Descriptor &quot;x&quot; was not open As procmail was
started, stdin, stdout or stderr was not connected (possibly
an attempt to sub- vert security)</p>

<p>Enforcing stricter permissions on &quot;x&quot; The

at exactly the same time.</p>

<p>Forcing lock on &quot;x&quot; Lockfile &quot;x&quot; is
going to be removed by force be- cause of a timeout (see
also: LOCKTIMEOUT).</p>

<p>Incomplete recipe The start of a recipe was found, but
it stranded in an EOF.</p>

<p>Insufficient privileges Procmail either needs root
privileges, or must have the right (e)uid and (e)gid to run
in de- livery mode. The mail will bounce.</p>

<p>Invalid regexp &quot;x&quot; The regular expression
&quot;x&quot; contains errors (most likely some missing or
extraneous parens).</p>

<p>Kernel-lock failed While trying to use the
kernel-supported locking calls, one of them failed (usually
indicates an OS error), procmail ignores this error and pro-
ceeds.</p>

<p>Kernel-unlock failed See above.</p>

<p>Lock failure on &quot;x&quot; Can only occur if you
specify some real weird (and illegal) lockfilenames or if
the lockfile could not be created because of insufficient
permissions or nonexistent subdirectories.</p>

<p>Lost &quot;x&quot; Procmail tried to clone itself but
could not find back rcfile &quot;x&quot; (it either got
removed or it was a relative path and you changed directory
since procmail opened it last time).</p>

<p>Missing action The current recipe was found to be
incomplete.</p>

<p>Missing closing brace A nesting block was started, but
never finished.</p>

<p>Missing name The -f option needs an extra argument.</p>

<p>Missing argument You specified the -a option but forgot
the argu- ment.</p>

<p>Missing rcfile You specified the -m option, procmail
expects the name of an rcfile as argument.</p>

<p>Missing recipient You specified the -d option or called
procmail under a different name, it expects one or more
recipients as arguments.</p>

<p>No space left to finish writing &quot;x&quot; The
filesystem containing &quot;x&quot; does not have enough
free space to permit delivery of the mes- sage to the

<p>Out of memory The system is out of swap space (and
NORESRETRY has been exhausted).</p>

<p>Processing continued The unrecognised options on the
command line are ignored, proceeding as usual.</p>

<p>Program failure (nnn) of &quot;x&quot; Program that was
started by procmail returned nnn instead of EXIT_SUCCESS
(=0); if nnn is neg- ative, then this is the signal the
program died on.</p>

<p>Quota exceeded while writing &quot;x&quot; The filesize
quota for the recipient on the filesystem containing
&quot;x&quot; does not permit deliv- ering the message to
the file.</p>

<p>Renaming bogus &quot;x&quot; into &quot;x&quot; The
system mailbox of the recipient was found to be bogus,
procmail performed evasive actions.</p>

<p>Rescue of unfiltered data succeeded/failed A filter
returned unsuccessfully, procmail tried to get back the
original text.</p>

<p>Skipped: &quot;x&quot; Couldnt do anything with

<p>Suspicious rcfile &quot;x&quot; The owner of the rcfile
was not the recipient or root, the file was world writable,
or the direc- tory that contained it was world writable, or
this was the default rcfile ($HOME/.procmailrc) and either
it was group writable or the directo- ry that contained it
was group writable (the rc- file was not used).</p>

<p>Terminating prematurely whilst waiting for ... Procmail

<p>Truncated file to former size The file could not be
delivered to successfully, so the file was truncated to its
former size.</p>

<p>Truncating &quot;x&quot; and retrying lock &quot;x&quot;

<p>Executing &quot;x&quot; Starting program &quot;x&quot;.

<p>Unlocking &quot;x&quot; Removing lockfile &quot;x&quot;
again.</p>

<p>WARNINGS You should create a shell script that uses
lockfile(1) before invoking your mail shell on any mailbox
file other than the system mailbox (un- less of course, your
mail shell uses the same lockfiles (local or glob- al) you
specified in your rcfile).</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that you absolutely need to kill
procmail before it has finished, first try and use the
regular kill command (i.e., not kill -9, see the subsection
Signals for suggestions), otherwise some lockfiles might not
get removed.</p>

<p>Beware when using the -t option, if procmail repeatedly
is unable to deliver the mail (e.g., due to an incorrect
rcfile), the system mailqueue could fill up. This could
aggravate both the local postmas- ter and other users.</p>

<p>The /etc/procmailrc file might be executed with root
privileges, so be very careful of what you put in it. SHELL
will be equal to that of the current recipient, so if
procmail has to invoke the shell, youd better set it to some
safe value first. See also: DROPPRIVS.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that if chown(1) is permitted on files in
/etc/procmail- rcs/, that they can be chowned to root (or
anyone else) by their cur- rent owners. For maximum
security, make sure this directory is exe- cutable to root
only.</p>

<p>Procmail is not the proper tool for sharing one mailbox
among many users, such as when you have one POP account for
all mail to your do- main. It can be done if you manage to
configure your MTA to add some headers with the envelope
recipient data in order to tell Procmail who a message is
for, but this is usually not the right thing to do. Per-
haps you want to investigate if your MTA offers virtual user
tables, or check out the multidrop facility of
Fetchmail.</p>

<p>BUGS After removing a lockfile by force, procmail waits
$SUSPEND seconds be- fore creating a new lockfile so that
another process that decides to remove the stale lockfile
will not remove the newly created lock by mistake.</p>

<p>Procmail uses the regular TERMINATE signal to terminate
any runaway filter, but it does not check if the filter
responds to that signal and it only sends it to the filter
itself, not to any of the filters chil- dren.</p>

<p>A continued Content-Length: field is not handled
correctly.</p>

<p>The embedded newlines in a continued header should be
skipped when matching instead of being treated as a single
space as they are now.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS If there is an existing Content-Length:
field in the header of the mail and the -Y option is not
specified, procmail will trim the field to re- port the
correct size. Procmail does not change the fieldwidth.</p>

<p>If there is no Content-Length: field or the -Y option
has been speci- fied and procmail appends to regular
mailfolders, any lines in the body of the message that look
like postmarks are prepended with &gt; (disarms bogus
mailheaders). The regular expression that is used to search
for these postmarks is: 0rom</p>

<p>If the destination name used in explicit delivery mode
is not in /etc/passwd, procmail will proceed as if explicit
delivery mode was not in effect. If not in explicit delivery
mode and should the uid proc- mail is running under, have no
corresponding /etc/passwd entry, then HOME will default to
/, LOGNAME will default to #uid, SHELL will de- fault to
/bin/sh, and ORGMAIL will default to /tmp/dead.letter.</p>

<p>When in explicit delivery mode, procmail will generate a
leading From line if none is present. If one is already
present procmail will leave it intact. If procmail is not
invoked with one of the following user or group ids : root,
daemon, uucp, mail, x400, network, list, slist, lists or
news, but still has to generate or accept a new From line,
it will generate an additional &gt;From line to help
distinguish fake mails.</p>

<p>For security reasons procmail will only use an absolute
or $HOME-rela- tive rcfile if it is owned by the recipient
or root, not world writable, and the directory it is
contained in is not world writable. The $HOME/.procmailrc
file has the additional constraint of not being
group-writable or in a group-writable directory.</p>

<p>If /var/mail/$LOGNAME is a bogus mailbox (i.e., does not
belong to the recipient, is unwritable, is a symbolic link
or is a hard link), proc- mail will upon startup try to
rename it into a file starting with BO- GUS.$LOGNAME. and
ending in an inode-sequence-code. If this turns out to be
impossible, ORGMAIL will have no initial value, and hence
will inhibit delivery without a proper rcfile.</p>

<p>If /var/mail/$LOGNAME already is a valid mailbox, but
has got too loose permissions on it, procmail will correct
this. To prevent procmail from doing this make sure the u+x
bit is set.</p>

<p>When delivering to directories, MH folders, or maildir
folders, you don t need to use lockfiles to prevent several
concurrently running procmail programs from messing up.</p>

<p>Delivering to MH folders is slightly more time consuming
than deliver- ing to normal directories or mailboxes,
because procmail has to search for the next available number
(instead of having the filename immedi- ately
available).</p>

<p>On general failure procmail will return EX_CANTCREAT,
unless option -t is specified, in which case it will return
EX_TEMPFAIL.</p>

<p>To make egrepping of headers more consistent, procmail
concatenates all continued header fields; but only
internally. When delivering the mail, line breaks will
appear as before.</p>

<p>If procmail is called under a name not starting with
procmail (e.g., if it is linked to another name and invoked
as such), it comes up in explicit delivery mode, and expects
the recipients names as command line arguments (as if -d had
been specified).</p>

<p>Comsat/biff notifications are done using udp. They are
sent off once when procmail generates the regular logfile
entry. The notification messages have the following extended
format (or as close as you can get when final delivery was
not to a file):
$LOGNAME@offset_of_message_in_mailbox:absolute_path_to_mailbox</p>

<p>Whenever procmail itself opens a file to deliver to, it
consistently uses the following kernel locking strategies:
fcntl(2).</p>

<p>Procmail is NFS-resistant and eight-bit clean.</p>

<p>NOTES Calling up procmail with the -h or -? options will
cause it to display a command-line help and recipe flag
quick-reference page.</p>

<p>There exists an excellent newbie FAQ about mailfilters
(and procmail in particular); it is maintained by Nancy
McGough &lt;nancym@ii.com&gt; and can be obtained by sending
a mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the fol- lowing in
the body: send usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq</p>

<p>If procmail is not installed globally as the default
mail delivery agent (ask your system administrator), you
have to make sure it is in- voked when your mail arrives. In
this case your $HOME/.forward (be- ware, it has to be world
readable) file should contain the line below. Be sure to
include the single and double quotes, and unless you know
your site to be running smrsh (the SendMail Restricted
SHell), it must be an absolute path.</p>

<p>&quot;|exec /usr/bin/procmail&quot;</p>

<p>Some mailers (notably exim) do not currently accept the
above syntax. In such case use this instead:</p>

<p>|/usr/bin/procmail</p>

<p>Procmail can also be invoked to postprocess an already
filled system mailbox. This can be useful if you dont want
to or cant use a $HOME/.forward file (in which case the
following script could periodi- cally be called from within
cron(1), or whenever you start reading mail):</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh</p>

<p>ORGMAIL=/var/mail/$LOGNAME</p>

<p>if cd $HOME &amp;&amp; test -s $ORGMAIL &amp;&amp;
lockfile -r0 -l1024 .newmail.lock 2&gt;/dev/null then trap
&quot;rm -f .newmail.lock&quot; 1 2 3 13 15 umask 077
lockfile -l1024 -ml cat $ORGMAIL &gt;&gt;.newmail &amp;&amp;
cat /dev/null &gt;$ORGMAIL lockfile -mu formail -s procmail
&lt;.newmail &amp;&amp; rm -f .newmail rm -f .newmail.lock
fi exit 0</p>

<p>A sample small $HOME/.procmailrc:
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin MAILDIR=$HOME/Mail #youd
better make sure it exists DEFAULT=$MAILDIR/mbox #completely
optional LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/from #recommended</p>
