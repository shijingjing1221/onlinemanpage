<p>NAME convdate - Convert time/date strings and
numbers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS convdate [-dhl] [-c -n -s] [date ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION convdate translates the date/time strings
given on the command line, outputting the results one to a
line. The input can either be a date in some format that
parsedate(3) can parse or the number of seconds since epoch
(if -c is given). The output is either ctime(3) results, the
number of seconds since epoch, or a Usenet Date: header,
depending on the options given.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Each argument is taken to be the number of
seconds since epoch (a time_t) rather than a date.</p>

<p>-d Output a valid Usenet Date: header instead of the
results of ctime(3) for each date given on the command line.
This is useful for testing the algorithm used to generate
Date: headers for local posts. Normally, the date will be in
UTC, but see the -l option.</p>

<p>-h Print usage information and exit.</p>

<p>-l Only makes sense in combination with -d. If given,
Date: headers generated will use the local time zone instead
of UTC.</p>

<p>-n Rather than outputting the results of ctime(3) or a
Date: header, output each date given as the number of
seconds since epoch (a time_t). This option doesnt make
sense in combination with -d.</p>

<p>-s Pass each given date to parsedate(3) and print the
results of ctime(3) (or a Date: header if -d is given). This
is the default behavior.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Note that relative times or times with partial
information use the cur- rent time to fill in the rest of
the date, so dates like &quot;12pm&quot; are taken to be
12pm of the day when convdate is run. This is a property of
parsedate(3); see the man page for more information. Most of
these examples are from the original man page dating from
1991 and were run in the -0400 time zone.</p>

<p>% convdate feb 10 10am Sun Feb 10 10:00:00 1991</p>

<p>% convdate 12pm 5/4/90 Fri Dec 13 00:00:00 1991 Fri May
4 00:00:00 1990</p>

<p>Note that 12pm and 5/4/90 are two *separate* arguments
and therefore result in two results. Note also that a date
with no time is taken to be at midnight.</p>

<p>% convdate -n feb 10 10am 12pm 5/4/90 666198000
641880000</p>

<p>% convdate -c 666198000 Sun Feb 10 10:00:00 1991</p>

<p>ctime(3) results are in the local time zone. Compare
to:</p>

<p>% convdate -dc 666198000 Sun, 10 Feb 1991 15:00:00 +0000
(UTC)</p>

<p>% env TZ=PST8PDT convdate -dlc 666198000 Sun, 10 Feb
1991 07:00:00 -0800 (PST)</p>

<p>% env TZ=EST5EDT convdate -dlc 666198000 Sun, 10 Feb
1991 10:00:00 -0500 (EST)</p>

<p>The system library functions generally use the
environment variable TZ to determine (or at least override)
the local time zone.</p>
