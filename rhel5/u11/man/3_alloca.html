<p>ALLOCA(3) Linux Programmer s Manual ALLOCA(3)</p>

<p>NAME alloca - memory allocator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;alloca.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *alloca(size_t size);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The alloca() function allocates size bytes
of space in the stack frame of the caller. This temporary
space is automatically freed when the function that called
alloca() returns to its caller.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The alloca() function returns a pointer to
the beginning of the allo- cated space. If the allocation
causes stack overflow, program behaviour is undefined.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO There is evidence that the alloca()
function appeared in 32v, pwb, pwb.2, 3bsd, and 4bsd. There
is a man page for it in 4.3BSD. Linux uses the GNU version.
This function is not in POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES ON THE GNU VERSION Normally, gcc translates calls
to alloca() by inlined code. This is not done when either
the -ansi or the -fno-builtin option is given. But beware!
By default the glibc version of &lt;stdlib.h&gt; includes
&lt;alloca.h&gt; and that contains the line # define
alloca(size) __builtin_alloca (size) with messy consequences
if one has a private version of this function.</p>

<p>The fact that the code is inlined, means that it is
impossible to take the address of this function, or to
change its behaviour by linking with a different
library.</p>

<p>The inlined code often consists of a single instruction
adjusting the stack pointer, and does not check for stack
overflow. Thus, there is no NULL error return.</p>

<p>BUGS The alloca() function is machine and compiler
dependent. On many sys- tems its implementation is buggy.
Its use is discouraged.</p>

<p>On many systems alloca() cannot be used inside the list
of arguments of a function call, because the stack space
reserved by alloca() would appear on the stack in the middle
of the space for the function argu- ments.</p>
