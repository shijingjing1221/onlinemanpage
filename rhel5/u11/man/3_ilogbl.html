<p>ILOGB(3) Linux Programmer s Manual ILOGB(3)</p>

<p>NAME ilogb, ilogbf, ilogbl - get integer exponent of a
floating point value</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ilogb(double x); int ilogbf(float x); int
ilogbl(long double x);</p>

<p>Link with -lm.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions return the exponent part of
their argument as a signed integer. When no error occurs,
these functions are equivalent to the corresponding logb()
functions, cast to (int). An error will occur for zero and
infinity and NaN, and possibly for overflow.</p>

<p>ERRORS In order to check for errors, set errno to zero
and call feclearex- cept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these
functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or
fetestexcept(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW |
FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.</p>

<p>If an error occurs and (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno is set to EDOM. If an
error occurs and (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception is
raised.</p>

<p>A domain error occurs when x is zero or infinite (or too
large, or too small) or NaN. If x is zero, the constant
FP_ILOGB0 is returned. If x is NaN, the constant FP_ILOGBNAN
is returned. If x is infinite (or too large), INT_MAX is
returned. If x is too small, INT_MIN is returned.</p>
