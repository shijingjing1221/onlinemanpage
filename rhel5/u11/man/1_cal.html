<p>CAL(1) BSD General Commands Manual CAL(1)</p>

<p>NAME cal - displays a calendar</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cal [-smjy13] [[month] year]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Cal displays a simple calendar. If arguments
are not specified, the cur- rent month is displayed. The
options are as follows:</p>

<p>-1 Display single month output. (This is the
default.)</p>

<p>-3 Display prev/current/next month output.</p>

<p>-s Display Sunday as the first day of the week. (This is
the default.)</p>

<p>-m Display Monday as the first day of the week.</p>

<p>-j Display Julian dates (days one-based, numbered from
January 1).</p>

<p>-y Display a calendar for the current year.</p>

<p>A single parameter specifies the year (1 - 9999) to be
displayed; note the year must be fully specified: cal 89
will not display a calendar for 1989. Two parameters denote
the month (1 - 12) and year. If no parameters are specified,
the current months calendar is displayed.</p>

<p>A year starts on Jan 1.</p>

<p>The Gregorian Reformation is assumed to have occurred in
1752 on the 3rd of September. By this time, most countries
had recognized the reforma- tion (although a few did not
recognize it until the early 1900s.) Ten days following that
date were eliminated by the reformation, so the cal- endar
for that month is a bit unusual.</p>

<p>HISTORY A cal command appeared in Version 6 AT&amp;T
UNIX.</p>

<p>OTHER VERSIONS Several much more elaborate versions of
this program exist, with support for colors, holidays,
birthdays, reminders and appointments, etc. For example, try
the cal from http://home.sprynet.com/~cbagwell/projects.html
or GNU gcal.</p>
