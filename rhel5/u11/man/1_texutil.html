<p>TEXUTIL(1) TEXUTIL(1)</p>

<p>texutil(1) CONTEXT texutil(1)</p>

<p>NAME texutil - ConTeXt auxiliary program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS texutil [ OPTION... ] FILENAME[...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When processing a source file, ConTeXt (via
texexec(1)) saves informa- tion (including table of
contents, tables of figures and tables, index entries,
cross-references) in a utility file&acute;&acute; called
FILENAME.tui. After each successful run, this utility file
is postprocessed by texu- til to organize the information
for the next run.</p>

<p>texutil performs a number of useful functions:</p>

<p>o Postprocessing references, including sorting index and
list entries (with --references)</p>

<p>o Extracting documentation and other types of
information from ConTeXt source files (with --documents)</p>

<p>o Logfile analysis (with --logfile)</p>

<p>o Collecting information about graphic files to help
with typeset- ting (with --figures)</p>

<p>o Converting EPS files to a PDF format suitable for
inclusion in PDF files generated with pdftex(1) (with
----epspage and --epstopdf)</p>

<p>OPTIONS All switches are specified here in full, but can
be abbreviated to the shortest unique string. Thus, --ver
works the same as --verbose pro- vided that there is no
other flag beginning with ver&acute;&acute;.</p>

<p>General Options --help Print a usage summary to
stdout.</p>

<p>--interface=LANGUAGECODE Specify the language for
messages. One of en (English), de (German), or nl (Dutch).
The default language is English.</p>

<p>--outputfile=FILENAME Specify the name of the output
file.</p>

<p>--purge [ BASENAME ] Delete temporary files. Specifying
an optional BASENAME will only affect the temporary files
that begin with that BASENAME.</p>

<p>--silent Redirects stdout to the log file (texutil.log,
by default). When used with --verbose, a summary is printed
to stdout, while any other output is written to the log
file.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>texutil --figures --silent --verbose somefile.png</p>

<p>will output something like</p>

<p>n=somefile.png t=png x=0bp y=0bp w=443bp h=591bp</p>

<p>to stdout, placing other output into texutil.log. This
informa- tion can be piped into another program for further
processing.</p>

<p>--type=SUFFIX Specify the SUFFIX of the file you want
texutil to process.</p>

<p>--verbose Print diagnostic messages to the screen.</p>

<p>Postprocessing References The --references flag
instructs texutil to process information about
cross-references, index entries, and other data requiring
more than one pass to process in the ConTeXt utility
file.</p>

<p>Index and sorted list entries are sorted before being
written out; redundant index entries are removed.</p>

<p>texutil is called automatically by texexec(1) during its
processing runs unless you specify otherwise. texutil can
also be run by hand, using the form</p>

<p>texutil --references FILENAME</p>

<p>This command would cause texutil to load the utility
file FILENAME.tui, sort and convert the contents of that
file, and write the results to FILENAME.tuo.</p>

<p>Options specific to this mode are:</p>

<p>--ij Sort IJ&acute;&acute; as Y&acute;&acute;. Often
used when processing files written in Dutch.</p>

<p>--high Convert high&acute;&acute; ASCII values into
equivalent TeX commands. This switch is provided for
backward compatibility.</p>

<p>--quotes Take tex(1) accent commands into consideration
when sorting. (Otherwise, quotes are considered to be
boundary characters for strings.)</p>

<p>--tcxpath=PATH Specify path to tcx filter files for
translating between encod- ings.</p>

<p>Extracting Information from ConTeXt Source Files ConTeXt
source files often contain documentation (see USAGE for more
information about the format) or other information that can
be extracted by texutil when called with the --documents
flag:</p>

<p>texutil --documents FILENAME</p>

<p>This command produces a file called FILENAME.ted from a
ConTeXt file called FILENAME.tex.</p>

<p>The --sources flag does the opposite: Documentation
lines are stripped out of the output, which is written to a
file called FILENAME.tes.</p>

<p>Historically, ConTeXt source files included other forms
of information -- such as syntax definitions, macro
definitions, and editor templates -- that can be extracted
with the following flags:</p>

<p>--infos Extract TeXEdit macro information (tex-&gt;tud
-- see USAGE)</p>

<p>--setups Extract ConTeXt syntax definitions
(tex-&gt;texutil.tus)</p>

<p>--templates Extract TeXEdit editor templates
(tex-&gt;tud)</p>

<p>Analyzing Log Files Calling texutil with the --logfile
option allows you to extract infor- mation about problems
with your ConTeXt source file from the log file produced
during a texexec(1) run.</p>

<p>You can specify what information texutil should report
with the follow- ing options:</p>

<p>--box Extract information about overfull boxes. By
default, this flag will cause texedit to report both
horizontal and vertical over- full boxes. If you&acute;re
only interested in one kind, you can specify --hbox or
--vbox instead.</p>

<p>--criterium=SIZE Exclude reports about boxes that are
less than SIZE points too large.</p>

<p>--unknown Extract messages about missing references or
figures.</p>

<p>Gathering Information about Figures The --figures flag
tells texutil to generate information about one or more
(non-EPS) graphics files for use in typesetting. Called as,
for example,</p>

<p>texutil --figures *.png *.tif</p>

<p>texutil will scan the current directory for PNG and TIFF
files and extract some useful information about their sizes
and types. By default, this information is stored in a file
called texutil.tuf, which is consulted by ConTeXt when
typesetting a page with a non-EPS image file -- see the
example given for the --silent flag for an alternative.</p>

<p>This flag is especially useful when you plan to typeset
a file of pre- views of graphic files -- see the discussion
of the --figures flag in the texexec(1) manpage.</p>

<p>Converting EPS Files for PDF Inclusion texutil can also
convert EPS files to PDF format for inclusion in PDF files
generated with pdftex(1) or pdfetex(1).</p>

<p>--epspage Adjust the bounding box of an EPS file to the
dimensions of the output page. This option also removes some
redundant informa- tion and marks files as converted so that
they will not be affected by subsequent runs.</p>

<p>--epstopdf Calls gs(1) to convert the specified EPS
graphic files into PDF format.</p>

<p>USAGE Embedded Documentation Format Documentation lines
included in ConTeXt source files can be specified by
beginning lines with the following strings:</p>

<p>%C Copyright information</p>

<p>%D Documentation lines</p>

<p>%I TeXEdit information lines (mostly in Dutch)</p>

<p>%M Macro code needed to processs the documentation</p>

<p>%S Suppressed&acute;&acute; lines</p>

<p>The same forms can be used for Perl scripts, except that
the %&acute;&acute; characters are replaced by
#&acute;&acute; characters. See the source for texu- til for
an example.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO gs(1), pdfetex(1), pdftex(1), texexec(1),
texshow(1).</p>
