<p>NAME distcache - Distributed session caching</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The distcache architecture provides a
protocol and set of accompanying tools to allow
applications, and indeed machines, to share session state
between them by way of a network service.</p>

<p>The primary use of distcache right now is SSL/TLS
session caching. This allows SSL/TLS servers (eg. a secure
Apache web server providing HTTPS support) to use a
centralised session cache, i.e any server may resume SSL/TLS
sessions negotiated by any other server on the network. The
advantages to this approach include increased freedom of
mechanisms for load-balancing.</p>

<p>Existing SSL/TLS load-balancing solutions</p>

<p>Many load-balancers attempt to route incoming
connections to servers based on remembering the last mapping
from the same source network address. Others, called
&quot;SSL sticky&quot; load-balancers, attempt to parse
SSL/TLS session ids from handshake messages and so map
future session- resume attempts. Both methods have serious
weaknesses - the former is generally confused by any form of
network address translation (eg. when clients are behind
masquerading gateways), and the latter is confused by any
SSL/TLS renegotiations. Moreover both are stateful and a
poten- tial bottleneck, because there is no obvious way to
scale the architec- ture to multiple load-balancers.</p>

<p>Arbitrary SSL/TLS load-balancing with distcache</p>

<p>There is no need nor motivation to route incoming
connections to &quot;the same server&quot; to improve the
chances for SSL/TLS session resumption, and indeed doing so
defeats the point of load-balancing (which is to bal- ance
according load or availability). The use of distcache is to
ensure that all servers share the same &quot;cache&quot; and
so can respond to SSL/TLS session resume requests
irrespective of where the previous SSL/TLS con- nection from
the same client was mapped to.</p>

<p>It ait just for SSL/TLS ...</p>

<p>Future versions of distcache will expand on the protocol
and should provide for a variety of &quot;shared-state&quot;
uses besides SSL/TLS session caching. The possibilities
include application state caching, network- based shared
virtual memory, etc.</p>

<p>TOOLS dc_server Runs a cache server listening on a
configurable network address. See dc_server(1).</p>

<p>dc_client Runs a local client proxy. From the point of
view of applications this behaves like dc_server, but
manages multiplexing application requests to/from a cache
server over a single persistent connec- tion. See
dc_client(1).</p>

<p>dc_test Sends a (configurable) barrage of session
caching requests to a given network address using the
distcache protocol. Useful for testing correctness of an
installation as well as benchmarking. Can be used directly
against an instance of dc_server or against a dc_client
proxy. See dc_test(1).</p>

<p>dc_snoop A transparent proxy tool supporting the
distcache protocol that can be used to monitor cache
operation requests and responses between any two end-points
(eg. between an application and dc_client, or between
dc_client and dc_server). See dc_snoop(1).</p>

<p>APIS The comments below provide a short summary of the
APIs available in distcache. To view more details, consult
the section 2 man pages these summaries refer to. If you are
using a packaged version of distcache, you may need to
ensure that a corresponding &quot;devel&quot; package is
installed as the libraries, headers, and API documentation
is often packaged independantly of the user tools.</p>

<p>libnal</p>

<p>This is the underlying Network Abstraction Library
(hence &quot;NAL&quot;) used by the distcache libraries and
tools. libnal uses non-blocking sockets, with an addressing
abstraction that allows tools to transparently work over
unix domain sockets or TCP/IPv4 sockets by a change of
address text. For this reason, all the distcache tools can
have their &quot;-listen&quot; and &quot;-connect&quot;
switches set to work over either kind of transport.</p>

<p>libnal defines various object types;</p>

<p>NAL_ADDRESS (see NAL_ADDRESS_new(2)) The addressing
abstraction converts to and from text representa- tions,
indicates whether given addresses are valid for listening
on, connecting to, or both.</p>

<p>NAL_CONNECTION (see NAL_CONNECTION_new(2)) This
encapsulates a network connection that can be used for
sending and receiving arbitrary binary data.</p>

<p>NAL_LISTENER (see NAL_LISTENER_new(2)) This encapsulates
a listening socket that can be used to accept incoming
connection requests on a configured address, creating a
NAL_CONNECTION wrapper for each accepted connection.</p>

<p>NAL_SELECTOR (see NAL_SELECTOR_new(2)) This provides an
object that can be prepared with various NAL_LIS- TENER and
NAL_CONNECTION objects, and then can block waiting for
network activity up to some configurable limit of time. This
is the basis of non-blocking I/O and is an encapsulation of
the tradi- tional select(2) function.</p>

<p>NAL_BUFFER (see NAL_BUFFER_new(2)) This abstraction
implements a FIFO data array and is used primarily for
representing the read and send parts of a NAL_CONNECTION
object.</p>

<p>There are also some helper functions to assist in
serialising data, particularly with respect to putting
integral data into network byte order (allowing
interoperability between platforms with differing
byte-order). These functions are documented in
NAL_decode_uint32(2).</p>

<p>libdistcache</p>

<p>There are two APIs implemented by the libdistcache
library;</p>

<p>distcache/dc_plug.h This header provides the DC_PLUG
abstraction. This encapsulates a connection and implements
the distcache protocol and various func- tions for
manipulating the reading and writing of distcache mes- sages
(requests or responses). This abstraction can support client
and server implementations of the distcache protocol and
supports asynchronous behaviour by interacting with libnal s
NAL_SELECTOR type. For more information, see
DC_PLUG_new(2).</p>

<p>distcache/dc_client.h This header declares a
higher-level (and much simpler) API than dc_plug.h, and is
useful in applications that want API functions that do cache
operations. The API is blocking, and provides simplistic
add, remove, and get functions that only return once the
full request/response cycle is complete or an error has
occured. This is the API used to add distcache support to
applications like Apache, stunnel, etc. For more
information, see DC_CTX_new(2).</p>

<p>libdistcacheserver</p>

<p>This header declares an API for implementing a session
cache supporting the distcache protocol. It is primarily
intended for environments that wish to implement an
alternative method for session storage. As with elements of
libdistcache, this API is likely to be undergoing some
important restructuring and enhancements. Please consider
subscribing to the distcache mail list and/or monitoring
CVS, this gives you an opportunity to influence ongoing
development and be less surprised at changes the turn up in
future versions. For more information, see
DC_SERVER_new(2).</p>

<p>LICENSE The distcache toolkit, including the libnal
network abstraction library that comes bundled with it, is
distributed under the LGPL license (&quot;Library GNU Public
License&quot;) and you should have received a copy of this
license with this software and its documents.</p>

<p>BUGS Quite possibly. In particular, portability has not
been tested under many platforms as the current developers
have limited OS resources. Feedback, access to alternative
platforms, bug-reports, and questions are all welcome -
please go to the distcache website and subscribe to the
distcache-users mail list.</p>
