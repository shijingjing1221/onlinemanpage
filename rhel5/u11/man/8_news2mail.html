<p>NAME news2mail - a channel script to gateway news into
email.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS news2mail</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION news2mail runs as a channel process
underneath innd. It is set up as channel feed in newsfeeds,
with different mailing lists as funnel entries pointing to
it (see below).</p>

<p>news2mail uses a config file</p>

<p>&lt;pathetc in inn.conf&gt;/news2mail.cf</p>

<p>to map mailing list names to email addresses.</p>

<p>news2mail causes sendmail to queue the messages for
later delivery (to avoid DOS attacks by mass postings). You
must run sendmail -q period- ically to get the queue
processed.</p>

<p>CONFIG FILE The config file format is simple: comments
(start with # ) and blank lines are ignored. All other lines
have two fields on them. The first is the list name and is
what innd uses (i.e. the site field of the entry in the
newsfeeds file). The second field is the actual email
address to send the article to. In the email message, the To
header will have the mailing list name (i.e. the first
field).</p>

<p># list-name address big-red-ants@ucsd.edu
big-red-ants-digest@ucsd.edu news-software@ucsd.edu
news-software-digest@ucsd.edu</p>

<p>a set of newsfeeds entries for these lists would be:</p>

<p>n2m!:!*:Tc,Ac,Wn*:&lt;pathbin in
inn.conf&gt;/news2mail</p>

<p>big-red-ants@ucsd.edu:rec.pets.redants.*:Tm:n2m!</p>

<p>news-software@ucsd.edu:news.software.nntp:Tm:n2m!</p>

<p>news2mail strips most article headers from the article
before mailing. It leaves: From, Subject Date, Organization
and Message-ID in there. It add a To header with the mailing
list name in it.</p>
