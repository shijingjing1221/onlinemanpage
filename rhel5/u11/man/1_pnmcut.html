<p>NAME pnmcut - cut a rectangle out of a PBM, PGM, or PPM

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmcut was obsoleted by
pamcut(1),introducedwithNetpbm9.20(May 2001). pamcut is
backward compatible with pnmcut, plus adds many additional
functions, including the ability to process PAM images.</p>

<p>pnmcut remains in the Netpbm package because it probably
has fewer bugs for now than pamcut. Some day, pnmcut will
probably become an alias for pamcut.</p>

<p>You can use the pamcut documentation for pnmcut, as long
as you avoid any function which it says was added after
Netpbm 9.20.</p>
