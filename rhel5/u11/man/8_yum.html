<p>NAME yum - Yellowdog Updater Modified</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS yum [options] [command] [package ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION yum is an interactive, rpm based, package
manager. It can automatically perform system updates,
including dependency analysis and obsolete pro- cessing
based on &quot;repository&quot; metadata. It can also
perform installa- tion of new packages, removal of old
packages and perform queries on the installed and/or
available packages among many other commands/ser- vices (see
below). yum is similar to other high level package managers
like apt-get and smart.</p>

<p>While there are some graphical interfaces directly to
the yum code, more recent graphical interface development is
happening with Pack- ageKit and the gnome-packagekit
application.</p>

<p>command is one of: * install package1 [package2] [...] *
update [package1] [package2] [...] * update-to [package1]
[package2] [...] * check-update * upgrade [package1]
[package2] [...] * upgrade-to [package1] [package2] [...] *
remove | erase package1 [package2] [...] * list [...] * info
[...] * provides | whatprovides feature1 [feature2] [...] *
clean [ packages | headers | metadata | dbcache | all ] *
makecache * groupinstall group1 [group2] [...] * groupupdate
group1 [group2] [...] * grouplist [hidden] [groupwildcard]
[...] * groupremove group1 [group2] [...] * groupinfo group1
[...] * search string1 [string2] [...] * shell [filename] *
resolvedep dep1 [dep2] [...] * localinstall rpmfile1
[rpmfile2] [...] * localupdate rpmfile1 [rpmfile2] [...] *
reinstall package1 [package2] [...] * downgrade package1
[package2] [...] * deplist package1 [package2] [...] *
repolist [all|enabled|disabled] * help [command]</p>

<p>Unless the --help or -h option is given, one of the
above commands must be present.</p>

<p>Repository configuration is honored in all
operations.</p>

<p>install Is used to install the latest version of a
package or group of packages while ensuring that all
dependencies are satisfied. If no package matches the given
package name(s), they are assumed to be a shell glob and any
matches are then installed. If the name starts with an @
character the rest of the name is used as though passed to
the groupinstall command. If the name is a file, then
install works like localinstall. If the name doesnt match a
package, then package &quot;provides&quot; are searched (Eg.
&quot;_sqlitecache.so()(64bit)&quot;) as are filelists (Eg.
&quot;/usr/bin/yum&quot;). Also note that for filelists,
wildcards will match multiple packages.</p>

<p>update If run without any packages, update will update
every currently installed package. If one or more packages
or package globs are specified, Yum will only update the
listed packages. While updating packages, yum will ensure
that all dependencies are satisfied. If the packages or
globs specified match to packages which are not currently
installed then update will not install them. update operates
on groups, files, provides and filelists just like the
&quot;install&quot; command.</p>

<p>If the main obsoletes configure option is true (default)
or the --obsoletes flag is present yum will include package
obsoletes in its calculations - this makes it better for
distro-version changes, for example: upgrading from
somelinux 8.0 to somelinux 9.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;update&quot; works on installed packages
first, and only if there are no matches does it look for
available packages. The difference is most noticable when
you do &quot;update foo-1-2&quot; which will act exactly as
&quot;update foo&quot; if foo-1-2 is installed. You can use
the &quot;update-to&quot; if you d prefer that nothing
happen in the above case.</p>

<p>update-to This command works like &quot;update&quot; but
always specifies the ver- sion of the package we want to
update to.</p>

<p>check-update Implemented so you could know if your
machine had any updates that needed to be applied without
running it interactively. Returns exit value of 100 if there
are packages available for an update. Also returns a list of
the pkgs to be updated in list format. Returns 0 if no
packages are available for update. Returns 1 if an error
occurred. Running in verbose mode also shows obsoletes.</p>

<p>upgrade Is the same as the update command with the
--obsoletes flag set. See update for more details.</p>

<p>upgrade-to This command works like &quot;upgrade&quot;
but always specifies the ver- sion of the package we want to
update to.</p>

<p>remove or erase Are used to remove the specified
packages from the system as well as removing any packages
which depend on the package being removed. remove operates
on groups, files, provides and filelists just like the
&quot;install&quot; command.</p>

<p>list Is used to list various information about available
packages; more complete details are available in the List
Options section below.</p>

<p>provides or whatprovides Is used to find out which
package provides some feature or file. Just use a specific
name or a file-glob-syntax wildcards to list the packages
available or installed that provide that feature or
file.</p>

<p>search Is used to find any packages matching a string in
the descrip- tion, summary and package name fields of an
rpm. Useful for finding a package you do not know by name
but know by some word related to it.</p>

<p>info Is used to list a description and summary
information about available packages; takes the same
arguments as in the List Options section below.</p>

<p>clean Is used to clean up various things which
accumulate in the yum cache directory over time. More
complete details can be found in the Clean Options section
below.</p>

<p>makecache Is used to download and make usable all the
metadata for the currently enabled yum repos.</p>

<p>groupinstall Is used to install all of the individual
packages in a group, of the specified types (this works as
if you d taken each of those package names and put them on
the command line for a &quot;yum install&quot; command). The
group_package_types configuration option specifies which
types will be installed.</p>

<p>groupupdate Is just an alias for groupinstall, which
will do the right thing because &quot;yum install X&quot;
and &quot;yum update X&quot; do the same thing, when X is
already installed.</p>

<p>grouplist Is used to list the available groups from all
yum repos. Groups are marked as &quot;installed&quot; if all
mandatory packages are installed, or if a group doesn t have
any mandatory packages then it is installed if any of the
optional or default package are installed. The optional
&quot;hidden&quot; argument will also list groups marked as
not being &quot;user visible&quot;. If you pass the -v
option, to enable verbose mode, then the groupids are dis-
played.</p>

<p>groupremove Is used to remove all of the packages in a
group, unlike &quot;groupinstall&quot; this will remove
everything regardless of group_package_types. It is worth
pointing out that packages can be in more than one group, so
&quot;groupinstall X Y&quot; followed by &quot;groupremove
Y&quot; does not do give you the same result as
&quot;groupinstall X&quot;.</p>

<p>groupinfo Is used to give the description and package
list of a group (and which type those packages are marked
as). Note that you can use the yum-filter-data and
yum-list-data plugins to get/use the data the other way
around (Ie. what groups own packages need updating). If you
pass the -v option, to enable verbose mode, then the package
names are matched against installed/available packages
similar to the list command.</p>

<p>shell Is used to enter the yum shell, when a filename is
specified the contents of that file is executed in yum shell
mode. See yum-shell(8) for more info</p>

<p>resolvedep Is used to list packages providing the
specified dependencies, at most one package is listed per
dependency.</p>

<p>localinstall Is used to install a set of local rpm
files. If required the enabled repositories will be used to
resolve dependencies. Note that the install command will do
a local install, if given a filename.</p>

<p>localupdate Is used to update the system by specifying
local rpm files. Only the specified rpm files of which an
older version is already installed will be installed, the
remaining specified packages will be ignored. If required
the enabled repositories will be used to resolve
dependencies. Note that the update command will do a local
install, if given a filename.</p>

<p>reinstall Will reinstall the identically versioned
package as is currently installed. This does not work for
&quot;installonly&quot; packages, like Kernels. reinstall
operates on groups, files, provides and filelists just like
the &quot;install&quot; command.</p>

<p>downgrade Will try and downgrade a package from the
version currently installed to the previously highest
version (or the specified version). The depsolver will not
necessarily work, but if you specify all the packages it
should work (and thus. all the sim- ple cases will work).
Also this does not work for &quot;installonly&quot;
packages, like Kernels. downgrade operates on groups, files,
provides and filelists just like the &quot;install&quot;
command.</p>

<p>deplist Produces a list of all dependencies and what
packages provide those dependencies for the given
packages.</p>

<p>repolist Produces a list of configured repositories. The
default is to list all enabled repositories. If you pass -v,
for verbose mode, more information is listed. If the first
argument is enabled, disabled or all then the command will
list those types of repos.</p>

<p>You can pass repo id or name arguments, or wildcards
which to match against both of those. However if the ir or
name matches exactly then the repo will be listed even if
you are listing enabled repos. and it is disabled.</p>

<p>In non-verbose mode the first column will start with a *
if the repo. has metalink data and the latest metadata is
not local. For non-verbose mode the last column will also
display the number of packages in the repo. and (if there
are any user specified excludes) the number of packages
excluded.</p>

<p>One last special feature of repolist, is that if you are
in non- verbose mode then yum will ignore any repo errors
and output the information it can get (Eg. &quot;yum clean
all; yum -C repolist&quot; will output something, although
the package counts/etc. will be zeroed out).</p>

<p>help Produces help, either for all commands or if given
a command name then the help for that particular
command.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS Most command line options can be set
using the configuration file as well and the descriptions
indicate the necessary configuration option to set.</p>

<p>-h, --help Help; display a help message and then
quit.</p>

<p>-y Assume yes; assume that the answer to any question
which would be asked is yes. Configuration Option:
assumeyes</p>

<p>-c [config file] Specifies the config file location -
can take http, ftp urls and local file paths.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Run without output. Note that you likely
also want to use -y.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Run with a lot of debugging output.</p>

<p>-d [number] Sets the debugging level to [number] - turns
up or down the amount of things that are printed. Practical
range: 0 - 10 Configuration Option: debuglevel</p>

<p>-e [number] Sets the error level to [number] Practical
range 0 - 10. 0 means print only critical errors about which
you must be told. 1 means print all errors, even ones that
are not overly important. 1+ means print more errors (if
any) -e 0 is good for cron jobs. Configuration Option:
errorlevel</p>

<p>-R [time in minutes] Sets the maximum amount of time yum
will wait before performing a command - it randomizes over
the time.</p>

<p>-C Tells yum to run entirely from cache - does not
download or update any headers unless it has to to perform
the requested action.</p>

<p>--version Reports the yum version number and exits.</p>

<p>--showduplicates Doesnt limit packages to their latest
versions in the info, list and search commands (will also
affect plugins which use the doPackageLists() API).</p>

<p>--installroot=root Specifies an alternative installroot,
relative to which all packages will be installed.
Configuration Option: installroot</p>

<p>--enablerepo=repoidglob Enables specific repositories by
id or glob that have been dis- abled in the configuration
file using the enabled=0 option. Configuration Option:
enabled</p>

<p>--disablerepo=repoidglob Disables specific repositories
by id or glob. Configuration Option: enabled</p>

<p>--obsoletes This option only has affect for an update,
it enables yum&acute;s obsoletes processing logic. For more
information see the update command above. Configuration
Option: obsoletes</p>

<p>-x, --exclude=package Exclude a specific package by name
or glob from updates on all repositories. Configuration
Option: exclude</p>

<p>--color=[always|auto|never] Display colorized output
automatically, depending on the output terminal, always
(using ANSI codes) or never. Note that some commands (Eg.
list and info) will do a little extra work when color is
enabled. Configuration Option: color</p>

<p>--disableexcludes=[all|main|repoid] Disable the excludes
defined in your config files. Takes one of three options:
all == disable all excludes main == disable excludes defined
in [main] in yum.conf repoid == disable excludes defined for
that repo</p>

<p>--disableplugin=plugin Run with one or more plugins
disabled, the argument is a comma separated list of
wildcards to match against plugin names.</p>

<p>--noplugins Run with all plugins disabled. Configuration
Option: plugins</p>

<p>--nogpgcheck Run with gpg signature checking disabled.
Configuration Option: gpgcheck</p>

<p>--skip-broken Resolve depsolve problems by removing
packages that are causing problems from the transaction.
Configuration Option: skip_broken</p>

<p>-t, --tolerant This option currently does nothing.</p>

<p>LIST OPTIONS The following are the ways which you can
invoke yum in list mode. Note that all list commands include
information on the version of the pack- age.</p>

<p>yum list [all | glob_exp1] [glob_exp2] [...] List all
available and installed packages.</p>

<p>yum list available [glob_exp1] [...] List all packages
in the yum repositories available to be installed.</p>

<p>yum list updates [glob_exp1] [...] List all packages
with updates available in the yum reposito- ries.</p>

<p>yum list installed [glob_exp1] [...] List the packages
specified by args. If an argument does not match the name of
an available package, it is assumed to be a shell-style glob
and any matches are printed.</p>

<p>yum list extras [glob_exp1] [...] List the packages
installed on the system that are not available in any yum
repository listed in the config file.</p>

<p>yum list obsoletes [glob_exp1] [...] List the packages
installed on the system that are obsoleted by packages in
any yum repository listed in the config file.</p>

<p>yum list recent List packages recently added into the
repositories.</p>

<p>Specifying package names All the list options mentioned
above take file-glob-syntax wild- cards or package names as
arguments, for example yum list avail- ablefoo*will list all
available packages that match foo*. (The single quotes will
keep your shell from expanding the globs.)</p>

<p>CLEAN OPTIONS The following are the ways which you can
invoke yum in clean mode. Note that &quot;all files&quot; in
the commands below means &quot;all files in currently
enabled repositories&quot;. If you want to also clean any
(temporarily) disabled repositories you need to use
--enablerepo*option.</p>

<p>yum clean expire-cache Eliminate the local data saying
when the metadata and mir- rorlists were downloaded for each
repo. This means yum will revalidate the cache for each
repo. next time it is used. How- ever if the cache is still
valid, nothing significant was deleted.</p>

<p>yum clean packages Eliminate any cached packages from
the system. Note that pack- ages are not automatically
deleted after they are downloaded.</p>

<p>yum clean headers Eliminate all of the header files
which yum uses for dependency resolution.</p>

<p>yum clean metadata Eliminate all of the files which yum
uses to determine the remote availability of packages. Using
this option will force yum to download all the metadata the
next time it is run.</p>

<p>yum clean dbcache Eliminate the sqlite cache used for
faster access to metadata. Using this option will force yum
to recreate the cache the next time it is run.</p>

<p>yum clean all Runs yum clean packages and yum clean
headers, yum clean meta- data and yum clean dbcache as
above.</p>

<p>MISC Specifying package names A package can be referred
to for install,update,list,remove etc with any of the
following:</p>

<p>name name.arch name-ver name-ver-rel name-ver-rel.arch
name-epoch:ver-rel.arch epoch:name-ver-rel.arch</p>

<p>For example: yum remove kernel-2.4.1-10.i686</p>

<p>PLUGINS Yum can be extended through the use of plugins.
A plugin is a Python &quot;.py&quot; file which is installed
in one of the directories specified by the pluginpath option
in yum.conf. For a plugin to work, the following conditions
must be met:</p>

<p>1. The plugin module file must be installed in the
plugin path as just described.</p>

<p>2. The global plugins option in /etc/yum/yum.conf must
be set to 1.</p>

<p>3. A configuration file for the plugin must exist in
/etc/yum/plugin- conf.d/&lt;plugin_name&gt;.conf and the
enabled setting in this file must set to 1 . The minimal
content for such a configuration file is:</p>

<p>[main] enabled = 1</p>

<p>See the yum.conf(5) man page for more information on
plugin related configuration options.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/yum.conf /etc/yum.repos.d/
/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/ /var/cache/yum/</p>
