<p>NAME kbd - Keyboard input driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;InputDevice&quot; Identifier
&quot;idevname&quot; Driver &quot;kbd&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION kbd is an Xorg input driver for keyboards.
The driver supports the standard OS-provided keyboard
interface, but these are currently only available to this
driver module for Linux, BSD, and Solaris. This driver is
planned to replace the built-in keyboard driver in a future
release of Xorg.</p>

<p>The kbd driver functions as a keyboard input device, and
may be used as the X servers core keyboard.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5x) for
general configuration details and for options that can be
used with all input drivers. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;Device&quot; &quot;string&quot; Specify the
keyboard device. Default: the OSs default console keyboard
input source.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Protocol&quot; &quot;string&quot; Specify
the keyboard protocol. Valid protocol types include:</p>

<p>Standard, Xqueue.</p>

<p>Not all protocols are supported on all platforms.
Default: &quot;Standard&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AutoRepeat&quot; &quot;delay rate&quot;
sets the auto repeat behaviour for the keyboard. This is not
implemented on all platforms. delay is the time in
milliseconds before a key starts repeating. rate is the
number of times a key repeats per second. Default: &quot;500
30&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XLeds&quot; &quot;ledlist&quot; makes the
keyboard LEDs specified in ledlist available for client use
instead of their traditional function (Scroll Lock, Caps
Lock and Num Lock). The numbers in the list are in the range
1 to 3. Default: empty list.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XkbRules&quot; &quot;rules&quot; specifies
which XKB rules file to use for interpreting the Xkb- Model,
XkbLayout, XkbVariant, and XkbOptions settings. Default:
&quot;xorg&quot; for most platforms, but &quot;xfree98&quot;
for the Japanese PC-98 platforms.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XkbModel&quot; &quot;modelname&quot;
specifies the XKB keyboard model name. Default:
&quot;pc105&quot; for most platforms, but &quot;pc98&quot;
for the Japanese PC-98 platforms.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XkbLayout&quot; &quot;layoutname&quot;
specifies the XKB keyboard layout name. This is usually the
country or language type of the keyboard. Default:
&quot;us&quot; for most platforms, but &quot;nec/jp&quot;
for the Japanese PC-98 platforms.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XkbVariant&quot; &quot;variants&quot;
specifies the XKB keyboard variant components. These can be
used to enhance the keyboard layout details. Default: not
set.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XkbOptions&quot; &quot;options&quot;
specifies the XKB keyboard option components. These can be
used to enhance the keyboard behaviour. Default: not
set.</p>

<p>Some other XKB-related options are available, but they
are incompatible with the ones listed above and are not
recommended, so they are not documented here.</p>
