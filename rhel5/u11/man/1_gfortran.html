<p>GFORTRAN(1) GNU GFORTRAN(1)</p>

<p>NAME gfortran - GNU Fortran 95 compiler</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gfortran [-c-S-E] [-g] [-pg] [-Olevel]
[-Wwarn...] [-pedantic] [-Idir...] [-Ldir...]
[-Dmacro[=defn]...] [-Umacro] [-foption...]
[-mmachine-option...] [-o outfile] infile...</p>

<p>Only the most useful options are listed here; see below
for the remain- der.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gfortran command supports all the
options supported by the gcc com- mand. Only options
specific to gfortran are documented here.</p>

<p>All gcc and gfortran options are accepted both by
gfortran and by gcc (as well as any other drivers built at
the same time, such as g++), since adding gfortran to the
gcc distribution enables acceptance of gfortran options by
all of the relevant drivers.</p>

<p>In some cases, options have positive and negative forms;
the negative form of -ffoo would be -fno-foo. This manual
documents only one of these two forms, whichever one is not
the default.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Here is a summary of all the options specific to
GNU Fortran, grouped by type. Explanations are in the
following sections.</p>

<p>Fortran Language Options -ffree-form -fno-fixed-form
-fdollar-ok -fimplicit-none -fmax-identifier-length -std=std
-fd-lines-as-code -fd-lines-as-comments
-ffixed-line-length-n -ffixed-line-length-none
-ffree-line-length-n -ffree-line-length-none
-fdefault-double-8 -fdefault-integer-8 -fdefault-real-8
-fcray-pointer -fopenmp -frange-check</p>

<p>Warning Options -fsyntax-only -pedantic -pedantic-errors
-w -Wall -Waliasing -Wampersand -Wconversion
-Wimplicit-interface -Wnonstd-intrinsics -Wsurprising
-Wunderflow -Wunused-labels -Wline-truncation -W</p>

<p>Debugging Options -fdump-parse-tree -ffpe-trap=list</p>

<p>Directory Options -Idir -Mdir</p>

<p>Runtime Options -fconvert=conversion
-frecord-marker=length</p>

<p>Code Generation Options -fno-automatic -ff2c
-fno-underscoring -fsecond-underscore -fbounds-check
-fmax-stack-var-size=n -fpackderived -frepack-arrays
-fshort-enums</p>

<p>Options Controlling Fortran Dialect</p>

<p>The following options control the dialect of Fortran
that the compiler accepts:</p>

<p>-ffree-form -ffixed-form Specify the layout used by the
source file. The free form layout was introduced in Fortran
90. Fixed form was traditionally used in older Fortran
programs.</p>

<p>-fd-lines-as-code -fd-lines-as-comments Enables special
treating for lines with d or D in fixed form sources. If the
-fd-lines-as-code option is given they are treated as if the
first column contained a blank. If the -fd-lines-as-com-
ments option is given, they are treated as comment
lines.</p>

<p>-fdefault-double-8 Set the &quot;DOUBLE PRECISION&quot;
type to an 8 byte wide.</p>

<p>-fdefault-integer-8 Set the default integer and logical
types to an 8 byte wide type. Do nothing if this is already
the default.</p>

<p>-fdefault-real-8 Set the default real type to an 8 byte
wide type. Do nothing if this is already the default.</p>

<p>-fdollar-ok Allow $ as a valid character in a symbol
name.</p>

<p>-fno-backslash Compile switch to change the
interpretation of a backslash from &quot;C&quot;-style
escape characters to a single backslash character.</p>

<p>-ffixed-line-length-n Set column after which characters
are ignored in typical fixed-form lines in the source file,
and through which spaces are assumed (as if padded to that
length) after the ends of short fixed-form lines.</p>

<p>Popular values for n include 72 (the standard and the
default), 80 (card image), and 132 (corresponds to
&quot;extended-source&quot; options in some popular
compilers). n may be none, meaning that the entire line is
meaningful and that continued character constants never have
implicit spaces appended to them to fill out the line.
-ffixed-line-length-0 means the same thing as
-ffixed-line-length-none.</p>

<p>-ffree-line-length-n Set column after which characters
are ignored in typical free-form lines in the source file.
For free-form, the default value is 132. n may be none,
meaning that the entire line is meaningful.
-ffree-line-length-0 means the same thing as
-ffree-line-length-none.</p>

<p>-fmax-identifier-length=n Specify the maximum allowed
identifier length. Typical values are 31 (Fortran 95) and 63
(Fortran 200x).</p>

<p>-fimplicit-none Specify that no implicit typing is
allowed, unless overridden by explicit IMPLICIT statements.
This is the equivalent of adding implicit none to the start
of every procedure.</p>

<p>-fcray-pointer Enables the Cray pointer extension, which
provides a C-like pointer.</p>

<p>-fopenmp Enables handling of OpenMP &quot;!$omp&quot;
directives in free form and &quot;c$omp&quot;, *$omp and
&quot;!$omp&quot; directives in fixed form, enables
&quot;!$&quot; conditional compilation sentinels in free
form and &quot;c$&quot;, &quot;*$&quot; and &quot;!$&quot;
sentinels in fixed form and when linking arranges for the
OpenMP runtime library to be linked in.</p>

<p>-frange-check Enable range checking on results of
simplification of constant expressions during compilation.
For example, by default, gfortran will give an overflow
error at compile time when simplifying &quot;a =
EXP(1000)&quot;. With -fno-range-check, no error will be
given and the variable &quot;a&quot; will be assigned the
value &quot;+Infinity&quot;.</p>

<p>-std=std Conform to the specified standard. Allowed
values for std are gnu, f95, f2003 and legacy.</p>

<p>Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</p>

<p>Warnings are diagnostic messages that report
constructions which are not inherently erroneous but which
are risky or suggest there might have been an error.</p>

<p>You can request many specific warnings with options
beginning -W, for example -Wimplicit to request warnings on
implicit declarations. Each of these specific warning
options also has a negative form beginning -Wno- to turn off
warnings; for example, -Wno-implicit. This manual lists only
one of the two forms, whichever is not the default.</p>

<p>These options control the amount and kinds of warnings
produced by GNU Fortran:</p>

<p>-fsyntax-only Check the code for syntax errors, but dont
do anything beyond that.</p>

<p>-pedantic Issue warnings for uses of extensions to
FORTRAN 95. -pedantic also applies to C-language constructs
where they occur in GNU For- tran source files, such as use
of e in a character constant within a directive like
#include.</p>

<p>Valid FORTRAN 95 programs should compile properly with
or without this option. However, without this option,
certain GNU extensions and traditional Fortran features are
supported as well. With this option, many of them are
rejected.</p>

<p>Some users try to use -pedantic to check programs for
conformance. They soon find that it does not do quite what
they want---it finds some nonstandard practices, but not
all. However, improvements to gfortran in this area are
welcome.</p>

<p>This should be used in conjunction with -std=std.</p>

<p>-pedantic-errors Like -pedantic, except that errors are
produced rather than warn- ings.</p>

<p>-w Inhibit all warning messages.</p>

<p>-Wall Enables commonly used warning options pertaining
to usage that we recommend avoiding and that we believe are
easy to avoid. This cur- rently includes -Wunused-labels,
-Waliasing, -Wampersand, -Wsur- prising, -Wnonstd-intrinsic,
and -Wline-truncation.</p>

<p>-Waliasing Warn about possible aliasing of dummy
arguments. Specifically, it warns if the same actual
argument is associated with a dummy argu- ment with
&quot;intent(in)&quot; and a dummy argument with
&quot;intent(out)&quot; in a call with an explicit
interface.</p>

<p>The following example will trigger the warning.</p>

<p>interface subroutine bar(a,b) integer, intent(in) :: a
integer, intent(out) :: b end subroutine end interface
integer :: a</p>

<p>call bar(a,a)</p>

<p>-Wampersand Warn about missing ampersand in continued
character literals. The warning is given with -Wampersand,
-pedantic, and -std=f95. Note: With no ampersand given in a
continued character literal, gfortran assumes continuation
at the first non-comment, non-whitespace char- acter.</p>

<p>-Wconversion Warn about implicit conversions between
different types.</p>

<p>-Wimplicit-interface Warn about when procedure are
called without an explicit interface. Note this only checks
that an explicit interface is present. It does not check
that the declared interfaces are consistent across program
units.</p>

<p>-Wnonstd-intrinsic Warn if the user tries to use an
intrinsic that does not belong to the standard the user has
chosen via the -std option.</p>

<p>-Wsurprising Produce a warning when
&quot;suspicious&quot; code constructs are encoun- tered.
While technically legal these usually indicate that an error
has been made.</p>

<p>This currently produces a warning under the following
circum- stances:</p>

<p>* An INTEGER SELECT construct has a CASE that can never
be matched as its lower value is greater than its upper
value.</p>

<p>* A LOGICAL SELECT construct has three CASE
statements.</p>

<p>-Wunderflow Produce a warning when numerical constant
expressions are encoun- tered, which yield an UNDERFLOW
during compilation.</p>

<p>-Wunused-labels Warn whenever a label is defined but
never referenced.</p>

<p>-Werror Turns all warnings into errors.</p>

<p>-W Turns on &quot;extra warnings&quot; and, if
optimization is specified via -O, the -Wuninitialized
option. (This might change in future versions of
gfortran</p>

<p>Some of these have no effect when compiling programs
written in For- tran.</p>

<p>Options for Debugging Your Program or GNU Fortran</p>

<p>GNU Fortran has various special options that are used
for debugging either your program or gfortran</p>

<p>-fdump-parse-tree Output the internal parse tree before
starting code generation. Only really useful for debugging
gfortran itself.</p>

<p>-ffpe-trap=list Specify a list of IEEE exceptions when a
Floating Point Exception (FPE) should be raised. On most
systems, this will result in a SIGFPE signal being sent and
the program being interrupted, produc- ing a core file
useful for debugging. list is a (possibly empty)
comma-separated list of the following IEEE exceptions:
invalid (invalid floating point operation, such as
&quot;sqrt(-1.0)&quot;), zero (division by zero), overflow
(overflow in a floating point opera- tion), underflow
(underflow in a floating point operation), preci- sion (loss
of precision during operation) and denormal (operation
produced a denormal denormal value).</p>

<p>Options for Directory Search</p>

<p>These options affect how gfortran searches for files
specified by the &quot;INCLUDE&quot; directive and where it
searches for previously compiled mod- ules.</p>

<p>It also affects the search paths used by cpp when used
to preprocess Fortran source.</p>

<p>-Idir These affect interpretation of the
&quot;INCLUDE&quot; directive (as well as of the
&quot;#include&quot; directive of the cpp preprocessor).</p>

<p>Also note that the general behavior of -I and
&quot;INCLUDE&quot; is pretty much the same as of -I with
&quot;#include&quot; in the cpp preprocessor, with regard to
looking for header.gcc files and other such things.</p>

<p>This path is also used to search for .mod files when
previously compiled modules are required by a
&quot;USE&quot; statement.</p>

<p>-Mdir -Jdir This option specifies where to put .mod
files for compiled modules. It is also added to the list of
directories to searched by an &quot;USE&quot; statement.</p>

<p>The default is the current directory.</p>

<p>-J is an alias for -M to avoid conflicts with existing
GCC options.</p>

<p>Influencing runtime behavior</p>

<p>These options affect the runtime behavior of
gfortran.</p>

<p>-fconvert=conversion Specify the representation of data
for unformatted files. Valid values for conversion are:
native, the default; swap, swap between big- and
little-endian; big-endian, use big-endian representation for
unformatted files; little-endian, use little-endian
representa- tion for unformatted files.</p>

<p>This option has an effect only when used in the main
program. The &quot;CONVERT&quot; specifier and the
GFORTRAN_CONVERT_UNIT environment vari- able override the
default specified by -fconvert.</p>

<p>-frecord-marker=length Specify the length of record
markers for unformatted files. Valid values for length are 4
and 8. Default is whatever &quot;off_t&quot; is specified to
be on that particular system. Note that specifying length as
4 limits the record length of unformatted files to 2 GB.
This option does not extend the maximum possible record
length on systems where &quot;off_t&quot; is a four_byte
quantity.</p>

<p>Options for Code Generation Conventions</p>

<p>These machine-independent options control the interface
conventions used in code generation.</p>

<p>Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the
negative form of -ffoo would be -fno-foo. In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed---the one which is
not the default. You can figure out the other form by either
removing no- or adding it.</p>

<p>-fno-automatic Treat each program unit as if the
&quot;SAVE&quot; statement was specified for every local
variable and array referenced in it. Does not affect common
blocks. (Some Fortran compilers provide this option under
the name -static.)</p>

<p>-ff2c Generate code designed to be compatible with code
generated by g77 and f2c.</p>

<p>The calling conventions used by g77 (originally
implemented in f2c) require functions that return type
default &quot;REAL&quot; to actually return the C type
&quot;double&quot;, and functions that return type
&quot;COM- PLEX&quot; to return the values via an extra
argument in the calling sequence that points to where to
store the return value. Under the default GNU calling
conventions, such functions simply return their results as
they would in GNU C -- default &quot;REAL&quot; functions
return the C type &quot;float&quot;, and &quot;COMPLEX&quot;
functions return the GNU C type &quot;complex&quot;.
Additionally, this option implies the -fsecond-under- score
option, unless -fno-second-underscore is explicitly
requested.</p>

<p>This does not affect the generation of code that
interfaces with the libgfortran library.</p>

<p>Caution: It is not a good idea to mix Fortran code
compiled with &quot;-ff2c&quot; with code compiled with the
default &quot;-fno-f2c&quot; calling con- ventions as,
calling &quot;COMPLEX&quot; or default &quot;REAL&quot;
functions between program parts which were compiled with
different calling conven- tions will break at execution
time.</p>

<p>Caution: This will break code which passes intrinsic
functions of type default &quot;REAL&quot; or
&quot;COMPLEX&quot; as actual arguments, as the library
implementations use the -fno-f2c calling conventions.</p>

<p>-fno-underscoring Do not transform names of entities
specified in the Fortran source file by appending
underscores to them.</p>

<p>With -funderscoring in effect, gfortran appends one
underscore to external names with no underscores. This is
done to ensure compat- ibility with code produced by many
UNIX Fortran compilers.</p>

<p>Caution: The default behavior of gfortran is
incompatible with f2c and g77, please use the -ff2c option
if you want object files compiled with gfortran to be
compatible with object code created with these tools.</p>

<p>Use of -fno-underscoring is not recommended unless you
are experi- menting with issues such as integration of (GNU)
Fortran into existing system environments (vis-a-vis
existing libraries, tools, and so on).</p>

<p>For example, with -funderscoring, and assuming other
defaults like -fcase-lower and that j() and max_count() are
external functions while my_var and lvar are local
variables, a statement like</p>

<p>I = J() + MAX_COUNT (MY_VAR, LVAR)</p>

<p>is implemented as something akin to:</p>

<p>i = j_() + max_count__(&amp;my_var__, &amp;lvar);</p>

<p>With -fno-underscoring, the same statement is
implemented as:</p>

<p>i = j() + max_count(&amp;my_var, &amp;lvar);</p>

<p>Use of -fno-underscoring allows direct specification of
user- defined names while debugging and when interfacing
gfortran code with other languages.</p>

<p>Note that just because the names match does not mean
that the interface implemented by gfortran for an external
name matches the interface implemented by some other
language for that same name. That is, getting code produced
by gfortran to link to code produced by some other compiler
using this or any other method can be only a small part of
the overall solution---getting the code generated by both
compilers to agree on issues other than naming can require
significant effort, and, unlike naming disagreements,
linkers nor- mally cannot detect disagreements in these
other areas.</p>

<p>Also, note that with -fno-underscoring, the lack of
appended under- scores introduces the very real possibility
that a user-defined external name will conflict with a name
in a system library, which could make finding
unresolved-reference bugs quite difficult in some
cases---they might occur at program run time, and show up
only as buggy behavior at run time.</p>

<p>In future versions of gfortran we hope to improve naming
and link- ing issues so that debugging always involves using
the names as they appear in the source, even if the names as
seen by the linker are mangled to prevent accidental linking
between procedures with incompatible interfaces.</p>

<p>-fsecond-underscore By default, gfortran appends an
underscore to external names. If this option is used
gfortran appends two underscores to names with underscores
and one underscore to external names with no under- scores.
(gfortran also appends two underscores to internal names
with underscores to avoid naming collisions with external
names.</p>

<p>This option has no effect if -fno-underscoring is in
effect. It is implied by the -ff2c option.</p>

<p>Otherwise, with this option, an external name such as
MAX_COUNT is implemented as a reference to the link-time
external symbol max_count__, instead of max_count_. This is
required for compati- bility with g77 and f2c, and is
implied by use of the -ff2c option.</p>

<p>-fbounds-check Enable generation of run-time checks for
array subscripts and against the declared minimum and
maximum values. It also checks array indices for assumed and
deferred shape arrays against the actual allocated
bounds.</p>

<p>In the future this may also include other forms of
checking, eg. checking substring references.</p>

<p>-fmax-stack-var-size=n This option specifies the size in
bytes of the largest array that will be put on the
stack.</p>

<p>This option currently only affects local arrays declared
with con- stant bounds, and may not apply to all character
variables. Future versions of gfortran may improve this
behavior.</p>

<p>The default value for n is 32768.</p>

<p>-fpackderived This option tells gfortran to pack derived
type members as closely as possible. Code compiled with this
option is likely to be incom- patible with code compiled
without this option, and may execute slower.</p>

<p>-frepack-arrays In some circumstances gfortran may pass
assumed shape array sec- tions via a descriptor describing a
discontiguous area of memory. This option adds code to the
function prologue to repack the data into a contiguous block
at runtime.</p>

<p>This should result in faster accesses to the array.
However it can introduce significant overhead to the
function call, especially when the passed data is
discontiguous.</p>

<p>-fshort-enums This option is provided for
interoperability with C code that was compiled with the
-fshort-enums option. It will make gfortran choose the
smallest &quot;INTEGER&quot; kind a given enumerator set
will fit in, and give all its enumerators this kind.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT GNU Fortran 95 currently does not make use
of any environment variables to control its operation above
and beyond those that affect the opera- tion of gcc.</p>
