<p>NAME fastjar - archive tool for Java archives</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fastjar -ctxu [OPTIONS] [jar-file]
[manifest-file] [-C dir] files...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;fastjar&quot; is an implementation of
Suns jar utility that comes with the JDK, written entirely
in C, and runs in a fraction of the time while being feature
compatible.</p>

<p>If any file is a directory then it is processed
recursively. The mani- fest file name and the archive file
name needs to be specified in the same order the -m and -f
flags are specified.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Exactly one of the following actions must be
specified:</p>

<p>-c Create new archive.</p>

<p>-t List table of contents for archive.</p>

<p>-x Extract named (or all) files from archive.</p>

<p>-u Update existing archive.</p>

<p>The following parameters are optional:</p>

<p>-@ Read the names of the files to add to the archive
from stdin. This option is supported only in combination
with -c or -u. Non stan- dard option added in the GCC
version.</p>

<p>-C directory Change to the directory and include the
following file.</p>

<p>-E Prevent fastjar from reading the content of a
directory when speci- fying one (and instead relying on the
provided list of files to populate the archive with regard
to the directory entry). Non stan- dard option added in the
GCC version.</p>

<p>-M Do not create a manifest file for the entries.</p>

<p>-i Generate an index of the packages in this jar and its
Class-Path (currently a no-op for jar command-line
compatibility).</p>

<p>-0 Store only; use no ZIP compression.</p>

<p>-V --version Display version information.</p>

<p>-f archive Specify archive file name.</p>

<p>-m manifest Include manifest information from specified
manifest file.</p>

<p>-v Generate verbose output on standard output.</p>

<p>All remaining options are considered to be names of
files.</p>
