<p>CLOCK_GETRES(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
CLOCK_GETRES(3)</p>

<p>NAME clock_getres, clock_gettime, clock_settime - clock
and time functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int clock_getres(clockid_t clk_id, struct timespec
*res); int clock_gettime(clockid_t clk_id, struct timespec
*tp); int clock_settime(clockid_t clk_id, const struct
timespec *tp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The function clock_getres() finds the
resolution (precision) of the specified clock clk_id, and,
if res is non-NULL, stores it in the struct timespec pointed
to by res. The resolution of clocks depends on the
implementation and cannot be configured by a particular
process. If the time value pointed to by the argument tp of
clock_settime() is not a multiple of res, then it is
truncated to a multiple of res.</p>

<p>The functions clock_gettime() and clock_settime()
retrieve and set the time of the specified clock clk_id.</p>

<p>The res and tp arguments are timespec structs, as
specified in &lt;time.h&gt;:</p>

<p>struct timespec { time_t tv_sec; /* seconds */ long
tv_nsec; /* nanoseconds */ };</p>

<p>The clk_id argument is the identifier of the particular
clock on which to act. A clock may be system-wide and hence
visible for all pro- cesses, or per-process if it measures
time only within a single pro- cess.</p>

<p>All implementations support the system-wide realtime
clock, which is identified by CLOCK_REALTIME. Its time
represents seconds and nanosec- onds since the Epoch. When
its time is changed, timers for a relative interval are
unaffected, but timers for an absolute point in time are
affected.</p>

<p>More clocks may be implemented. The interpretation of
the corresponding time values and the effect on timers is
unspecified.</p>

<p>Sufficiently recent versions of GNU libc and the Linux
kernel support the following clocks:</p>

<p>CLOCK_REALTIME System-wide realtime clock. Setting this
clock requires appro- priate privileges.</p>

<p>CLOCK_MONOTONIC Clock that cannot be set and represents
monotonic time since some unspecified starting point.</p>

<p>CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID High-resolution per-process
timer from the CPU.</p>

<p>CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID Thread-specific CPU-time
clock.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE clock_gettime(), clock_settime() and
clock_getres() return 0 for suc- cess, or -1 for failure (in
which case errno is set appropriately).</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT tp points outside the accessible address
space.</p>

<p>EINVAL The clk_id specified is not supported on this
system.</p>

<p>EPERM clock_settime() does not have permission to set
the clock indi- cated.</p>

<p>NOTE Most systems require the program be linked with the
librt library to use these functions.</p>

<p>NOTE for SMP systems The CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and
CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID clocks are realized on many
platforms using timers from the CPUs (TSC on i386, AR.ITC on
Itanium). These registers may differ between CPUs and as a
consequence these clocks may return bogus results if a
process is migrated to another CPU.</p>

<p>If the CPUs in an SMP system have different clock
sources then there is no way to maintain a correlation
between the timer registers since each CPU will run at a
slightly different frequency. If that is the case then
clock_getcpuclockid(0) will return ENOENT to signify this
condi- tion. The two clocks will then only be useful if it
can be ensured that a process stays on a certain CPU.</p>

<p>The processors in an SMP system do not start all at
exactly the same time and therefore the timer registers are
typically running at an off- set. Some architectures include
code that attempts to limit these off- sets on bootup.
However, the code cannot guarantee to accurately tune the
offsets. Glibc contains no provisions to deal with these
offsets (unlike the Linux Kernel). Typically these offsets
are small and there- fore the effects may be negligible in
most cases.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY On POSIX systems on which these functions
are available, the symbol _POSIX_TIMERS is defined in
&lt;unistd.h&gt; to a value greater than 0. The symbols
_POSIX_MONOTONIC_CLOCK, _POSIX_CPUTIME,
_POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME indicate that CLOCK_MONOTONIC,
CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID are
available. (See also sysconf(3).)</p>
