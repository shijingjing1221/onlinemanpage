<p>GROUP.CONF(5) Linux-PAM Manual GROUP.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME group.conf - configuration file for the pam_group
module</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_group PAM module does not
authenticate the user, but instead it grants group
memberships (in the credential setting phase of the
authentication module) to the user. Such memberships are
based on the service they are applying for.</p>

<p>For this module to function correctly there must be a
correctly formatted /etc/security/group.conf file present.
White spaces are ignored and lines maybe extended with
(escaped newlines). Text following a # is ignored to the end
of the line.</p>

<p>The syntax of the lines is as follows:</p>

<p>services;ttys;users;times;groups</p>

<p>The first field, the services field, is a logic list of
PAM service names that the rule applies to.</p>

<p>The second field, the tty field, is a logic list of
terminal names that this rule applies to.</p>

<p>The third field, the users field, is a logic list of
users or a netgroup of users to whom this rule applies.</p>

<p>For these items the simple wildcard * may be used only
once. With netgroups no wildcards or logic operators are
allowed.</p>

<p>The times field is used to indicate &quot;when&quot;
these groups are to be given to the user. The format here is
a logic list of day/time-range entries. The days are
specified by a sequence of two character entries, MoTuSa for
example is Monday Tuesday and Saturday. Note that repeated
days are unset MoMo = no day, and MoWk = all weekdays bar
Monday. The two character combinations accepted are Mo Tu We
Th Fr Sa Su Wk Wd Al, the last two being week-end days and
all 7 days of the week respectively. As a final example,
AlFr means all days except Friday.</p>

<p>Each day/time-range can be prefixed with a ! to indicate
&quot;anything but&quot;. The time-range part is two 24-hour
times HHMM, separated by a hyphen, indicating the start and
finish time (if the finish time is smaller than the start
time it is deemed to apply on the following day).</p>

<p>The groups field is a comma or space separated list of
groups that the user inherits membership of. These groups
are added if the previous fields are satisfied by the users
request.</p>

<p>For a rule to be active, ALL of service+ttys+users must
be satisfied by the applying process.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES These are some example lines which might be
specified in /etc/security/group.conf.</p>

<p>Running xsh on tty* (any ttyXXX device), the user us is
given access to the floppy (through membership of the floppy
group)</p>

<p>xsh;tty*&amp;!ttyp*;us;Al0000-2400;floppy</p>

<p>Running xsh on tty* (any ttyXXX device), the user sword
is given access to games (through membership of the floppy
group) after work hours.</p>

<p>xsh; tty* ;sword;!Wk0900-1800;games, sound xsh; tty*
;*;Al0900-1800;floppy</p>
