<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>NAME rdist - remote file distribution client program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rdist [ -DFn ] [ -A num ] [ -a num ] [ -d
var=value ] [ -l &lt;local logopts&gt; ] [ -L &lt;remote
logopts&gt; ] [ -f distfile ] [ -M maxproc ] [ -m host ] [

<p>rdist -DFn -c name ... [login@]host[:dest]</p>

<p>rdist -Server</p>

<p>rdist -V</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rdist is a program to maintain identical
copies of files over multiple hosts. It preserves the owner,
group, mode, and mtime of files if pos- sible and can update
programs that are executing. Rdist reads commands from
distfile to direct the updating of files and/or directories.
If distfile is -, the standard input is used. If no -f
option is present, the program looks first for distfile ,
then Distfile to use as the input. If no names are specified
on the command line, rdist will update all of the files and
directories listed in distfile. Oth- erwise, the argument is
taken to be the name of a file to be updated or the label of
a command to execute. If label and file names conflict, it
is assumed to be a label. These may be used together to
update spe- cific files using specific commands.</p>

<p>The -c option forces rdist to interpret the remaining
arguments as a small distfile. The equivalent distfile is as
follows.</p>

<p>( name ... ) -&gt; [login@]host install [dest] ;</p>

<p>The -Server option is recognized to provide partial
backward compatible support for older versions of rdist
which used this option to put rdist into server mode. If
rdist is started with the -Server command line option, it
will attempt to exec (run) the old version of rdist. This
option will only work if rdist was compiled with the
location of the old rdist (the path /usr/bin/oldrdist is
used on Red Hat linux) and that program is available at run
time.</p>

<p>Rdist can use either the rcmd(3) function call or run an
arbitrary transport program such as rsh(1c) to access each
target host. The method used is selected at compile-time.
However, if the later method is used, the transport program
can be specified at run-time on the com- mand line with the
default being rsh(1c). If the rsh(1c) method is used and the
target host is the string localhost and the remote user name
is the same as the local user name, rdist will run the
command</p>

<p>/bin/sh -c rdistd -S</p>

<p>Otherwise rdist run will run the command</p>

<p>rsh host -l remuser rdistd -S</p>

<p>where host is the name of the target host, remuser is
the name of the user to make the connection as and, rdistd
is the rdist server command on the target host as shown
below. To use a transport program other than rsh(1c) use the
-P option. Whatever transport program is used, must be
compatible with the above specified syntax for rsh(1c). If
the transport program is not, it should be wrapped in a
shell script which does understand this command line syntax
and which then executes the real transport program.</p>

<p>Heres an example which uses ssh(1) as the transport:</p>

<p>rdist -P /usr/local/bin/ssh -f myDistfile</p>

<p>If the rcmd(3) method is used, then rdist makes the
connection to the target host itself and runs the rdistd
server program as shown below. The default, and preferred
method, is to use rsh(1c) to make the con- nection to target
hosts. This allows rdist to be run without being setuid to
root.</p>

<p>On each target host Rdist will attempt to run the
command</p>

<p>rdistd -S</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>&lt;rdistd path&gt; -S</p>

<p>if the -p option was specified. If no -p option is
included, or the &lt;rdistd path&gt; is a simple filename,
rdistd or &lt;rdistd path&gt; must be somewhere in the $PATH
of the user running rdist on the remote (target) host.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A num Set the minimum number of free files
(inodes) on a filesystem that must exist for rdist to update
or install a file.</p>

<p>-a num Set the minimum amount of free space (in bytes)
on a filesystem that must exist for rdist to update or
install a file.</p>

<p>-D Enable copious debugging messages.</p>

<p>-d var=value Define var to have value. This option is
used to define or override variable definitions in the
distfile. Value can be the empty string, one name, or a list
of names surrounded by paren- theses and separated by tabs
and/or spaces.</p>

<p>-F Do not fork any child rdist processes. All clients
are updated sequentially.</p>

<p>-f distfile Set the name of the distfile to use to be
distfile . If dist- file is specified as - (dash) then read
from standard input (stdin).</p>

<p>-l logopts Set local logging options. See the section
MESSAGE LOGGING for details on the syntax for logopts.</p>

<p>-L logopts Set remote logging options. logopts is the
same as for local logging except the values are passed to
the remote server (rdistd). See the section MESSAGE LOGGING
for details on the syntax for logopts.</p>

<p>-M num Set the maximum number of simultaneously running
child rdist processes to num. The default is 4.</p>

<p>-m machine Limit which machines are to be updated.
Multiple -m arguments can be given to limit updates to a
subset of the hosts listed in the distfile.</p>

<p>-n Print the commands without executing them. This
option is useful for debugging distfile.</p>

<p>-odistopts Specify the dist options to enable. distopts
is a comma sepa- rated list of options which are listed
below. The valid values for distopts are:</p>

<p>verify Verify that the files are up to date on all the
hosts. Any files that are out of date will be displayed but
no files will be changed nor any mail sent.</p>

<p>whole Whole mode. The whole file name is appended to the
desti- nation directory name. Normally, only the last
component of a name is used when renaming files. This will
pre- serve the directory structure of the files being copied
instead of flattening the directory structure. For exam-
ple, rdisting a list of files such as /path/dir1/f1 and
/path/dir2/f2 to /tmp/dir would create files
/tmp/dir/path/dir1/f1 and /tmp/dir/path/dir2/f2 instead of
/tmp/dir/dir1/f1 and /tmp/dir/dir2/f2.</p>

<p>noexec Automatically exclude executable files that are
in a.out(5) format from being checked or updated.</p>

<p>younger Younger mode. Files are normally updated if
their mtime and size (see stat(2)) disagree. This option
causes rdist not to update files that are younger than the
master copy. This can be used to prevent newer copies on
other hosts from being replaced. A warning message is
printed for files which are newer than the master copy.</p>

<p>compare Binary comparison. Perform a binary comparison
and update files if they differ rather than comparing dates
and sizes.</p>

<p>follow Follow symbolic links. Copy the file that the
link points to rather than the link itself.</p>

<p>ignlnks Ignore unresolved links. Rdist will normally try
to maintain the link structure of files being transferred
and warn the user if all the links cannot be found.</p>

<p>chknfs Do not check or update files on target host that
reside on NFS filesystems.</p>

<p>chkreadonly Enable check on target host to see if a file
resides on a read-only filesystem. If a file does, then no
checking or updating of the file is attempted.</p>

<p>chksym If the target on the remote host is a symbolic
link, but is not on the master host, the remote target will
be left a symbolic link. This behavior is generally
considered a bug in the original version of rdist, but is
present to allow compatibility with older versions.</p>

<p>quiet Quiet mode. Files that are being modified are
normally printed on standard output. This option suppresses
this.</p>

<p>remove Remove extraneous files. If a directory is being
updated, any files that exist on the remote host that do not
exist in the master directory are removed. This is useful
for maintaining truly identical copies of directories.</p>

<p>nochkowner Do not check user ownership of files that
already exist. The file ownership is only set when the file
is updated.</p>

<p>nochkgroup Do not check group ownership of files that
already exist. The file ownership is only set when the file
is updated.</p>

<p>nochkmode Do not check file and directory permission
modes. The permission mode is only set when the file is
updated.</p>

<p>nodescend Do not descend into a directory. Normally
rdist will recursively check directories. If this option is
enabled, then any files listed in the file list in the
distfile that are directories are not recursively scanned.
Only the existence, ownership, and mode of the directory are
checked.</p>

<p>numchkgroup Use the numeric group id (gid) to check
group ownership instead of the group name.</p>

<p>numchkowner Use the numeric user id (uid) to check user
ownership instead of the user name.</p>

<p>savetargets Save files that are updated instead of
removing them. Any target file that is updates is first
rename from file to file.OLD.</p>

<p>sparse Enable checking for sparse (aka wholely) files.
One of the most common types of sparse files are those
produced by ndbm(3). This option adds some additional
processing overhead so it should only be enabled for targets
likely to contain sparse files.</p>

<p>-p &lt;rdistd-path&gt; Set the path where the rdistd
server is searched for on the tar- get host.</p>

<p>-P &lt;transport-path&gt; Set the path to the transport
command to be used. This is nor- mally rsh(1c) but can be
any other program - such as ssh(1) - which understands
rsh(1c) command line syntax and which provides an
appropriate connection to the remote host. The transport-
path may be a colon seperated list of possible pathnames. In
this case, the first component of the path to exist is used.
i.e. /usr/ucb/rsh:/usr/bin/remsh , /usr/bsd/rsh.</p>

<p>-t timeout Set the timeout period (in seconds) for
waiting for responses from the remote rdist server. The
default is 900 seconds.</p>

<p>-V Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>MESSAGE LOGGING Rdist uses a collection of predefined
message facilities that each con- tain a list of message
types specifying which types of messages to send to that
facility. The local client (rdist) and the remote server
(rdistd) each maintain their own copy of what types of
messages to log to what facilities.</p>

<p>The -l logopts option to rdist tells rdist what logging
options to use locally. The -L logopts option to rdist tells
rdist what logging options to pass to the remote rdistd
server.</p>

<p>The form of logopts should be of form</p>

<p>facility=types:facility=types...</p>

<p>The valid facility names are:</p>

<p>stdout Messages to standard output.</p>

<p>file Log to a file. To specify the file name, use the
format file=filename=types . e.g.
file=/tmp/rdist.log=all,debu.</p>

<p>syslog Use the syslogd(8) facility.</p>

<p>notify Use the internal rdist notify facility. This
facility is used in conjunction with the notify keyword in a
distfile to specify what messages are mailed to the notify
address.</p>

<p>types should be a comma separated list of message types.
Each message type specified enables that message level. This
is unlike the sys- log(3) system facility which uses an
ascending order scheme. The fol- lowing are the valid
types:</p>

<p>change Things that change. This includes files that are
installed or updated in some way.</p>

<p>info General information.</p>

<p>notice General info about things that change. This
includes things like making directories which are needed in
order to install a specific target, but which are not
explic- itly specified in the distfile.</p>

<p>nerror Normal errors that are not fatal.</p>

<p>ferror Fatal errors.</p>

<p>warning Warnings about errors which are not as serious
as nerror type messages.</p>

<p>debug Debugging information.</p>

<p>all All but debug messages.</p>

<p>Here is a sample command line option:</p>

<p>-l
stdout=all:syslog=change,notice:file=/tmp/rdist.log=all</p>

<p>This entry will set local message logging to have all
but debug mes- sages sent to standard output, change and
notice messages will be sent to syslog(3), and all messages
will be written to the file /tmp/rdist.log.</p>

<p>DISTFILES The distfile contains a sequence of entries
that specify the files to be copied, the destination hosts,
and what operations to perform to do the updating. Each
entry has one of the following formats.</p>

<p>&lt;variable name&gt; = &lt;name list&gt; [ label: ]
&lt;source list&gt; -&gt; &lt;destination list&gt;
&lt;command list&gt; [ label: ] &lt;source list&gt; ::
&lt;time_stamp file&gt; &lt;command list&gt;</p>

<p>The first format is used for defining variables. The
second format is used for distributing files to other hosts.
The third format is used for making lists of files that have
been changed since some given date. The source list
specifies a list of files and/or directories on the local
host which are to be used as the master copy for
distribution. The destination list is the list of hosts to
which these files are to be copied. Each file in the source
list is added to a list of changes if the file is out of
date on the host which is being updated (second format) or
the file is newer than the time stamp file (third
format).</p>

<p>Labels are optional. They are used to identify a command
for partial updates.</p>

<p>Newlines, tabs, and blanks are only used as separators
and are other- wise ignored. Comments begin with # and end
with a newline.</p>

<p>Variables to be expanded begin with $ followed by one
character or a name enclosed in curly braces (see the
examples at the end).</p>

<p>The source and destination lists have the following
format:</p>

<p>&lt;name&gt; or ( &lt;zero or more names separated by
white-space&gt; )</p>

<p>These simple lists can be modified by using one level of
set addition, subtraction, or intersection like this:</p>

<p>list - list or list + list or list &amp; list</p>

<p>If additional modifications are needed (e.g., all
servers and client machines except for the OSF/1 machines)
then the list will have to be explicitly constructed in
steps using &quot;temporary&quot; variables.</p>

<p>The shell meta-characters [, ], {, }, * , and ? are
recog- nized and expanded (on the local host only) in the
same way as csh(1). They can be escaped with a backslash.
The ~ character is also expanded in the same way as csh but
is expanded separately on the local and destination hosts.
When the -owhole option is used with a file name that begins
with ~, everything except the home directory is appended to
the destination name. File names which do not begin with /
or ~ use the destination users home directory as the root
direc- tory for the rest of the file name.</p>

<p>The command list consists of zero or more commands of
the following format.</p>

<p>install &lt;options&gt; opt_dest_name ; notify &lt;name
list&gt; ; except &lt;name list&gt; ; except_pat &lt;pattern
list&gt;; special &lt;name list&gt; string ; cmdspecial
&lt;name list&gt; string ;</p>

<p>The install command is used to copy out of date files
and/or directo- ries. Each source file is copied to each
host in the destination list. Directories are recursively
copied in the same way. Opt_dest_name is an optional
parameter to rename files. If no install command appears in
the command list or the destination name is not specified,
the source file name is used. Directories in the path name
will be created if they do not exist on the remote host. The
-o distopts option as specified above under OPTIONS, has the
same semantics as on the command line except they only apply
to the files in the source list. The login name used on the
destination host is the same as the local host unless the
destination name is of the format login@host&quot;.</p>

<p>The notify command is used to mail the list of files
updated (and any errors that may have occurred) to the
listed names. If no @ appears in the name, the destination
host is appended to the name (e.g., name1@host, name2@host,
...).</p>

<p>The except command is used to update all of the files in
the source list except for the files listed in name list.
This is usually used to copy everything in a directory
except certain files.</p>

<p>The except_pat command is like the except command except
that pattern list is a list of regular expressions (see
ed(1) for details). If one of the patterns matches some
string within a file name, that file will be ignored. Note
that since is a quote character, it must be dou- bled to
become part of the regular expression. Variables are
expanded in pattern list but not shell file pattern matching
characters. To include a $, it must be escaped with .</p>

<p>The special command is used to specify sh(1) commands
that are to be executed on the remote host after the file in
name list is updated or installed. If the name list is
omitted then the shell commands will be executed for every
file updated or installed. String starts and ends with
&quot; and can cross multiple lines in distfile. Multiple
commands to the shell should be separated by ;. Commands are
executed in the users home directory on the host being
updated. The special command can be used to rebuild private
databases, etc. after a program has been updated. The
following environment variables are set for each special
command:</p>

<p>FILE The full pathname of the local file that was just
updated.</p>

<p>REMFILE The full pathname of the remote file that was
just updated.</p>

<p>BASEFILE The basename of the remote file that was just
updated.</p>

<p>The cmdspecial command is similar to the special
command, except it is executed only when the entire command
is completed instead of after each file is updated. The list
of files is placed in the environment variable $FILES. Each
file name in $FILES is separated by a : (colon).</p>

<p>If a hostname ends in a + (plus sign), then the plus is
stripped off and NFS checks are disabled. This is equivalent
to disabling the -ochknfs option just for this one host.</p>

<p>The following is a small example.</p>

<p>HOSTS = ( matisse root@arpa)</p>

<p>FILES = ( /bin /lib /usr/bin /usr/games
/usr/include/{*.h,{stand,sys,vax*,pascal,machine}/*.h}
/usr/lib /usr/man/man? /usr/ucb /usr/local/rdist )</p>

<p>EXLIB = ( Mail.rc aliases aliases.dir aliases.pag
crontab dshrc sendmail.cf sendmail.fc sendmail.hf
sendmail.st uucp vfont )</p>

<p>${FILES} -&gt; ${HOSTS} install -oremove,chknfs ; except
/usr/lib/${EXLIB} ; except /usr/games/lib ; special
/usr/lib/sendmail &quot;/usr/lib/sendmail -bz&quot; ;</p>

<p>srcs: /usr/src/bin -&gt; arpa except_pat ( \.o/SCCS)
;</p>

<p>IMAGEN = (ips dviimp catdvi)</p>

<p>imagen: /usr/local/${IMAGEN} -&gt; arpa install
/usr/local/lib ; notify ralph ;</p>

<p>${FILES} :: stamp.cory notify root@cory ;</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT TMPDIR Name of temporary directory to use.
Default is /tmp.</p>

<p>FILES distfile - input command file $TMPDIR/rdist* -
temporary file for update lists</p>

<p>SEE ALSO sh(1), csh(1), stat(2), rsh(1c), rcmd(3)</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS NOTES If the basename of a file (the last
component in the pathname) is &quot;.&quot;, then rdist
assumes the remote (destination) name is a directory. i.e.
/tmp/. means that /tmp should be a directory on the remote
host.</p>

<p>The following options are still recognized for backwards
compatibility:</p>

<p>-v -N -O -q -b -r -R -s -w -y -h -i -x</p>

<p>BUGS Source files must reside on the local host where
rdist is executed.</p>

<p>Variable expansion only works for name lists; there
should be a general macro facility.</p>

<p>Rdist aborts on files which have a negative mtime
(before Jan 1, 1970).</p>

<p>If a hardlinked file is listed more than once in the
same target, then rdist will report missing links. Only one
instance of a link should be listed in each target.</p>
