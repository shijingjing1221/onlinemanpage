<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) man(1) man(1)</p>

<p>NAME man - format and display the on-line manual
pages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS man [-acdfFhkKtwW] [--path] [-m system] [-p
string] [-C config_file] [-M pathlist] [-P pager] [-B
browser] [-H htmlpager] [-S section_list] [section] name
...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION man formats and displays the on-line manual
pages. If you specify sec- tion, man only looks in that
section of the manual. name is normally the name of the
manual page, which is typically the name of a command,
function, or file. However, if name contains a slash (/)
then man interprets it as a file specification, so that you
can do man ./foo.5 or even man /cd/foo/bar.1.gz.</p>

<p>See below for a description of where man looks for the
manual page files.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C config_file Specify the configuration file to
use; the default is /etc/man.config. (See
man.config(5).)</p>

<p>-M path Specify the list of directories to search for
man pages. Sepa- rate the directories with colons. An empty
list is the same as not specifying -M at all. See SEARCH
PATH FOR MANUAL PAGES.</p>

<p>-P pager Specify which pager to use. This option
overrides the MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn
overrides the PAGER vari- able. By default, man uses
/usr/bin/less -is.</p>

<p>-B Specify which browser to use on HTML files. This
option over- rides the BROWSER environment variable. By
default, man uses /usr/bin/less-is,</p>

<p>-H Specify a command that renders HTML files as text.
This option overrides the HTMLPAGER environment variable. By
default, man uses /bin/cat,</p>

<p>-S section_list List is a colon separated list of manual
sections to search. This option overrides the MANSECT
environment variable.</p>

<p>-a By default, man will exit after displaying the first
manual page it finds. Using this option forces man to
display all the man- ual pages that match name, not just the
first.</p>

<p>-c Reformat the source man page, even when an up-to-date
cat page exists. This can be meaningful if the cat page was
formatted for a screen with a different number of columns,
or if the pre- formatted page is corrupted.</p>

<p>-d Don t actually display the man pages, but do print
gobs of debugging information.</p>

<p>-D Both display and print debugging info.</p>

<p>-f Equivalent to whatis.</p>

<p>-F or --preformat Format only - do not display.</p>

<p>-h Print a help message and exit.</p>

<p>-k Equivalent to apropos.</p>

<p>-K Search for the specified string in *all* man pages.
Warning: this is probably very slow! It helps to specify a
section. (Just to give a rough idea, on my machine this
takes about a minute per 500 man pages.)</p>

<p>-m system Specify an alternate set of man pages to
search based on the system name given.</p>

<p>-p string Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run
before nroff or troff. Not all installations will have a
full set of preproces- sors. Some of the preprocessors and
the letters used to desig- nate them are: eqn (e), grap (g),
pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer (r). This option
overrides the MANROFFSEQ environment variable.</p>

<p>-t Use /usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc to format the manual
page, pass- ing the output to stdout. The default output
format of /usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc is Postscript, refer
to the manual page of /usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc for ways
to pick an alter- nate format.</p>

<p>Depending on the selected format and the availability of
printing devices, the output may need to be passed through
some filter or another before being printed.</p>

<p>-w or --path Dont actually display the man pages, but do
print the loca- tion(s) of the files that would be formatted
or displayed. If no argument is given: display (on stdout)
the list of directories that is searched by man for man
pages. If manpath is a link to man, then &quot;manpath&quot;
is equivalent to &quot;man --path&quot;.</p>

<p>-W Like -w, but print file names one per line, without
additional information. This is useful in shell commands
like man -aW man | xargs ls -l</p>

<p>CAT PAGES Man will try to save the formatted man pages,
in order to save format- ting time the next time these pages
are needed. Traditionally, format- ted versions of pages in
DIR/manX are saved in DIR/catX, but other map- pings from
man dir to cat dir can be specified in /etc/man.config. No
cat pages are saved when the required cat directory does not
exist. No cat pages are saved when they are formatted for a
line length different from 80. No cat pages are saved when
man.config contains the line NOCACHE.</p>

<p>It is possible to make man suid to a user man. Then, if
a cat directory has owner man and mode 0755 (only writable
by man), and the cat files have owner man and mode 0644 or
0444 (only writable by man, or not writable at all), no
ordinary user can change the cat pages or put other files in
the cat directory. If man is not made suid, then a cat
directory should have mode 0777 if all users should be able
to leave cat pages there.</p>

<p>The option -c forces reformatting a page, even if a
recent cat page exists.</p>

<p>HTML PAGES Man will find HTML pages if they live in
directories named as expected to be &quot;.html&quot;, thus
a valid name for an HTML version of the ls(1) man page would
be /usr/share/man/htmlman1/ls.1.html.</p>

<p>SEARCH PATH FOR MANUAL PAGES man uses a sophisticated
method of finding manual page files, based on the invocation
options and environment variables, the /etc/man.config
configuration file, and some built in conventions and
heuristics.</p>

<p>First of all, when the name argument to man contains a
slash (/), man assumes it is a file specification itself,
and there is no searching involved.</p>

<p>But in the normal case where name doesnt contain a
slash, man searches a variety of directories for a file that
could be a manual page for the topic named.</p>

<p>If you specify the -M pathlist option, pathlist is a
colon-separated list of the directories that man
searches.</p>

<p>If you dont specify -M but set the MANPATH environment
variable, the value of that variable is the list of the
directories that man searches.</p>

<p>If you dont specify an explicit path list with -M or
MANPATH, man develops its own path list based on the
contents of the configuration file /etc/man.config. The
MANPATH statements in the configuration file identify
particular directories to include in the search path.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the MANPATH_MAP statements add to the
search path depend- ing on your command search path (i.e.
your PATH environment variable). For each directory that may
be in the command search path, a MAN- PATH_MAP statement
specifies a directory that should be added to the search
path for manual page files. man looks at the PATH variable
and adds the corresponding directories to the manual page
file search path. Thus, with the proper use of MANPATH_MAP,
when you issue the command man xyz, you get a manual page
for the program that would run if you issued the command
xyz.</p>

<p>In addition, for each directory in the command search
path (well call it a &quot;command directory&quot;) for
which you do not have a MANPATH_MAP statement, man
automatically looks for a manual page directory
&quot;nearby&quot; namely as a subdirectory in the command
directory itself or in the par- ent directory of the command
directory.</p>

<p>You can disable the automatic &quot;nearby&quot;
searches by including a NOAU- TOPATH statement in
/etc/man.config.</p>

<p>In each directory in the search path as described above,
man searches for a file named topic.section, with an
optional suffix on the section number and possibly a
compression suffix. If it doesnt find such a file, it then
looks in any subdirectories named manN or catN where N is
the manual section number. If the file is in a catN
subdirectory, man assumes it is a formatted manual page file
(cat page). Otherwise, man assumes it is unformatted. In
either case, if the filename has a known compression suffix
(like .gz), man assumes it is gzipped.</p>

<p>If you want to see where (or if) man would find the
manual page for a particular topic, use the --path (-w)
option.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT MANPATH If MANPATH is set, man uses it as
the path to search for manual page files. It overrides the
configuration file and the auto- matic search path, but is
overridden by the -M invocation option. See SEARCH PATH FOR
MANUAL PAGES.</p>

<p>MANPL If MANPL is set, its value is used as the display
page length. Otherwise, the entire man page will occupy one
(long) page.</p>

<p>MANROFFSEQ If MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to
determine the set of preprocessors run before running nroff
or troff. By default, pages are passed through the tbl
preprocessor before nroff.</p>

<p>MANSECT If MANSECT is set, its value is used to
determine which manual sections to search.</p>

<p>MANWIDTH If MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the
width manpages should be displayed. Otherwise the pages may
be displayed over the whole width of your screen.</p>

<p>MANPAGER If MANPAGER is set, its value is used as the
name of the program to use to display the man page. If not,
then PAGER is used. If that has no value either,
/usr/bin/less -is is used.</p>

<p>BROWSER The name of a browser to use for displaying HTML
manual pages. If it is not set, /usr/bin/less -is is
used.</p>

<p>HTMLPAGER The command to use for rendering HTML manual
pages as text. If it is not set, /bin/cat is used.</p>

<p>LANG If LANG is set, its value defines the name of the
subdirectory where man first looks for man pages. Thus, the
command LANG=dk man 1 foo will cause man to look for the foo
man page in .../dk/man1/foo.1, and if it cannot find such a
file, then in .../man1/foo.1, where ... is a directory on
the search path.</p>

<p>NLSPATH, LC_MESSAGES, LANG The environment variables
NLSPATH and LC_MESSAGES (or LANG when the latter does not
exist) play a role in locating the message catalog. (But the
English messages are compiled in, and for English no catalog
is required.) Note that programs like col(1) called by man
also use e.g. LC_CTYPE.</p>

<p>PATH PATH helps determine the search path for manual
page files. See SEARCH PATH FOR MANUAL PAGES.</p>

<p>SYSTEM SYSTEM is used to get the default alternate
system name (for use with the -m option).</p>

<p>BUGS The -t option only works if a troff-like program is
installed. If you see blinking 255 or &lt;AD&gt; instead of
hyphens, put LESS- CHARSET=latin1 in your environment.</p>

<p>TIPS If you add the line</p>

<p>(global-set-key [(f1)] (lambda () (interactive)
(manual-entry (current-word))))</p>

<p>to your .emacs file, then hitting F1 will give you the
man page for the library call at the current cursor
position.</p>

<p>To get a plain text version of a man page, without
backspaces and underscores, try</p>

<p># man foo | col -b &gt; foo.mantxt</p>
