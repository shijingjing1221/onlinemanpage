<p>NAME perlbug - how to submit bug reports on Perl</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS perlbug [ -v ] [ -a address ] [ -s subject ] [
-b body -f inputfile ] [ -F outputfile ] [ -r returnaddress
] [ -e editor ] [ -c adminad- dress -C ] [ -S ] [ -t ] [ -d
] [ -A ] [ -h ]</p>

<p>perlbug [ -v ] [ -r returnaddress ] [ -A ] [ -ok -okay
-nok -nokay ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A program to help generate bug reports about
perl or the modules that come with it, and mail them.</p>

<p>If you have found a bug with a non-standard port (one
that was not part of the standard distribution), a binary
distribution, or a non-standard module (such as Tk, CGI,
etc), then please see the documentation that came with that
distribution to determine the correct place to report
bugs.</p>

<p>&quot;perlbug&quot; is designed to be used
interactively. Normally no arguments will be needed. Simply
run it, and follow the prompts.</p>

<p>If you are unable to run perlbug (most likely because
you dont have a working setup to send mail that perlbug
recognizes), you may have to compose your own report, and
email it to perlbug@perl.org. You might find the -d option
useful to get summary information in that case.</p>

<p>In any case, when reporting a bug, please make sure you
have run through this checklist:</p>

<p>What version of Perl you are running? Type &quot;perl
-v&quot; at the command line to find out.</p>

<p>Are you running the latest released version of perl?
Look at http://www.perl.com/ to find out. If it is not the
latest released version, get that one and see whether your
bug has been fixed. Note that bug reports about old versions
of Perl, espe- cially those prior to the 5.0 release, are
likely to fall upon deaf ears. You are on your own if you
continue to use perl1 .. perl4.</p>

<p>Are you sure what you have is a bug? A significant
number of the bug reports we get turn out to be docu- mented
features in Perl. Make sure the behavior you are witnessing
doesnt fall under that category, by glancing through the
documen- tation that comes with Perl (well admit this is no
mean task, given the sheer volume of it all, but at least
have a look at the sections that seem relevant).</p>

<p>Be aware of the familiar traps that perl programmers of
various hues fall into. See perltrap.</p>

<p>Check in perldiag to see what any Perl error message(s)
mean. If message isn t in perldiag, it probably isnt
generated by Perl. Consult your operating system
documentation instead.</p>

<p>If you are on a non-UNIX platform check also perlport,
as some fea- tures may be unimplemented or work
differently.</p>

<p>Try to study the problem under the Perl debugger, if
necessary. See perldebug.</p>

<p>Do you have a proper test case? The easier it is to
reproduce your bug, the more likely it will be fixed,
because if no one can duplicate the problem, no one can fix
it. A good test case has most of these attributes: fewest
possible number of lines; few dependencies on external
commands, modules, or libraries; runs on most platforms
unimpeded; and is self-document- ing.</p>

<p>A good test case is almost always a good candidate to be
on the perl test suite. If you have the time, consider
making your test case so that it will readily fit into the
standard test suite.</p>

<p>Remember also to include the exact error messages, if
any. &quot;Perl complained something&quot; is not an exact
error message.</p>

<p>If you get a core dump (or equivalent), you may use a
debugger (dbx, gdb, etc) to produce a stack trace to include
in the bug report. NOTE: unless your Perl has been compiled
with debug info (often -g), the stack trace is likely to be
somewhat hard to use because it will most probably contain
only the function names and not their arguments. If
possible, recompile your Perl with debug info and reproduce
the dump and the stack trace.</p>

<p>Can you describe the bug in plain English? The easier it
is to understand a reproducible bug, the more likely it will
be fixed. Anything you can provide by way of insight into
the problem helps a great deal. In other words, try to
analyze the problem (to the extent you can) and report your
discoveries.</p>

<p>Can you fix the bug yourself? A bug report which
includes a patch to fix it will almost defi- nitely be
fixed. Use the &quot;diff&quot; program to generate your
patches (&quot;diff&quot; is being maintained by the GNU
folks as part of the diffu- tils package, so you should be
able to get it from any of the GNU software repositories).
If you do submit a patch, the cool-dude counter at
perlbug@perl.org will register you as a savior of the world.
Your patch may be returned with requests for changes, or
requests for more detailed explanations about your fix.</p>

<p>Here are some clues for creating quality patches: Use
the -c or -u switches to the diff program (to create a
so-called context or uni- fied diff). Make sure the patch is
not reversed (the first argu- ment to diff is typically the
original file, the second argument your changed file). Make
sure you test your patch by applying it with the
&quot;patch&quot; program before you send it on its way. Try
to follow the same style as the code you are trying to
patch. Make sure your patch really does work (&quot;make
test&quot;, if the thing youre patching supports it).</p>

<p>Can you use &quot;perlbug&quot; to submit the report?
perlbug will, amongst other things, ensure your report
includes crucial information about your version of perl. If
&quot;perlbug&quot; is unable to mail your report after you
have typed it in, you may have to compose the message
yourself, add the output produced by &quot;perl- bug
-d&quot; and email it to perlbug@perl.org. If, for some
reason, you cannot run &quot;perlbug&quot; at all on your
system, be sure to include the entire output produced by
running &quot;perl -V&quot; (note the uppercase V).</p>

<p>Whether you use &quot;perlbug&quot; or send the email
manually, please make your Subject line informative. &quot;a
bug&quot; not informative. Neither is &quot;perl
crashes&quot; nor &quot;HELP!!!&quot;. These dont help. A
compact description of whats wrong is fine.</p>

<p>Having done your bit, please be prepared to wait, to be
told the bug is in your code, or even to get no reply at
all. The Perl maintainers are busy folks, so if your problem
is a small one or if it is difficult to understand or
already known, they may not respond with a personal reply.
If it is important to you that your bug be fixed, do monitor
the &quot;Changes&quot; file in any development releases
since the time you sub- mitted the bug, and encourage the
maintainers with kind words (but never any flames!). Feel
free to resend your bug report if the next released version
of perl comes out and your bug is still present.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Address to send the report to. Defaults to
perlbug@perl.org.</p>

<p>-A Don t send a bug received acknowledgement to the
reply address. Generally it is only a sensible to use this
option if you are a perl maintainer actively watching perl
porters for your message to arrive.</p>

<p>-b Body of the report. If not included on the command
line, or in a file with -f, you will get a chance to edit
the message.</p>

<p>-C Dont send copy to administrator.</p>

<p>-c Address to send copy of report to. Defaults to the
address of the local perl administrator (recorded when perl
was built).</p>

<p>-d Data mode (the default if you redirect or pipe
output). This prints out your configuration data, without
mailing anything. You can use this with -v to get more
complete data.</p>

<p>-e Editor to use.</p>

<p>-f File containing the body of the report. Use this to
quickly send a prepared message.</p>

<p>-F File to output the results to instead of sending as
an email. Useful particularly when running perlbug on a
machine with no direct internet connection.</p>

<p>-h Prints a brief summary of the options.</p>

<p>-ok Report successful build on this system to perl
porters. Forces -S and -C. Forces and supplies values for -s
and -b. Only prompts for a return address if it cannot guess
it (for use with make). Honors return address specified with
-r. You can use this with -v to get more complete data. Only
makes a report if this system is less than 60 days old.</p>

<p>-okay As -ok except it will report on older systems.</p>

<p>-nok Report unsuccessful build on this system. Forces
-C. Forces and supplies a value for -s, then requires you to
edit the report and say what went wrong. Alternatively, a
prepared report may be supplied using -f. Only prompts for a
return address if it cannot guess it (for use with make).
Honors return address specified with -r. You can use this
with -v to get more complete data. Only makes a report if
this system is less than 60 days old.</p>

<p>-nokay As -nok except it will report on older
systems.</p>

<p>-r Your return address. The program will ask you to
confirm its default if you dont use this option.</p>

<p>-S Send without asking for confirmation.</p>

<p>-s Subject to include with the message. You will be
prompted if you dont supply one on the command line.</p>

<p>-t Test mode. The target address defaults to perl-
bug-test@perl.org.</p>

<p>-v Include verbose configuration data in the report.</p>
