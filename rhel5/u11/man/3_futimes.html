<p>NAME futimes - change access and/or modification times
of an open file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int futimes(int fd, const struct timeval tv[2]);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION futimes() changes the access and
modification times of a file in the same way as utimes(2),
with the difference that the file whose times- tamps are to
be changed is specified via a file descriptor, fd, rather
than via a pathname.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS Errors are as for utimes(2), with the following
additions:</p>

<p>EBADF fd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOSYS The /proc file system could not be accessed.</p>

<p>VERSIONS futimes() is available since glibc 2.3.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.2BSD. Other than Linux, this function is
only available on the BSDs.</p>
