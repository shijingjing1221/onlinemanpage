<p>NAME dhcp-options - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
options</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Dynamic Host Configuration protocol
allows the client to receive options from the DHCP server
describing the network configuration and various services
that are available on the network. When configuring dhcpd(8)
or dhclient(8) , options must often be declared. The syntax
for declaring options, and the names and formats of the
options that can be declared, are documented here.</p>

<p>REFERENCE: OPTION STATEMENTS DHCP option statements
always start with the option keyword, followed by an option
name, followed by option data. The option names and data
formats are described below. It is not necessary to
exhaustively specify all DHCP options - only those options
which are needed by clients must be specified.</p>

<p>Option data comes in a variety of formats, as defined
below:</p>

<p>The ip-address data type can be entered either as an
explicit IP address (e.g., 239.254.197.10) or as a domain
name (e.g., haa- gen.isc.org). When entering a domain name,
be sure that that domain name resolves to a single IP
address.</p>

<p>The int32 data type specifies a signed 32-bit integer.
The uint32 data type specifies an unsigned 32-bit integer.
The int16 and uint16 data types specify signed and unsigned
16-bit integers. The int8 and uint8 data types specify
signed and unsigned 8-bit integers. Unsigned 8-bit integers
are also sometimes referred to as octets.</p>

<p>The text data type specifies an NVT ASCII string, which
must be enclosed in double quotes - for example, to specify
a root-path option, the syntax would be</p>

<p>option root-path
&quot;10.0.1.4:/var/tmp/rootfs&quot;;</p>

<p>The domain-name data type specifies a domain name, which
must not enclosed in double quotes. This data type is not
used for any exist- ing DHCP options. The domain name is
stored just as if it were a text option.</p>

<p>The flag data type specifies a boolean value. Booleans
can be either true or false (or on or off, if that makes
more sense to you).</p>

<p>The string data type specifies either an NVT ASCII
string enclosed in double quotes, or a series of octets
specified in hexadecimal, sepa- rated by colons. For
example:</p>

<p>option dhcp-client-identifier &quot;CLIENT-FOO&quot;; or
option dhcp-client-identifier
43:4c:49:45:54:2d:46:4f:4f;</p>

<p>SETTING OPTION VALUES USING EXPRESSIONS Sometimes its
helpful to be able to set the value of a DHCP option based
on some value that the client has sent. To do this, you can
use expression evaluation. The dhcp-eval(5) manual page
describes how to write expressions. To assign the result of
an evaluation to an option, define the option as
follows:</p>

<p>option my-option = expression ;</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>option hostname = binary-to-ascii (16, 8, &quot;-&quot;,
substring (hardware, 1, 6));</p>

<p>STANDARD DHCP OPTIONS The documentation for the various
options mentioned below is taken from the latest IETF draft
document on DHCP options. Options not listed below may not
yet be implemented, but it is possible to use such options
by defining them in the configuration file. Please see the
DEFINING NEW OPTIONS heading later in this document for more
informa- tion.</p>

<p>Some of the options documented here are automatically
generated by the DHCP server or by clients, and cannot be
configured by the user. The value of such an option can be
used in the configuration file of the receiving DHCP
protocol agent (server or client), for example in condi-
tional expressions. However, the value of the option cannot
be used in the configuration file of the sending agent,
because the value is determined only after the configuration
file has been processed. In the following documentation,
such options will be shown as &quot;not user con-
figurable&quot;</p>

<p>The standard options are:</p>

<p>option all-subnets-local flag;</p>

<p>This option specifies whether or not the client may
assume that all subnets of the IP network to which the
client is connected use the same MTU as the subnet of that
network to which the client is directly connected. A value
of true indicates that all subnets share the same MTU. A
value of false means that the client should assume that some
subnets of the directly connected network may have smaller
MTUs.</p>

<p>option arp-cache-timeout uint32;</p>

<p>This option specifies the timeout in seconds for ARP
cache entries.</p>

<p>option bootfile-name text;</p>

<p>This option is used to identify a bootstrap file. If
supported by the client, it should have the same effect as
the filename declara- tion. BOOTP clients are unlikely to
support this option. Some DHCP clients will support it, and
others actually require it.</p>

<p>option boot-size uint16;</p>

<p>This option specifies the length in 512-octet blocks of
the default boot image for the client.</p>

<p>option broadcast-address ip-address;</p>

<p>This option specifies the broadcast address in use on
the clients subnet. Legal values for broadcast addresses are
specified in sec- tion 3.2.1.3 of STD 3 (RFC1122).</p>

<p>option cookie-servers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The cookie server option specifies a list of RFC 865
cookie servers available to the client. Servers should be
listed in order of pref- erence.</p>

<p>option default-ip-ttl uint8;</p>

<p>This option specifies the default time-to-live that the
client should use on outgoing datagrams.</p>

<p>option default-tcp-ttl uint8;</p>

<p>This option specifies the default TTL that the client
should use when sending TCP segments. The minimum value is
1.</p>

<p>option dhcp-client-identifier string;</p>

<p>This option can be used to specify a DHCP client
identifier in a host declaration, so that dhcpd can find the
host record by matching against the client identifier.</p>

<p>Please be aware that some DHCP clients, when configured
with client identifiers that are ASCII text, will prepend a
zero to the ASCII text. So you may need to write:</p>

<p>option dhcp-client-identifier &quot; foo&quot;;</p>

<p>rather than:</p>

<p>option dhcp-client-identifier &quot;foo&quot;;</p>

<p>option dhcp-lease-time uint32;</p>

<p>This option is used in a client request (DHCPDISCOVER or
DHCPRE- QUEST) to allow the client to request a lease time
for the IP address. In a server reply (DHCPOFFER), a DHCP
server uses this option to specify the lease time it is
willing to offer.</p>

<p>This option is not directly user configurable in the
server; refer to the max-lease-time and default-lease-time
server options in dhcpd.conf(5).</p>

<p>option dhcp-max-message-size uint16;</p>

<p>This option, when sent by the client, specifies the
maximum size of any response that the server sends to the
client. When specified on the server, if the client did not
send a dhcp-max-message-size option, the size specified on
the server is used. This works for BOOTP as well as DHCP
responses.</p>

<p>option dhcp-message text;</p>

<p>This option is used by a DHCP server to provide an error
message to a DHCP client in a DHCPNAK message in the event
of a failure. A client may use this option in a DHCPDECLINE
message to indicate why the client declined the offered
parameters.</p>

<p>This option is not user configurable.</p>

<p>option dhcp-message-type uint8;</p>

<p>This option, sent by both client and server, specifies
the type of DHCP message contained in the DHCP packet.
Possible values (taken directly from RFC2132) are:</p>

<p>1 DHCPDISCOVER 2 DHCPOFFER 3 DHCPREQUEST 4 DHCPDECLINE 5
DHCPACK 6 DHCPNAK 7 DHCPRELEASE 8 DHCPINFORM</p>

<p>This option is not user configurable.</p>

<p>option dhcp-option-overload uint8;</p>

<p>This option is used to indicate that the DHCP sname or
file fields are being overloaded by using them to carry DHCP
options. A DHCP server inserts this option if the returned
parameters will exceed the usual space allotted for
options.</p>

<p>If this option is present, the client interprets the
specified addi- tional fields after it concludes
interpretation of the standard option fields.</p>

<p>Legal values for this option are:</p>

<p>1 the file field is used to hold options 2 the sname
field is used to hold options 3 both fields are used to hold
options</p>

<p>This option is not user configurable.</p>

<p>option dhcp-parameter-request-list uint16;</p>

<p>This option, when sent by the client, specifies which
options the client wishes the server to return. Normally, in
the ISC DHCP client, this is done using the request
statement. If this option is not specified by the client,
the DHCP server will normally return every option that is
valid in scope and that fits into the reply. When this
option is specified on the server, the server returns the
specified options. This can be used to force a client to
take options that it hasnt requested, and it can also be
used to tailor the response of the DHCP server for clients
that may need a more limited set of options than those the
server would normally return.</p>

<p>option dhcp-rebinding-time uint32;</p>

<p>This option specifies the number of seconds from the
time a client gets an address until the client transitions
to the REBINDING state.</p>

<p>This option is not user configurable.</p>

<p>option dhcp-renewal-time uint32;</p>

<p>This option specifies the number of seconds from the
time a client gets an address until the client transitions
to the RENEWING state.</p>

<p>This option is not user configurable.</p>

<p>option dhcp-requested-address ip-address;</p>

<p>This option is used by the client in a DHCPDISCOVER to
request that a particular IP address be assigned.</p>

<p>This option is not user configurable.</p>

<p>option dhcp-server-identifier ip-address;</p>

<p>This option is used in DHCPOFFER and DHCPREQUEST
messages, and may optionally be included in the DHCPACK and
DHCPNAK messages. DHCP servers include this option in the
DHCPOFFER in order to allow the client to distinguish
between lease offers. DHCP clients use the contents of the
server identifier field as the destination address for any
DHCP messages unicast to the DHCP server. DHCP clients also
indicate which of several lease offers is being accepted by
includ- ing this option in a DHCPREQUEST message.</p>

<p>The value of this option is the IP address of the
server.</p>

<p>This option is not directly user configurable. See the
server-iden- tifier server option in dhcpd.conf(5).</p>

<p>option domain-name text;</p>

<p>This option specifies the domain name that client should
use when resolving hostnames via the Domain Name System.</p>

Domain Name Sys- tem (STD 13, RFC 1035) name servers
available to the client. Servers should be listed in order
of preference.</p>

<p>option extensions-path text;</p>

<p>This option specifies the name of a file containing
additional options to be interpreted according to the DHCP
option format as specified in RFC2132.</p>

<p>option finger-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The Finger server option specifies a list of Finger
servers avail- able to the client. Servers should be listed
in order of prefer- ence.</p>

<p>option font-servers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>This option specifies a list of X Window System Font
servers avail- able to the client. Servers should be listed
in order of preference.</p>

<p>option host-name string;</p>

<p>This option specifies the name of the client. The name
may or may not be qualified with the local domain name (it
is preferable to use the domain-name option to specify the
domain name). See RFC 1035 for character set restrictions.
This option is only honored by dhclient-script(8) if the
hostname for the client machine is not set.</p>

<p>option ieee802-3-encapsulation flag;</p>

<p>This option specifies whether or not the client should
use Ethernet Version 2 (RFC 894) or IEEE 802.3 (RFC 1042)
encapsulation if the interface is an Ethernet. A value of
false indicates that the client should use RFC 894
encapsulation. A value of true means that the client should
use RFC 1042 encapsulation.</p>

<p>option ien116-name-servers ip-address [, ip-address...
];</p>

<p>The ien116-name-servers option specifies a list of IEN

The mini- mum legal value for the MTU is 68.</p>

<p>option ip-forwarding flag;</p>

<p>This option specifies whether the client should
configure its IP layer for packet forwarding. A value of
false means disable IP for- warding, and a value of true
means enable IP forwarding.</p>

<p>option irc-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The IRC server option specifies a list of IRC servers
available to the client. Servers should be listed in order
of preference.</p>

<p>option log-servers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>This option specifies the path-name of a file to which
the clients core image should be dumped in the event the
client crashes. The path is formatted as a character string
consisting of characters from the NVT ASCII character
set.</p>

<p>option mobile-ip-home-agent ip-address [, ip-address...
];</p>

<p>This option specifies a list of IP addresses indicating
mobile IP home agents available to the client. Agents should
be listed in order of preference, although normally there
will be only one such agent.</p>

<p>option nds-context string;</p>

<p>The nds-context option specifies the name of the initial
Netware Directory Service for an NDS client.</p>

<p>option nds-servers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The nds-servers option specifies a list of IP addresses
of NDS servers.</p>

<p>option nds-tree-name string;</p>

ip-address...];</p>

<p>The NetBIOS name server (NBNS) option specifies a list
of RFC 1001/1002 NBNS name servers listed in order of
preference. NetBIOS Name Service is currently more commonly
referred to as WINS. WINS servers can be specified using the
netbios-name-servers option.</p>

<p>option netbios-node-type uint8;</p>

<p>The NetBIOS node type option allows NetBIOS over TCP/IP
clients which are configurable to be configured as described
in RFC 1001/1002. The value is specified as a single octet
which identi- fies the client type.</p>

<p>Possible node types are:</p>

<p>1 B-node: Broadcast - no WINS</p>

<p>2 P-node: Peer - WINS only</p>

<p>4 M-node: Mixed - broadcast, then WINS</p>

<p>8 H-node: Hybrid - WINS, then broadcast</p>

<p>option netbios-scope string;</p>

<p>The NetBIOS scope option specifies the NetBIOS over
TCP/IP scope parameter for the client as specified in RFC
1001/1002. See RFC1001, RFC1002, and RFC1035 for
character-set restrictions.</p>

<p>option nis-domain text;</p>

<p>This option specifies the name of the clients NIS (Sun
Network Information Services) domain. The domain is
formatted as a charac- ter string consisting of characters
from the NVT ASCII character set.</p>

<p>option nis-servers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>This option specifies a list of IP addresses indicating
NIS servers available to the client. Servers should be
listed in order of pref- erence.</p>

<p>option nisplus-domain text;</p>

<p>This option specifies the name of the client s NIS+

<p>The name of the NetWare/IP domain that a NetWare/IP
client should use.</p>

<p>option nwip-suboptions string;</p>

<p>A sequence of suboptions for NetWare/IP clients - see
RFC2242 for details. Normally this option is set by
specifying specific Net- Ware/IP suboptions - see the
NETWARE/IP SUBOPTIONS section for more information.</p>

<p>option path-mtu-aging-timeout uint32;</p>

<p>This option specifies the timeout (in seconds) to use
when aging Path MTU values discovered by the mechanism
defined in RFC 1191.</p>

<p>option path-mtu-plateau-table uint16 [, uint16... ];</p>

<p>This option specifies a table of MTU sizes to use when
performing Path MTU Discovery as defined in RFC 1191. The
table is formatted as a list of 16-bit unsigned integers,
ordered from smallest to largest. The minimum MTU value
cannot be smaller than 68.</p>

<p>option perform-mask-discovery flag;</p>

discovery.</p>

<p>option policy-filter ip-address ip-address [, ip-address
ip-address...];</p>

<p>This option specifies policy filters for non-local
source routing. The filters consist of a list of IP
addresses and masks which spec- ify destination/mask pairs
with which to filter incoming source routes.</p>

<p>Any source routed datagram whose next-hop address does
not match one of the filters should be discarded by the

string consisting of characters from the NVT ASCII character
set.</p>

<p>option router-discovery flag;</p>

<p>This option specifies whether or not the client should
solicit routers using the Router Discovery mechanism defined
in RFC 1256. A value of false indicates that the client
should not perform router discovery. A value of true means
that the client should perform router discovery.</p>

<p>option router-solicitation-address ip-address;</p>

<p>This option specifies the address to which the client
should trans- mit router solicitation requests.</p>

<p>option routers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The routers option specifies a list of IP addresses for
routers on the client s subnet. Routers should be listed in
order of prefer- ence.</p>

<p>option slp-directory-agent boolean ip-address [,
ip-address... ];</p>

<p>This option specifies two things: the IP addresses of
one or more Service Location Protocol Directory Agents, and
whether the use of these addresses is mandatory. If the
initial boolean value is true, the SLP agent should just use
the IP addresses given. If the value is false, the SLP agent
may additionally do active or passive multicast discovery of
SLP agents (see RFC2165 for details).</p>

<p>Please note that in this option and the
slp-service-scope option, the term &quot;SLP Agent&quot; is
being used to refer to a Service Location Protocol agent
running on a machine that is being configured using the DHCP
protocol.</p>

<p>Also, please be aware that some companies may refer to
SLP as NDS. If you have an NDS directory agent whose address
you need to config- ure, the slp-directory-agent option
should work.</p>

<p>option slp-service-scope boolean text;</p>

<p>The Service Location Protocol Service Scope Option
specifies two things: a list of service scopes for SLP, and
whether the use of this list is mandatory. If the initial
boolean value is true, the SLP agent should only use the
list of scopes provided in this option; otherwise, it may
use its own static configuration in pref- erence to the list
provided in this option.</p>

<p>The text string should be a comma-separated list of
scopes that the SLP agent should use. It may be omitted, in
which case the SLP Agent will use the aggregated list of
scopes of all directory agents known to the SLP agent.</p>

<p>option smtp-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The SMTP server option specifies a list of SMTP servers
available to the client. Servers should be listed in order
of preference.</p>

<p>option static-routes ip-address ip-address [, ip-address
ip-address...];</p>

<p>This option specifies a list of static routes that the
client should install in its routing cache. If multiple
routes to the same desti- nation are specified, they are
listed in descending order of prior- ity.</p>

<p>The routes consist of a list of IP address pairs. The
first address is the destination address, and the second
address is the router for the destination.</p>

<p>The default route (0.0.0.0) is an illegal destination
for a static route. To specify the default route, use the
routers option. Also, please note that this option is not
intended for classless IP routing - it does not include a
subnet mask. Since classless IP routing is now the most
widely deployed routing standard, this option is virtually
useless, and is not implemented by any of the popular DHCP
clients, for example the Microsoft DHCP client.</p>

<p>NOTE to Red Hat dhclient users: The RedHat
dhclient-script interprets trailing 0 octets of the tar- get
as indicating the subnet class of the route - so for this
static-routes value: option static-routes 172.0.0.0
172.16.2.254, 192.168.0.0 192.168.2.254; the Red Hat
dhclient-script will create routes: 172/8 via 172.16.2.254
dev $interface 192.168/16 via 192.168.2.254 dev $interface
which slightly increases the usefulness of the static-routes
option.</p>

<p>option streettalk-directory-assistance-server ip-address
[, ip-address...];</p>

<p>The StreetTalk Directory Assistance (STDA) server option
specifies a list of STDA servers available to the client.
Servers should be listed in order of preference.</p>

<p>option streettalk-server ip-address [, ip-address...
];</p>

<p>The StreetTalk server option specifies a list of
StreetTalk servers available to the client. Servers should
be listed in order of pref- erence.</p>

<p>option subnet-mask ip-address;</p>

<p>The subnet mask option specifies the clients subnet mask
as per RFC 950. If no subnet mask option is provided
anywhere in scope, as a last resort dhcpd will use the
subnet mask from the subnet declara- tion for the network on
which an address is being assigned. How- ever, any
subnet-mask option declaration that is in scope for the
address being assigned will override the subnet mask
specified in the subnet declaration.</p>

<p>option subnet-selection string;</p>

<p>Sent by the client if an address is required in a subnet
other than the one that would normally be selected (based on
the relaying address of the connected subnet the request is
obtained from). See RFC3011. Note that the option number
used by this server is 118; this has not always been the
defined number, and some clients may use a different value.
Use of this option should be regarded as slightly
experimental!</p>

<p>This option is not user configurable in the server.</p>

<p>option swap-server ip-address;</p>

<p>This specifies the IP address of the clients swap
server.</p>

<p>option tcp-keepalive-garbage flag;</p>

<p>This option specifies whether or not the client should
send TCP keepalive messages with an octet of garbage for
compatibility with older implementations. A value of false
indicates that a garbage octet should not be sent. A value
of true indicates that a garbage octet should be sent.</p>

<p>option tcp-keepalive-interval uint32;</p>

<p>This option specifies the interval (in seconds) that the
client TCP should wait before sending a keepalive message on
a TCP connection. The time is specified as a 32-bit unsigned
integer. A value of zero indicates that the client should
not generate keepalive messages on connections unless
specifically requested by an application.</p>

<p>option tftp-server-name text;</p>

<p>This option is used to identify a TFTP server and, if
supported by the client, should have the same effect as the
server-name declara- tion. BOOTP clients are unlikely to
support this option. Some DHCP clients will support it, and
others actually require it.</p>

<p>option time-offset int32;</p>

<p>The time-offset option specifies the offset of the
clients subnet in seconds from Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC).</p>

<p>option time-servers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The time-server option specifies a list of RFC 868 time
servers available to the client. Servers should be listed in
order of pref- erence.</p>

<p>option trailer-encapsulation flag;</p>

<p>This option specifies whether or not the client should
negotiate the use of trailers (RFC 893 [14]) when using the
ARP protocol. A value of false indicates that the client
should not attempt to use trail- ers. A value of true means
that the client should attempt to use trailers.</p>

<p>option uap-servers text;</p>

<p>This option specifies a list of URLs, each pointing to a
user authentication service that is capable of processing
authentication requests encapsulated in the User
Authentication Protocol (UAP). UAP servers can accept either
HTTP 1.1 or SSLv3 connections. If the list includes a URL
that does not contain a port component, the nor- mal default
port is assumed (i.e., port 80 for http and port 443 for
https). If the list includes a URL that does not contain a
path component, the path /uap is assumed. If more than one
URL is spec- ified in this list, the URLs are separated by
spaces.</p>

<p>option user-class string;</p>

<p>This option is used by some DHCP clients as a way for
users to specify identifying information to the client. This
can be used in a similar way to the vendor-class-identifier
option, but the value of the option is specified by the
user, not the vendor. Most recent DHCP clients have a way in
the user interface to specify the value for this identifier,
usually as a text string.</p>

<p>option vendor-class-identifier string;</p>

<p>This option is used by some DHCP clients to identify the
vendor type and possibly the configuration of a DHCP client.
The information is a string of bytes whose contents are
specific to the vendor and are not specified in a standard.
To see what vendor class identifier clients are sending, you
can write the following in your DHCP server configuration
file:</p>

<p>set vendor-string = option vendor-class-identifier;</p>

<p>This will result in all entries in the DHCP server lease
database file for clients that sent vendor-class-identifier
options having a set statement that looks something like
this:</p>

<p>set vendor-string = &quot;SUNW.Ultra-5_10&quot;;</p>

<p>The vendor-class-identifier option is normally used by
the DHCP server to determine the options that are returned
in the vendor- encapsulated-options option. Please see the
VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS section later in this manual
page for further information.</p>

<p>option vendor-encapsulated-options string;</p>

<p>The vendor-encapsulated-options option can contain
either a single vendor-specific value or one or more
vendor-specific suboptions. This option is not normally
specified in the DHCP server configura- tion file - instead,
a vendor class is defined for each vendor, ven- dor class
suboptions are defined, values for those suboptions are
defined, and the DHCP server makes up a response on that
basis.</p>

<p>Some default behaviours for well-known DHCP client
vendors (cur- rently, the Microsoft Windows 2000 DHCP
client) are configured auto- matically, but otherwise this
must be configured manually - see the VENDOR ENCAPSULATED
OPTIONS section later in this manual page for details.</p>

<p>option www-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The WWW server option specifies a list of WWW servers
available to the client. Servers should be listed in order
of preference.</p>

<p>option x-display-manager ip-address [, ip-address...
];</p>

<p>This option specifies a list of systems that are running
the X Win- dow System Display Manager and are available to
the client. Addresses should be listed in order of
preference.</p>

<p>RELAY AGENT INFORMATION OPTION An IETF draft,
draft-ietf-dhc-agent-options-11.txt, defines a series of
encapsulated options that a relay agent can add to a DHCP
packet when relaying it to the DHCP server. The server can
then make address allocation decisions (or whatever other
decisions it wants) based on these options. The server also
returns these options in any replies it sends through the
relay agent, so that the relay agent can use the information
in these options for delivery or accounting purposes.</p>

<p>The current draft defines two options. To reference
these options in the dhcp server, specify the option space
name, &quot;agent&quot;, followed by a period, followed by
the option name. It is not normally useful to define values
for these options in the server, although it is permissi-
ble. These options are not supported in the client.</p>

<p>option agent.circuit-id string;</p>

<p>The circuit-id suboption encodes an agent-local
identifier of the circuit from which a DHCP client-to-server
packet was received. It is intended for use by agents in
relaying DHCP responses back to the proper circuit. The
format of this option is currently defined to be
vendor-dependent, and will probably remain that way,
although the current draft allows for for the possibility of
standardizing the format in the future.</p>

<p>option agent.remote-id string;</p>

<p>The remote-id suboption encodes information about the
remote host end of a circuit. Examples of what it might
contain include caller ID information, username information,
remote ATM address, cable modem ID, and similar things. In
principal, the meaning is not well-specified, and it should
generally be assumed to be an opaque object that is
administratively guaranteed to be unique to a partic- ular
remote end of a circuit.</p>

<p>option agent.DOCSIS-device-class uint32;</p>

<p>The DOCSIS-device-class suboption is intended to convey
information about the host endpoint, hardware, and software,
that either the host operating system or the DHCP server may
not otherwise be aware of (but the relay is able to
distinguish). This is implemented as a 32-bit field (4
octets), each bit representing a flag describing the host in
one of these ways. So far, only bit zero (being the least
significant bit) is defined in RFC3256. If this bit is set
to one, the host is considered a CPE Controlled Cable Modem
(CCCM). All other bits are reserved.</p>

<p>THE CLIENT FQDN SUBOPTIONS The Client FQDN option,
currently defined in the Internet Draft draft-
ietf-dhc-fqdn-option-00.txt is not a standard yet, but is in
suffi- ciently wide use already that we have implemented it.
Due to the com- plexity of the option format, we have
implemented it as a suboption space rather than a single
option. In general this option should not be configured by
the user - instead it should be used as part of an automatic
DNS update system.</p>

<p>option fqdn.no-client-update flag;</p>

<p>When the client sends this, if it is true, it means the
client will not attempt to update its A record. When sent by
the server to the client, it means that the client should
not update its own A record.</p>

<p>option fqdn.server-update flag;</p>

<p>When the client sends this to the server, it is
requesting that the server update its A record. When sent by
the server, it means that the server has updated (or is
about to update) the clients A record.</p>

<p>option fqdn.encoded flag;</p>

<p>If true, this indicates that the domain name included in
the option is encoded in DNS wire format, rather than as
plain ASCII text. The client normally sets this to false if
it doesnt support DNS wire format in the FQDN option. The
server should always send back the same value that the
client sent. When this value is set on the configuration
side, it controls the format in which the fqdn.fqdn
suboption is encoded.</p>

<p>option fqdn.rcode1 flag;</p>

<p>option fqdn.rcode2 flag;</p>

<p>These options specify the result of the updates of the A
and PTR records, respectively, and are only sent by the DHCP
server to the DHCP client. The values of these fields are
those defined in the DNS protocol specification.</p>

<p>option fqdn.fqdn text;</p>

<p>Specifies the domain name that the client wishes to use.
This can be a fully-qualified domain name, or a single
label. If there is no trailing generally update that name in
some locally-defined domain.</p>

<p>option fqdn.hostname --never set--;</p>

<p>This option should never be set, but it can be read back
using the option and config-option operators in an
expression, in which case it returns the first label in the
fqdn.fqdn suboption - for example, if the value of fqdn.fqdn
is &quot;foo.example.com.&quot;, then fqdn.hostname will be
&quot;foo&quot;.</p>

<p>option fqdn.domainname --never set--;</p>

<p>This option should never be set, but it can be read back
using the option and config-option operators in an
expression, in which case it returns all labels after the
first label in the fqdn.fqdn subop- tion - for example, if
the value of fqdn.fqdn is &quot;foo.example.com.&quot;, then
fqdn.hostname will be &quot;example.com.&quot;. If this
suboption value is not set, it means that an unqualified
name was sent in the fqdn option, or that no fqdn option was
sent at all.</p>

<p>If you wish to use any of these suboptions, we strongly
recommend that you refer to the Client FQDN option draft (or
standard, when it becomes a standard) - the documentation
here is sketchy and incomplete in com- parison, and is just
intended for reference by people who already understand the
Client FQDN option specification.</p>

<p>THE NETWARE/IP SUBOPTIONS RFC2242 defines a set of
encapsulated options for Novell NetWare/IP clients. To use
these options in the dhcp server, specify the option space
name, &quot;nwip&quot;, followed by a period, followed by
the option name. The following options can be specified:</p>

<p>option nwip.nsq-broadcast flag;</p>

<p>If true, the client should use the NetWare Nearest
Server Query to locate a NetWare/IP server. The behaviour of
the Novell client if this suboption is false, or is not
present, is not specified.</p>

<p>option nwip.preferred-dss ip-address [, ip-address...
];</p>

<p>This suboption specifies a list of up to five IP
addresses, each of which should be the IP address of a
NetWare Domain SAP/RIP server (DSS).</p>

<p>option nwip.nearest-nwip-server ip-address [,
ip-address...];</p>

<p>This suboption specifies a list of up to five IP
addresses, each of which should be the IP address of a
Nearest NetWare IP server.</p>

<p>option nwip.autoretries uint8;</p>

<p>Specifies the number of times that a NetWare/IP client
should attempt to communicate with a given DSS server at
startup.</p>

<p>option nwip.autoretry-secs uint8;</p>

<p>Specifies the number of seconds that a Netware/IP client
should wait between retries when attempting to establish
communications with a DSS server at startup.</p>

<p>option nwip.nwip-1-1 uint8;</p>

<p>If true, the NetWare/IP client should support NetWare/IP
version 1.1 compatibility. This is only needed if the client
will be contact- ing Netware/IP version 1.1 servers.</p>

<p>option nwip.primary-dss ip-address;</p>

<p>Specifies the IP address of the Primary Domain SAP/RIP
Service server (DSS) for this NetWare/IP domain. The
NetWare/IP adminis- tration utility uses this value as
Primary DSS server when configur- ing a secondary DSS
server.</p>

<p>DEFINING NEW OPTIONS The Internet Systems Consortium
DHCP client and server provide the capability to define new
options. Each DHCP option has a name, a code, and a
structure. The name is used by you to refer to the option.
The code is a number, used by the DHCP server and client to
refer to an option. The structure describes what the
contents of an option looks like.</p>

<p>To define a new option, you need to choose a name for it
that is not in use for some other option - for example, you
cant use &quot;host-name&quot; because the DHCP protocol
already defines a host-name option, which is documented
earlier in this manual page. If an option name doesnt appear
in this manual page, you can use it, but its probably a good
idea to put some kind of unique string at the beginning so
you can be sure that future options don t take your name.
For example, you might define an option,
&quot;local-host-name&quot;, feeling some confidence that no
official DHCP option name will ever start with
&quot;local&quot;.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen a name, you must choose a code. For
site-local options, all codes between 128 and 254 are
reserved for DHCP options, so you can pick any one of these.
In practice, some vendors have interpreted the protocol
rather loosely and have used option code val- ues greater
than 128 themselves. Theres no real way to avoid this
problem, but its not likely to cause too much trouble in
practice.</p>

<p>The structure of an option is simply the format in which
the option data appears. The ISC DHCP server currently
supports a few simple types, like integers, booleans,
strings and IP addresses, and it also supports the ability
to define arrays of single types or arrays of fixed
sequences of types.</p>

<p>New options are declared as follows:</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = definition ;</p>

<p>The values of new-name and new-code should be the name
you have chosen for the new option and the code you have
chosen. The definition should be the definition of the
structure of the option.</p>

<p>The following simple option type definitions are
supported:</p>

<p>BOOLEAN</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = boolean ;</p>

<p>An option of type boolean is a flag with a value of
either on or off (or true or false). So an example use of
the boolean type would be:</p>

<p>option use-zephyr code 180 = boolean; option use-zephyr
on;</p>

<p>INTEGER</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = sign integer width ;</p>

<p>The sign token should either be blank, unsigned or
signed. The width can be either 8, 16 or 32, and refers to
the number of bits in the integer. So for example, the
following two lines show a definition of the
sql-connection-max option and its use:</p>

<p>option sql-connection-max code 192 = unsigned integer
16; option sql-connection-max 1536;</p>

<p>IP-ADDRESS</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = ip-address ;</p>

<p>An option whose structure is an IP address can be
expressed either as a domain name or as a dotted quad. So
the following is an example use of the ip-address type:</p>

<p>option sql-server-address code 193 = ip-address; option
sql-server-address sql.example.com;</p>

<p>TEXT</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = text ;</p>

<p>An option whose type is text will encode an ASCII text
string. For example:</p>

<p>option sql-default-connection-name code 194 = text;
option sql-default-connection-name &quot;PRODZA&quot;;</p>

<p>DATA STRING</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = string ;</p>

<p>An option whose type is a data string is essentially
just a collection of bytes, and can be specified either as
quoted text, like the text type, or as a list of hexadecimal
contents separated by colons whose values must be between 0
and FF. For example:</p>

<p>option sql-identification-token code 195 = string;
option sql-identification-token
17:23:19:a6:42:ea:99:7c:22;</p>

<p>ENCAPSULATION</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = encapsulate identifier
;</p>

<p>An option whose type is encapsulate will encapsulate the
contents of the option space specified in identifier.
Examples of encapsulated options in the DHCP protocol as it
currently exists include the vendor- encapsulated-options
option, the netware-suboptions option and the
relay-agent-information option.</p>

<p>option space local; option local.demo code 1 = text;
option local-encapsulation code 197 = encapsulate local;
option local.demo &quot;demo&quot;;</p>

<p>ARRAYS</p>

<p>Options can contain arrays of any of the above types
except for the text and data string types, which aren t
currently supported in arrays. An example of an array
definition is as follows:</p>

<p>option kerberos-servers code 200 = array of ip-address;
option kerberos-servers 10.20.10.1, 10.20.11.1;</p>

<p>RECORDS</p>

<p>Options can also contain data structures consisting of a
sequence of data types, which is sometimes called a record
type. For example:</p>

<p>option contrived-001 code 201 = { boolean, integer 32,
text }; option contrived-001 on 1772
&quot;contrivance&quot;;</p>

<p>It s also possible to have options that are arrays of
records, for example:</p>

<p>option new-static-routes code 201 = array of {
ip-address, ip-address, ip-address, integer 8 }; option
static-routes 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 net-0-rtr.example.com
1, 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 net-1-rtr.example.com 1, 10.2.0.0
255.255.224.0 net-2-0-rtr.example.com 3;</p>

<p>VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS The DHCP protocol defines
the vendor-encapsulated-options option, which allows vendors
to define their own options that will be sent encapsulated
in a standard DHCP option. The format of the vendor-
encapsulated-options option is either a series of bytes
whose format is not specified, or a sequence of options,
each of which consists of a single-byte vendor-specific
option code, followed by a single-byte length, followed by
as many bytes of data as are specified in the length (the
length does not include itself or the option code).</p>

<p>The value of this option can be set in one of two ways.
The first way is to simply specify the data directly, using
a text string or a colon- separated list of hexadecimal
values. For example:</p>

<p>option vendor-encapsulated-options 2:4:AC:11:41:1:
3:12:73:75:6e:64:68:63:70:2d:73:65:72:76:65:72:31:37:2d:31:
4:12:2f:65:78:70:6f:72:74:2f:72:6f:6f:74:2f:69:38:36:70:63;</p>

<p>The second way of setting the value of this option is to
have the DHCP server generate a vendor-specific option
buffer. To do this, you must do four things: define an
option space, define some options in that option space,
provide values for them, and specify that that option space
should be used to generate the vendor-encapsulated-options
option.</p>

<p>To define a new option space in which vendor options can
be stored, use the option space statement:</p>

<p>option space name ;</p>

<p>The name can then be used in option definitions, as
described earlier in this document. For example:</p>

<p>option space SUNW; option SUNW.server-address code 2 =
ip-address; option SUNW.server-name code 3 = text; option
SUNW.root-path code 4 = text;</p>

<p>Once you have defined an option space and the format of
some options, you can set up scopes that define values for
those options, and you can say when to use them. For
example, suppose you want to handle two different classes of
clients. Using the option space definition shown in the
previous example, you can send different option values to
dif- ferent clients based on the vendor-class-identifier
option that the clients send, as follows:</p>

<p>class &quot;vendor-classes&quot; { match option
vendor-class-identifier; }</p>

<p>option SUNW.server-address 172.17.65.1; option
SUNW.server-name &quot;sundhcp-server17-1&quot;;</p>

<p>subclass &quot;vendor-classes&quot;
&quot;SUNW.Ultra-5_10&quot; { vendor-option-space SUNW;
option SUNW.root-path &quot;/export/root/sparc&quot;; }</p>

<p>subclass &quot;vendor-classes&quot;
&quot;SUNW.i86pc&quot; { vendor-option-space SUNW; option
SUNW.root-path &quot;/export/root/i86pc&quot;; }</p>

<p>As you can see in the preceding example, regular scoping
rules apply, so you can define values that are global in the
global scope, and only define values that are specific to a
particular class in the local scope. The vendor-option-space
declaration tells the DHCP server to use options in the SUNW
option space to construct the vendor-encapsu- lated-options
option.</p>
