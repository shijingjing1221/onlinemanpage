<p>PWMCONFIG(8) PWMCONFIG(8)</p>

<p>NAME pwmconfig - tests the PWM outputs of sensors and
configures fancontrol</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pwmconfig</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pwmconfig searches your sensors for pulse
width modulation (PWM) con- trols, and test each one to see
if it controls a fan on your mother- board. Note that many
motherboards do not have PWM circuitry installed, even if
your sensor chip supports PWM.</p>

<p>It attempts to briefly stop each fan using the PWM
controls. It then attempts to restore each fan to full speed
after testing. However, it is very important that you
physically verify that the fans have been returned to full
speed after the program has completed.</p>

<p>WARNING This program will stop your fans, one at a time,
for approximately 5 seconds each. This may cause your
processor temperature to rise. Ver- ify that all fans are
running at normal speed after this program has exited.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO lm_sensors-2.x</p>
