<p>PORTMAP(8) BSD System Manager s Manual PORTMAP(8)</p>

<p>NAME portmap - DARPA port to RPC program number
mapper</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS portmap [-d] [-l] [-v]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Portmap is a server that converts RPC
program numbers into DARPA protocol port numbers. It must be
running in order to make RPC calls.</p>

<p>When an RPC server is started, it will tell portmap what
port number it is listening to, and what RPC program numbers
it is prepared to serve. When a client wishes to make an RPC
call to a given program number, it will first contact
portmap on the server machine to determine the port number
where RPC packets should be sent.</p>

<p>Portmap must be started before any RPC servers are
invoked.</p>

<p>Normally portmap forks and dissociates itself from the
terminal like any other daemon. Portmap then logs errors
using syslog(3).</p>

<p>Option available:</p>

<p>-d (debug) prevents portmap from running as a daemon,
and causes errors and debugging information to be printed to
the standard error output.</p>

<p>-l (localhost only) causes portmap to only bind to the
loopback interface (i.e. INADDR_LOOPBACK).</p>

<p>-v (verbose) run portmap in verbose mode.</p>

<p>This portmap version is protected by the tcp_wrapper
library. You have to give the clients access to portmap if
they should be allowed to use it. To allow connects from
clients of the .bar.com domain you could use the following
line in /etc/hosts.allow:</p>

<p>portmap: .bar.com</p>

<p>You have to use the daemon name portmap for the daemon
name (even if the binary has a different name). For the
client names you can use the key- word ALL, IP addresses,
hostnames or domain names.</p>

<p>For further information please have a look at the
tcpd((8)), hosts_allow((5)) and hosts_access((5)) manual
pages.</p>

pmap_dump((8)), xinetd((8)) tcpd((8)) hosts_access((5))
hosts_options((5))</p>

<p>BUGS If portmap crashes, all rpc servers must be
restarted.</p>

<p>HISTORY The portmap command appeared in BSDBSD 4.3.</p>
