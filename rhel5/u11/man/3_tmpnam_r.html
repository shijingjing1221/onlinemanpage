<p>TMPNAM(3) Linux Programmer s Manual TMPNAM(3)</p>

<p>NAME tmpnam, tmpnam_r - create a name for a temporary
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *tmpnam(char *s);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tmpnam() function returns a pointer to a
string that is a valid filename, and such that a file with
this name did not exist at some point in time, so that naive
programmers may think it a suitable name for a temporary
file. If the argument s is NULL this name is generated in an
internal static buffer and may be overwritten by the next
call to tmpnam(). If s is not NULL, the name is copied to
the character array (of length at least L_tmpnam) pointed to
by s and the value s is returned in case of success.</p>

<p>The pathname that is created, has a directory prefix
P_tmpdir. (Both L_tmpnam and P_tmpdir are defined in
&lt;stdio.h&gt;, just like the TMP_MAX mentioned below.)</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The tmpnam() function returns a pointer to
a unique temporary filename, or NULL if a unique name cannot
be generated.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>NOTES The tmpnam() function generates a different string
each time it is called, up to TMP_MAX times. If it is called
more than TMP_MAX times, the behaviour is implementation
defined.</p>

<p>Although tmpnam(3) generates names that are difficult to
guess, it is nevertheless possible that between the time
that tmpnam(3) returns a pathname, and the time that the
program opens it, another program might create that pathname
using open(2), or create it as a symbolic link. This can
lead to security holes. To avoid such possibilities, use the
open(2) O_EXCL flag to open the pathname. Or better yet, use
mkstemp(3) or tmpfile(3).</p>

<p>Portable applications that use threads cannot call
tmpnam() with NULL parameter if either _POSIX_THREADS or
_POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS is defined.</p>

<p>A POSIX draft proposed to use a function tmpnam_r()
defined by</p>

<p>char *tmpnam_r(char *s) { return s ? tmpnam(s) : NULL;
}</p>

<p>apparently as a warning not to use NULL. A few systems
implement it. To get a glibc prototype for this function,
define _SVID_SOURCE or _BSD_SOURCE before including
&lt;stdio.h&gt;.</p>

<p>BUGS Never use this function. Use mkstemp(3) or
tmpfile(3) instead.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.</p>
