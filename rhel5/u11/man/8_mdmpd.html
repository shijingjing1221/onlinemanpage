<p>NAME mdmpd - daemon to monitor MD multipath devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mdmpd</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Enterprise storage requirements often
include the desire to have more than one way to talk to a
single disk drive so that in the event of some failure to
talk to a disk drive via one controller, the system can
automatically switch to another controller and keep going.
This is called multipath disk access. The linux kernel
implements multipath disk access via the software RAID stack
known as the md (Multiple Devices) driver. The kernel
portion of the md multipath driver only handles routing I/O
requests to the proper device and handling failures on the
active path. It does not try and find out if a path that has
previously failed might be working again. Thats what this
daemon does. Upon startup, the daemon will fork and place
itself in the back- ground. Then it reads the current state
of the md raid arrays, saves that state, and then waits for
the kernel to tell it something inter- esting has happened.
It then wakes up, checks to see if any paths on a multipath
device have failed, and if they have then it starts to poll
the failed path once every 15 seconds until it starts
working again. Once it starts working again, the daemon will
then add the path back into the multipath md device it was
originally part of as a new spare path.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None. This is a very simple program that only
does one thing.</p>

<p>FILES /proc/mdstat If you re using the /proc filesystem,
/proc/mdstat lists all active md devices with information
about them. mdmpd requires this to find arrays to monitor
paths on and to get notification of interesting events.</p>
