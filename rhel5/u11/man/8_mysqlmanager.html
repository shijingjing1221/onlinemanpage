MYSQLMANAGER(8)</p>

<p>NAME mysqlmanager - the MySQL Instance Manager</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysqlmanager [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Important MySQL Instance Manager is been
deprecated in MySQL 5.1 and is removed in MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>mysqlmanager is the MySQL Instance Manager (IM). This
program monitors and manages MySQL Database Server
instances. MySQL Instance Manager is available for Unix-like
operating systems, and also on Windows as of MySQL 5.0.13.
It runs as a daemon that listens on a TCP/IP port. On Unix,
it also listens on a Unix socket file.</p>

<p>MySQL Instance Manager is included in MySQL
distributions from version 5.0.3, and can be used in place
of the mysqld_safe script to start and stop one or more
instances of MySQL Server. Because Instance Manager can
manage multiple server instances, it can also be used in
place of the mysqld_multi script. Instance Manager offers
these capabilities:</p>

<p>&middot; Instance Manager can start and stop instances,
and report on the status of instances.</p>

<p>&middot; Server instances can be treated as guarded or
unguarded:</p>

<p>&middot; When Instance Manager starts, it starts each
guarded instance. If the instance crashes, Instance Manager
detects this and restarts it. When Instance Manager stops,
it stops the instance.</p>

<p>&middot; A nonguarded instance is not started when
Instance Manager starts or monitored by it. If the instance
crashes after being started, Instance Manager does not
restart it. When Instance Manager exits, it does not stop
the instance if it is running. Instances are guarded by
default. An instance can be designated as nonguarded by
including the nonguarded option in the configuration
file.</p>

<p>&middot; Instance Manager provides an interactive
interface for configuring instances, so that the need to
edit the configuration file manually is reduced or
eliminated.</p>

<p>&middot; Instance Manager provides remote instance
management. That is, it runs on the host where you want to
control MySQL Server instances, but you can connect to it
from a remote host to perform instance-management
operations.</p>

<p>The following sections describe MySQL Instance Manager
operation in more detail.</p>

<p>MYSQL INSTANCE MANAGER COMMAND OPTIONS Important MySQL
Instance Manager is been deprecated in MySQL 5.1 and is
removed in MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>The MySQL Instance Manager supports a number of command
options. For a brief listing, invoke mysqlmanager with the
--help option. Options may be given on the command line or
in the Instance Manager configuration file. On Windows, the
standard configuration file is my.ini in the directory where
Instance Manager is installed. On Unix, the standard file is
/etc/my.cnf. To specify a different configuration file,
start Instance Manager with the --defaults-file option.</p>

<p>mysqlmanager supports the following options. It also
reads option files and supports the options for processing
them described at Section 4.2.3.3.1, Command-Line Options
that Affect Option-File Handling.</p>

<p>&middot; --help, -?</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --angel-pid-file=file_name</p>

<p>The file in which the angel process records its process
ID when mysqlmanager runs in daemon mode (that is, when the
--run-as-service option is given). The default file name is
mysqlmanager.angel.pid.</p>

<p>If the --angel-pid-file option is not given, the default
angel PID file has the same name as the PID file except that
any PID file extension is replaced with an extension of
.angel.pid. (For example, mysqlmanager.pid becomes
mysqlmanager.angel.pid.)</p>

<p>This option was added in MySQL 5.0.23.</p>

<p>&middot; --bind-address=IP</p>

<p>The IP address to bind to.</p>

<p>&middot; --default-mysqld-path=path</p>

<p>The path name of the MySQL Server binary. This path name
is used for all server instance sections in the
configuration file for which no mysqld-path option is
present. The default value of this option is the compiled-in
path name, which depends on how the MySQL distribution was
configured. Example:
--default-mysqld-path=/usr/sbin/mysqld</p>

<p>&middot; --defaults-file=file_name</p>

<p>Read Instance Manager and MySQL Server settings from the
given file. All configuration changes made by the Instance
Manager will be written to this file. This must be the first
option on the command line if it is used, and the file must
exist.</p>

<p>If this option is not given, Instance Manager uses its
standard configuration file. On Windows, the standard file
is my.ini in the directory where Instance Manager is
installed. On Unix, the standard file is /etc/my.cnf.</p>

<p>&middot; --install</p>

<p>On Windows, install Instance Manager as a Windows
service. The service name is MySQL Manager. This option was
added in MySQL 5.0.11.</p>

<p>&middot; --log=file_name</p>

<p>The path to the Instance Manager log file. This option
has no effect unless the --run-as-service option is also
given. If the file name specified for the option is a
relative name, the log file is created under the directory
from which Instance Manager is started. To ensure that the
file is created in a specific directory, specify it as a
full path name.</p>

<p>If --run-as-service is given without --log, the log file
is mysqlmanager.log in the data directory.</p>

<p>If --run-as-service is not given, log messages go to the
standard output. To capture log output, you can redirect
Instance Manager output to a file:</p>

<p>mysqlmanager &gt; im.log</p>

<p>&middot; --monitoring-interval=seconds</p>

<p>The interval in seconds for monitoring server instances.
The default value is 20 seconds. Instance Manager tries to
connect to each monitored (guarded) instance using the
nonexisting MySQL_Instance_Manager user account to check
whether it is available/not hanging. If the result of the
connection attempt indicates that the instance is
unavailable, Instance Manager performs several attempts to
restart the instance.</p>

<p>Normally, the MySQL_Instance_Manager account does not
exist, so the connection attempts by Instance Manager cause
the monitored instance to produce messages in its general
query log similar to the following:</p>

<p>Access denied for user
&acute;MySQL_Instance_M&acute;@&acute;localhost&acute;
(using password: YES)</p>

<p>The nonguarded option in the appropriate server instance
section disables monitoring for a particular instance. If
the instance dies after being started, Instance Manager will
not restart it. Instance Manager tries to connect to a
nonguarded instance only when you request the
instance&acute;s status (for example, with the SHOW
INSTANCES status.</p>

<p>See the section called MYSQL SERVER INSTANCE STATUS
MONITORING, for more information.</p>

<p>&middot; --passwd, -P</p>

<p>Prepare an entry for the password file, print it to the
standard output, and exit. You can redirect the output from
Instance Manager to a file to save the entry in the file.
See also the section called INSTANCE MANAGER USER AND
PASSWORD MANAGEMENT . This</p>

<p>&middot; --password-file=file_name</p>

<p>The name of the file where the Instance Manager looks
for users and passwords. On Windows, the default is
mysqlmanager.passwd in the directory where Instance Manager
is installed. On Unix, the default file is
/etc/mysqlmanager.passwd. See also the section called
INSTANCE MANAGER USER AND PASSWORD MANAGEMENT.</p>

<p>&middot; --pid-file=file_name</p>

<p>The process ID file to use. On Windows, the default file
is mysqlmanager.pid in the directory where Instance Manager
is installed. On Unix, the default is mysqlmanager.pid in
the data directory.</p>

<p>&middot; --port=port_num</p>

<p>The port number to use when listening for TCP/IP
connections from clients. The default port number (assigned
by IANA) is 2273.</p>

<p>&middot; --print-defaults</p>

<p>Print the current defaults and exit. This must be the
first option on the command line if it is used.</p>

<p>&middot; --remove</p>

<p>On Windows, removes Instance Manager as a Windows
service. This assumes that Instance Manager has been run
with --install previously. This option was added in MySQL
5.0.11.</p>

<p>&middot; --run-as-service</p>

<p>On Unix, daemonize and start an angel process. The angel
process monitors Instance Manager and restarts it if it
crashes. (The angel process itself is simple and unlikely to
crash.)</p>

<p>&middot; --socket=path</p>

<p>On Unix, the socket file to use for incoming
connections. The default file is named
/tmp/mysqlmanager.sock. This option has no meaning on
Windows.</p>

<p>&middot; --standalone</p>

<p>This option is used on Windows to run Instance Manager
in standalone mode. You should specify it when you start
Instance Manager from the command line. This option was
added in MySQL 5.0.13.</p>

<p>&middot; --user=user_name</p>

<p>On Unix, the user name of the system account to use for
starting and running mysqlmanager. This option generates a
warning and has no effect unless you start mysqlmanager as
root (so that it can change its effective user ID), or as
the named user. It is recommended that you configure
mysqlmanager to run using the same account used to run the
mysqld server. (User in this context refers to a system
login account, not a MySQL user listed in the grant
tables.)</p>

<p>&middot; --version, -V</p>

<p>Display version information and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --wait-timeout=N</p>

<p>The number of seconds to wait for activity on an
incoming connection before closing it. The default is 28800
seconds (8 hours).</p>

<p>This option was added in MySQL 5.0.19. Before that, the
timeout is 30 seconds and cannot be changed.</p>

<p>MYSQL INSTANCE MANAGER CONFIGURATION FILES Important
MySQL Instance Manager is been deprecated in MySQL 5.1 and
is removed in MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>Instance Manager uses its standard configuration file
unless it is started with a --defaults-file option that
specifies a different file. On Windows, the standard file is
my.ini in the directory where Instance Manager is installed.
On Unix, the standard file is /etc/my.cnf. (Prior to MySQL
5.0.10, the MySQL Instance Manager read the same
configuration files as the MySQL Server, including
/etc/my.cnf, ~/.my.cnf, and so forth.)</p>

<p>Instance Manager reads options for itself from the
[manager] section of the configuration file, and options for
server instances from [mysqld] or [mysqldN] sections. The
[manager] section contains any of the options listed in the
section called MYSQL INSTANCE MANAGER COMMAND OPTIONS ,
except for those specified as having to be given as the
first option on the command line. Here is a sample [manager]
section:</p>

<p># MySQL Instance Manager options section [manager]
default-mysqld-path = /usr/local/mysql/libexec/mysqld
socket=/tmp/manager.sock pid-file=/tmp/manager.pid
password-file = /home/cps/.mysqlmanager.passwd
monitoring-interval = 2 port = 1999 bind-address =
192.168.1.5</p>

<p>Each [mysqld] or [mysqldN] instance section specifies
options given by Instance Manager to a server instance at
startup. These are mainly common MySQL Server options (see
Section 5.1.2, Server Command Options). In addition, a
[mysqldN] section can contain the options in the following
list, which are specific to Instance Manager. These options
are interpreted by Instance Manager itself; it does not pass
them to the server when it attempts to start that
server.</p>

<p>Warning The Instance Manager-specific options must not
be used in a [mysqld] section. If a server is started
without using Instance Manager, it will not recognize these
options and will fail to start properly.</p>

<p>&middot; mysqld-path = path</p>

<p>The path name of the mysqld server binary to use for the
server instance.</p>

<p>&middot; nonguarded</p>

<p>This option disables Instance Manager monitoring
functionality for the server instance. By default, an
instance is guarded: At Instance Manager start time, it
starts the instance. It also monitors the instance status
and attempts to restart it if it fails. At Instance Manager
exit time, it stops the instance. None of these things
happen for nonguarded instances.</p>

<p>&middot; shutdown-delay = seconds</p>

<p>The number of seconds Instance Manager should wait for
the server instance to shut down. The default value is 35
seconds. After the delay expires, Instance Manager assumes
that the instance is hanging and attempts to terminate it.
If you use InnoDB with large tables, you should increase
this value.</p>

<p>Here are some sample instance sections:</p>

<p>[mysqld1] mysqld-path=/usr/local/mysql/libexec/mysqld
socket=/tmp/mysql.sock port=3307 server_id=1
skip-stack-trace core-file skip-bdb log-bin log-error
log=mylog log-slow-queries [mysqld2] nonguarded port=3308
server_id=2 mysqld-path=
/home/cps/mysql/trees/mysql-5.0/sql/mysqld socket =
/tmp/mysql.sock5 pid-file = /tmp/hostname.pid5 datadir=
/home/cps/mysql_data/data_dir1
language=/home/cps/mysql/trees/mysql-5.0/sql/share/english
log-bin log=/tmp/fordel.log</p>

<p>STARTING THE MYSQL SERVER WITH MYSQL INSTANCE MANAGER
Important MySQL Instance Manager is been deprecated in MySQL
5.1 and is removed in MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>This section discusses how Instance Manager starts
server instances when it starts. However, before you start
Instance Manager, you should set up a password file for it.
Otherwise, you will not be able to connect to Instance
Manager to control it after it starts. For details about
creating Instance Manager accounts, see the section called
INSTANCE MANAGER USER AND PASSWORD MANAGEMENT.</p>

<p>On Unix, the mysqld MySQL database server normally is
started with the mysql.server script, which usually resides
in the /etc/init.d/ directory. In MySQL 5.0.3, this script
invokes mysqlmanager (the MySQL Instance Manager binary) to
start MySQL. (In prior versions of MySQL the mysqld_safe
script is used for this purpose.) Starting from MySQL 5.0.4,
the behavior of the startup script was changed again to
incorporate both setup schemes. In version 5.0.4, the
startup script uses the old scheme (invoking mysqld_safe) by
default, but one can set the use_mysqld_safe variable in the
script to 0 (zero) to use the MySQL Instance Manager to
start a server.</p>

<p>Starting with MySQL 5.0.19, you can use Instance Manager
if you modify the my.cnf configuration file by adding
use-manager to the [mysql.server] section:</p>

<p>[mysql.server] use-manager</p>

<p>When Instance Manager starts, it reads its configuration
file if it exists to find server instance sections and
prepare a list of instances. Instance sections have names of
the form [mysqld] or [mysqldN], where N is an unsigned
integer (for example, [mysqld1], [mysqld2], and so
forth).</p>

<p>After preparing the list of instances, Instance Manager
starts the guarded instances in the list. If there are no
instances, Instance Manager creates an instance named mysqld
and attempts to start it with default (compiled-in)
configuration values. This means that the Instance Manager
cannot find the mysqld program if it is not installed in the
default location. (Section 2.7, Installation Layouts,
describes default locations for components of MySQL
distributions.) If you have installed the MySQL server in a
nonstandard location, you should create the Instance Manager
configuration file.</p>

<p>Instance Manager also stops all guarded server instances
when it shuts down.</p>

<p>The permissible options for [mysqldN] server instance
sections are described in the section called MYSQL INSTANCE
MANAGER CONFIGURATION FILES. In these sections, you can use
a special mysqld-path=path-to-mysqld-binary option that is
recognized only by Instance Manager. Use this option to let
Instance Manager know where the mysqld binary resides. If
there are multiple instances, it may also be necessary to
set other options such as datadir and port, to ensure that
each instance has a different data directory and TCP/IP port
number. Section 5.6, Running Multiple MySQL Instances on One
Machine , discusses the configuration values that must
differ for each instance when you run multiple instance on
the same machine.</p>

<p>Warning The [mysqld] instance section, if it exists,
must not contain any Instance Manager-specific options.</p>

<p>The typical Unix startup/shutdown cycle for a MySQL
server with the MySQL Instance Manager enabled is as
follows:</p>

<p>1. The /etc/init.d/mysql script starts MySQL Instance
Manager.</p>

<p>2. Instance Manager starts the guarded server instances
and monitors them.</p>

<p>3. If a server instance fails, Instance Manager restarts
it.</p>

<p>4. If Instance Manager is shut down (for example, with
the /etc/init.d/mysql stop command), it shuts down all
server instances.</p>

<p>INSTANCE MANAGER USER AND PASSWORD MANAGEMENT Important
MySQL Instance Manager is been deprecated in MySQL 5.1 and
is removed in MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>The Instance Manager stores its user information in a
password file. On Windows, the default is
mysqlmanager.passwd in the directory where Instance Manager
is installed. On Unix, the default file is
/etc/mysqlmanager.passwd. To specify a different location
for the password file, use the --password-file option.</p>

<p>If the password file does not exist or contains no
password entries, you cannot connect to the Instance
Manager.</p>

<p>Note Any Instance Manager process that is running to
monitor server instances does not notice changes to the
password file. You must stop it and restart it after making
password entry changes.</p>

<p>Entries in the password file have the following format,
where the two fields are the account user name and encrypted
password, separated by a colon:</p>

<p>petr:*35110DC9B4D8140F5DE667E28C72DD2597B5C848</p>

<p>Instance Manager password encryption is the same as that
used by MySQL Server. It is a one-way operation; no means
are provided for decrypting encrypted passwords.</p>

<p>Instance Manager accounts differ somewhat from MySQL
Server accounts:</p>

<p>&middot; MySQL Server accounts are associated with a
host name, user name, and password (see Section 5.5.1, User
Names and Passwords).</p>

<p>&middot; Instance Manager accounts are associated with a
user name and password only.</p>

<p>This means that a client can connect to Instance Manager
with a given user name from any host. To limit connections
so that clients can connect only from the local host, start
Instance Manager with the --bind-address=127.0.0.1 option so
that it listens only to the local network interface. Remote
clients will not be able to connect. Local clients can
connect like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 2273</p>

<p>To generate a new entry, invoke Instance Manager with
the --passwd option and append the output to the
/etc/mysqlmanager.passwd file. Here is an example:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlmanager --passwd &gt;&gt;
/etc/mysqlmanager.passwd Creating record for new user. Enter
user name: mike Enter password: mikepass Re-type password:
mikepass</p>

<p>At the prompts, enter the user name and password for the
new Instance Manager user. You must enter the password
twice. It does not echo to the screen, so double entry
guards against entering a different password than you intend
(if the two passwords do not match, no entry is
generated).</p>

<p>The preceding command causes the following line to be
added to /etc/mysqlmanager.passwd:</p>

<p>mike:*BBF1F551DD9DD96A01E66EC7DDC073911BAD17BA</p>

<p>Use of the --password option fails if mysqlmanager is
invoked directly from an IBM 5250 terminal. To work around
this, use a command like the following from the command line
to generate the password entry:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql -B --skip-column-name -e &acute;SELECT
CONCAT(&quot;user_name&quot;,&quot;:&quot;,PASSWORD(&quot;pass_val&quot;));&acute;</p>

<p>The output from the command can be used an entry in the
/etc/mysqlmanager.passwd file.</p>

<p>MYSQL SERVER INSTANCE STATUS MONITORING Important MySQL
Instance Manager is been deprecated in MySQL 5.1 and is
removed in MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>To monitor the status of each guarded server instance,
the MySQL Instance Manager attempts to connect to the
instance at regular intervals using the
MySQL_Instance_Manager@localhost user account with a
password of check_connection.</p>

<p>You are not required to create this account for MySQL
Server; in fact, it is expected that it will not exist.
Instance Manager can tell that a server is operational if
the server accepts the connection attempt but refuses access
for the account by returning a login error. However, these
failed connection attempts are logged by the server to its
general query log (see Section 5.2.2, The General Query
Log).</p>

<p>Instance Manager also attempts a connection to
nonguarded server instances when you use the SHOW INSTANCES
or SHOW INSTANCE STATUS command. This is the only status
monitoring done for nonguarded instances.</p>

<p>Instance Manager knows if a server instance fails at
startup because it receives a status from the attempt. For
an instance that starts but later crashes, Instance Manager
receives a signal because it is the parent process of the
instance.</p>

<p>CONNECTING TO MYSQL INSTANCE MANAGER Important MySQL
Instance Manager is been deprecated in MySQL 5.1 and is
removed in MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>After you set up a password file for the MySQL Instance
Manager and Instance Manager is running, you can connect to
it. The MySQL client/server protocol is used to communicate
with the Instance Manager. For example, you can connect to
it using the standard mysql client program:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql --port=2273 --host=im.example.org
--user=mysql --password</p>

<p>Instance Manager supports the version of the MySQL
client/server protocol used by the client tools and
libraries distributed with MySQL 4.1 or later, so other
programs that use the MySQL C API also can connect to
it.</p>

<p>MYSQL INSTANCE MANAGER COMMANDS Important MySQL Instance
Manager is been deprecated in MySQL 5.1 and is removed in
MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>After you connect to MySQL Instance Manager, you can
issue commands. The following general principles apply to
Instance Manager command execution:</p>

<p>&middot; Commands that take an instance name fail if the
name is not a valid instance name.</p>

<p>&middot; Commands that take an instance name fail if the
instance does not exist.</p>

<p>&middot; Instance Manager maintains information about
instance configuration in an internal (in-memory) cache.
Initially, this information comes from the configuration
file if it exists, but some commands change the
configuration of an instance. Commands that modify the
configuration file fail if the file does not exist or is not
accessible to Instance Manager.</p>

<p>&middot; On Windows, the standard file is my.ini in the
directory where Instance Manager is installed. On Unix, the
standard configuration file is /etc/my.cnf. To specify a
different configuration file, start Instance Manager with
the --defaults-file option.</p>

<p>&middot; If a [mysqld] instance section exists in the
configuration file, it must not contain any Instance
Manager-specific options (see the section called MYSQL
INSTANCE MANAGER CONFIGURATION FILES). Therefore, you must
not add any of these options if you change the configuration
for an instance named mysqld.</p>

<p>The following list describes the commands that Instance
Manager accepts, with examples.</p>

<p>&middot; START INSTANCE instance_name</p>

<p>This command attempts to start an offline instance. The
command is asynchronous; it does not wait for the instance
to start.</p>

<p>mysql&gt; START INSTANCE mysqld4; Query OK, 0 rows
affected (0,00 sec)</p>

<p>&middot; STOP INSTANCE instance_name</p>

<p>This command attempts to stop an instance. The command
is synchronous; it waits for the instance to stop.</p>

<p>mysql&gt; STOP INSTANCE mysqld4; Query OK, 0 rows
affected (0,00 sec)</p>

<p>&middot; SHOW INSTANCES</p>

<p>Shows the names and status of all loaded instances.</p>

<p>mysql&gt; SHOW INSTANCES; +---------------+---------+ |
instance_name | status | +---------------+---------+ |
mysqld3 | offline | | mysqld4 | online | | mysqld2 | offline
| +---------------+---------+</p>

<p>&middot; SHOW INSTANCE STATUS instance_name</p>

<p>Shows status and version information for an
instance.</p>

<p>mysql&gt; SHOW INSTANCE STATUS mysqld3;
+---------------+--------+---------+ | instance_name |
status | version | +---------------+--------+---------+ |
mysqld3 | online | unknown |
+---------------+--------+---------+</p>

<p>&middot; SHOW INSTANCE OPTIONS instance_name</p>

<p>Shows the options used by an instance.</p>

<p>mysql&gt; SHOW INSTANCE OPTIONS mysqld3;
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| option_name | value |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| instance_name | mysqld3 | | mysqld-path |
/home/cps/mysql/trees/mysql-4.1/sql/mysqld | | port | 3309 |
| socket | /tmp/mysql.sock3 | | pid-file | hostname.pid3 | |
datadir | /home/cps/mysql_data/data_dir1/ | | language |
/home/cps/mysql/trees/mysql-4.1/sql/share/english |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------+</p>

<p>&middot; SHOW instance_name LOG FILES</p>

<p>The command lists all log files used by the instance.
The result set contains the path to the log file and the log
file size. If no log file path is specified in the instance
section of the configuration file (for example,
log=/var/mysql.log), the Instance Manager tries to guess its
placement. If Instance Manager is unable to guess the log
file placement you should specify the log file location
explicitly by using a log option in the appropriate instance
section of the configuration file.</p>

<p>mysql&gt; SHOW mysqld LOG FILES;
+-------------+------------------------------------+----------+
| Logfile | Path | Filesize |
+-------------+------------------------------------+----------+
| ERROR LOG | /home/cps/var/mysql/owlet.err | 9186 | |
GENERAL LOG | /home/cps/var/mysql/owlet.log | 471503 | |
SLOW LOG | /home/cps/var/mysql/owlet-slow.log | 4463 |
+-------------+------------------------------------+----------+</p>

<p>Log options are described in Section 5.1.2, Server
Command Options.</p>

<p>&middot; SHOW instance_name LOG {ERROR | SLOW | GENERAL}
size[,offset_from_end]</p>

<p>This command retrieves a portion of the specified log
file. Because most users are interested in the latest log
messages, the size parameter defines the number of bytes to
retrieve from the end of the log. To retrieve data from the
middle of the log file, specify the optional offset_from_end
parameter. The following example retrieves 21 bytes of data,
starting 23 bytes before the end of the log file and ending
2 bytes before the end:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; SHOW mysqld LOG GENERAL 21, 2;
+---------------------+ | Log | +---------------------+ |
using password: YES | +---------------------+</p>

<p>&middot; SET
instance_name.option_name[=option_value]</p>

<p>This command edits the specified instance&acute;s
configuration section to change or add instance options. The
option is added to the section is it is not already present.
Otherwise, the new setting replaces the existing one.</p>

<p>mysql&gt; SET mysqld2.port=3322; Query OK, 0 rows
affected (0.00 sec)</p>

<p>Changes made to the configuration file do not take
effect until the MySQL server is restarted. In addition,
these changes are not stored in the instance manager&acute;s
local cache of instance settings until a FLUSH INSTANCES
command is executed.</p>

<p>&middot; UNSET instance_name.option_name</p>

<p>This command removes an option from an instance&acute;s
configuration section.</p>

<p>mysql&gt; UNSET mysqld2.port; Query OK, 0 rows affected
(0.00 sec)</p>

<p>Changes made to the configuration file do not take
effect until the MySQL server is restarted. In addition,
these changes are not stored in the instance manager&acute;s
local cache of instance settings until a FLUSH INSTANCES
command is executed.</p>

<p>&middot; FLUSH INSTANCES</p>

<p>This command forces Instance Manager reread the
configuration file and to refresh internal structures. This
command should be performed after editing the configuration
file. The command does not restart instances.</p>

<p>mysql&gt; FLUSH INSTANCES; Query OK, 0 rows affected
(0.04 sec)</p>

<p>FLUSH INSTANCES is deprecated and will be removed in
MySQL 5.2.</p>
