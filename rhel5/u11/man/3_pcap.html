<p>DESCRIPTION The Packet Capture library provides a high
level interface to packet capture systems. All packets on
the network, even those destined for other hosts, are
accessible through this mechanism.</p>

<p>ROUTINES NOTE: errbuf in pcap_open_live(),
pcap_open_dead(), pcap_open_offline(), pcap_fopen_offline(),
pcap_setnonblock(), pcap_getnonblock(), pcap_findalldevs(),
pcap_lookupdev(), and pcap_lookupnet() is assumed to be able
to hold at least PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE chars.</p>

<p>pcap_open_live() is used to obtain a packet capture
descriptor to look at packets on the network. device is a
string that specifies the net- work device to open; on Linux
systems with 2.2 or later kernels, a device argument of
&quot;any&quot; or NULL can be used to capture packets from
all interfaces. snaplen specifies the maximum number of
bytes to cap- ture. If this value is less than the size of a
packet that is cap- tured, only the first snaplen bytes of
that packet will be captured and provided as packet data. A
value of 65535 should be sufficient, on most if not all
networks, to capture all the data available from the packet.
promisc specifies if the interface is to be put into
promiscu- ous mode. (Note that even if this parameter is
false, the interface could well be in promiscuous mode for
some other reason.) For now, this doesnt work on the
&quot;any&quot; device; if an argument of &quot;any&quot; or
NULL is supplied, the promisc flag is ignored. to_ms
specifies the read timeout in milliseconds. The read timeout
is used to arrange that the read not necessarily return
immediately when a packet is seen, but that it wait for some
amount of time to allow more packets to arrive and to read
multiple packets from the OS kernel in one operation. Not
all platforms support a read timeout; on platforms that
dont, the read timeout is ignored. A zero value for to_ms,
on platforms that support a read timeout, will cause a read
to wait forever to allow enough pack- ets to arrive, with no
timeout. errbuf is used to return error or warning text. It
will be set to error text when pcap_open_live() fails and
returns NULL. errbuf may also be set to warning text when
pcap_open_live() succeds; to detect this case the caller
should store a zero-length string in errbuf before calling
pcap_open_live() and dis- play the warning to the user if
errbuf is no longer a zero-length string.</p>

<p>pcap_open_dead() is used for creating a pcap_t structure
to use when calling the other functions in libpcap. It is
typically used when just using libpcap for compiling BPF
code.</p>

<p>pcap_open_offline() is called to open a savefile for
reading. fname specifies the name of the file to open. The
file has the same format as those used by tcpdump(8) and
tcpslice(8). The name &quot;-&quot; in a synonym for stdin.
Alternatively, you may call pcap_fopen_offline() to read
dumped data from an existing open stream fp. Note that on
Win- dows, that stream should be opened in binary mode.
errbuf is used to return error text and is only set when
pcap_open_offline() or pcap_fopen_offline() fails and
returns NULL.</p>

<p>pcap_dump_open() is called to open a savefile for
writing. The name &quot;-&quot; in a synonym for stdout.
NULL is returned on failure. p is a pcap struct as returned
by pcap_open_offline() or pcap_open_live(). fname specifies
the name of the file to open. Alternatively, you may call
pcap_dump_fopen() to write data to an existing open stream
fp. Note that on Windows, that stream should be opened in
binary mode. If NULL is returned, pcap_geterr() can be used
to get the error text.</p>

<p>pcap_setnonblock() puts a capture descriptor, opened
with pcap_open_live(), into non-blocking mode, or takes it
out of non- blocking mode, depending on whether the nonblock
argument is non-zero or zero. It has no effect on savefiles.
If there is an error, -1 is returned and errbuf is filled in
with an appropriate error message; otherwise, 0 is returned.
In non-blocking mode, an attempt to read from the capture
descriptor with pcap_dispatch() will, if no packets are
currently available to be read, return 0 immediately rather
than blocking waiting for packets to arrive. pcap_loop() and
pcap_next() will not work in non-blocking mode.</p>

<p>pcap_getnonblock() returns the current non-blocking
state of the capture descriptor; it always returns 0 on
savefiles. If there is an error, -1 is returned and errbuf
is filled in with an appropriate error message.</p>

<p>pcap_findalldevs() constructs a list of network devices
that can be opened with pcap_open_live(). (Note that there
may be network devices that cannot be opened with
pcap_open_live() by the process calling pcap_findalldevs(),
because, for example, that process might not have sufficient
privileges to open them for capturing; if so, those devices
will not appear on the list.) alldevsp is set to point to
the first element of the list; each element of the list is
of type pcap_if_t, and has the following members:</p>

<p>next if not NULL, a pointer to the next element in the
list; NULL for the last element of the list</p>

<p>name a pointer to a string giving a name for the device
to pass to pcap_open_live()</p>

<p>description if not NULL, a pointer to a string giving a
human-read- able description of the device</p>

<p>addresses a pointer to the first element of a list of
addresses for the interface</p>

<p>flags interface flags:</p>

<p>PCAP_IF_LOOPBACK set if the interface is a loopback
interface</p>

<p>Each element of the list of addresses is of type
pcap_addr_t, and has the following members:</p>

<p>next if not NULL, a pointer to the next element in the
list; NULL for the last element of the list</p>

<p>addr a pointer to a struct sockaddr containing an
address</p>

<p>netmask if not NULL, a pointer to a struct sockaddr that
contains the netmask corresponding to the address pointed to
by addr</p>

<p>broadaddr if not NULL, a pointer to a struct sockaddr
that contains the broadcast address corresponding to the
address pointed to by addr; may be null if the interface
doesnt support broadcasts</p>

<p>dstaddr if not NULL, a pointer to a struct sockaddr that
contains the destination address corresponding to the
address pointed to by addr; may be null if the interface
isnt a point-to-point interface</p>

<p>Note that not all the addresses in the list of addresses
are necessar- ily IPv4 or IPv6 addresses - you must check
the sa_family member of the struct sockaddr before
interpreting the contents of the address.</p>

<p>-1 is returned on failure, in which case errbuf is
filled in with an appropriate error message; 0 is returned
on success.</p>

<p>pcap_freealldevs() is used to free a list allocated by
pcap_find- alldevs().</p>

<p>pcap_lookupdev() returns a pointer to a network device
suitable for use with pcap_open_live() and pcap_lookupnet().
If there is an error, NULL is returned and errbuf is filled
in with an appropriate error message.</p>

<p>pcap_lookupnet() is used to determine the network number
and mask asso- ciated with the network device device. Both
netp and maskp are bpf_u_int32 pointers. A return of -1
indicates an error in which case errbuf is filled in with an
appropriate error message.</p>

<p>pcap_dispatch() is used to collect and process packets.
cnt specifies the maximum number of packets to process
before returning. This is not a minimum number; when reading
a live capture, only one bufferful of packets is read at a
time, so fewer than cnt packets may be processed. A cnt of
-1 processes all the packets received in one buffer when
read- ing a live capture, or all the packets in the file
when reading a savefile . callback specifies a routine to be
called with three arguments: a u_char pointer which is
passed in from pcap_dispatch(), a const struct pcap_pkthdr
pointer to a structure with the following mem- bers:</p>

<p>ts a struct timeval containing the time when the packet
was captured</p>

<p>caplen a bpf_u_int32 giving the number of bytes of the
packet that are available from the capture</p>

<p>len a bpf_u_int32 giving the length of the packet, in
bytes (which might be more than the number of bytes
available from the capture, if the length of the packet is
larger than the maximum number of bytes to capture)</p>

<p>and a const u_char pointer to the first caplen (as given
in the struct pcap_pkthdr a pointer to which is passed to
the callback routine) bytes of data from the packet (which
won t necessarily be the entire packet; to capture the
entire packet, you will have to provide a value for snaplen
in your call to pcap_open_live() that is sufficiently large
to get all of the packets data - a value of 65535 should be
sufficient on most if not all networks).</p>

<p>The number of packets read is returned. 0 is returned if
no packets were read from a live capture (if, for example,
they were discarded because they didnt pass the packet
filter, or if, on platforms that support a read timeout that
starts before any packets arrive, the timeout expires before
any packets arrive, or if the file descriptor for the
capture device is in non-blocking mode and no packets were
available to be read) or if no more packets are available in
a save- file. A return of -1 indicates an error in which
case pcap_perror() or pcap_geterr() may be used to display
the error text. A return of -2 indicates that the loop
terminated due to a call to pcap_breakloop() before any
packets were processed. If your application uses
pcap_breakloop(), make sure that you explicitly check for -1
and -2, rather than just checking for a return value &lt;
0.</p>

<p>NOTE: when reading a live capture, pcap_dispatch() will
not necessarily return when the read times out; on some
platforms, the read timeout isnt supported, and, on other
platforms, the timer doesn t start until at least one packet
arrives. This means that the read timeout should NOT be used
in, for example, an interactive application, to allow the
packet capture loop to poll for user input periodically, as
theres no guarantee that pcap_dispatch() will return after
the timeout expires.</p>

<p>pcap_loop() is similar to pcap_dispatch() except it
keeps reading pack- ets until cnt packets are processed or
an error occurs. It does not return when live read timeouts
occur. Rather, specifying a non-zero read timeout to
pcap_open_live() and then calling pcap_dispatch() allows the
reception and processing of any packets that arrive when the
timeout occurs. A negative cnt causes pcap_loop() to loop
forever (or at least until an error occurs). -1 is returned
on an error; 0 is returned if cnt is exhausted; -2 is
returned if the loop terminated due to a call to
pcap_breakloop() before any packets were processed. If your
application uses pcap_breakloop(), make sure that you
explicitly check for -1 and -2, rather than just checking
for a return value &lt; 0.</p>

<p>pcap_next() reads the next packet (by calling
pcap_dispatch() with a cnt of 1) and returns a u_char
pointer to the data in that packet. (The pcap_pkthdr struct
for that packet is not supplied.) NULL is returned if an
error occured, or if no packets were read from a live
capture (if, for example, they were discarded because they
didnt pass the packet filter, or if, on platforms that
support a read timeout that starts before any packets
arrive, the timeout expires before any pack- ets arrive, or
if the file descriptor for the capture device is in non-
blocking mode and no packets were available to be read), or
if no more packets are available in a savefile.
Unfortunately, there is no way to determine whether an error
occured or not.</p>

<p>pcap_next_ex() reads the next packet and returns a
success/failure indication:</p>

<p>1 the packet was read without problems</p>

<p>0 packets are being read from a live capture, and the
time- out expired</p>

<p>-1 an error occurred while reading the packet</p>

<p>-2 packets are being read from a savefile, and there are
no more packets to read from the savefile.</p>

<p>If the packet was read without problems, the pointer
pointed to by the pkt_header argument is set to point to the
pcap_pkthdr struct for the packet, and the pointer pointed
to by the pkt_data argument is set to point to the data in
the packet.</p>

<p>pcap_breakloop() sets a flag that will force
pcap_dispatch() or pcap_loop() to return rather than
looping; they will return the number of packets that have
been processed so far, or -2 if no packets have been
processed so far.</p>

<p>This routine is safe to use inside a signal handler on
UNIX or a con- sole control handler on Windows, as it merely
sets a flag that is checked within the loop.</p>

<p>The flag is checked in loops reading packets from the OS
- a signal by itself will not necessarily terminate those
loops - as well as in loops processing a set of packets
returned by the OS. Note that if you are catching signals on
UNIX systems that support restarting system calls after a
signal, and calling pcap_breakloop() in the signal handler,
you must specify, when catching those signals, that system
calls should NOT be restarted by that signal. Otherwise, if
the signal interrupted a call reading packets in a live
capture, when your signal handler returns after calling
pcap_breakloop(), the call will be restarted, and the loop
will not terminate until more packets arrive and the call
com- pletes.</p>

<p>Note also that, in a multi-threaded application, if one
thread is blocked in pcap_dispatch(), pcap_loop(),
pcap_next(), or pcap_next_ex(), a call to pcap_breakloop()
in a different thread will not unblock that thread; you will
need to use whatever mechanism the OS provides for breaking
a thread out of blocking calls in order to unblock the
thread, such as thread cancellation in systems that support
POSIX threads.</p>

<p>Note that pcap_next() will, on some platforms, loop
reading packets from the OS; that loop will not necessarily
be terminated by a signal, so pcap_breakloop() should be
used to terminate packet processing even if pcap_next() is
being used.</p>

<p>pcap_breakloop() does not guarantee that no further
packets will be processed by pcap_dispatch() or pcap_loop()
after it is called; at most one more packet might be
processed.</p>

<p>If -2 is returned from pcap_dispatch() or pcap_loop(),
the flag is cleared, so a subsequent call will resume
reading packets. If a posi- tive number is returned, the
flag is not cleared, so a subsequent call will return -2 and
clear the flag.</p>

<p>pcap_inject() sends a raw packet through the network
interface; buf points to the data of the packet, including
the link-layer header, and size is the number of bytes in
the packet. It returns the number of bytes written on
success. A return of -1 indicates an error in which case
pcap_perror() or pcap_geterr() may be used to display the
error text. Note that, even if you successfully open the
network interface, you might not have permission to send
packets on it, or it might not support sending packets; as
pcap_open_live() doesnt have a flag to indicate whether to
open for capturing, sending, or capturing and send- ing, you
cannot request an open that supports sending and be notified
at open time whether sending will be possible. Note also
that some devices might not support sending packets.</p>

<p>Note that, on some platforms, the link-layer header of
the packet that s sent might not be the same as the
link-layer header of the packet supplied to pcap_inject(),
as the source link-layer address, if the header contains
such an address, might be changed to be the address assigned
to the interface on which the packet it sent, if the
platform doesn t support sending completely raw and
unchanged packets. Even worse, some drivers on some
platforms might change the link-layer type field to whatever
value libpcap used when attaching to the device, even on
platforms that do nominally support sending completely raw
and unchanged packets.</p>

<p>pcap_sendpacket() is like pcap_inject(), but it returns
0 on success and -1 on failure. (pcap_inject() comes from
OpenBSD; pcap_send- packet() comes from WinPcap. Both are
provided for compatibility.)</p>

<p>pcap_dump() outputs a packet to the savefile opened with
pcap_dump_open(). Note that its calling arguments are
suitable for use with pcap_dispatch() or pcap_loop(). If
called directly, the user parameter is of type pcap_dumper_t
as returned by pcap_dump_open().</p>

<p>pcap_compile() is used to compile the string str into a
filter program. program is a pointer to a bpf_program struct
and is filled in by pcap_compile(). optimize controls
whether optimization on the result- ing code is performed.
netmask specifies the IPv4 netmask of the net- work on which
packets are being captured; it is used only when checking
for IPv4 broadcast addresses in the filter program. If the
netmask of the network on which packets are being captured
isnt known to the pro- gram, or if packets are being
captured on the Linux &quot;any&quot; pseudo-inter- face
that can capture on more than one network, a value of 0 can
be supplied; tests for IPv4 broadcast addreses wont be done
correctly, but all other tests in the filter program will be
OK. A return of -1 indicates an error in which case
pcap_geterr() may be used to display the error text.</p>

<p>pcap_compile_nopcap() is similar to pcap_compile()
except that instead of passing a pcap structure, one passes
the snaplen and linktype explicitly. It is intended to be
used for compiling filters for direct BPF usage, without
necessarily having called pcap_open(). A return of -1
indicates an error; the error text is unavailable.
(pcap_com- pile_nopcap() is a wrapper around
pcap_open_dead(), pcap_compile(), and pcap_close(); the
latter three routines can be used directly in order to get
the error text for a compilation error.)</p>

<p>pcap_setfilter() is used to specify a filter program. fp
is a pointer to a bpf_program struct, usually the result of
a call to pcap_com- pile(). -1 is returned on failure, in
which case pcap_geterr() may be used to display the error
text; 0 is returned on success.</p>

<p>pcap_freecode() is used to free up allocated memory
pointed to by a bpf_program struct generated by
pcap_compile() when that BPF program is no longer needed,
for example after it has been made the filter program for a
pcap structure by a call to pcap_setfilter().</p>

<p>pcap_setdirection() is used to specify a direction that
packets will be captured. pcap_direction_t is one of the
constants PCAP_D_IN, PCAP_D_OUT or PCAP_D_INOUT. PCAP_D_IN
will only capture packets received by the device, PCAP_D_OUT
will only capture packets sent by the device and
PCAP_D_INOUT will capture packets received by or sent by the
device. PCAP_D_INOUT is the default setting if this function
is not called. This isnt necessarily supported on all
platforms; some platforms might return an error, and some
other platforms might not support PCAP_D_OUT. This operation
is not supported if a savefile is being read. -1 is returned
on failure, 0 is returned on success.</p>

<p>pcap_datalink() returns the link layer type; link layer
types it can return include:</p>

<p>DLT_NULL BSD loopback encapsulation; the link layer
header is a 4-byte field, in host byte order, containing a
PF_ value from socket.h for the network-layer protocol of
the packet.</p>

<p>Note that host byte order is the byte order of the
machine on which the packets are captured, and the PF_
values are for the OS of the machine on which the packets
are cap- tured; if a live capture is being done, host byte
order is the byte order of the machine capturing the
packets, and the PF_ values are those of the OS of the
machine capturing the packets, but if a savefile is being
read, the byte order and PF_ values are not necessarily
those of the machine reading the capture file.</p>

<p>pcap_list_datalinks() is used to get a list of the
supported data link types of the interface associated with
the pcap descriptor. pcap_list_datalinks() allocates an
array to hold the list and sets *dlt_buf. The caller is
responsible for freeing the array. -1 is returned on
failure; otherwise, the number of data link types in the
array is returned.</p>

<p>pcap_set_datalink() is used to set the current data link
type of the pcap descriptor to the type specified by dlt. -1
is returned on fail- ure.</p>

<p>pcap_datalink_name_to_val() translates a data link type
name, which is a DLT_ name with the DLT_ removed, to the
corresponding data link type value. The translation is
case-insensitive. -1 is returned on fail- ure.</p>

<p>pcap_datalink_val_to_name() translates a data link type
value to the corresponding data link type name. NULL is
returned on failure.</p>

<p>pcap_datalink_val_to_description() translates a data
link type value to a short description of that data link
type. NULL is returned on fail- ure.</p>

<p>pcap_snapshot() returns the snapshot length specified
when pcap_open_live() was called.</p>

<p>pcap_is_swapped() returns true if the current savefile
uses a dif- ferent byte order than the current system.</p>

<p>pcap_major_version() returns the major number of the
file format of the savefile; pcap_minor_version() returns
the minor number of the file format of the savefile. The
version number is stored in the header of the savefile.</p>

<p>pcap_file() returns the standard I/O stream of the
savefile, if a savefile was opened with pcap_open_offline(),
or NULL, if a network device was opened with
pcap_open_live().</p>

<p>pcap_stats() returns 0 and fills in a pcap_stat struct.
The values rep- resent packet statistics from the start of
the run to the time of the call. If there is an error or the
underlying packet capture doesnt support packet statistics,
-1 is returned and the error text can be obtained with
pcap_perror() or pcap_geterr(). pcap_stats() is sup- ported
only on live captures, not on savefiles ; no statistics are
stored in savefiles, so no statistics are available when
reading from a savefile.</p>

<p>pcap_fileno() returns the file descriptor number from
which captured packets are read, if a network device was
opened with pcap_open_live(), or -1, if a savefile was
opened with pcap_open_offline().</p>

<p>pcap_get_selectable_fd() returns, on UNIX, a file
descriptor number for a file descriptor on which one can do
a select() or poll() to wait for it to be possible to read
packets without blocking, if such a descrip- tor exists, or
-1, if no such descriptor exists. Some network devices
opened with pcap_open_live() do not support select() or
poll() (for example, regular network devices on FreeBSD 4.3
and 4.4, and Endace DAG devices), so -1 is returned for
those devices.</p>

<p>Note that on most versions of most BSDs (including Mac
OS X) select() and poll() do not work correctly on BPF
devices; pcap_get_selectable_fd() will return a file
descriptor on most of those versions (the exceptions being
FreeBSD 4.3 and 4.4), a simple select() or poll() will not
return even after a timeout specified in pcap_open_live()
expires. To work around this, an application that uses
select() or poll() to wait for packets to arrive must put
the pcap_t in non-blocking mode, and must arrange that the
select() or poll() have a timeout less than or equal to the
timeout specified in pcap_open_live(), and must try to read
packets after that timeout expires, regardless of whether
select() or poll() indicated that the file descriptor for
the pcap_t is ready to be read or not. (That workaround will
not work in FreeBSD 4.3 and later; however, in FreeBSD 4.6
and later, select() and poll() work correctly on BPF
devices, so the workaround isnt necessary, although it does
no harm.)</p>

<p>pcap_get_selectable_fd() is not available on
Windows.</p>

<p>pcap_perror() prints the text of the last pcap library
error on stderr, prefixed by prefix.</p>

<p>pcap_geterr() returns the error text pertaining to the
last pcap library error. NOTE: the pointer it returns will
no longer point to a valid error message string after the
pcap_t passed to it is closed; you must use or copy the
string before closing the pcap_t.</p>

<p>pcap_strerror() is provided in case strerror(1) isn t
available.</p>

<p>pcap_lib_version() returns a pointer to a string giving
information about the version of the libpcap library being
used; note that it con- tains more information than just a
version number.</p>

<p>pcap_close() closes the files associated with p and
deallocates resources.</p>

<p>pcap_dump_file() returns the standard I/O stream of the
savefile opened by pcap_dump_open().</p>

<p>pcap_dump_flush() flushes the output buffer to the
savefile, so that any packets written with pcap_dump() but
not yet written to the savefile will be written. -1 is
returned on error, 0 on success.</p>

<p>pcap_dump_ftell() returns the current file position for
the save- file , representing the number of bytes written by
pcap_dump_open() and pcap_dump(). -1 is returned on
error.</p>

<p>pcap_dump_close() closes the savefile.</p>
