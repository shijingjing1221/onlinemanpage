<p>NAME mkstemp - create a unique temporary file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mkstemp(char *template);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mkstemp() function generates a unique
temporary filename from tem- plate. The last six characters
of template must be XXXXXX and these are replaced with a
string that makes the filename unique. The file is then
created with mode read/write and permissions 0666 (glibc
2.0.6 and earlier), 0600 (glibc 2.0.7 and later). Since it
will be modified, template must not be a string constant,
but should be declared as a character array. The file is
opened with the open(2) O_EXCL flag, guaranteeing that when
mkstemp() returns successfully we are the only user.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, the mkstemp() function returns
the file descriptor of the temporary file. On error, -1 is
returned, and errno is set appropri- ately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EEXIST Could not create a unique temporary
filename. Now the contents of template are undefined.</p>

<p>EINVAL The last six characters of template were not
XXXXXX. Now tem- plate is unchanged.</p>

<p>NOTES The old behaviour (creating a file with mode 0666)
may be a security risk, especially since other Unix flavours
use 0600, and somebody might overlook this detail when
porting programs.</p>

<p>More generally, the POSIX specification does not say
anything about file modes, so the application should make
sure its umask is set appro- priately before calling
mkstemp().</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001</p>

<p>NOTE The prototype is in &lt;unistd.h&gt; for libc4,
libc5, glibc1; glibc2 follows the Single Unix Specification
and has the prototype in &lt;stdlib.h&gt;.</p>
