<p>NAME gnutls_ia_recv - read data from the TLS/IA
protocol</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/extra.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t gnutls_ia_recv(gnutls_session_t session, char *
data, size_t sizeofdata);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a gnutls_session_t
structure.</p>

<p>char * data the buffer that the data will be read into,
must hold &gt;= 12 bytes.</p>

<p>size_t sizeofdata the number of requested bytes, must be
&gt;= 12.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Receive TLS/IA data. This function has the
similar semantics with recv(). The only difference is that
is accepts a GNUTLS session, and uses different error
codes.</p>

<p>If the server attempt to finish an application phase,
this function will return GNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_IPHF_RECEIVED
or GNUTLS_E_WARN- ING_IA_FPHF_RECEIVED. The caller should
then invoke gnutls_ia_ver- ify_endphase(), and if it runs
the client side, also send an endphase message of its own
using gnutls_ia_endphase_send.</p>

<p>If EINTR is returned by the internal push function (the
default is code{recv()}) then GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED will be
returned. If GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED or GNUTLS_E_AGAIN is
returned, you must call this function again, with the same
parameters; alternatively you could pro- vide a NULL pointer
for data, and 0 for size.</p>

<p>Returns the number of bytes received. A negative error
code is returned in case of an error. The
GNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_IPHF_RECEIVED and
GNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_FPHF_RECEIVED errors are returned when
an application phase finished message has been sent by the
server.</p>
