<p>NAME dvipdfm - Produce PDF files directly from DVI
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dvipdfm [options] file[.dvi]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The program dvipdfm generates a PDF file
from a DVI file. DVI files are the output format produced by
TeX. Output from groff can be con- verted to DVI format
using grodvi.</p>

<p>The program dvipdfm recognizes several commonly
usedpecial commands, which are extensions to the DVI format.
Specifically, it understands color specials, papersize
specials, tpic specials (which allow it to be used with
pic), hypertex specials, and some PostScript specials. These
extensions allow documents to contain color, figures, and
hyperlinks. The program tries to mimic the behavior of dvips
so that many macro packages produced for use with dvips will
work with dvipdfm. Dvipdfm understands its own specific
pecial commands to allow access to PDF features such as
annotations and bookmarks. For more details, consult the
Dvipdfm User_s Manual, which is distributed with
dvipdfm.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Ignore colorpecials. The -c toggles a flag
that disables color pecial processing. Unless changed in the
configuration file, that flag is off, and colorpecials are
interpreted normally. The -c option may be used to produce a
black and white document from a document containing color
TeXpecial commands.</p>

<p>-d Remove thumbnail images after including them. (See
the -t option for more information.)</p>

<p>-e Toggle partial font embedding flag. If partial font
embedding is off, embedded fonts are fully embedded. The
default, if not changed in the configuration file, is to
embed only those glyphs actually used in the document.</p>

<p>-f map_file Set the name of the font map file to
map_file. The format of the font map file is documented in
the Dvipdfm User_s Manual.</p>

<p>-l Select landscape mode. In other words, exchange the x
and y dimensions of the paper.</p>

<p>-m mag Magnify the input document by mag.</p>

<p>-o name Generate PDF output file having the name name.
By default, the name of the output file is file.pdf.</p>

<p>-p paper Select the papersize by name (e.g., letter,
legal, ledger, tabloid, a3, a4, or a5 )</p>

<p>-r size Set resolution of bitmapped fonts to size dots
per inch. Bitmapped fonts are generated by the Kpathsea
library, which uses MetaFont. Bitmapped fonts are included
as type 3 fonts in the PDF output file.</p>

<p>-s page_specifications Select the pages of the DVI file
to be converted. The page_speci- fications consists of a
comma separated list of page_ranges:</p>

<p>page_specifications :=
page_specification[,page_specifications]</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>page_specification := single_page|page_range</p>

<p>page_range := [first_page]-[last_page]</p>

<p>An empty first_page is implied to be the first page of
the DVI file. An empty last_page is treated as the last page
of the DVI file.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>-s 1,3,5 includes pages 1, 3, and 5;</p>

<p>-s - includes all pages;</p>

<p>-s -,- includes two copies of all pages in the DVI file;
and</p>

<p>-s 1-10 includes the first ten pages of the DVI
file.</p>

<p>-t Search for thumbnail images of each page in the
directory named by the TMP environment variable. The
thumbnail images must be named in a specific format. They
must have the same base name as the DVI file and they must
have the page number as the extension to the file name.
Dvipdfm does not generate the thumbnails itself, but it is
distributed with a wrapper program named dvipdft that does
so.</p>

<p>-v Increase verbosity. Results of the -v option are
cumulative (e.g., -vv ) increases the verbosity by two
increments.</p>

<p>-x x_offset Set the left margin to x_offset. The default
left margin is 1.0in. The dimension may be specified in any
units understood by TeX (e.g., bpt, pt, in, cm )</p>

<p>-y y_offset Set the top margin to y_offset. The default
top margin is 1.0in. The dimension may be specified in any
units understood by TeX (e.g., bpt, pt, in, cm )</p>

<p>-z compression_level Set the compression level to
compression_level. Compressions lev- els range from 0 (no
compression) to 9 (maximum compression) and correspond to
the values understood by zlib.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Dvipdfm uses the kpathsea library for
locating the files that it opens. Hence, the environment
variables documented in the Kpathsea library documentation
influence dvipdfm.</p>

<p>Dvipdfm also reads the following environment
variables:</p>

<p>TMP The directory to search for thumbnail images of each
page.</p>

<p>FILES The precise location of the following files is
determined by the Kpath- sea library configuration. The
location may be determined by using kpsewhich, e.g.,
kpsewhich -progname=dvipdfm -formatother text
filesconfig</p>

<p>config Startup options</p>

<p>t1fonts.map The default font map file (this name may be
changed in the config file).</p>

<p>*.tfm TeX font metrics</p>

<p>*.vf TeX virtual font files</p>

<p>*.pfb PostScript Type 1 font files</p>

<p>texmf.cnf The Kpathsea library configuration file. The
location of this file may be found by typing kpsewhich
texmf.cnf</p>
