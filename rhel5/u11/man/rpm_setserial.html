<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) SETSERIAL(8)
SETSERIAL(8)</p>

<p>NAME setserial - get/set Linux serial port
information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS setserial [ -abqvVWz ] device [ parameter1 [
arg ] ] ...</p>

<p>setserial -g [ -abGv ] device1 ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION setserial is a program designed to set
and/or report the configuration information associated with
a serial port. This information includes what I/O port and
IRQ a particular serial port is using, and whether or not
the break key should be interpreted as the Secure Attention
Key, and so on.</p>

<p>During the normal bootup process, only COM ports 1-4 are
initialized, using the default I/O ports and IRQ values, as
listed below. In order to initialize any additional serial
ports, or to change the COM 1-4 ports to a nonstadard
configuration, the setserial program should be used.
Typically it is called from an rc.serial script, which is
usu- ally run out of /etc/rc.local.</p>

<p>The device argument or arguments specifies the serial
device which should be configured or interrogated. It will
usually have the follow- ing form: /dev/cua[0-3].</p>

<p>If no parameters are specified, setserial will print out
the port type (i.e., 8250, 16450, 16550, 16550A, etc.), the
hardware I/O port, the hardware IRQ line, its &quot;baud
base,&quot; and some of its operational flags.</p>

<p>If the -g option is given, the arguments to setserial
are interpreted as a list of devices for which the
characteristics of those devices should be printed.</p>

<p>Without the -g option, the first argument to setserial
is interpreted as the device to be modified or
characteristics to be printed, and any additional arguments
are interpreted as parameters which should be assigned to
that serial device.</p>

<p>For the most part, superuser privilege is required to
set the configu- ration parameters of a serial port. A few
serial port parameters can be set by normal users, however,
and these will be noted as exceptions in this manual
page.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Setserial accepts the following options:</p>

<p>-a When reporting the configuration of a serial device,
print all available information.</p>

<p>-b When reporting the configuration of a serial device,
print a summary of the devices configuration, which might be
suitable for printing during the bootup process, during the
/etc/rc script.</p>

<p>-G Print out the configuration information of the serial
port in a form which can be fed back to setserial as
command-line argu- ments.</p>

<p>-q Be quiet. Setserial will print fewer lines of
output.</p>

<p>-v Be verbose. Setserial will print additional status
output.</p>

<p>-V Display version and exit.</p>

<p>-W Do wild interrupt initialization and exit. This
option is no longer relevant in Linux kernels after version
2.1.</p>

<p>-z Zero out the serial flags before starting to set
flags. This is related to the automatic saving of serial
flags using the -G flag.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS The following parameters can be assigned to a
serial port.</p>

<p>All argument values are assumed to be in decimal unless
preceeded by &quot;0x&quot;.</p>

<p>port port_number The port option sets the I/O port, as
described above.</p>

<p>irq irq_number The irq option sets the hardware IRQ, as
described above.</p>

<p>uart uart_type This option is used to set the UART type.
The permitted types are none, 8250, 16450, 16550, 16550A,
16650, 16650V2, 16654, 16750, 16850, 16950, and 16954. Using
UART type none will dis- able the port.</p>

<p>Some internal modems are billed as having a &quot;16550A
UART with a 1k buffer&quot;. This is a lie. They do not have
really have a 16550A compatible UART; instead what they have
is a 16450 com- patible UART with a 1k receive buffer to
prevent receiver over- runs. This is important, because they
do not have a transmit FIFO. Hence, they are not compatible
with a 16550A UART, and the autoconfiguration process will
correctly identify them as 16450s. If you attempt to
override this using the uart parame- ter, you will see
dropped characters during file transmissions. These UART s
usually have other problems: the skip_test parame- ter also
often must be specified.</p>

<p>autoconfig When this parameter is given, setserial will
ask the kernel to attempt to automatically configure the
serial port. The I/O port must be correctly set; the kernel
will attempt to determine the UART type, and if the auto_irq
parameter is set, Linux will attempt to automatically
determine the IRQ. The autoconfig parameter should be given
after the port,auto_irq, and skip_test parameters have been
specified.</p>

<p>auto_irq During autoconfiguration, try to determine the
IRQ. This fea- ture is not guaranteed to always produce the
correct result; some hardware configurations will fool the
Linux kernel. It is generally safer not to use the auto_irq
feature, but rather to specify the IRQ to be used
explicitly, using the irq parameter.</p>

<p>^auto_irq During autoconfiguration, do not try to
determine the IRQ.</p>

<p>skip_test During autoconfiguration, skip the UART test.
Some internal modems do not have National Semiconductor
compatible UARTs, but have cheap imitations instead. Some of
these cheasy imitations UARTs do not fully support the
loopback detection mode, which is used by the kernel to make
sure there really is a UART at a particular address before
attempting to configure it. So for certain internal modems
you will need to specify this parameter so Linux can
initialize the UART correctly.</p>

<p>^skip_test During autoconfiguration, do not skip the
UART test.</p>

<p>baud_base baud_base This option sets the base baud rate,
which is the clock fre- quency divided by 16. Normally this
value is 115200, which is also the fastest baud rate which
the UART can support.</p>

<p>spd_hi Use 57.6kb when the application requests 38.4kb.
This parameter may be specified by a non-privileged
user.</p>

<p>spd_vhi Use 115kb when the application requests 38.4kb.
This parameter may be specified by a non-privileged
user.</p>

<p>spd_shi Use 230kb when the application requests 38.4kb.
This parameter may be specified by a non-privileged
user.</p>

<p>spd_warp Use 460kb when the application requests 38.4kb.
This parameter may be specified by a non-privileged
user.</p>

<p>spd_cust Use the custom divisor to set the speed when
the application requests 38.4kb. In this case, the baud rate
is the baud_base divided by the divisor. This parameter may
be specified by a non-privileged user.</p>

<p>spd_normal Use 38.4kb when the application requests
38.4kb. This parameter may be specified by a non-privileged
user.</p>

<p>divisor divisor This option sets the custom divison.
This divisor will be used then the spd_cust option is
selected and the serial port is set to 38.4kb by the
application. This parameter may be specified by a
non-privileged user.</p>

<p>sak Set the break key at the Secure Attention Key.</p>

<p>^sak disable the Secure Attention Key.</p>

<p>fourport Configure the port as an AST Fourport card.</p>

<p>^fourport Disable AST Fourport configuration.</p>

<p>close_delay delay Specify the amount of time, in
hundredths of a second, that DTR should remain low on a
serial line after the callout device is closed, before the
blocked dialin device raises DTR again. The default value of
this option is 50, or a half-second delay.</p>

<p>closing_wait delay Specify the amount of time, in
hundredths of a second, that the kernel should wait for data
to be transmitted from the serial port while closing the
port. If &quot;none&quot; is specified, no delay will occur.
If &quot;infinite&quot; is specified the kernel will wait
indefinitely for the buffered data to be transmitted. The
default setting is 3000 or 30 seconds of delay. This default
is generally appropriate for most devices. If too long a
delay is selected, then the serial port may hang for a long
time if when a serial port which is not connected, and has
data pending, is closed. If too short a delay is selected,
then there is a risk that some of the transmitted data is
output at all. If the device is extremely slow, like a
plotter, the closing_wait may need to be larger.</p>

<p>session_lockout Lock out callout port (/dev/cuaXX)
accesses across different sessions. That is, once a process
has opened a port, do not allow a process with a different
session ID to open that port until the first process has
closed it.</p>

<p>^session_lockout Do not lock out callout port accesses
across different sessions.</p>

<p>pgrp_lockout Lock out callout port (/dev/cuaXX) accesses
across different process groups. That is, once a process has
opened a port, do not allow a process in a different process
group to open that port until the first process has closed
it.</p>

<p>^pgrp_lockout Do not lock out callout port accesses
across different process groups.</p>

<p>hup_notify Notify a process blocked on opening a dial in
line when a pro- cess has finished using a callout line
(either by closing it or by the serial line being hung up)
by returning EAGAIN to the open.</p>

<p>The application of this parameter is for gettys which
are blocked on a serial port s dial in line. This allows the
getty to reset the modem (which may have had its
configuration modi- fied by the application using the
callout device) before block- ing on the open again.</p>

<p>^hup_notify Do not notify a process blocked on opening a
dial in line when the callout device is hung up.</p>

<p>split_termios Treat the termios settings used by the
callout device and the termios settings used by the dialin
devices as separate.</p>

<p>^split_termios Use the same termios structure to store
both the dialin and callout ports. This is the default
option.</p>

<p>callout_nohup If this particular serial port is opened
as a callout device, do not hangup the tty when carrier
detect is dropped.</p>

<p>^callout_nohup Do not skip hanging up the tty when a
serial port is opened as a callout device. Of course, the
HUPCL termios flag must be enabled if the hangup is to
occur.</p>

<p>low_latency Minimize the receive latency of the serial
device at the cost of greater CPU utilization. (Normally
there is an average of 5-10ms latency before characters are
handed off to the line dis- cpline to minimize overhead.)
This is off by default, but cer- tain real-time applications
may find this useful.</p>

<p>^low_latency Optimize for efficient CPU processing of
serial characters at the cost of paying an average of 5-10ms
of latency before the characters are processed. This is the
default.</p>

<p>CONSIDERATIONS OF CONFIGURING SERIAL PORTS It is
important to note that setserial merely tells the Linux
kernel where it should expect to find the I/O port and IRQ
lines of a particu- lar serial port. It does *not* configure
the hardware, the actual serial board, to use a particular
I/O port. In order to do that, you will need to physically
program the serial board, usually by setting some jumpers or
by switching some DIP switches.</p>

<p>This section will provide some pointers in helping you
decide how you would like to configure your serial
ports.</p>

<p>The &quot;standard MS-DOS&quot; port associations are
given below:</p>

<p>/dev/ttys0 (COM1), port 0x3f8, irq 4 /dev/ttys1 (COM2),
port 0x2f8, irq 3 /dev/ttys2 (COM3), port 0x3e8, irq 4
/dev/ttys3 (COM4), port 0x2e8, irq 3</p>

<p>Due to the limitations in the design of the AT/ISA bus
architecture, normally an IRQ line may not be shared between
two or more serial ports. If you attempt to do this, one or
both serial ports will become unreliable if you try to use
both simultaneously. This limitation can be overcome by
special multi-port serial port boards, which are designed to
share multiple serial ports over a single IRQ line. Multi-
port serial cards supported by Linux include the AST
FourPort, the Accent Async board, the Usenet Serial II
board, the Bocaboard BB-1004, BB-1008, and BB-2016 boards,
and the HUB-6 serial board.</p>

<p>The selection of an alternative IRQ line is difficult,
since most of them are already used. The following table
lists the &quot;standard MS-DOS&quot; assignments of
available IRQ lines:</p>

<p>IRQ 3: COM2 IRQ 4: COM1 IRQ 5: LPT2 IRQ 7: LPT1</p>

<p>Most people find that IRQ 5 is a good choice, assuming
that there is only one parallel port active in the computer.
Another good choice is IRQ 2 (aka IRQ 9); although this IRQ
is sometimes used by network cards, and very rarely VGA
cards will be configured to use IRQ 2 as a vertical retrace
interrupt. If your VGA card is configured this way; try to
disable it so you can reclaim that IRQ line for some other
card. Its not necessary for Linux and most other Operating
systems.</p>

<p>The only other available IRQ lines are 3, 4, and 7, and
these are prob- ably used by the other serial and parallel
ports. (If your serial card has a 16bit card edge connector,
and supports higher interrupt numbers, then IRQ 10, 11, 12,
and 15 are also available.)</p>

<p>On AT class machines, IRQ 2 is seen as IRQ 9, and Linux
will interpret it in this manner.</p>

<p>IRQ s other than 2 (9), 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 15,
should not be used, since they are assigned to other
hardware and cannot, in general, be changed. Here are the
&quot;standard&quot; assignments:</p>

<p>IRQ 0 Timer channel 0 IRQ 1 Keyboard IRQ 2 Cascade for
controller 2 IRQ 3 Serial port 2 IRQ 4 Serial port 1 IRQ 5
Parallel port 2 (Reserved in PS/2) IRQ 6 Floppy diskette IRQ
7 Parallel port 1 IRQ 8 Real-time clock IRQ 9 Redirected to
IRQ2 IRQ 10 Reserved IRQ 11 Reserved IRQ 12 Reserved
(Auxillary device in PS/2) IRQ 13 Math coprocessor IRQ 14
Hard disk controller IRQ 15 Reserved</p>

<p>MULTIPORT CONFIGURATION Certain multiport serial boards
which share multiple ports on a single IRQ use one or more
ports to indicate whether or not there are any pending ports
which need to be serviced. If your multiport board sup-
ports these ports, you should make use of them to avoid
potential lock- ups if the interrupt gets lost.</p>

<p>In order to set these ports specify set_multiport as a
parameter, and follow it with the multiport parameters. The
multiport parameters take the form of specifying the port
that should be checked, a mask which indicate which bits in
the register are significant, and finally, a match parameter
which specifies what the significant bits in that reg- ister
must match when there is no more pending work to be
done.</p>

<p>Up to four such port/mask/match combinations may be
specified. The first such combinations should be specified
by setting the parameters port1, mask1, and match1. The
second such combination should be speci- fied with port2,
mask2, and match2, and so on. In order to disable this
multiport checking, set port1 to be zero.</p>

<p>In order to view the current multiport settings, specify
the parameter get_multiport on the command line.</p>

<p>Here are some multiport settings for some common serial
boards:</p>

<p>AST FourPort port1 0x1BF mask1 0xf match1 0xf</p>

<p>Boca BB-1004/8 port1 0x107 mask1 0xff match1 0</p>

<p>Boca BB-2016 port1 0x107 mask1 0xff match1 0 port2 0x147
mask2 0xff match2 0</p>

<p>Hayes ESP Configuration Setserial may also be used to
configure ports on a Hayes ESP serial board.</p>

<p>The following parameters when configuring ESP ports:</p>

<p>rx_trigger This is the trigger level (in bytes) of the
receive FIFO. Larger values may result in fewer interrupts
and hence better perfor- mance; however, a value too high
could result in data loss. Valid values are 1 through
1023.</p>

<p>tx_trigger This is the trigger level (in bytes) of the
transmit FIFO. Larger values may result in fewer interrupts
and hence better performance; however, a value too high
could result in degraded transmit performance. Valid values
are 1 through 1023.</p>

<p>flow_off This is the level (in bytes) at which the ESP
port will &quot;flow off&quot; the remote transmitter (i.e.
tell him to stop stop sending more bytes). Valid values are
1 through 1023. This value should be greater than the
receive trigger level and the flow on level.</p>

<p>flow_on This is the level (in bytes) at which the ESP
port will &quot;flow on&quot; the remote transmitter (i.e.
tell him to resume sending bytes) after having flowed it
off. Valid values are 1 through 1023. This value should be
less than the flow off level, but greater than the receive
trigger level.</p>

<p>rx_timeout This is the amount of time that the ESP port
will wait after receiving the final character before
signaling an interrupt. Valid values are 0 through 255. A
value too high will increase latency, and a value too low
will cause unnecessary interrupts.</p>

<p>CAUTION CAUTION: Configuring a serial port to use an
incorrect I/O port can lock up your machine.</p>
