<p>ACTSYNC(8) ACTSYNC(8)</p>

<p>NAME actsync, actsyncd - synchronize newsgroups</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS actsync [-A] [-b hostid] [-d hostid] [-g max]
[-i ignore_file] [-I hostid] [-k] [-l hostid] [-m] [-n name]
[-o fmt] [-p min_%_unchg] [-q hostid] [-s size] [-t hostid]
[-T] [-v verbosity] [-z sec] [host1] host2</p>

<p>actsyncd [-x] actsync.cfg [debug_level [debug_outfmt]
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Actsync(8) permits one to synchronize,
compare, or merge two active files. With this utility one
may add, change, or remove newsgroups on the local news
server to make it similar to the list the newsgroups found
on another system or file. The synchronization need not be
exact. Local differences in newsgroup lists may be
maintained and pre- served. Certain newsgroup errors may be
detected and optionally cor- rected.</p>

<p>There are several reasons to run actsync(8) (or
actsyncd(8)), on a periodic basis. Among the reasons
are:</p>

<p>A control message to add, change or remove a newsgroup
may fail to reach your site.</p>

<p>Your control.ctl may be out of date or incomplete.</p>

<p>News articles for a new newsgroup can arrive ahead
(sometimes days ahead) of the control message.</p>

<p>Control messages may be forged, thus bypassing the
restrictions found in control.ctl .</p>

<p>Your active file may have been trashed.</p>

<p>If host1 or host2 begins with .o, then it is assumed to
be a name of a file containing information in the active(5)
format. The getlist(1) utility may be used to obtain copy a
remote systems active file via its NNTP server, or an FTP
client program can retrieve such a file from an FTP archive
(such as ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/active; see
more about this below). Newsgroup information from a file
may be treated as if it was obtained from a host. In this
man page host1 and host2 are called hosts, even though they
may be file names.</p>

<p>If a host argument does not begin wit.o, is assumed to
be a hostname or Internet address. In this case, actsync(8)
will attempt to use the NNTP protocol to obtain a copy of
the the specified systems active file. If the host argument
contains a: , the right side will be considerd the port to
connect to on the remote sys- tem. If no port number is
specified, actsync(8) will connect to port 119.</p>

<p>Regardless how the active file information is obtained,
the actions of actsync(8) remain the same.</p>

<p>If only one host is specified, it is assumed to be
host2; if host1 is not specified, it assumed to be the
default local NNTP server as speci- fied by the NNTPSERVER
environment variable, or by the server value found in
inn.conf.</p>

<p>The newsgroup synchronization, by default, involves all
newsgroups found on both hosts. One may also synchronize a
subset of newsgroups by directing actsync(8) to ignore
certain newsgroups from both systems. Only newsgroups with
valid names will be synchronized. To be valid, a newsgroup
name must consist only of alphanumeric characters, ., +, -,
and _. One may not have two .s in a row. The first character
must be alphanumeric, as must any character following a ..
The name may not end in a . character.</p>

<p>The actsyncd(8) daemon provides a convenient interface
to configure and run actsync(8). If a host is not initially
reachable, the daemon will retry up to 9 additional times,
waiting 6 minutes before each retry. This daemon runs in the
foreground, sending output to standard output and standard
error.</p>

<p>If the -x flag is given to actsyncd(8), then a ctlinnd
xexec will be used instead of a ctlinnd reload to load the
newly modified active file.</p>

<p>The configuration filename for the daemon is given as a
commandline argument, usually &lt;pathetc in
inn.conf&gt;/actsync.cfg The config file can contain the
following options:</p>

<p>host=host2 ftppath=/remote/path/to/active/file
spool=&lt;normally patharticles in inn.conf&gt;
ignore_file=ignore_file flags=actsyncd(8) options</p>

<p>The host, ignore_file, and flags lines are
mandatory.</p>

<p>The keyword must start at the beginning of the line, and
there may be no whitespace before the=character. Blank lines
are ignored. Comment lines start witand are ignored. Any
other lines may produce undefined results.</p>

<p>The host config file line refers to the host2 parameter
to actsync(8). The ftppath directive causes the machine
named in the host line to accessed as an ftp server,
retrieving the file named. If the filename ends in .gz or
.Z, then it will automatically be uncompressed after
retrieval. The spool config file lines determines where the
top of the news spool tree is to be found. The ignore_file
config file line names the ignore file to be used by
actsync(8). The flags config file line contains any flags
that you wish to pass to actsync(8).</p>

<p>Note that the -i ignore_file option and the -o format
option should not be given in the flags= line because they
are automatically taken care of by actsyncd(8).</p>

<p>INN is shipped with default values of ftp.isc.org for
host and /pub/usenet/CONFIG/active for ftppath. You can read
about the policies used for maintaining that active file at
ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/README. Consider
sychronizing from this file on a daily basis by using
cron(8).</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options to actsync(8) are as follows:</p>

<p>-A actsync(8) tries to authenticate before issuing LIST
command.</p>

<p>-b hostid This flag causes actsync(8) to ignore
newsgroups with bork.bork.bork style names. That is,
newsgroups whose last 3 components are identical. For
example, the following news- groups have bork style
names:</p>

<p>alt.helms.dork.dork.dork alt.auto.accident.sue.sue.sue
alt.election.vote.vote.vote</p>

<p>The value hostid determines on which hosts this action
is per- formed:</p>

<p>0 neither host 1 local default server 2 remove server 12
both servers 21 both servers</p>

<p>The default is -b 0; no newsgroups are ignored because
of bork- style names.</p>

<p>-d hostid This flag causes actsync(8) to ignore
newsgroups that have all numeric path components. The hostid
value is interpreted the same as in -b. For example, the
following newsgroups have numeric path components:</p>

<p>alt.prime.chongo.23209
391581.times.2.to_the.216193.power.-1
99.bottles.of.treacle.on.the.wall
linfield.class.envio_bio.101.d</p>

<p>The newsgroups directory of a newsgroups with a all
numeric com- ponent could conflict with an article from
another group if stored using the tradspool storage method;
see stor- age.conf(5). For example, the directory for the
first newsgroup listed above is the same path as article
number 23209 from the newsgroup:</p>

<p>alt.prime.chongo</p>

<p>The default is -d 0; all numeric newsgroups from both
hosts will be processed.</p>

<p>-g max Ignore any newsgroup with more than max levels.
For example, -g 6 would ignore:</p>

<p>alt.feinstien.votes.to.trash.freedom.of.speech
alt.senator.exon.enemy.of.the.internet
alt.crypto.export.laws.dumb.dumb.dumb</p>

<p>but would not ignore:</p>

<p>alt.feinstien.acts.like.a.republican alt.exon.amendment
alt.crypto.export.laws</p>

<p>If max is 0, then the max level feature is disabled.</p>

<p>By default, the max level feature is disabled.</p>

<p>-i ignore_file The ignore_file , usually &lt;pathetc in
inn.conf&gt;/actsync.ign , allows one to have a fine degree
of control over which news- groups are ignored. It contains
a set of rules that specifies which newsgroups will be
checked and which will be ignored.</p>

<p>By default, these rules apply to both hosts. This can be
modified by using the -I hostid flag.</p>

<p>By default, all newsgroups are checked. If no
ignore_file if specified, or if the ignore file contains no
rule lines, all newsgroups will be checked.</p>

<p>Blank lines and text after a # are considered comments
and are ignored.</p>

<p>Rule lines consist of tokens separated by whitespace.
Rule lines may be one of two forms:</p>

<p>c newsgroup [type ...] i newsgroup [type ...]</p>

<p>If the rule begins with a c then the rule requests
certain news- groups to be checked. If the rule begins with
an i then the rule requests certain newsgroups to be
ignored. The newsgroup field may be a specific newsgroup, or
a uwildmat(3) pattern.</p>

<p>If one or more types are specified, then the rule
applies to the newsgroup only if is of the specified type.
Types refer to the 4th field of the active file; that is, a
type may be one of:</p>

<p>y n m j x =group.name</p>

<p>Unlike active files, the group.name in an alias type may
be a newsgroup name or a uwildmat(3) pattern. Also= is
equiva- lent t=.</p>

<p>On each rule line, no pattern type may not be repeated.
For example, one may not have more than one type that begins
with = , per line. However, one may achieve an effect
equivalent to using multiple=types by using multiple rule
lines affecting the same newsgroup.</p>

<p>By default, all newsgroups are candidates to be checked.
If an ignore file is used, each newsgroup in turn is checked
against the ignore file. If multiple lines match a given
newsgroup, the last line in the ignore file is used.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following ignore file
lines:</p>

<p>i *.general c *.general m i nsa.general</p>

<p>The newsgroups ba.general and mod.general would be
synchronized if moderated and ignored if not moderated. The
newsgroup nsa.general would be ignored regardless of
moderation status. All newsgroups not matching *.general
would be synchronized by default.</p>

<p>-I hostid This flag restricts which hosts are affected
by the ignore file. The hostid value is interpreted the same
as in -b described above.</p>

<p>This flag may be useful in conjunction with the -m merge
flag. For example:</p>

<p>actsync -i actsync.ign -I 2 -m host1 host2</p>

<p>will keep all newsgroups currently on host1 . It will
also will only compare host1 groups with non-ignored
newsgroups from host2 .</p>

<p>The default is -I 12, newsgroups from both hosts to be
ignored per the -i actsync.ign file.</p>

<p>-k By default, any newsgroup on host1 that is in error
will be con- sidered for removal. This causes actsync(8)
simply ignore such newsgroups. This flag, used in
combination with -m , will pre- vent any newsgroup from
being scheduled for removal.</p>

<p>-l hostid This flag causes problem newsgroups of typfrom
host1 or host2 to be considered as errors. The hostid value
is inter- preted the same as in -b. Newsgroups of type=are
news- groups active entries that have 4th field that begins
with = , i.e. newsgroups that are equivalent to other
newsgroups. A problem newsgroup is one which is:</p>

<p>* equivalent to itself * in an equivalence chain that
loops around to itself * in an equivalence chain longer than
16 groups * equivalent to a non-existant newsgroup *
equivalent to a newsgroup that has an error of some kind</p>

<p>However, a newsgroup that is equivalent to an ignored
newsgroup is not a problem.</p>

<p>By default, problem newsgroups from both hosts are
marked as errors.</p>

<p>-m Merge newsgroups instead of sync. By default, if a
newsgroup exists on host1 but not host2, it will be
scheduled to be removed. This flag disables this process,
permitting newsgroups unique to host1 to be kept.</p>

<p>-n name The ctlinnd(8) command is used to create
newsgroups as neces- sary. By default, the creator name used
is actsync. This flag changes the creator name to name.</p>

<p>-o fmt Determine the output / action format of this
utility. The fmt may one of:</p>

<p>a output in active(5) format a1 output in active(5)
format, and output host1 non-error ignored groups ak output
in active(5) format, but use host2 hi &amp; low (2nd &amp;
3rd active fields) values for any newsgroup being created aK
output in active(5) format, but use host2 hi &amp; low (2nd
&amp; 3rd active fields) values for all newsgroups found in
host2 a1k output in active(5) format, but use host2 hi &amp;
low (2nd &amp; 3rd active fields) values for any newsgroup
being created, and output host1 non-error ignored groups a1K
output in active(5) format, but use host2 hi &amp; low (2nd
&amp; 3rd active fields) values for all newsgroups found in
host2, and output host1 non-error ignored groups ak1 same as
a1k aK1 same as a1K c output in ctlinnd(8) format x no
output, directly exec ctlinnd(8) commands xi no output,
directly exec ctlinnd(8) commands, in an interactive
mode</p>

<p>The a, a1, ak, aK, a1k, a1K, ak1 and aK1 style formats
allow one to form a new active file instead of producing
ctlinnd(8) com- mands. They use hi &amp; low values of
0000000000 and 0000000001 respectively for newsgroups that
are created. The ak and aK variants change the the hi &amp;
low (2nd &amp; 3rd active fields). In the case of ak,
newsgroups created take their hi &amp; low values from
host2. In the case of aK, all newsgroups found on host2 take
their hi &amp; low values from host2.</p>

<p>The c format produces ctlinnd(8) commands. No actions
are taken because actsync(8) simply prints ctlinnd(8)
commands on standard output. The sync (or merge) with host2
may be accomplished by piping this output into sh(1). A
paranoid person might prefer to use x or xi in case a
newsgroup name or type contains bogus characters that might
be interpreted by sh(1). Even so, this output format is
useful to let you see how host1 will be affected by the sync
(or merge) with host2.</p>

<p>The sync (or merge) may be accomplished directly by use
of the x format. With this format, actsync(8) uses the
execl(2) system call to directly execute ctlinnd(8)
commands. Because of the exec, there is no risk of bogus
newsgroups containing bogus characters causing a shell to do
bogus (or dangerous) things. The output of such exec calls
may be seen if the verbosity level is at least 2.</p>

<p>The actsync(8) utility will pause for 4 seconds before
each com- mand is executed if -o x is selected. See the -z
sec flag below for discussion of this delay and how to
customize it.</p>

<p>The xi format interactively prompts on standard output
and reads directives on standard input. One may pick and
choose changes using this format.</p>

<p>Care should be taken when producing active(5) formatted
output. One should check to be sure that actsync(8) exited
with a zero status prior to using such output. Also one
should realize that such output will not contain lines
ignored due to -i ignore_file even if -p 100 is used.</p>

<p>By default, -o c is assumed.</p>

<p>-p min_%_unchg By default, the actsync(8) utility has
safeguards against per- forming massive changes. If fewer
than min_%_unchg percent of the non-ignored lines from host1
remain unchanged, no actions (output, execution, etc.) are
performed and actsync(8) exits with a non-zero exit status.
The min_%_unchg may be a floating point value such as
66.667.</p>

<p>A change is considered a host1 line that was removed,
added, changed, or found to be in error. Changing the 2nd or
3rd active fields via -oak or -o aK are not considered
changes by -p.</p>

<p>To force actsync(8) to accept any amount of change, use
the -p 0 option. To force actsync(8) to reject any changes,
use the -p 100 option.</p>

<p>Care should be taken when producing active(5)-formatted
output; be sure to check that actsync(8) exited with a zero
status prior to using such output. Also one should realize
that such output will not contain lines ignored by the -i
ignore_file process even if -p 100 is used.</p>

<p>By default, 96% of the lines not ignored in host1 must
be unchanged. That is, by default, -p 96 is assumed.</p>

<p>-q hostid By default, all newsgroup errors are reported
on standard error. This flag quiets errors from host1 or
host2. The hostid value is interpreted the same as in
-b.</p>

<p>-s size If size &gt; 0, then ignore newsgroups with
names longer than size, and ignore newsgroups equivalent (by
following= chains) to names longer than size. Length
checking is performed on both the local and remote
hosts.</p>

<p>By default, size is 0 and thus no length checking is
performed.</p>

<p>-t hostid Ignore improper newsgroups consisting of only
a top component from host1 or host2. The hostid value is
interpreted the same as in -b. The following newsgroups are
considered proper news- groups despite top only names and
therefore are exempt from this flag:</p>

<p>control general junk test to</p>

<p>For example, the following newsgroup names are improper
because they only contain a top level component:</p>

<p>dole_for_pres dos microsoft windows95</p>

<p>The default is -t 2, that is, all improper
top-level-only news- groups from the remote are ignored.</p>

<p>-T This flag causes host2 newsgroups from new
hierarchies to be ignored. Normally a newsgroup which only
exists on host2 , for example chongo.was.here , will be
created for host1. However, if this flag is given and host1
does not have any other news- groups in the same hierarchy,
e.g. chongo.* , then the news- group in question will be
ignored and will not be created on host1.</p>

<p>-v verbosity By default, actsync(8) is not verbose. This
flag controls the verbosity level as follows:</p>

<p>0 no debug or status reports (default) 1 print summary,
but only if work was needed or done 2 print actions, exec
output, and summary, but only if work was needed or done 3
print actions, exec output, and summary 4 full debug
output</p>

<p>-z sec If -o x is selected, actsync(8) will pause for
sec seconds before each command is executed. This helps
prevent innd(8) from being busied-out if a large number of
ctlinnd(8) commands are needed. One can entirely disable
this sleeping by using -z 0.</p>

<p>By default, actsync(8) will pause for 4 seconds before
each com- mand is executed if -o x is selected.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Determine the difference (but don t change
anything) between your news- group set and uunets set:</p>

<p>actsync news.uu.net</p>

<p>Same as above, with full debug and progress reports:</p>

<p>actsync -v 4 news.uu.net</p>

<p>Force a site to have the same newsgroups some other
site:</p>

<p>actsync -o x master</p>

<p>This may be useful to sync a slave site to its master,
or to sync internal site to a gateway.</p>

<p>Compare your site with uunet, disregarding local groups
and certain local differences with uunet. Produce a report
if any differences were encountered:</p>

<p>actsync -v 2 -i actsync.ign news.uu.net</p>

<p>where actsync.ign contains:</p>

<p># Dont compare to.* groups as they will differ. # i
to.*</p>

<p># These are our local groups that nobody else # (should)
carry. So ignore them for the sake # of the compare. # i
nsa.*</p>

<p># These groups are local favorites, so keep them # even
if uunet does not carry them. # i ca.dump.bob.dorman i
ca.keep.bob.dorman i alt.tv.dinosaurs.barney.die.die.die i
alt.tv.dinosaurs.barney.love.love.love i alt.sounds.*
=alt.binaries.sounds.*</p>

<p>To interactively sync against news.uu.net, using the
same ignore file:</p>

<p>actsync -o xi -v 2 -i actsync.ign news.uu.net</p>

<p>Based on newsgroups that you decided to keep, one could
make changes to the actsync.ign file:</p>

<p># Dont compare to.* groups as they will differ. # i
to.*</p>

<p># These are our local groups that nobody else # (should)
carry. So ignore them for the sake # of the compare. # i
nsa.*</p>

<p># These groups are local favorites, so keep them # even
if uunet does not carry them. # i ca.dump.bob.dorman i
alt.tv.dinosaurs.barney.die.die.die i alt.sounds.*
=alt.binaries.sounds.*</p>

<p># Dont sync test groups, except for ones that are #
moderated or that are under the gnu hierarchy. i *.test c
*.test m # check moderated test groups c gnu.*.test c
gnu.test # just in case it ever exists</p>

<p>Automatic processing may be setup by using the following
actsync.cfg file:</p>

<p># host to sync off of (host2) host=news.uu.net</p>

<p># location of the ignore file ignore_file=&lt;pathetc in
inn.conf&gt;/actsync.ign</p>

<p># where news articles are kept spool=&lt;patharticles in
inn.conf&gt;</p>

<p># actsync(8) flags # # Automatic execs, report if
something was done, # otherwise dont say anything, dont
report # uunet active file problems, just ignore # the
affected entries. flags=-o x -v 2 -q 2</p>

<p>and then by running actsyncd(8) with the path to the
config file:</p>

<p>actsyncd &lt;pathetc in inn.conf&gt;/actsync.cfg</p>

<p>One may produce a trial actsyncd(8) run without changing
anything on the server by supplying the debug_level arg:</p>

<p>actsyncd &lt;pathetc in inn.conf&gt;/actsync.cfg 2</p>

<p>The debug_level causes actsyncd(8) to run actsync(8)
with an -v debug_level (overriding any -v flag on the flags
line), not make any changes to the active file, write a new
active file to standard output, and write debug messages to
standard error.</p>

<p>If the debug_outfmt arg is also given to actsyncd(8)
then the data written to standard output will be in -o
debug_outfmt instead of in -o a1 format. The /bin/sh
command</p>

<p>actsyncd &lt;pathetc in inn.conf&gt;/actsync.cfg 4
&gt;cmd.log 2&gt;dbg.log</p>

<p>will operate in debug mode, not change the active file,
write ctlinnd(8) style commands to cmd.log, and write debug
statements to dbg.log.</p>

<p>To check only the major hierarchies against news.uu,net,
use the fol- lowing actsync.ign file:</p>

<p># by default, ignore everything i *</p>

<p># check the major groups c comp.* c gnu.* c sci.* c
alt.* c misc.* c news.* c rec.* c soc.* c talk.*</p>

<p>and the command:</p>

<p>actsync -i actsync.ign news.uu.net</p>

<p>To determine the differences between your old active and
your current default server:</p>

<p>actsync &lt;pathetc in inn.conf&gt;/active.old -</p>

<p>To report but not fix any newsgroup problems with the
current active file:</p>

<p>actsync - -</p>

<p>To detect any newsgroup errors on your local server, and
to remove any *.bork.bork.bork style silly newsgroup
names:</p>

<p>actsync -b 2 - -</p>

<p>The active file produced by:</p>

<p>actsync ...flags... -o x erehwon.honey.edu</p>

<p>or by:</p>

<p>actsync ...flags... -o c erehwon.honey.edu | sh</p>

<p>is effectively the same as the active file produced
by:</p>

<p>ctlinnd pause running actsync rm -f active.new actsync
...flags... -o a1 erehwon.honey.edu &gt; active.new rm -f
active.old ln active active.old mv active.new active ctlinnd
reload active running actsync ctlinnd go running actsync</p>

<p>It should be noted that the final method above, pausing
the server and simply replacing the active file, is
faster.</p>

<p>CAUTION Careless use of this tool may result in the
unintended addition, change, or removal of newsgroups. You
should avoid using the x output format until you are sure it
will do what you want.</p>

<p>BUGS If a newsgroup appears multiple times, actsync(8)
will treat all copies as errors. However, if the group is
marked for removal, only one rmgroup will be issued.</p>

<p>The timeout for ctlinnd(8) commands is fixed at 30
seconds when running in x or xi output format. Perhaps the
timeout value should be controlled via a command line
option?</p>
