<p>curl_multi_socket(3) libcurl Manual
curl_multi_socket(3)</p>

<p>NAME curl_multi_socket - reads/writes available data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>CURLMcode curl_multi_socket(CURLM * multi_handle,
curl_socket_t sockfd, int *running_handles);</p>

<p>CURLMcode curl_multi_socket_all(CURLM *multi_handle, int
*running_handles);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Alternative versions of
curl_multi_perform(3) that allows the applica- tion to pass
in one of the file descriptors/sockets that have been
detected to have &quot;action&quot; on them and let libcurl
perform. This allows libcurl to not have to scan through all
possible file descriptors to check for action. When the
application has detected action on a socket handled by
libcurl, it should call curl_multi_socket(3) with the sockfd
argument set to the socket with the action.</p>

<p>At return, the int running_handles points to will
contain the number of still running easy handles within the
multi handle. When this number reaches zero, all transfers
are complete/done. Note that when you call
curl_multi_socket(3) on a specific socket and the counter
decreases by one, it DOES NOT necessarily mean that this
exact socket/transfer is the one that completed. Use
curl_multi_info_read(3) to figure out which easy handle that
completed.</p>

<p>The curl_multi_socket functions inform the application
about updates in the socket (file descriptor) status by
doing none, one or multiple calls to the socket callback
function set with the CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNC- TION option to
curl_multi_setopt(3). They update the status with changes
since the previous time this function was called.</p>

<p>To force libcurl to (re-)check all its internal sockets
and transfers instead of just a single one, you call
curl_multi_socket_all(3). This is typically done as the
first function call before the application has any knowledge
about what sockets libcurl uses.</p>

<p>Applications should call curl_multi_timeout(3) to figure
out how long to wait for socket actions - at most - before
doing the timeout action: call the curl_multi_socket(3)
function with the sockfd argument set to
CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT.</p>

<p>CALLBACK DETAILS The socket callback function uses a
prototype like this</p>

<p>int curl_socket_callback(CURL *easy, /* easy handle */
curl_socket_t s, /* socket */ int action, /* see values
below */ void *userp, /* private callback pointer */ void
*socketp); /* private socket pointer */</p>

<p>The callback MUST return 0.</p>

<p>The easy argument is a pointer to the easy handle that
deals with this particular socket. Note that a single handle
may work with several sockets simultaneously.</p>

<p>The s argument is the actual socket value as you use it
within your system.</p>

<p>The action argument to the callback has one of five
values:</p>

<p>CURL_POLL_NONE (0) register, not interested in readiness
(yet)</p>

<p>CURL_POLL_IN (1) register, interested in read
readiness</p>

<p>CURL_POLL_OUT (2) register, interested in write
readiness</p>

<p>CURL_POLL_INOUT (3) register, interested in both read
and write readiness</p>

<p>CURL_POLL_REMOVE (4) deregister</p>

<p>The socketp argument is a private pointer you have
previously set with curl_multi_assign(3) to be associated
with the s socket. If no pointer has been set, socketp will
be NULL. This argument is of course a ser- vice to
applications that want to keep certain data or structs that
are strictly associated to the given socket.</p>

<p>The userp argument is a private pointer you have
previously set with curl_multi_setopt(3) and the
CURLMOPT_SOCKETDATA option.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE CURLMcode type, general libcurl multi
interface error code.</p>

<p>If you receive CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM, this basically
means that you should call curl_multi_perform again, before
you wait for more actions on libcurl s sockets. You don t
have to do it immediately, but the return code means that
libcurl may have more data available to return or that there
may be more data to send off before it is
&quot;satisfied&quot;.</p>

<p>NOTE that this only returns errors etc regarding the
whole multi stack. There might still have occurred problems
on individual transfers even when this function returns
OK.</p>

<p>TYPICAL USAGE 1. Create a multi handle</p>

<p>2. Set the socket callback with
CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION</p>

<p>3. Add easy handles</p>

<p>4. Call curl_multi_socket_all() first once</p>

<p>5. Setup a &quot;collection&quot; of sockets to
supervise when your socket call- back is called.</p>

<p>6. Use curl_multi_timeout() to figure out how long to
wait for action</p>

<p>7. Wait for action on any of libcurls sockets</p>

<p>8, When action happens, call curl_multi_socket() for the
socket(s) that got action.</p>

<p>9. Go back to step 6.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY This function was added in libcurl 7.15.4,
although not deemed stable yet.</p>
