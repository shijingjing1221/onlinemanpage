<p>FIND(1) FIND(1)</p>

<p>NAME find - search for files in a directory
hierarchy</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS find [-H] [-L] [-P] [path...] [expression]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents the GNU version
of find. GNU find searches the directory tree rooted at each
given file name by evaluating the given expression from left
to right, according to the rules of prece- dence (see
section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left
hand side is false for and operations, true for or), at
which point find moves on to the next file name.</p>

<p>If you are using find in an environment where security
is important (for example if you are using it to seach
directories that are writable by other users), you should
read the &quot;Security Considerations&quot; chapter of the
findutils documentation, which is called Finding Files and
comes with findutils. That document also includes a lot more
detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find
it a more useful source of information.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The -H , -L and -P options control the treatment
of symbolic links. Command-line arguments following these
are taken to be names of files or directories to be
examined, up to the first argument that begins with -, (, ),
,, or ! . That argument and any follow- ing arguments are
taken to be the expression describing what is to be searched
for. If no paths are given, the current directory is used.
If no expression is given, the expression -print is used
(but you should probably consider using -print0 instead,
anyway).</p>

<p>This manual page talks about options within the
expression list. These options control the behaviour of find
but are specified immedi- ately after the last path name.
The three real options -H, -L and -P must appear before the
first path name, if at all.</p>

<p>-P Never follow symbolic links. This is the default
behaviour. When find examines or prints information a file,
and the file is a symbolic link, the information used shall
be taken from the properties of the symbolic link
itself.</p>

<p>-L Follow symbolic links. When find examines or prints
information about files, the information used shall be taken
from the prop- erties of the file to which the link points,
not from the link itself (unless it is a broken symbolic
link or find is unable to examine the file to which the link
points). Use of this option implies -noleaf. If you later
use the -P option, -noleaf will still be in effect. If -L is
in effect and find discovers a symbolic link to a
subdirectory during its search, the subdirec- tory pointed
to by the symbolic link will be searched.</p>

<p>When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate
will always match against the type of the file that a
symbolic link points to rather than the link itself (unless
the symbolic link is bro- ken). Using -L causes the -lname
and -ilname predicates always to return false.</p>

<p>-H Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing
the com- mand line arguments. When find examines or prints
information about files, the information used shall be taken
from the prop- erties of the symbolic link itself. The only
exception to this behaviour is when a file specified on the
command line is a sym- bolic link, and the link can be
resolved. For that situation, the information used is taken
from whatever the link points to (that is, the link is
followed). The information about the link itself is used as
a fallback if the file pointed to by the sym- bolic link
cannot be examined. If -H is in effect and one of the paths
specified on the command line is a symbolic link to a
directory, the contents of that directory will be examined
(though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).</p>

<p>If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each
overrides the oth- ers; the last one appearing on the
command line takes effect. Since it is the default, the -P
option should be considered to be in effect unless either -H
or -L is specified.</p>

<p>GNU find frequently stats files during the processing of
the command line itself, before any searching has begun.
These options also affect how those arguments are processed.
Specifically, there are a number of tests that compare files
listed on the command line against a file we are currently
considering. In each case, the file specified on the command
line will have been examined and some of its properties will
have been saved. If the named file is in fact a symbolic
link, and the -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor
-L were specified), the information used for the comparison
will be taken from the properties of the symbolic link.
Otherwise, it will be taken from the properties of the file
the link points to. If find cannot follow the link (for
example because it has insufficient privileges or the link
points to a nonexistent file) the properties of the link
itself will be used.</p>

<p>When the -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic
links listed as the argument of -newer will be dereferenced,
and the timestamp will be taken from the file to which the
symbolic link points. The same con- sideration applies to
-anewer and -cnewer.</p>

<p>The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it
takes effect at the point where it appears (that is, if -L
is not used but -follow is, any symbolic links appearing
after -follow on the command line will be dereferenced, and
those before it will not).</p>

<p>EXPRESSIONS The expression is made up of options (which
affect overall operation rather than the processing of a
specific file, and always return true), tests (which return
a true or false value), and actions (which have side effects
and return a true or false value), all separated by opera-
tors. -and is assumed where the operator is omitted.</p>

<p>If the expression contains no actions other than -prune,
-print is per- formed on all files for which the expression
is true.</p>

<p>OPTIONS All options always return true. Except for
-follow and -daystart, they always take effect, rather than
being processed only when their place in the expression is
reached. Therefore, for clarity, it is best to place them at
the beginning of the expression. A warning is issued if you
dont do this.</p>

<p>-daystart Measure times (for -amin, -atime, -cmin,
-ctime, -mmin, and -mtime) from the beginning of today
rather than from 24 hours ago. This option only affects
tests which appear later on the command line.</p>

<p>-depth Process each directory s contents before the
directory itself.</p>

<p>-d A synonym for -depth, for compatibility with FreeBSD,
NetBSD, MacOS X and OpenBSD.</p>

<p>-follow Deprecated; use the -L option instead.
Dereference symbolic links. Implies -noleaf. The -follow
option affects only those tests which appear after it on the
command line. Unless the -H or -L option has been specified,
the position of the -follow option changes the behaviour of
the -newer predicate; any files listed as the argument of
-newer will be dereferenced if they are symbolic links. The
same consideration applies to -anewer and -cnewer.
Similarly, the -type predicate will always match against the
type of the file that a symbolic link points to rather than
the link itself. Using -follow causes the -lname and -ilname
predicates always to return false.</p>

<p>-help, --help Print a summary of the command-line usage
of find and exit.</p>

<p>-ignore_readdir_race Normally, find will emit an error
message when it fails to stat a file. If you give this
option and a file is deleted between the time find reads the
name of the file from the directory and the time it tries to
stat the file, no error message will be issued. This also
applies to files or directories whose names are given on the
command line. This option takes effect at the time the
command line is read, which means that you cannot search one
part of the filesystem with this option on and part of it
with this option off (if you need to do that, you will need
to issue two find commands instead, one with the option and
one without it).</p>

<p>-maxdepth levels Descend at most levels (a non-negative
integer) levels of direc- tories below the command line
arguments. -maxdepth 0 means only apply the tests and
actions to the command line arguments.</p>

<p>-mindepth levels Do not apply any tests or actions at
levels less than levels (a non-negative integer). -mindepth
1 means process all files except the command line
arguments.</p>

<p>-mount Don t descend directories on other filesystems.
An alternate name for -xdev, for compatibility with some
other versions of find.</p>

<p>-noignore_readdir_race Turns off the effect of
-ignore_readdir_race.</p>

<p>-noleaf Do not optimize by assuming that directories
contain 2 fewer subdirectories than their hard link count.
This option is needed when searching filesystems that do not
follow the Unix directory-link convention, such as CD-ROM or
MS-DOS filesystems or AFS volume mount points. Each
directory on a normal Unix filesystem has at least 2 hard
links: its name and its . entry. Additionally, its
subdirectories (if any) each have a .. entry linked to that
directory. When find is examining a directory, after it has
statted 2 fewer subdirectories than the directorys link
count, it knows that the rest of the entries in the
directory are non-directories (leaf files in the directory
tree). If only the files names need to be examined, there is
no need to stat them; this gives a significant increase in
search speed.</p>

<p>-regextype type Changes the regular expression syntax
understood by -regex and -iregex tests which occur later on
the command line. Currently- implemented types are emacs
(this is the default), posix-awk, posix-basic, posix-egrep
and posix-extended.</p>

<p>-version, --version Print the find version number and
exit.</p>

<p>-warn, -nowarn Turn warning messages on or off. These
warnings apply only to the command line usage, not to any
conditions that find might encounter when it searches
directories. The default behaviour corresponds to -warn if
standard input is a tty, and to -nowarn otherwise.</p>

<p>-xautofs Dont descend directories on autofs
filesystems.</p>

<p>-xdev Dont descend directories on other filesystems.</p>

<p>TESTS Numeric arguments can be specified as</p>

<p>+n for greater than n,</p>

<p>-n for less than n,</p>

<p>n for exactly n.</p>

<p>-amin n File was last accessed n minutes ago.</p>

<p>-anewer file File was last accessed more recently than
file was modified. If file is a symbolic link and the -H
option or the -L option is in effect, the access time of the
file it points to is always used.</p>

<p>-atime n File was last accessed n*24 hours ago. When
find figures out how many 24-hour periods ago the file was
last accessed, any fractional part is ignored, so to match
-atime +1, a file has to have been accessed at least two
days ago.</p>

<p>-cmin n Files status was last changed n minutes ago.</p>

<p>-cnewer file File s status was last changed more
recently than file was modi- fied. If file is a symbolic
link and the -H option or the -L option is in effect, the
status-change time of the file it points to is always
used.</p>

<p>-ctime n Files status was last changed n*24 hours ago.
See the comments for -atime to understand how rounding
affects the interpretation of file status change times.</p>

<p>-empty File is empty and is either a regular file or a
directory.</p>

<p>-false Always false.</p>

<p>-fstype type File is on a filesystem of type type. The
valid filesystem types vary among different versions of
Unix; an incomplete list of filesystem types that are
accepted on some version of Unix or another is: ufs, 4.2,
4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K, S52K. You can use -printf with the
%F directive to see the types of your filesystems.</p>

<p>-gid n Files numeric group ID is n.</p>

<p>-group gname File belongs to group gname (numeric group
ID allowed).</p>

<p>-ilname pattern Like -lname, but the match is case
insensitive. If the -L option or the -follow option is in
effect, this test returns false unless the symbolic link is
broken.</p>

<p>-iname pattern Like -name, but the match is case
insensitive. For example, the patterns fo* and F?? match the
file names Foo, FOO, foo , fOo , etc. In these patterns,
unlike filename expan- sion by the shell, an initial . can
be matched by *. That is, find -name *bar will match the
file .foobar. Please note that you should quote patterns as
a matter of course, otherwise the shell will expand any
wildcard characters in them.</p>

<p>-inum n File has inode number n. It is normally easier
to use the -samefile test instead.</p>

<p>-ipath pattern Behaves in the same way as -iwholename.
This option is depre- cated, so please do not use it.</p>

<p>-iregex pattern Like -regex, but the match is case
insensitive.</p>

<p>-iwholename pattern Like -wholename, but the match is
case insensitive.</p>

<p>-links n File has n links.</p>

<p>-lname pattern File is a symbolic link whose contents
match shell pattern pat- tern. The metacharacters do not
treat / or . specially. If the -L option or the -follow
option is in effect, this test returns false unless the
symbolic link is broken.</p>

<p>-mmin n Files data was last modified n minutes ago.</p>

<p>-mtime n Files data was last modified n*24 hours ago.
See the comments for -atime to understand how rounding
affects the interpretation of file modification times.</p>

<p>-name pattern Base of file name (the path with the
leading directories removed) matches shell pattern pattern.
The metacharacters (*, ?, and []) match a . at the start of
the base name (this is a change in findutils-4.2.2; see
section STANDARDS CON- FORMANCE below). To ignore a
directory and the files under it, use -prune; see an example
in the description of -wholename. Braces are not recognised
as being special, despite the fact that some shells
including Bash imbue braces with a special meaning in shell
patterns. The filename matching is performed with the use of
the fnmatch(3) library function. Dont forget to enclose the
pattern in quotes in order to protect it from expansion by
the shell.</p>

<p>-newer file File was modified more recently than file.
If file is a sym- bolic link and the -H option or the -L
option is in effect, the modification time of the file it
points to is always used.</p>

<p>-nouser No user corresponds to files numeric user
ID.</p>

<p>-nogroup No group corresponds to files numeric group
ID.</p>

<p>-path pattern See -wholename. The predicate -path is
also supported by HP-UX find.</p>

<p>-perm mode File s permission bits are exactly mode
(octal or symbolic). Since an exact match is required, if
you want to use this form for symbolic modes, you may have
to specify a rather complex mode string. For example -perm
g=w will only match files which have mode 0020 (that is,
ones for which group write per- mission is the only
permission set). It is more likely that you will want to use
the / or - forms, for example -perm -g=w, which matches any
file with group write permission. See the EXAMPLES section
for some illustrative examples.</p>

<p>-perm -mode All of the permission bits mode are set for
the file. Symbolic modes are accepted in this form, and this
is usually the way in which would want to use them. You must
specify u, g or o if you use a symbolic mode. See the
EXAMPLES section for some illustrative examples.</p>

<p>-perm /mode Any of the permission bits mode are set for
the file. Symbolic modes are accepted in this form. You must
specify u, g or o if you use a symbolic mode. See the
EXAMPLES section for some illustrative examples. If no
permission bits in mode are set, this test currently matches
no files. However, it will soon be changed to match any file
(the idea is to be more con- sistent with the behaviour of
perm -000).</p>

<p>-perm +mode Deprecated, old way of searching for files
with any of the per- mission bits in mode set. You should
use -perm /mode instead. Trying to use the + syntax with
symbolic modes will yield sur- prising results. For example,
+u+x is a valid symbolic mode (equivalent to +u,+x, i.e.
0111) and will therefore not be eval- uated as -perm +mode
but instead as the exact mode specifier -perm mode and so it
matches files with exact permissions 0111 instead of files
with any execute bit set. If you found this paragraph
confusing, youre not alone - just use -perm /mode. This form
of the -perm test is deprecated because the POSIX
specification requires the interpretation of a leading + as
being part of a symbolic mode, and so we switched to using /
instead.</p>

<p>-regex pattern File name matches regular expression
pattern. This is a match on the whole path, not a search.
For example, to match a file named ./fubar3, you can use the
regular expression .*bar. or .*b.*3, but not f.*r3. The
regular expressions understood by find are by default Emacs
Regular Expressions, but this can be changed with the
-regextype option.</p>

<p>-samefile name File refers to the same inode as name.
When -L is in effect, this can include symbolic links.</p>

<p>-size n[cwbkMG] File uses n units of space. The
following suffixes can be used:</p>

<p>b for 512-byte blocks (this is the default if no suffix
is used)</p>

<p>c for bytes</p>

<p>w for two-byte words</p>

<p>k for Kilobytes (units of 1024 bytes)</p>

<p>M for Megabytes (units of 1048576 bytes)</p>

<p>G for Gigabytes (units of 1073741824 bytes)</p>

<p>The size does not count indirect blocks, but it does
count blocks in sparse files that are not actually
allocated. Bear in mind that the %k and %b format specifiers
of -printf handle sparse files differently. The b suffix
always denotes 512-byte blocks and never 1 Kilobyte blocks,
which is different to the behaviour of -ls.</p>

<p>-true Always true.</p>

<p>-type c File is of type c:</p>

<p>b block (buffered) special</p>

<p>c character (unbuffered) special</p>

<p>d directory</p>

<p>p named pipe (FIFO)</p>

<p>f regular file</p>

<p>l symbolic link; this is never true if the -L option or
the -follow option is in effect, unless the symbolic link is
broken. If you want to search for symbolic links when -L is
in effect, use -xtype.</p>

<p>s socket</p>

<p>D door (Solaris)</p>

<p>-uid n Files numeric user ID is n.</p>

<p>-used n File was last accessed n days after its status
was last changed.</p>

<p>-user uname File is owned by user uname (numeric user ID
allowed).</p>

<p>-wholename pattern File name matches shell pattern
pattern. The metacharacters do not treat / or . specially;
so, for example, find . -wholename ./sr*sc will print an
entry for a directory called ./src/misc (if one exists). To
ignore a whole directory tree, use -prune rather than
checking every file in the tree. For example, to skip the
directory src/emacs and all files and directories under it,
and print the names of the other files found, do something
like this: find . -wholename ./src/emacs -prune -o
-print</p>

<p>-xtype c The same as -type unless the file is a symbolic
link. For sym- bolic links: if the -H or -P option was
specified, true if the file is a link to a file of type c;
if the -L option has been given, true if c is l. In other
words, for symbolic links, -xtype checks the type of the
file that -type does not check.</p>

<p>-context pattern (SELinux only) Security context of the
file matches glob pat- tern.</p>

<p>ACTIONS -delete Delete files; true if removal succeeded.
If the removal failed, an error message is issued. Use of
this action automatically turns on the -depth option.</p>

<p>-exec command ; Execute command; true if 0 status is
returned. All following arguments to find are taken to be
arguments to the command until an argument consisting of ;
is encountered. The string {} is replaced by the current
file name being processed everywhere it occurs in the
arguments to the command, not just in arguments where it is
alone, as in some versions of find. Both of these
constructions might need to be escaped (with a ) or quoted
to protect them from expansion by the shell. See the
EXAMPLES sec- tion for examples of the use of the -exec
option. The speci- fied command is run once for each matched
file. The command is executed in the starting directory.
There are unavoidable security problems surrounding use of
the -exec option; you should use the -execdir option
instead.</p>

<p>-exec command {} + This variant of the -exec option runs
the specified command on the selected files, but the command
line is built by appending each selected file name at the
end; the total number of invoca- tions of the command will
be much less than the number of matched files. The command
line is built in much the same way that xargs builds its
command lines. Only one instance of {} is allowed within the
command. The command is executed in the starting
directory.</p>

<p>-execdir command ;</p>

<p>-execdir command {} + Like -exec, but the specified
command is run from the subdirec- tory containing the
matched file, which is not normally the directory in which
you started find. This a much more secure method for
invoking commands, as it avoids race conditions dur- ing
resolution of the paths to the matched files. As with the
-exec option, the + form of -execdir will build a command
line to process more than one matched file, but any given
invocation of command will only list files that exist in the
same subdirec- tory. If you use this option, you must ensure
that your $PATH environment variable does not reference the
current directory; otherwise, an attacker can run any
commands they like by leaving an appropriately-named file in
a directory in which you will run -execdir.</p>

<p>-fls file True; like -ls but write to file like -fprint.
The output file is always created, even if the predicate is
never matched. See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for
information about how unusual characters in filenames are
handled.</p>

<p>-fprint file True; print the full file name into file
file. If file does not exist when find is run, it is
created; if it does exist, it is truncated. The file names
/dev/stdout and /dev/stderr are handled specially; they
refer to the standard output and standard error output,
respectively. The output file is always created, even if the
predicate is never matched. See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES
section for information about how unusual characters in
filenames are handled.</p>

<p>-fprint0 file True; like -print0 but write to file like
-fprint. The output file is always created, even if the
predicate is never matched. See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES
section for information about how unusual characters in
filenames are handled.</p>

<p>-fprintf file format True; like -printf but write to
file like -fprint. The output file is always created, even
if the predicate is never matched. See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES
section for information about how unusual characters in
filenames are handled.</p>

<p>-ok command ; Like -exec but ask the user first (on the
standard input); if the response does not start with y or Y,
do not run the com- mand, and return false. If the command
is run, its standard input is redirected from /dev/null.</p>

<p>-print True; print the full file name on the standard
output, followed by a newline. If you are piping the output
of find into another program and there is the faintest
possibility that the files which you are searching for might
contain a newline, then you should seriously consider using
the -print0 option instead of -print. See the UNUSUAL
FILENAMES section for information about how unusual
characters in filenames are handled.</p>

<p>-okdir command ; Like -execdir but ask the user first
(on the standard input); if the response does not start with
y or Y, do not run the com- mand, and return false. If the
command is run, its standard input is redirected from
/dev/null.</p>

<p>-print0 True; print the full file name on the standard
output, followed by a null character (instead of the newline
character that -print uses). This allows file names that
contain newlines or other types of white space to be
correctly interpreted by pro- grams that process the find
output. This option corresponds to the -0 option of
xargs.</p>

<p>-printf format True; print format on the standard
output, interpreting escapes and % directives. Field widths
and precisions can be specified as with the printf C
function. Please note that many of the fields are printed as
%s rather than %d, and this may mean that flags don t work
as you might expect. This also means that the - flag does
work (it forces fields to be left- aligned). Unlike -print,
-printf does not add a newline at the end of the string. The
escapes and directives are:</p>

<p>Alarm bell.</p>

<p>Backspace.</p>

<p>output.</p>

<p>Form feed.</p>

<p>Newline.</p>

<p>Carriage return.</p>

<p>Horizontal tab.</p>

<p>Vertical tab.</p>

<p>ASCII NUL.</p>

<p>\ A literal backslash ().</p>

<p>The character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal).</p>

<p>A character followed by any other character is treated
as an ordinary character, so they both are printed.</p>

<p>%% A literal percent sign.</p>

<p>%a File s last access time in the format returned by the
C ctime function.</p>

<p>%Ak File s last access time in the format specified by
k, which is either @ or a directive for the C strftime
function. The possible values for k are listed below; some
of them might not be available on all systems, due to
differences in strftime between systems.</p>

<p>@ seconds since Jan. 1, 1970, 00:00 GMT.</p>

<p>%b The amount of disk space used for this file in
512-byte blocks. Since disk space is allocated in multiples
of the filesystem block size this is usually greater than
%s/1024, but it can also be smaller if the file is a sparse
file.</p>

by the C ctime function.</p>

<p>%Ck Files last status change time in the format
specified by k, which is the same as for %A.</p>

<p>%d Files depth in the directory tree; 0 means the file

<p>%D The device number on which the file exists (the
st_dev field of struct stat), in decimal.</p>

<p>%f Files name with any leading directories removed (only
the last element).</p>

<p>%F Type of the filesystem the file is on; this value can
be used for -fstype.</p>

<p>%g Files group name, or numeric group ID if the group
has no name.</p>

<p>%G Files numeric group ID.</p>

<p>%h Leading directories of files name (all but the last
ele- ment). If the file name contains no slashes (since it
is in the current directory) the %h specifier expands to
&quot;.&quot;.</p>

<p>%H Command line argument under which file was found.</p>

<p>%i Files inode number (in decimal).</p>

<p>%k The amount of disk space used for this file in 1K
blocks. Since disk space is allocated in multiples of the
filesystem block size this is usually greater than %s/1024,
but it can also be smaller if the file is a sparse file.</p>

<p>%l Object of symbolic link (empty string if file is not
a symbolic link).</p>

<p>%m Files permission bits (in octal). This option uses
the traditional numbers which most Unix implementations use,
but if your particular implementation uses an unusual
ordering of octal permissions bits, you will see a
difference between the actual value of the files mode and
the output of %m. Normally you will want to have a leading
zero on this number, and to do this, you should use the #
flag (as in, for example, %#m).</p>

<p>%M File s permissions (in symbolic form, as for ls).
This directive is supported in findutils 4.2.5 and
later.</p>

<p>%n Number of hard links to file.</p>

<p>%p Files name.</p>

<p>%P File s name with the name of the command line
argument under which it was found removed.</p>

<p>%s Files size in bytes.</p>

<p>%t Files last modification time in the format returned
by the C ctime function.</p>

<p>%Tk File s last modification time in the format
specified by k, which is the same as for %A.</p>

<p>%u Files user name, or numeric user ID if the user has
no name.</p>

<p>%U Files numeric user ID.</p>

<p>%y Files type (like in ls -l), U=unknown type (shouldnt
happen)</p>

<p>%Y File s type (like %y), plus follow symlinks: L=loop,
N=nonexistent</p>

<p>%Z (SELinux only) files security context.</p>

<p>A % character followed by any other character is
discarded (but the other character is printed).</p>

<p>The %m and %d directives support the # , 0 and + flags,
but the other directives do not, even if they print numbers.
Numeric directives that do not support these flags include
G, U, b, D, k and n. The - format flag is supported and
changes the align- ment of a field from right-justified
(which is the default) to left-justified.</p>

<p>See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for information about
how unusual characters in filenames are handled.</p>

<p>-prune If -depth is not given, true; if the file is a
directory, do not descend into it. If -depth is given,
false; no effect.</p>

<p>-quit Exit immediately. No child processes will be left
running, but no more paths specified on the command line
will be processed. For example, find /tmp/foo /tmp/bar
-print -quit will print only /tmp/foo. Any command lines
which have been built up with -execdir ... {} + will be
invoked before find exits. The exit status may or may not be
zero, depending on whether an error has already
occurred.</p>

<p>-ls True; list current file in ls -dils format on
standard output. The block counts are of 1K blocks, unless
the environment vari- able POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which
case 512-byte blocks are used. See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES
section for information about how unusual characters in
filenames are handled.</p>

<p>UNUSUAL FILENAMES Many of the actions of find result in
the printing of data which is under the control of other
users. This includes file names, sizes, modification times
and so forth. File names are a potential problem since they
can contain any character except and / . Unusual characters
in file names can do unexpected and often undesirable things
to your terminal (for example, changing the settings of your
function keys on some terminals). Unusual characters are
handled differently by various actions, as described
below.</p>

<p>-print0, -fprint0 Always print the exact filename,
unchanged, even if the output is going to a terminal.</p>

<p>-ls, -fls Unusual characters are always escaped. White
space, backslash, and double quote characters are printed
using C-style escaping , (for example using an octal escape.
Other printable characters (for -ls and -fls these are the
characters between octal 041 and 0176) are printed
as-is.</p>

<p>-printf, -fprintf If the output is not going to a
terminal, it is printed as-is. Otherwise, the result depends
on which directive is in use. The directives %D, %F, %g, %G,
%H, %Y, and %y expand to values which are not under control
of files owners, and so are printed as- is. The directives
%a, %b, %c, %d, %i, %k, %m, %M, %n, %s, %t, %u and %U have
values which are under the control of files own- ers but
which cannot be used to send arbitrary data to the ter-
minal, and so these are printed as-is. The directives %f,
%h, %l, %p and %P are quoted. This quoting is performed in
the same way as for GNU ls. This is not the same quoting
mechanism as the one used for -ls and -fls. If you are able
to decide what format to use for the output of find then it
is normally better to use as a terminator than to use
newline, as file names can contain white space and newline
characters.</p>

<p>-print, -fprint Quoting is handled in the same way as
for -printf and -fprintf. If you are using find in a script
or in a situation where the matched files might have
arbitrary names, you should consider using -print0 instead
of -print.</p>

<p>The -ok and -okdir actions print the current filename
as-is. This may change in a future release.</p>

<p>OPERATORS Listed in order of decreasing precedence:</p>

<p>( expr ) Force precedence.</p>

<p>! expr True if expr is false.</p>

<p>-not expr Same as ! expr, but not POSIX compliant.</p>

<p>expr1 expr2 Two expressions in a row are taken to be
joined with an implied &quot;and&quot;; expr2 is not
evaluated if expr1 is false.</p>

<p>expr1 -a expr2 Same as expr1 expr2.</p>

<p>expr1 -and expr2 Same as expr1 expr2, but not POSIX
compliant.</p>

<p>expr1 -o expr2 Or; expr2 is not evaluated if expr1 is
true.</p>

<p>expr1 -or expr2 Same as expr1 -o expr2, but not POSIX
compliant.</p>

<p>expr1 , expr2 List; both expr1 and expr2 are always
evaluated. The value of expr1 is discarded; the value of the
list is the value of expr2. The comma operator can be useful
for searching for several different types of thing, but
traversing the filesystem hierarchy only once. The -fprintf
action can be used to list the various matched items into
several different output files.</p>

<p>STANDARDS CONFORMANCE The following options are
specified in the POSIX standard (IEEE Std 1003.1, 2003
Edition):</p>

<p>-H This option is supported.</p>

<p>-L This option is supported.</p>

<p>-name This option is supported, but POSIX conformance
depends on the POSIX conformance of the system s fnmatch(3)
library function. As of findutils-4.2.2, shell
metacharacters (* . ? or [] for example) will match a
leading ., because IEEE PASC inter- pretation 126 requires
this. This is a change from previous versions of
findutils.</p>

<p>-type Supported. POSIX specifies b, c, d, l, p, f and s.
GNU find also supports D, representing a Door, where the OS
provides these.</p>

<p>-ok Supported. Interpretation of the response is not
locale-depen- dent (see ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES).</p>

<p>-newer Supported. If the file specified is a symbolic
link, it is always dereferenced. This is a change from
previous behaviour, which used to take the relevant time
from the symbolic link; see the HISTORY section below.</p>

<p>Other predicates The predicates -atime , -ctime, -depth,
-group, -links, -mtime, -nogroup, -nouser, -perm, -print,
-prune , -size, -user and -xdev, are all supported.</p>

<p>The POSIX standard specifies parentheses (, ), negation
! and the and and or operators (-a, -o).</p>

<p>All other options, predicates, expressions and so forth
are extensions beyond the POSIX standard. Many of these
extensions are not unique to GNU find, however.</p>

<p>The POSIX standard requires that</p>

<p>The find utility shall detect infinite loops; that is,
entering a previously visited directory that is an ancestor
of the last file encountered. When it detects an infinite
loop, find shall write a diagnostic message to standard
error and shall either recover its position in the hierarchy
or terminate.</p>

<p>The link count of directories which contain entries
which are hard links to an ancestor will often be lower than
they otherwise should be. This can mean that GNU find will
sometimes optimise away the visiting of a subdirectory which
is actually a link to an ancestor. Since find does not
actually enter such a subdirectory, it is allowed to avoid
emitting a diagnostic message. Although this behaviour may
be somewhat confusing, it is unlikely that anybody actually
depends on this behaviour. If the leaf optimisation has been
turned off with -noleaf, the directory entry will always be
examined and the diagnostic message will be issued where it
is appropriate. Symbolic links cannot be used to create
filesystem cycles as such, but if the -L option or the -fol-
low option is in use, a diagnostic message is issued when
find encoun- ters a loop of symbolic links. As with loops
containing hard links, the leaf optimisation will often mean
that find knows that it doesnt need to call stat() or
chdir() on the symbolic link, so this diagnostic is
frequently not necessary.</p>

<p>The -d option is supported for compatibility with
various BSD systems, but you should use the POSIX-compliant
option -depth instead.</p>

<p>The POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable does not affect
the behaviour of the -regex or -iregex tests because those
tests arent specified in the POSIX standard.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES LANG Provides a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or
null.</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE The POSIX standard specifies that this
variable affects the pat- tern matching to be used for the
-name option. GNU find uses the fnmatch(3) library function,
and so support for LC_COLLATE depends on the system
library.</p>

<p>POSIX also specifies that the LC_COLLATE environment
variable affects the interpretation of the users response to
the query issued by -ok , but this is not the case for GNU
find.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE This variable affects the treatment of
character classes used with the -name test, if the systems
fnmatch(3) library func- tion supports this. It has no
effect on the behaviour of the -ok expression.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determines the locale to be used for
internationalised messages.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determines the location of the
internationalisation message cat- alogues.</p>

<p>PATH Affects the directories which are searched to find
the executa- bles invoked by -exec, -execdir, -ok and
-okdir.</p>

<p>POSIXLY_CORRECT Determines the block size used by -ls
and -fls. If POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, blocks are units of 512
bytes. Other- wise they are units of 1024 bytes.</p>

<p>TZ Affects the time zone used for some of the
time-related format directives of -printf and -fprintf.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES find /tmp -name core -type f -print | xargs
/bin/rm -f</p>

<p>Find files named core in or below the directory /tmp and
delete them. Note that this will work incorrectly if there
are any filenames con- taining newlines, single or double
quotes, or spaces.</p>

<p>find /tmp -name core -type f -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm
-f</p>

<p>Find files named core in or below the directory /tmp and
delete them, processing filenames in such a way that file or
directory names con- taining single or double quotes, spaces
or newlines are correctly han- dled. The -name test comes
before the -type test in order to avoid having to call
stat(2) on every file.</p>

<p>find . -type f -exec file{;</p>

<p>Runs file on every file in or below the current
directory. Notice that the braces are enclosed in single
quote marks to protect them from interpretation as shell
script punctuation. The semicolon is simi- larly protected
by the use of a backslash, though ; could have been used in
that case also.</p>

<p>find / ( -perm -4000 -fprintf /root/suid.txt%#m %u %) ,
( -size +100M -fprintf /root/big.txt%-10s %)</p>

<p>Traverse the filesystem just once, listing setuid files
and directories into /root/suid.txt and large files into
/root/big.txt.</p>

<p>find $HOME -mtime 0</p>

<p>Search for files in your home directory which have been
modified in the last twenty-four hours. This command works
this way because the time since each file was last modified
is divided by 24 hours and any remainder is discarded. That
means that to match -mtime 0, a file will have to have a
modification in the past which is less than 24 hours
ago.</p>

<p>find . -perm 664</p>

<p>Search for files which have read and write permission
for their owner, and group, but which other users can read
but not write to. Files which meet these criteria but have
other permissions bits set (for example if someone can
execute the file) will not be matched.</p>

<p>find . -perm -664</p>

<p>Search for files which have read and write permission
for their owner and group, and which other users can read,
without regard to the pres- ence of any extra permission
bits (for example the executable bit). This will match a
file which has mode 0777, for example.</p>

<p>find . -perm /222</p>

<p>Search for files which are writable by somebody (their
owner, or their group, or anybody else).</p>

<p>find . -perm /220 find . -perm /u+w,g+w find . -perm
/u=w,g=w</p>

<p>All three of these commands do the same thing, but the
first one uses the octal representation of the file mode,
and the other two use the symbolic form. These commands all
search for files which are writable by either their owner or
their group. The files don t have to be writable by both the
owner and group to be matched; either will do.</p>

<p>find . -perm -220 find . -perm -g+w,u+w</p>

<p>Both these commands do the same thing; search for files
which are writable by both their owner and their group.</p>

<p>find . -perm -444 -perm /222 ! -perm /111 find . -perm
-a+r -perm /a+w ! -perm /a+x</p>

<p>These two commands both search for files that are
readable for every- body (-perm -444 or -perm -a+r), have at
least on write bit set (-perm /222 or -perm /a+w) but are
not executable for anybody (! -perm /111 and ! -perm /a+x
respectively)</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS find exits with status 0 if all files are
processed successfully, greater than 0 if errors occur. This
is deliberately a very broad description, but if the return
value is non-zero, you should not rely on the correctness of
the results of find.</p>

chmod(1), fnmatch(3), regex(7), stat(2), lstat(2), ls(1),

Info, or printed).</p>

<p>HISTORY As of findutils-4.2.2, shell metacharacters (*.
? or [] for exam- ple) used in filename patterns will match
a leading . , because IEEE POSIX interpretation 126 requires
this.</p>

<p>NON-BUGS $ find . -name *.c -print find: paths must
precede expression Usage: find [-H] [-L] [-P] [path...]
[expression]</p>

<p>This happens because *.c has been expanded by the shell
resulting in find actually receiving a command line like
this:</p>

<p>find . -name bigram.c code.c frcode.c locate.c
-print</p>

<p>That command is of course not going to work. Instead of
doing things this way, you should enclose the pattern in
quotes: $ find . -name &acute;*.c&acute; -print</p>

<p>BUGS The test -perm /000 currently matches no files, but
for greater consis- tency with -perm -000, this will be
changed to match all files; this change will probably be
made in early 2006. Meanwhile, a warning mes- sage is given
if you do this.</p>

<p>There are security problems inherent in the behaviour
that the POSIX standard specifies for find, which therefore
cannot be fixed. For example, the -exec action is inherently
insecure, and -execdir should be used instead. Please see
Finding Files for more information.</p>

<p>The best way to report a bug is to use the form at
http://savan- nah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=findutils. The reason
for this is that you will then be able to track progress in
fixing the problem. Other com- ments about find(1) and about
the findutils package in general can be sent to the
