<p>NAME nnrpd.track - file to specify hosts to be tracked
by nnrpd.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This file, which is located in &lt;pathetc
in inn.conf&gt;, specifies which hosts are to have their
activities recorded during an nnrpd session. The nnrpd
server reads it when first spawned by innd, provided reader-
track in inn.conf is true; otherwise this file is not
used.</p>

<p>Entries consist of one host specification per line, each
line having two fields, separated by a colon:</p>

<p>host:identity</p>

<p>The first field is either the FQDN of a host, or a
domain name (in the form *.domain.com).</p>

<p>The second field is simply a segment of text which may
be used to more easily identify the client, typically an
e-mail address or other iden- tifying mark.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>nasty.foo.com:nasty@foo.com
*.bar.com:VeryNastyClient</p>
