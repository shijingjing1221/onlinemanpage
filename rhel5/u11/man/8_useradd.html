<p>USERADD(8) System Management Commands USERADD(8)</p>

<p>NAME useradd - create a new user or update default new
user information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS useradd [options] LOGIN</p>

<p>useradd -D</p>

<p>useradd -D [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When invoked without the -D option, the
useradd command creates a new user account using the values
specified on the command line and the default values from
the system. Depending on command line options, the useradd
command will update system files and may also create the new
user s home directory and copy initial files. The version
provided with Red Hat Linux will create a group for each
user added to the system by default.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options which apply to the useradd command
are:</p>

<p>-c, --comment COMMENT Any text string. It is generally a
short description of the login, and is currently used as the
field for the user s full name.</p>

<p>-b, --base-dir BASE_DIR The default base directory for
the system if -d dir is not specified. BASE_DIR is
concatenated with the account name to define the home
directory. The BASE_DIR must exist otherwise the home
directory cannot be created.</p>

<p>-d, --home HOME_DIR The new user will be created using
HOME_DIR as the value for the user s login directory. The
default is to append the LOGIN name to BASE_DIR and use that
as the login directory name. The parent directory of
HOME_DIR must exist otherwise the home directory cannot be
created.</p>

<p>-e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE The date on which the user
account will be disabled. The date is specified in the
format YYYY-MM-DD.</p>

<p>-f, --inactive INACTIVE The number of days after a
password expires until the account is permanently disabled.
A value of 0 disables the account as soon as the password
has expired, and a value of -1 disables the feature. The
default value is -1.</p>

<p>-g, --gid GROUP The group name or number of the user s
initial login group. The group name must exist. A group
number must refer to an already existing group.
/etc/default/useradd.</p>

<p>-G, --groups GROUP1[,GROUP2,...[,GROUPN]]] A list of
supplementary groups which the user is also a member of.
Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no
intervening whitespace. The groups are subject to the same
restrictions as the group given with the -g option. The
default is for the user to belong only to the initial
group.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display help message and exit.</p>

<p>-M The users home directory will not be created, even if
the system wide settings from /etc/login.defs is to create
home dirs.</p>

<p>-m, --create-home The users home directory will be
created if it does not exist. The files contained in
SKEL_DIR will be copied to the home directory if the -k
option is used, otherwise the files contained in /etc/skel
will be used instead. Any directories contained in SKEL_DIR
or /etc/skel will be created in the users home directory as
well. The -k option is only valid in conjunction with the -m
option. The default is to not create the directory and to
not copy any files.</p>

<p>-l Do not add the user to the last login log file. This
is an option added by Red Hat.</p>

<p>-n A group having the same name as the user being added
to the system will be created by default. This option will
turn off this Red Hat Linux specific behavior. When this
option is used, users by default will be placed in whatever
group is specified in /etc/default/useradd. If no default
group is defined, group 1 will be used.</p>

<p>-K, --key KEY=VALUE Overrides /etc/login.defs defaults
(UID_MIN, UID_MAX, UMASK, PASS_MAX_DAYS and others).</p>

<p>Example: -K PASS_MAX_DAYS=-1 can be used when creating
system account to turn off password ageing, even though
system account has no password at all. Multiple -K options
can be specified, e.g.: -K UID_MIN=100 -K UID_MAX=499</p>

<p>Note: -K UID_MIN=10,UID_MAX=499 doesnt work yet.</p>

<p>-o, --non-unique Allow the creation of a user account
with a duplicate (non-unique) UID.</p>

<p>-p, --password PASSWORD The encrypted password, as
returned by crypt(3). The default is to disable the
account.</p>

<p>-r This flag is used to create a system account. That
is, a user with a UID lower than the value of UID_MIN
defined in /etc/login.defs and whose password does not
expire. Note that useradd will not create a home directory
for such an user, regardless of the default setting in
/etc/login.defs. You have to specify -m option if you want a
home directory for a system account to be created. This is
an option added by Red Hat</p>

<p>-s, --shell SHELL The name of the users login shell. The
default is to leave this field blank, which causes the
system to select the default login shell.</p>

<p>-u, --uid UID The numerical value of the users ID. This
value must be unique, unless the -o option is used. The
value must be non-negative. The default is to use ID value
equal to or greater than UID_MIN and smaller then UID_MAX.
Values between 0 and UID_MIN are typically reserved for
system accounts.</p>

<p>-Z, --selinux-user SEUSER The SELinux user for the users
login. The default is to leave this field blank, which
causes the system to select the default SELinux user.</p>

<p>Changing the default values When invoked with the -D
option, useradd will either display the current default
values, or update the default values from the command line.
The valid options are</p>

<p>-b HOME_DIR The initial path prefix for a new users home
directory. The users name will be affixed to the end of
HOME_DIR to create the new directory name if the -d option
is not used when creating a new account.</p>

<p>-e EXPIRE_DATE The date on which the user account is
disabled.</p>

<p>-f INACTIVE The number of days after a password has
expired before the account will be disabled.</p>

<p>-g, --gid GROUP The group name or ID for a new users
initial group. The named group must exist, and a numerical
group ID must have an existing entry.</p>

<p>-s, --shell SHELL The name of the new user s login
shell. The named program will be used for all future new
user accounts.</p>

<p>If no options are specified, useradd displays the
current default values.</p>

<p>NOTES The system administrator is responsible for
placing the default user files in the /etc/skel/ directory.
This version of useradd was modified by Red Hat to suit Red
Hat user/group conventions.</p>

<p>CAVEATS You may not add a user to a NIS group. This must
be performed on the NIS server.</p>

<p>Similarly, if the username already exists in an external
user database such as NIS, useradd will deny the user
account creation request.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd User account information.</p>

<p>/etc/shadow Secure user account information.</p>

<p>/etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/gshadow Secure group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/default/useradd Default values for account
creation.</p>

<p>/etc/skel/ Directory containing default files.</p>

<p>/etc/login.defs Shadow password suite configuration.</p>

<p>EXIT VALUES The useradd command exits with the following
values:</p>

<p>0 success</p>

<p>1 cant update password file</p>

<p>2 invalid command syntax</p>

<p>3 invalid argument to option</p>

<p>4 UID already in use (and no -o)</p>

<p>6 specified group doesnt exist</p>

<p>9 username already in use</p>

<p>10 cant update group file</p>
