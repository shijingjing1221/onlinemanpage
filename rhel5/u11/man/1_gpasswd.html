<p>NAME gpasswd - administer the /etc/group file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gpasswd group</p>

<p>gpasswd -a user group</p>

<p>gpasswd -d user group</p>

<p>gpasswd -R group</p>

<p>gpasswd -r group</p>

<p>gpasswd [-A user,...] [-M user,...] group</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gpasswd is used to administer the /etc/group
file (and /etc/gshadow file if compiled with SHADOWGRP
defined). Every group can have administrators, members and a
password. System administrator can use -A option to define
group administrator(s) and -M option to define members and
has all rights of group administrators and members.</p>

<p>Notes about group passwords Group passwords are an
inherent security problem since more than one person is
permitted to know the password. However, groups are a useful
tool for permitting co-operation between different
users.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Group administrator can add and delete users
using -a and -d options respectively. Administrators can use
-r option to remove group password. When no password is set
only group members can use newgrp to join the group. Option
-R disables access via a password to the group through
newgrp command (however members will still be able to switch
to this group).</p>

<p>gpasswd called by a group administrator with group name
only prompts for the group password. If password is set the
members can still newgrp(1) without a password, non-members
must supply the password.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/gshadow Secure group account information.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO newgrp(1), gshadow(5), groupadd(8),
groupdel(8), groupmod(8), grpck(8), group(5).</p>
