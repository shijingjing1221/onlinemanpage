<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>OPTIONS dev=device</p>

<p>-D device</p>

<p>-device device uses device as the source for CDDA
reading. For example /dev/cdrom for the cooked_ioctl
interface and Bus,ID,Lun for the generic_scsi interface. The
device has to correspond with the interface setting (see
below).</p>

<p>Using the cooked_ioctl is not recommended as this makes
cdda2wav mainly depend on the audio extraction quality of
the operating system which is usually extremely bad.</p>

<p>The setting of the environment variable CDDA_DEVICE is
overrid- den by this option.</p>

<p>-A auxdevice</p>

<p>-auxdevice auxdevice uses auxdevice as CDROM drive for
ioctl usage.</p>

<p>-I interface</p>

<p>-interface interface specifies the interface for CDROM
access: generic_scsi or (on Linux, and FreeBSD systems)
cooked_ioctl.</p>

<p>-c channels --channels uses 1 for mono, or 2 for stereo
recording, or s for stereo recording with both channels
swapped.</p>

<p>-s --stereo sets to stereo recording.</p>

<p>-m --mono sets to mono recording.</p>

<p>-x --max sets maximum (CD) quality.</p>

<p>-b bits --bits-per-sample sets bits per sample per
channel: 8, 12 or 16.</p>

<p>-r rate --rate sets rate in samples per second. Possible
values are listed with the -R option.</p>

<p>-a divider --divider sets rate to 44100Hz / divider.
Possible values are listed with the -R option.</p>

<p>-R --dump-rates shows a list of all sample rates and
their dividers.</p>

<p>-P sectors --set-overlap sets the initial number of
overlap sectors for jitter correc- tion.</p>

<p>-n sectors --sectors-per-request reads sectors per
request.</p>

<p>-l buffers --buffers-in-ring uses a ring buffer with
buffers total.</p>

<p>-t track+endtrack --track selects the start track and
optionally the end track.</p>

<p>-i index --index selects the start index.</p>

<p>-o offset --offset starts offset sectors behind start
track (one sector equivalents 1/75 seconds).</p>

<p>-O audiotype --output-format can be wav (for wav files)
or aiff (for apple/sgi aiff files) or aifc (for apple/sgi
aifc files) or au or sun (for sun .au PCM files) or cdr or
raw (for headerless files to be used for cd writers).</p>

<p>-C endianess --cdrom-endianess sets endianess of the
input samples to little, big or guess to override
defaults.</p>

<p>-E endianess --output-endianess sets endianess of the
output samples to little or big to override defaults.</p>

<p>-d duration --duration sets recording time in seconds or
frames. Frames (sectors) are indicated by a f suffix (like
75f for 75 sectors). 0 sets the time for whole track.</p>

<p>-B --bulk --alltracks copies each track into a seperate
file.</p>

<p>-w --wait waits for signal, then start recording.</p>

<p>-F --find-extremes finds extrem amplitudes in
samples.</p>

<p>-G --find-mono finds if input samples are in mono.</p>

<p>-T --deemphasize undo the effect of pre-emphasis in the
input samples.</p>

<p>-e --echo copies audio data to sound device e.g.
/dev/dsp.</p>

<p>-p percentage --set-pitch changes pitch of audio data
copied to sound device.</p>

<p>-v itemlist --verbose-level prints verbose information
about the CD. Level is a list of comma seperated suboptions.
Each suboption controls the type of information to be
reported.</p>


<p>+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
|Suboption | Description |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| disable | no information is given, warnings appear however
| | all | all information is given | | toc | show table of
contents | | summary | show a summary of the recording
parameters | | indices | determine and display index offsets

Recording Codes ISRC | | sectors | show the table of
contents in start sector notation | | titles | show the
table of contents with track titles (when available) |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
-N --no-write does not write to a file, it just reads (for
debugging pur- poses).</p>

<p>-J --info-only does not write to a file, it just gives
information about the disc.</p>

<p>-L cddb mode --cddb does a cddbp album- and track title
lookup based on the cddb id. The parameter cddb mode defines
how multiple entries shall be handled.</p>


<p>+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|Parameter | Description |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| 0 | interactive mode. The user selects the entry to use. |
| 1 | first fit mode. The first entry is taken
unconditionally. |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
cddbp-server=servername sets the server to be contacted for
title lookups.</p>

<p>cddbp-port=portnumber sets the port number to be used
for title lookups.</p>

<p>-H --no-infofile does not write an info file and a cddb
file.</p>

<p>-g --gui formats the output to be better parsable by gui
frontends.</p>

<p>-M count --md5 enables calculation of MD-5 checksum for
count bytes from a beginning of a track.</p>

<p>-S speed --speed sets the cdrom device to one of the
selectable speeds for read- ing.</p>

<p>-q --quiet quiet operation, no screen output.</p>

<p>-Q --silent-SCSI suppress SCSI command error reports to
the console. This is mainly used for guis.</p>

<p>-scanbus Scan all SCSI devices on all SCSI busses and
print the inquiry strings. This option may be used to find
SCSI address of the CD/DVD-Recorder on a system. The numbers
printed out as labels are computed by: bus * 100 +
target</p>

<p>-paranoia use the paranoia library instead of cdda2wav s
routines for reading.</p>

<p>-h --help display version of cdda2wav on standard
output.</p>

<p>Defaults depend on the Makefile and environment variable
settings (currently CDDA_DEVICE ).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CDDA_DEVICE is used to set the
device name. The device naming is com- patible with Joerg
Schillings cdrecord package.</p>

<p>CDDBP_SERVER is used for cddbp title lookups when
supplied.</p>

<p>CDDBP_PORT is used for cddbp title lookups when
supplied.</p>

<p>RSH If the RSH environment variable is present, the
remote connec- tion will not be created via rcmd(3) but by
calling the program pointed to by RSH. Use e.g.
RSH=/usr/bin/ssh to create a secure shell connection.</p>

<p>Note that this forces cdda2wav to create a pipe to the
rsh(1) program and disallows cdda2wav to directly access the
network socket to the remote server. This makes it
impossible to set up performance parameters and slows down
the connection compared to a root initiated rcmd(3)
connection.</p>

<p>RSCSI If the RSCSI environment variable is present, the
remote SCSI server will not be the program
/opt/schily/sbin/rscsi but the program pointed to by RSCSI.
Note that the remote SCSI server program name will be
ignored if you log in using an account that has been created
with a remote SCSI server program as login shell.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES cdda2wav uses the following exit codes to
indicate various degress of success:</p>


<p>+---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Exitcode | Description |
+---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0 | no errors encountered, successful operation. | | 1 |

+---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
DISCUSSION cdda2wav is able to read parts of an audio CD or
multimedia CDROM (con- taining audio parts) directly
digitally. These parts can be written to a file, a pipe, or
to a sound device.</p>

<p>cdda2wav stands for CDDA to WAV (where CDDA stands for
compact disc digital audio and WAV is a sound sample format
introduced by MS Win- dows). It allows copying CDDA audio
data from the CDROM drive into a file in WAV or other
formats.</p>

<p>The latest versions try to get higher real-time
scheduling priorities to ensure smooth (uninterrupted)
operation. These priorities are avail- able for super users
and are higher than those of normal processes. Thus delays
are minimized.</p>

<p>If your CDROM is on device DEV and it is loaded with an
audio CD, you may simply invoke cdda2wav dev=DEV and it will
create the sound file audio.wav recording the whole track
beginning with track 1 in stereo at 16 bit at 44100 Hz
sample rate, if your file system has enough space free.
Otherwise recording time will be limited. For details see
files README and README.INSTALL</p>

<p>HINTS ON OPTIONS Options Most of the options are used to
control the format of the WAV file. In the following text
all of them are described.</p>

<p>Select Device -D device selects the CDROM drive device
to be used. The speci- fier given should correspond to the
selected interface (see below). CHANGE! For the cooked_ioctl
interface this is the cdrom device descriptor as before. The
SCSI devices used with the generic SCSI interface however
are now addressed with their SCSI-Bus, SCSI-Id, and SCSI-Lun
instead of the generic SCSI device descriptor!!! One example
for a SCSI CDROM drive on bus 0 with SCSI ID 3 and lun 0 is
-D0,3,0.</p>

<p>Select Auxiliary device -A auxdevice is necessary for
CD-Extra handling. For Non-SCSI- CDROM drives this is the
same device as given by -D (see above). For SCSI-CDROM
drives it is the CDROM drive (SCSI) device (i.e. /dev/sr0 )
corresponding to the SCSI device (i.e. 0,3,0 ). It has to
match the device used for sampling.</p>

<p>Select Interface -I interface selects the CDROM drive
interface. For SCSI drives use generic_scsi (cooked_ioctl
may not yet be available for all devices): generic_scsi and
cooked_ioctl. The first uses the generic SCSI interface, the
latter uses the ioctl of the CDROM driver. The latter
variant works only when the kernel driver supports CDDA
reading. This entry has to match the selected CDROM device
(see above).</p>

<p>Enable echo to soundcard -e copies audio data to the
sound card while recording, so you hear it nearly
simultaneously. The soundcard gets the same data that is
recorded. This is time critical, so it works best with the
-q option. To use cdda2wav as a pseudo CD player without
recording in a file you could use cdda2wav -q -e -t2 -d0 -N
to play the whole second track. This feature reduces the
recording speed to at most onefold speed. You cannot make
better record- ings than your sound card can play (since the
same data is used).</p>

<p>Change pitch of echoed audio -p percentage changes the
pitch of all audio echoed to a sound card. Only the copy to
the soundcard is affected, the recorded audio samples in a
file remain the same. Normal pitch, which is the default, is
given by 100%. Lower percentages correspond to lower
pitches, i.e. -p 50 transposes the audio output one octave
lower. See also the script pitchplay as an example. This
option was contributed by Raul Sobon.</p>

<p>Select mono or stereo recording -m or -c 1 selects mono
recording (both stereo channels are mixed), -s or -c 2 or -c
s selects stereo recording. Parameter s will swap both sound
channels.</p>

<p>Select maximum quality -x will set stereo, 16 bits per
sample at 44.1 KHz (full CD quality). Note that other format
options given later can change this setting.</p>

<p>Select sample quality -b 8 specifies 8 bit (1 Byte) for
each sample in each channel; -b 12 specifies 12 bit (2 Byte)
for each sample in each channel; -b 16 specifies 16 bit (2
Byte) for each sample in each channel (Ensure that your
sample player or sound card is capable of playing 12-bit or
16-bit samples). Selecting 12 or 16 bits dou- bles file
size. 12-bit samples are aligned to 16-bit samples, so they
waste some disk space.</p>

<p>Select sample rate -r samplerate selects a sample rate.
samplerate can be in a range between 44100 and 900. Option
-R lists all available rates.</p>

<p>Select sample rate divider -a divider selects a sample
rate divider. divider can be mini- mally 1 and maximally
50.5 and everything between in steps of 0.5. Option -R lists
all available rates.</p>

<p>To make the sound smoother at lower sampling rates,
cdda2wav sums over n samples (where n is the specific
dividend). So for 22050 Hertz output we have to sum over 2
samples, for 900 Hertz we have to sum over 49 samples. This
cancels higher frequen- cies. Standard sector size of an
audio CD (ignoring additional information) is 2352 Bytes. In
order to finish summing for an output sample at sector
boundaries the rates above have to be choosen. Arbitrary
sampling rates in high quality would require some
interpolation scheme, which needs much more sophisticated
programming.</p>

<p>List a table of all sampling rates -R shows a list of
all sample rates and their dividers. Dividers can range from
1 to 50.5 in steps of 0.5.</p>

<p>Select start track and optionally end track -t n+m
selects n as the start track and optionally m as the last
track of a range to be recorded. These tracks must be from
the table of contents. This sets the track where recording
begins. Recording can advance through the following tracks
as well (lim- ited by the optional end track or otherwise
depending on record- ing time). Whether one file or
different files are then created depends on the -B option
(see below).</p>

<p>Select start index -i n selects the index to start
recording with. Indices other than 1 will invoke the index
scanner, which will take some time to find the correct start
position. An offset may be given addi- tionally (see
below).</p>

<p>Set recording time -d n sets recording time to n seconds
or set recording time for whole track if n is zero. In order
to specify the duration in frames (sectors) also, the
argument can have an appended f. Then the numerical argument
is to be taken as frames (sectors) rather than seconds.
Please note that if track ranges are being used they define
the recording time as well thus overriding any -d option
specified times.</p>

<p>Recording time is defined as the time the generated
sample will play (at the defined sample rate). Since its
related to the amount of generated samples, its not the time
of the sampling process itself (which can be less or more).
Its neither strictly coupled with the time information on
the audio CD (shown by your hifi CD player). Differences can
occur by the usage of the -o option (see below). Notice that
recording time will be shortened, unless enough disk space
exists. Recording can be aborted at anytime by pressing the
break character (sig- nal SIGQUIT).</p>

<p>Record all tracks of a complete audio CD in seperate
files -B copies each track into a seperate file. A base name
can be given. File names have an appended track number and
an extension corresponding to the audio format. To record
all audio tracks of a CD, use a sufficient high duration
(i.e. -d99999).</p>

<p>Set start sector offset -o sectors increments start
sector of the track by sectors. By this option you are able
to skip a certain amount at the beginning of a track so you
can pick exactly the part you want. Each sector runs for
1/75 seconds, so you have very fine con- trol. If your
offset is so high that it would not fit into the current
track, a warning message is issued and the offset is
ignored. Recording time is not reduced. (To skip
introductory quiet passages automagically, use the -w option
see below.)</p>

<p>Wait for signal option -w Turning on this option will
suppress all silent output at startup, reducing possibly
file size. cdda2wav will watch for any signal in the output
signal and switches on writing to file.</p>

<p>Find extrem samples -F Turning on this option will
display the most negative and the most positive sample value
found during recording for both chan- nels. This can be
useful for readjusting the volume. The values shown are not
reset at track boundaries, they cover the complete sampling
process. They are taken from the original samples and have
the same format (i.e. they are independent of the selected
output format).</p>

<p>Find if input samples are in mono -G If this option is
given, input samples for both channels will be compared. At
the end of the program the result is printed. Differences in
the channels indicate stereo, otherwise when both channels
are equal it will indicate mono.</p>

<p>Undo the pre-emphasis in the input samples -T Some older
audio CDs are recorded with a modified frequency response
called pre-emphasis. This is found mostly in classical
recordings. The correction can be seen in the flags of the
Table Of Contents often. But there are recordings, that show
this set- ting only in the subchannels. If this option is
given, the index scanner will be started, which reads the
q-subchannel of each track. If pre-emphasis is indicated in
the q-subchannel of a track, but not in the TOC,
pre-emphasis will be assumed to be present, and subsequently
a reverse filtering is done for this track before the
samples are written into the audio file.</p>

<p>Set audio format -O audiotype can be wav (for wav files)
or au or sun (for sun PCM files) or cdr or raw (for
headerless files to be used for cd writers). All file
samples are coded in linear pulse code modu- lation (as done
in the audio compact disc format). This holds for all audio
formats. Wav files are compatible to Wind*ws sound files,
they have lsb,msb byte order as being used on the audio cd.
The default filename extension is .wav . Sun type files are
not like the older common logarithmically coded .au files,
but instead as mentioned above linear PCM is used. The byte
order is msb,lsb to be compatible. The default filename
extension is .au . The AIFF and the newer variant AIFC from
the Apple/SGI world store their samples in bigendian format
(msb,lsb). In AIFC no compression is used. Finally the
easiest format , the cdr aka raw format. It is done per
default in msb,lsb byte order to satisfy the order wanted by
most cd writ- ers. Since there is no header information in
this format, the sample parameters can only be identified by
playing the samples on a soundcard or similiar. The default
filename extension is .cdr or .raw.</p>

<p>Select cdrom drive reading speed -S speed allows to
switch the cdrom drive to a certain level of speed in order
to reduce read errors. The argument is transfered verbatim
to the drive. Details depend very much on the cdrom drives.
An argument of 0 for example is often the default speed of
the drive, a value of 1 often selects single speed.</p>

<p>Enable MD5 checksums -M count enables calculation of
MD-5 checksum for count bytes from the beginning of a track.
This was introduced for quick comparisons of tracks.</p>

<p>Use Montys libparanoia for reading of sectors -paranoia
selects an alternate way of extracting audio sectors. Montys
library is used with the following default options:</p>

<p>PARANOIA_MODE_FULL, but without
PARANOIA_MODE_NEVERSKIP</p>

<p>for details see Montys libparanoia documentation. In
this case the option -P has no effect.</p>

<p>Do linear or overlapping reading of sectors (This
applies unless option -paranoia is used.) -P sectors sets
the given number of sectors for initial overlap sampling for
jitter correction. Two cases are to be distinguished. For
nonzero values, some sectors are read twice to enable
cdda2wavs jitter correction. If an argument of zero is
given, no overlap sampling will be used. For nonzero overlap
sectors cdda2wav dynamically adjusts the setting during
sampling (like cdparanoia does). If no match can be found,
cdda2wav retries the read with an increased overlap. If the
amount of jitter is lower than the current overlapped
samples, cdda2wav reduces the overlap set- ting, resulting
in a higher reading speed. The argument given has to be
lower than the total number of sectors per request (see
option -n below). Cdda2wav will check this setting and
issues a error message otherwise. The case of zero sectors
is nice on low load situations or errorfree (perfect) cdrom
drives and perfect (not scratched) audio cds.</p>

<p>Set the transfer size -n sectors will set the transfer
size to the specified sectors per request.</p>

<p>Set number of ring buffer elements -l buffers will
allocate the specified number of ring buffer elements.</p>

<p>Set endianess of input samples -C endianess will
override the default settings of the input format. Endianess
can be set explicitly to &quot;little&quot; or
&quot;big&quot; or to the automatic endianess detection
based on voting with &quot;guess&quot;.</p>

<p>Set endianess of output samples -E endianess (endianess
can be &quot;little&quot; or &quot;big&quot;) will override
the default settings of the output format.</p>

<p>Verbose option -v itemlist prints more information. A
list allows selection of different information items.</p>

<p>disable keeps quiet</p>

<p>toc displays the table of contents</p>

<p>summary displays a summary of recording parameters</p>

<p>indices invokes the index scanner and displays start
positions of indices</p>

<p>catalog retrieves and displays a media catalog
number</p>

<p>trackid retrieves and displays international standard
recording codes</p>

<p>sectors displays track start positions in absolute
sector nota- tion</p>

<p>To combine several requests just list the suboptions
seperated with commas.</p>

<p>The table of contents The display will show the table of
contents with number of tracks and total time (displayed in
mm:ss.hh format, mm=minutes, ss=seconds, hh=rounded 1/100
seconds). The following list dis- plays track number and
track time for each entry. The summary gives a line per
track describing the type of the track.</p>

<p>track preemphasis copypermitted tracktype chans</p>

<p>The track column holds the track number. preemphasis
shows if that track has been given a non linear frequency
response. NOTE: You can undo this effect with the -T option.
copy-permit- ted indicates if this track is allowed to copy.
tracktype can be data or audio. On multimedia CDs (except
hidden track CDs) both of them should be present. channels
is defined for audio tracks only. There can be two or four
channels.</p>

<p>No file output -N this debugging option switches off
writing to a file.</p>

<p>No infofile generation -H this option switches off
creation of an info file and a cddb file.</p>

<p>Generation of simple output for gui frontends -g this
option switches on simple line formatting, which is needed
to support gui frontends (like xcd-roast).</p>

<p>Verbose SCSI logging -V this option switches on logging
of SCSI commands. This will produce a lot of output (when
SCSI devices are being used). This is needed for debugging
purposes. The format is the same as being used with the
cdrecord program from Joerg Schilling. I will not describe
it here.</p>

<p>Quiet option -q suppresses all screen output except
error messages. That reduces cpu time resources.</p>

<p>Just show information option -J does not write a file,
it only prints information about the disc (depending on the
-v option). This is just for information purposes.</p>

<p>CDDBP support Lookup album and track titles option -L
cddbp mode Cdda2wav tries to retrieve performer, album-, and
track titles from a cddbp server. The default server right
now is freedb.freedb.org. It is planned to have more control
over the server handling later. The parameter defines how
multiple entries are handled:</p>

<p>0 interactive mode, the user chooses one of the
entries.</p>

<p>1 take the first entry without asking.</p>

<p>Set server for title lookups cddbp-server servername
When using -L or --cddb, the server being contacted can be
set with this option.</p>

<p>Set portnumber for title lookups cddbp-port portnumber
When using -L or --cddb, the server port being contacted can
be set with this option.</p>

<p>HINTS ON USAGE Don t create samples you cannot read.
First check your sample player software and sound card
hardware. I experienced problems with very low sample rates
(stereo &lt;= 1575 Hz, mono &lt;= 3675 Hz) when trying to
play them with standard WAV players for sound blaster (maybe
they are not legal in WAV format). Most CD-Writers insist on
audio samples in a bigendian format. Now cdda2wav supports
the -E endianess option to control the endianess of the
written samples.</p>

<p>If your hardware is fast enough to run cdda2wav
uninterrupted and your CD drive is one of the perfect ones,
you will gain speed when switch- ing all overlap sampling
off with the -P 0 option. Further fine tuning can be done
with the -n sectors option. You can specify how much sec-
tors should be requested in one go.</p>

<p>Cdda2wav supports pipes now. Use a filename of - to let
cdda2wav output its samples to standard output.</p>

<p>Conversion to other sound formats can be done using the
sox program package (although the use of sox -x to change
the byte order of samples should be no more necessary; see
option -E to change the output byte- order).</p>

<p>If you want to sample more than one track into different
files in one run, this is currently possible with the -B
option. When recording time exceeds the track limit a new
file will be opened for the next track.</p>

<p>FILES Cdda2wav can generate a lot of files for various
purposes.</p>

<p>Audio files:</p>

<p>There are audio files containing samples with default
extensions These files are not generated when option (-N) is
given. Multiple files may be written when the bulk copy
option (-B) is used. Individual file names can be given as
arguments. If the number of file names given is sufficient
to cover all included audio tracks, the file names will be
used verbatim. Otherwise, if there are less file names than
files needed to write the included tracks, the part of the
file name before the extension is extended with _dd where dd
represents the current track number.</p>

<p>Cddb and Cdindex files:</p>

<p>If cdda2wav detects cd-extra or cd-text (album/track)
title informa- tion, then .cddb and .cdindex files are
generated unless suppressed by the option -H. They contain
suitable formatted entries for submission to audio cd track
title databases in the internet. The CDINDEX and CDDB(tm)
systems are currently supported. For more information please
visit www.musicbrainz.org and www.freedb.com.</p>

<p>Inf files:</p>

<p>The inf files are describing the sample files and the
part from the audio cd, it was taken from. They are a means
to transfer information to a cd burning program like
cdrecord. For example, if the original audio cd had
pre-emphasis enabled, and cdda2wav -T did remove the pre-
emphasis, then the inf file has pre-emphasis not set (since
the audio file does not have it anymore), while the .cddb
and the .cdindex have pre-emphasis set as the original
does.</p>

<p>WARNING IMPORTANT: it is prohibited to sell copies of
copyrighted material by noncopyright holders. This program
may not be used to circumvent copy- rights. The user
acknowledges this constraint when using the software.</p>

<p>BUGS Generation of md5 checksums is currently
broken.</p>

<p>Performance may not be optimal on slower systems.</p>

<p>The index scanner may give timeouts.</p>

<p>The resampling (rate conversion code) uses polynomial
interpolation, which is not optimal.</p>

<p>Cdda2wav should use threads.</p>

<p>Cdda2wav currently cannot sample hidden audio tracks
(track 1 index 0).</p>
