<p>SEM_OPEN(3) Linux Programmer s Manual SEM_OPEN(3)</p>

<p>NAME sem_open - initialise and open a named
semaphore</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;semaphore.h&gt;</p>

<p>sem_t *sem_open(const char *name, int oflag); sem_t
*sem_open(const char *name, int oflag, mode_t mode, unsigned
int value);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sem_open() creates a new POSIX semaphore or
opens an existing semaphore. The semaphore is identified by
name. For details of the construction of name, see
sem_overview(7).</p>

<p>The oflag argument specifies flags that control the
operation of the call. If O_CREAT is specified in oflag,
then the semaphore is created if it does not already exist.
The owner (user ID) of the semaphore is set to the effective
user ID of the calling process. The group owner- ship (group
ID) is set to the effective group ID of the calling pro-
cess. If both O_CREAT and O_EXCL are specified in oflag,
then an error is returned if a semaphore with the given name
already exists.</p>

<p>If O_CREAT is specified in oflag, then two additional
arguments must be supplied. The mode argument specifies the
permissions to be placed on the new semaphore, as for
open(2). The permissions settings are masked against the
process umask. Both read and write permission should be
granted to each class of user that will access the
semaphore. The value argument specifies the initial value
for the new semaphore. If O_CREAT is specified, and a
semaphore with the given name already exists, then mode and
value are ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, sem_open() returns the address
of the new semaphore; this address is used when calling
other semaphore-related functions. On error, sem_open()
returns SEM_FAILED, with errno set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCESS The semaphore exists, but the caller does
not have permission to open it.</p>

<p>EEXIST Both O_CREAT and O_EXCL were specified in oflag,
but a semaphore with this name already exists.</p>

<p>EINVAL value was greater than SEM_VALUE_MAX.</p>

<p>EMFILE The process already has the maximum number of
files and open.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG name was too long.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>ENOENT The O_CREAT flag was not specified in oflag, and
no semaphore with this name exists.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>
