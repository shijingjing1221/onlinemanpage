<p>MODPROBE.CONF(5) MODPROBE.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME modprobe.conf, modprobe.d - Configuration
file/directory for modprobe</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Because the modprobe command can add or
remove extra more than one mod- ule, due to module
dependencies, we need a method of specifying what options
are to be used with those modules. /etc/modprobe.conf (or,
if that does not exist, all files under the /etc/modprobe.d
directory) specifies those options, as required. It can also
be used to create convenient aliases: alternate names for a
module. Finally, it can override the normal modprobe
behavior altogether, for those with very special
requirements (such as inserting more than one module).</p>

<p>Note that module and alias names (like other module
names) can have - or _ in them: both are interchangable
throughout all the module com- mands.</p>

<p>The format of modprobe.conf and files under modprobe.d
is simple: one command per line, with blank lines and lines
starting with # ignored (useful for adding comments). A at
the end of a line causes it to continue on the next line,
which makes the file a bit neater.</p>

<p>The syntax is a simplification of modules.conf, used in
2.4 kernels and earlier.</p>

<p>COMMANDS alias wildcard modulename This allows you to
give alternate names for a module. For exam- ple:
&quot;alias my-mod really_long_modulename&quot; means you
can use &quot;modprobe my-mod&quot; instead of
&quot;modprobe really_long_modulename&quot;. You can also
use shell-style wildcards, so &quot;alias my-mod*
really_long_modulename&quot; means that &quot;modprobe
my-mod-something&quot; has the same effect. You cant have
aliases to other aliases (that way lies madness), but
aliases can have options, which will be added to any other
options.</p>

<p>Note that modules can also contain their own aliases,
which you can see using modinfo. These aliases are used as a
last resort (ie. if there is no real module, install,
remove, or alias com- mand in the configuration).</p>

<p>options modulename option... This command allows you to
add options to the module modulename (which might be an
alias) every time it is inserted into the kernel: whether
directly (using modprobe modulename, or because the module
being inserted depends on this module.</p>

<p>All options are added together: they can come from an
option for the module itself, for an alias, and on the
command line.</p>

<p>install modulename command... This is the most powerful
primitive in modprobe.conf: it tells modprobe to run your
command instead of inserting the module in the kernel as
normal. The command can be any shell command: this allows
you to do any kind of complex processing you might wish. For
example, if the module &quot;fred&quot; worked better with
the module &quot;barney&quot; already installed (but it didn
t depend on it, so modprobe wont automatically load it), you
could say &quot;install fred /sbin/modprobe barney;
/sbin/modprobe --ignore-install fred&quot;, which would do
what you wanted. Note the --ignore- install, which stops the
second modprobe from re-running the same install command.
See also remove below.</p>

<p>You can also use install to make up modules which dont
other- wise exist. For example: &quot;install probe-ethernet
/sbin/modprobe e100 || /sbin/modprobe eepro100&quot;, which
will try first the e100 driver, then the eepro100 driver,
when you do &quot;modprobe probe- ethernet&quot;.</p>

<p>If you use the string &quot;$CMDLINE_OPTS&quot; in the
command, it will be replaced by any options specified on the
modprobe command line. This can be useful because users
expect &quot;modprobe fred opt=1&quot; to pass the
&quot;opt=1&quot; arg to the module, even if there s an
install command in the configuration file. So our above
example becomes &quot;install fred /sbin/modprobe barney;
/sbin/modprobe --ignore- install fred
$CMDLINE_OPTS&quot;</p>

<p>remove modulename command... This is similar to the
install command above, except it is invoked when
&quot;modprobe -r&quot; is run. The removal counterparts to
the two examples above would be: &quot;remove fred
/sbin/modprobe -r --ignore-remove fred &amp;&amp;
/sbin/modprobe -r barney&quot;, and &quot;remove
probe-ethernet /sbin/modprobe -r eepro100 || /sbin/modprobe
-r e100&quot;.</p>

<p>include filename Using this command, you can include
other configuration files, or whole directories, which is
occasionally useful. Note that aliases in the included file
will override aliases previously declared in the current
file.</p>

<p>blacklist modulename Modules can contain their own
aliases: usually these are aliases describing the devices
they support, such as &quot;pci:123...&quot;. These
&quot;internal&quot; aliases can be overridden by normal
&quot;alias&quot; keywords, but there are cases where two or
more modules both support the same devices, or a module
invalidly claims to sup- port a device: the blacklist
keyword indicates that all of a particular module s internal
aliases are to be ignored.</p>

<p>BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY There is a
generate_modprobe.conf program which should do a reasonable
job of generating modprobe.conf from your current (2.4 or
2.2) modules setup.</p>

<p>Although the syntax is similar to the older
/etc/modules.conf, there are many features missing. There
are two reasons for this: firstly, install and remove
commands can do just about anything, and secondly, the
module-init-tools modprobe is designed to be simple enough
that it can be easily replaced.</p>

<p>With the complexity of actual module insertion reduced
to three system calls (open, read, init_module), and the
modules.dep file being simple and open, producing a more
powerful modprobe variant can be done inde- pendently if
there is a need.</p>
