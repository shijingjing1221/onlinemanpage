<p>NAME mailpost - feed an email message into a news
group</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mailpost [-a addr] [-b database] [-c wait-time]
[-d distribution] [-f addr] [-m mailing-list] [-p port] [-r
addr] [-x header[:header...]] [newsgroups ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mailpost program reads a properly
formatted email message from stdin and feeds it to inews for
posting to a news server. newsgroups is a
whitespace-separated list of group names to which to post
the arti- cle.</p>

<p>Before feeding the article to inews, it checks that the
article has not been seen before, and it changes some
headers (cleans up some address headers and puts X- in front
of unknown headers).</p>

<p>If the article has been seen before (mailpost records
the message-id of each articles it handles), then the
article will be silently dropped. Other errors will cause
the article to be mailed to the newsmaster.</p>

<p>Normally mailpost is run by sendmail(8) via an alias
entry:</p>

<p>local-mail-wreck-bikes: &quot;&lt;pathbin in
inn.conf&gt;/mailpost -d local
local.mail.rec.bicycles.racing&quot;</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a addr If the -a flag is used the value given
is added to the article as an Approved header.</p>

<p>-b database If the -b flag is used, then it defines the
location of the database used to store the message ids of
articles sent on. This is to prevent articles looping around
if a news to mail gateway sends them back here. This option
may be required if the mailpost process doesnt have write
access to the news tmp directory (the value of pathtmp in
inn.conf(5)).</p>

<p>-c wait-time The -c flag indicates a length of time to
sleep before posting. If duplicate messages are received in
this interval (by any instance of mailpost using the same
database), the article is only posted once, but with
Newsgroups: header modified to crosspost the article to all
indicated groups.</p>

<p>-d distribution If the -d flag is used the value given
is added to the article as a Distribution: header.</p>

<p>-f addr The -f flag is a synonym for the -r flag.</p>

<p>-m mailing-list If the -m flag is used the value given
is added to the articles in a Mailing-List: header, if such
a header doesnt already exist.</p>

<p>-p port Specifies the port on which nnrpd is listening,
used for article posting. If given, -p is passed along to
inews.</p>

<p>-r addr A heuristic is used to determine a reasonable
value for the Path: header. The -r flag indicates what to
use if no other value can be determined.</p>

<p>-x header[:header...] A colon-separated list of
additional headers which should be treated as known headers;
these headers will be passed through to inews(1) without
having &quot;X-&quot; prepended.</p>

<p>HISTORY Written by Paul Vixie long ago and then hacked
