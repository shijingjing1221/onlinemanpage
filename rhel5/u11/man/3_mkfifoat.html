<p>MKFIFOAT(3) Linux Programmer s Manual MKFIFOAT(3)</p>

<p>NAME mkfifoat - make a FIFO (named pipe) relative to a
directory file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mkfifoat(int dirfd, const char *pathname, mode_t
mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mkfifoat() system call operates in
exactly the same way as mkfifo(3), except for the
differences described in this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it
is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor dirfd (rather than relative to the current
working directory of the calling process, as is done by
mkfifo(3) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in pathname is relative and dirfd
is the special value AT_FDCWD, then pathname is interpreted
relative to the current working directory of the calling
process (like mkfifo(3)).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in pathname is absolute, then
dirfd is ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, mkfifoat() returns 0. On error,
-1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for mkfifo(3) can also
occur for mkfifoat(). The following additional errors can
occur for mkfifoat():</p>

<p>EBADF dirfd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR pathname is a relative path and dirfd is a file
descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
mkfifoat().</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function is non-standard but is
proposed for inclusion in a future revision of POSIX.1.</p>

<p>VERSIONS mkfifoat() was added to glibc in version 2.4.
It is implemented using mknod(2), available on Linux since
kernel 2.6.16.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO openat(2), path_resolution(2), mkfifo(3).</p>
