<p>NAME synclient - query and modify Synaptics TouchPad
driver for XOrg/XFree86 server parameters on the fly.</p>

<p>SYNTAX synclient [-m interval] synclient [-hlV?]
[var1=value1 [var2=value2] ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program lets you change your Synaptics
TouchPad driver for XOrg/XFree86 server parameters while X
is running if you enabled SHM- Config &quot;on&quot; in your
XOrg/XFree86 configuration.</p>

<p>WARNING: This is not secure if you are in an untrusted
multiuser environment. All local users can change the
parameters at any time.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -m interval monitor changes to the touchpad
state. Interval specifies how often (in ms) to poll the
touchpad state. Whenever a change in the touchpad state is
detected, one line of output is generated that describes the
current state of the touchpad. The following data is
included in the output.</p>

<p>time Time in seconds since the logging was started.</p>

<p>x,y The x/y coordinates of the finger on the touchpad.
The origin is in the upper left corner.</p>

<p>z The &quot;pressure&quot; value. Pressing the finger
harder on the touchpad typically produces a larger value.
Note that most touchpads don t measure the real pressure
though. Instead, capacitance is usually measured, which is
corre- lated to the contact area between the finger and the
touchpad. Since more pressure usually means a larger contact
area, the reported pressure value is at least indirectly
related to the real pressure.</p>

<p>f The number of fingers currently touching the touchpad.
Note that only some touchpads can report more than one
finger. Generally, synaptics touchpads can, but ALPS
touchpads cant.</p>

<p>w The w value is a measurement of the finger width. This
is only supported by some synaptics touchpads. Touchpads
that can t measure the finger width typically report a faked
constant value when a finger is touching the touch- pad.</p>

<p>l,r,u,d,m,multi The state of the left, right, up, down,
middle and multi buttons. Zero means not pressed, one means
pressed. Not all touchpads have all these buttons. If a
button doesnt exist, the value is always reported as 0.</p>

<p>gl,gm,gr Some touchpads have a &quot;guest device&quot;.
This is typically a pointing stick located in the middle of
the keyboard. Some guest devices have physical buttons, or
can detect button presses when tapping on the pointing
stick. Such button events are reported as &quot;guest
left&quot;, &quot;guest middle&quot; or &quot;guest
right&quot;.</p>

<p>gdx,gdy Pointer movements from the guest device are
reported as relative x/y positions, called gdx and gdy.</p>

<p>-h Show detected hardware properties.</p>

<p>-l List current user settings.</p>

<p>-V Print version number and exit.</p>

<p>-? Show the help message.</p>

<p>var=value Set user parameter var to value.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To disable EdgeMotionSpeed:</p>

<p>synclient EdgeMotionSpeed=0</p>

<p>To monitor touchpad events:</p>

<p>synclient -m 100</p>
