<p>SETSID(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SETSID(2)</p>

<p>NAME setsid - creates a session and sets the process
group ID</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>pid_t setsid(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION setsid() creates a new session if the
calling process is not a process group leader. The calling
process is the leader of the new session, the process group
leader of the new process group, and has no control- ling
tty. The process group ID and session ID of the calling
process are set to the PID of the calling process. The
calling process will be the only process in this new process
group and in this new session.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The session ID of the calling process.</p>

<p>ERRORS On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set. The
only error which can happen is EPERM. It is returned when
the process group ID of any pro- cess equals the PID of the
calling process. Thus, in particular, set- sid() fails if
the calling process is already a process group leader.</p>

<p>NOTES A child created via fork(2) inherits its parent s
session ID. The ses- sion ID is preserved across an
execve(2).</p>

<p>A process group leader is a process with process group
ID equal to its PID. In order to be sure that setsid() will
succeed, fork() and exit(), and have the child do
setsid().</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.</p>
