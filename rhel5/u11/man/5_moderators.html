<p>NAME moderators - submission addresses for moderated
newsgroups</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When an unapproved article is posted locally
to a moderated newsgroup, it is not passed off to innd(8)
for normal handling; instead its instead sent via e-mail to
the submission address for that newsgroup. The file
&lt;pathetc in inn.conf&gt;/moderators lists the submission
addresses for moderated newsgroups. This file is used by
nnrpd(8), inews(1), and any other program that uses the
GetModeratorAddress() routine (see libinn(3)).</p>

<p>The moderators file is a list of associations between
uwildmat(3) pat- terns matching newsgroups and the
submission address for those news- groups. Blank lines and
lines starting with a number sign (#) are ignored. All other
lines should consist of two fields separated by a colon.</p>

<p>The first field specifies the group or groups to match
using uwild- mat(3). The first matching line is used, so
more specific patterns should occur earlier than general
patterns.</p>

<p>The second field, the submission address, may have at
most one %s any- where in it; if present, this will be
replaced by the name of the news- group with periods
replaced by dashes. If there is a literal % in the
submission address, it must be written as %% (even if not
fol- lowed by an s).</p>

<p>Here is a sample file:</p>

<p>example.important:announce-request@example.com
example.*:%s@smtp.example.com gnu.*:%s@prep.ai.mit.edu
*:%s@moderators.isc.org</p>

<p>Using the above file, postings to the moderated
newsgroup in the left column will be sent to the address
shown in the right column:</p>

<p>example.important announce-request@example.com
example.x.announce example-x-announce@smtp.example.com
gnu.emacs.sources gnu-emacs-sources@prep.ai.mit.edu
comp.sources.unix comp-sources-unix@moderators.isc.org</p>

<p>Periods are converted to dashes for historical reasons,
from back in the days when periods in the local part of
addresses were not always handled correctly. Its probably no
longer necessary, but so much now depends on it that it cant
be easily changed.</p>

<p>It s intended that the sample moderators file included
in the INN dis- tribution always be sufficient for all
world-wide newsgroups. The hosts behind moderators.isc.org
have graciously volunteered to handle forwarding tasks for
all world-wide newsgroups so that individual sites don t
have to keep track of the submission addresses for moderated
groups. The forwarding database used by moderators.isc.org
is coordi- nated by moderators-request@isc.org; if you know
of a world-wide news- group hierarchy that is not correctly
handled by moderators.isc.org, please send the details to
that address.</p>

<p>Given that, the only thing you should have to add to the
sample file under normal circumstances are the forwarding
addresses for local or limited-distribution moderated
groups.</p>
