<p>CRON(8) CRON(8)</p>

<p>NAME cron - daemon to execute scheduled commands (ISC
Cron V4.1)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cron [-n | -p | -m&lt;mailcommand&gt;] cron -x
[ext,sch,proc,pars,load,misc,test,bit]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Cron should be started from /etc/rc.d/init.d
or /etc/init.d</p>

<p>Cron searches /var/spool/cron for crontab files which
are named after accounts in /etc/passwd; crontabs found are
loaded into memory. Cron also searches for /etc/crontab and
the files in the /etc/cron.d direc- tory, which are in a
different format (see crontab(5) ). Cron then wakes up every
minute, examining all stored crontabs, checking each command
to see if it should be run in the current minute. When
execut- ing commands, any output is mailed to the owner of
the crontab (or to the user named in the MAILTO environment
variable in the crontab, if such exists).</p>

<p>Additionally, cron checks each minute to see if its
spool directorys modtime (or the modtime on /etc/crontab)
has changed, and if it has, cron will then examine the
modtime on all crontabs and reload those which have changed.
Thus cron need not be restarted whenever a crontab file is
modified. Note that the crontab(1) command updates the
modtime of the spool directory whenever it changes a
crontab.</p>

<p>Daylight Saving Time and other time changes Local time
changes of less than three hours, such as those caused by
the start or end of Daylight Saving Time, are handled
specially. This only applies to jobs that run at a specific
time and jobs that are run with a granularity greater than
one hour. Jobs that run more fre- quently are scheduled
normally.</p>

<p>If time has moved forward, those jobs that would have
run in the inter- val that has been skipped will be run
immediately. Conversely, if time has moved backward, care is
taken to avoid running jobs twice.</p>

<p>Time changes of more than 3 hours are considered to be
corrections to the clock or timezone, and the new time is
used immediately.</p>

<p>PAM Access Control On Red Hat systems, crond now
supports access control with PAM - see pam(8). A PAM
configuration file for crond is installed in
/etc/pam.d/crond. crond loads the PAM environment from the
pam_env module, but these can be overriden by settings in
the crontab file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -m This option allows you to specify a shell
command string to use for sending cron mail output instead
of sendmail(8). This com- mand must accept a fully formatted
mail message (with headers) on stdin and send it as a mail
message to the recipients speci- fied in the mail
headers.</p>

<p>-n This option changes default behavior causing it to
run crond in the foreground. This can be useful when
starting it out of init.</p>

<p>-p Cron permit any crontab, which user set.</p>

<p>-x With this option is possible to set debug flags.</p>

<p>SIGNALS On receipt of a SIGHUP, the cron daemon will
close and reopen its log file. This is useful in scripts
which rotate and age log files. Natu- rally this is not
relevant if cron was built to use syslog(3).</p>

<p>CAVEATS In this version of cron , without the -p option,
/etc/crontab must not be writable by any user other than
root, no crontab files may be links, or linked to by any
other file, and no crontab files may be executable, or be
writable by any user other than their owner.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO crontab(1), crontab(5), pam(8)</p>
