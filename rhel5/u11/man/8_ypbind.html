<p>NAME ypbind - NIS binding process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ypbind [ -c ] [ -d|-debug ] [ -v|-verbose ] [
-broadcast ] [ -broken- server ] [ -ypset ] [ -ypsetme ] [
-no-ping ] [ -p port ] [ -f config- file ] [ -local-only ] [
-ping-interval ping-interval ]</p>

<p>ypbind --version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ypbind finds the server for NIS domains and
maintains the NIS binding information. The client (normaly
the NIS routines in the standard C library) could get the
information over RPC from ypbind or read the binding files.
The binding files resides in the directory /var/yp/bind- ing
and are conventionally named [domainname].[version]. The
supported versions are 1 and 2. There could be several such
files since it is possible for an NIS client to be bound to
more then one domain.</p>

<p>After a binding has been established, ypbind will send
YPPROC_DOMAIN requests to the current NIS server at 20
seconds intervals. If it doesn t get an response or the NIS
server reports that he doesnt have this domain any longer,
ypbind will search for a new NIS server. All 15 minutes
ypbind will check to see if the current NIS server is the
fastest. If it find a server which answers faster, it will
switch to this server. You could tell ypbind to use network
broadcasts to find a new server, what is insecure, or you
could give it a list of known secure servers. In this case
ypbind will send a ping to all servers and binds to first
one which answers.</p>

<p>Unless the option -debug is used, ypbind detaches itself
from the con- trolling terminal and puts itself into
background. ypbind uses sys- log(3) for logging errors and
warnings. At startup or when receiving signal SIGHUP, ypbind
parses the file /etc/yp.conf and tries to use the entries
for its initial binding. Valid entries are</p>

<p>domain nisdomain server hostname Use server hostname for
the domain nisdomain. You could have more then one entry of
this type for a single domain.</p>

<p>domain nisdomain broadcast Use broadcast on the local
net for domain nisdomain.</p>

<p>ypserver hostname Use server server for the local
domain.</p>

<p>A broadcast entry in the configuration file will
overwrite a ypserver/server entry and a ypserver/server
entry broadcast. If all given server are down, ypbind will
not switch to use broadcast. ypbind will try at first
/etc/hosts and then DNS for resolving the hosts names from
/etc/yp.conf. If ypbind couldn t reconfigure the search
order, it will use only DNS. If DNS isn t available, you
could only use IP- addresses in /etc/hosts. ypbind could
only reconfigure the search order with glibc 2.x. If the
-broadcast option is specified, ypbind will ignore the
configuration file. If the file does not exist or if there
are no valid entries, ypbind exit.</p>

<p>This ypbind is a special version which uses pthreads. It
will start 2 more threads. The master process services RPC
requests asking for binding info. The first thread
initializes the binding and checks it periodically. Upon
failure, the binding is invalidated and the process tries
again to find a valid server. The second thread will handle
all the signals.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -broadcast Send a broadcast to request the
information needed to bind to a specific NIS server. With
this option, /etc/yp.conf will be ignored.</p>

<p>-ypset Allow root from any remote machine to change the
binding for a domain via the ypset(8) command. By default,
no one can change the binding. This option is really
insecure. If you change a binding for a domain, all the
current known servers for this domain will be forgotten. If
the new server goes down, ypbind will use the old
searchlist.</p>

<p>-ypsetme The same as -ypset, but only root on the local
machine is allowed to chang the binding. Such requests are
only allowd from loopback.</p>

<p>-c ypbind only checks if the config file has syntax
errors and exits.</p>

<p>-debug starts ypbind in debug mode. ypbind will not put
itself into background, and error messages and debug output
are written to standard error.</p>

<p>-verbose Causes ypbind to syslog(2) any and all changes
in the server its bound to.</p>

<p>-broken-server lets ypbind accept answers from servers
running on an illegal port number. This should usually be
avoided, but is required by some ypserv(8) versions.</p>

<p>-no-ping ypbind will not check if the binding is alive.
This option is for use with dialup connections to prevent
ypbind from keeping the connection unnessecarily open or
causing autodials.</p>

<p>-p port ypbind will bind itself to this port. This makes
it possible to have a router filter packets to the NIS
ports, so that access to this service from hosts on the
Internet can be restricted.</p>

<p>-f configfile ypbind will use configfile and not
/etc/yp.conf</p>

<p>-local-only ypbind will only bind to the loopback device
and is not reacheable from a remote network.</p>

<p>-ping-interval ping-interval The default value for
ypbind to check, if a NIS server is still reacheable, is 20
seconds. With this options another frequency in seconds can
be specified.</p>

<p>--version Prints the version number</p>

<p>NOTES Binding to multiple domains is tested and works.
Load sharing between multiple servers for a single domain is
not supported. ypbind will always try to bind a domain to a
server. If there is no valid server in the list or answers
to a broadcast, the domain is unbounded.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/yp.conf configuration file.</p>

<p>/var/yp/binding/[domainname].[version] binding file
containing information about each NIS domain.</p>

<p>/var/run/ypbind.pid contains the process id of the
currently running ypbind master process.</p>
