<p>NAME bcc - Bruces C compiler</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS bcc [-03EGNOPSVcegvwxW] [-Aas_option]
[-Bexecutable_prefix] [-Ddefine] [-Uundef] [-Mc_mode] [-o
outfile] [-ansi] [-Ccc1_option] [-Pcpp_option]
[-Iinclude_dir] [-Lld_option] [-Ttmpdir] [-Qc386_option]
[-ttext_segno] [ld_options] [infiles]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Bcc is a simple C compiler that produces
8086 assembler, in addition compiler compile time options
allow 80386 or 6809 versions. The compiler understands
traditional K&amp;R C with just the restriction that bit
fields are mapped to one of the other integer types.</p>

<p>The default operation is to produce an 8086 executable
called a.out from the source file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -ansi Pass the C source through unprotoize after
preprocessing and before code generation. This will allow
some ansi C to be compiled but it is definitly NOT a true
ansi-C compiler.</p>

<p>-0 8086 target (works on 80386 host, but not 6809)</p>

<p>-3 80386 target (may work on 8086 host, but not
6809)</p>

<p>-A pass remainder of option to assembler (e.g. -A-l
-Alistfile for a listing)</p>

<p>-B prefix for executable search path (as usual; the
search order is all paths specified using -B, in order, then
the path given in the environment variable BCC_EXEC_PREFIX
if that is set, then the compiled-in defaults (something
like /usr/lib/bcc/ followed by /usr/bin/)</p>

<p>-C pass remainder of option to bcc-cc1, see code
generation options.</p>

<p>-D preprocessor define</p>

<p>-E produce preprocessor output to standard out.</p>

<p>-G produce GCC objects (Same as -Mg)</p>

<p>-Ixyz include search xyz path</p>

<p>-I dont add default include to search list</p>

<p>-Lxyz add directory name xyz to the head of the list of
library directories searched</p>

<p>-L dont add default library to search list</p>

<p>-Md alters the arguments for all passes to produce MSDOS
executable COM files. These are small model executables, use
-i to get tiny model.</p>

<p>-Mf sets bcc to pass the -c and -f arguments to the code
generator for smaller faster code. Note this code is not
compatible with the standard calling conventions so a
different version of the C library is linked too.</p>

<p>-Mc sets bcc to pass the -c argument to the code
generator for smaller faster code. Note the standard libc is
normally transparent to this, but there are exceptions.</p>

<p>-Ms alters the arguments for all passes and selects
C-library to produce standalone Linux-86 executables</p>

<p>-Ml switches to i386-Linux code generator and library.
This configuration accepts the -z flag to generate QMAGIC
a.out files instead of the normal OMAGIC.</p>

<p>-Mg switches to i386-Linux code generator and generates
OMAGIC object files that can be linked with some versions of
gcc; unfortunatly the most recent versions use collect2 to
link and this crashes.</p>

<p>-N makes the linker produce a native a.out file (Linux
OMAGIC) if combined with -3 the executable will run under
Linux-i386.</p>

<p>-O optimize, call copt(1) to optimize 8086 code.
Specifiers to choose which rules copt should use can be
appended to the -O and the option can be repeated.</p>

<p>-P produce preprocessor output with no line numbers to
standard output.</p>

<p>-Q pass full option to c386 (Only for c386 version)</p>

<p>-S produce assembler file</p>

<p>-T temporary directory (overrides previous value and
default; default is from the environment variable TMPDIR if
that is set, otherwise /tmp)</p>

<p>-U preprocessor undefine</p>

<p>-V print names of files being compiled</p>

<p>-X pass remainder of option to linker (e.g. -X-Ofile is
passed to the linker as -Ofile)</p>

<p>-c produce object file</p>

<p>-f turn on floating point support, no effect with i386,
changes libc library with 8086 code.</p>

<p>-g produce debugging info (ignored.)</p>

<p>-o output file name follows (assembler, object or
executable) (as usual)</p>

<p>-p produce profiling info (ignored.)</p>

<p>-t1 pass to the assembler to renumber the text segment
for multi- segment programs.</p>

<p>-v print names and args of subprocesses being run. Two
or more -vs print names of files being unlinked. Three or
more -vs print names of paths being searched.</p>

<p>-w Supress any warning diagnostics.</p>

<p>-W Turn on assembler warning messages.</p>

<p>-x dont include crt0.o in the link.</p>

<p>-i dont pass -i to the linker so that it will create an
impure executable.</p>

<p>Other options are passed to the linker, in particular
-lx, -M, -m, -s, -H.</p>

<p>CODE GENERATOR OPTIONS These are all options that the
code generator pass bcc-cc1 understands, only some will be
useful for the -C option of bcc.</p>

<p>-0 8086 target (works even on 80386 host, not on
6809)</p>

<p>-3 80386 target (may work even on 8086 host, not on
6809)</p>

<p>-D define (as usual)</p>

<p>-E produce preprocessor output (as usual)</p>

<p>-I include search path (as usual)</p>

<p>-P produce preprocessor output with no line numbers (as
usual)</p>

<p>-c produce code with caller saving regs before function
calls</p>

<p>-d print debugging information in assembly output</p>

<p>-f produce code with 1st argument passed in a register
(AX, EAX or X)</p>

<p>-l produce code for 2 3 1 0 long byte order (only works
in 16-bit code), a special library of compiler helper
functions is needed for this mode.</p>

<p>-o assembler output file name follows</p>

<p>-p produce (almost) position-independent code (only for
the 6809)</p>

<p>-t print source code in assembly output</p>

<p>-w print what cc1 thinks is the location counter in
assembly output</p>

<p>All the options except -D, -I and -o may be turned off
by following the option letter by a -. Options are processed
left to right so the last setting has precedence.</p>

<p>PREPROCESSOR DEFINES The preprocessor has a number of
manifest constants.</p>

<p>__BCC__ 1 The compiler identifier, normally used to
avoid compiler limitations.</p>

<p>__FILE__ stringized name of current input file</p>

<p>__LINE__ current line number</p>

<p>__MSDOS__ 1 compiler is configured for generating MSDOS
executable COM files.</p>

<p>__STANDALONE__ 1 compiler is configured for generating
standalone executables.</p>

<p>__AS386_16__ 1 compiler is generating 16 bit 8086
assembler and the #asm keyword is available for including
8086 code.</p>

<p>__AS386_32__ 1 compiler is generating 32 bit 80386
assembler and the #asm keyword is available for including
80386 code.</p>

<p>__CALLER_SAVES__ 1 compiler calling conventions are
altered so the calling function must save the SI and DI
registers if they are in use (ESI and EDI on the 80386)</p>

<p>__FIRST_ARG_IN_AX__ 1 compiler calling conventions are
altered so the calling function is passing the first
argument to the function in the AX (or EAX ) register.</p>

<p>__LONG_BIG_ENDIAN__ 1 alters the word order of code
generated by the 8086 compiler.</p>

<p>These defines only occur in the 6809 version of the
compiler.</p>

<p>__AS09__ 1 compiler is generating 6809 code</p>

<p>__FIRST_ARG_IN_X__ 1 the first argument to functions is
passed in the X register.</p>

<p>__POS_INDEPENDENT__ 1 the code generated is (almost)
position independent.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT BCC_EXEC_PREFIX default directory to seach
for compiler passes</p>

<p>TMPDIR directory to place temporary files (default
/tmp)</p>

<p>DIRECTORIES All the include, library and compiler
components are stored under the /usr/bcc directory under
Linux-i386, this is laid out the same as a /usr filesystem
and if bcc is to be the primary compiler on a system it
should be moved there. The configuration for this is in the
bcc.c source file only, all other executables are
independent of location.</p>

<p>The library installation also creates the file
/usr/lib/liberror.txt, this path is hardcoded into the C
library.</p>

<p>The bcc executable itself, as86 and ld86 are in
/usr/bin.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO as86(1), ld86(1), elksemu(1)</p>

<p>BUGS The bcc.c compiler driver source is very
untidy.</p>

<p>The linker, ld86, produces a broken a.out object file if
given one input and the -r option this is so it is
compatible with pre-dev86 versions.</p>
