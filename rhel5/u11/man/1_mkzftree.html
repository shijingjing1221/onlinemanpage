<p>NAME mkzftree - Create a zisofs/RockRidge compressed
file tree</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mkzftree [OPTIONS]... INPUT OUTPUT</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Takes an input file tree (INPUT) and create
a corresponding compressed file tree (OUTPUT) that can be
used with an appropriately patched mkisofs(8) to create a
transparent-compression ISO 9660/Rock Ridge filesystem using
the &quot;ZF&quot; compression records.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f, --force Always compress all files, even if
they get larger when com- pressed.</p>

<p>-z level, --level level Select compression level (1-9,
default is 9). Lower compression levels are faster, but
typically result in larger output.</p>

<p>-u, --uncompress Uncompress an already compressed tree.
This can be used to read a compressed filesystem on a system
which cannot read them natively.</p>

<p>-p parallelism, --parallelism parallelism Compress in
parallel. The parallelism value indicates how many
compression threads are allowed to run.</p>

<p>-x, --one-filesystem Do not cross filesystem boundaries,
but create directory stubs at mount points.</p>

<p>-X, --strict-one-filesystem Do not cross filesystem
boundaries, and do not create directory stubs at mount
points.</p>

<p>-C path, --crib-path path Steal (&quot;crib&quot;) files
from another directory if it looks (based on name, size,
type and modification time) like they match entries in the
new filesystem. The &quot;crib tree&quot; is usually the
compressed version of an older version of the same workload;
this thus allows for &quot;incremental rebuilds&quot; of a
compressed filesystem tree. The files are hardlinked from
the crib tree to the output tree, so if it is desirable to
keep the link count correct the crib path should be deleted
before running mkisofs. The crib tree must be on the same
filesystem as the output tree.</p>

<p>-l, --local Do not recurse into subdirectories, but
create the directories themselves.</p>

<p>-L, --strict-local Do not recurse into subdirectories,
and do not create directo- ries.</p>

<p>-F, --file Indicates that INPUT may not necessarily be a
directory; this allows operation on a single file. Note
especially that if -F is specified, and INPUT is a symlink,
the symlink itself will be copied rather than whatever it
happens to point to.</p>

<p>-s, --sloppy Treat file modes, times and ownership data
as less than precious information and dont abort if they
cannot be set. This may be useful if running mkisofs on an
input tree you do not own.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Increase the program verbosity.</p>

<p>-V value, --verbosity value Set the program verbosity to
value.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Issue no messages whatsoever, including
error messages. This is the same as specifying -V 0.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display a brief help message.</p>

<p>-w, --version Display the release version.</p>

<p>BUGS Long options (beginning with --) may not work on
all systems. See the message printed out by mkzftree -h to
see if this applies to your sys- tem.</p>

<p>Inode change times (ctimes) are not copied. This is a
system limita- tion and applies to all file copy
programs.</p>

<p>If using the parallel option (-z) the access times
(atimes) on directo- ries may or may not be copied. If it is
important that the atimes on directories are copied exactly,
avoid using -z.</p>
