<p>NAME scrollkeeper-update - identify new, modified, or
removed OMF files and update the scrollkeeper databases</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS scrollkeeper-update [ -v ] [ -q ] [ -n ] [ -p
database-directory ] [ -o omf-directories ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This synchronizes the scrollkeeper database
with the OMF directory. It searches the scrollkeeper OMF
directory to identify if any files were added, removed, or
modified and updates its internal database files to reflect
any changes.</p>

<p>This utility is generally executed as the last step of
installation, after the OMF file is copied into place. It is
also typically the last step of uninstallation, after the
OMF file is removed. Using this, an administrator can easily
manually install and uninstall documents into the database.
It can also be run to guarantee the database is fully
up-to-date.</p>

<p>Note that because scrollkeeper-update is normally run
during installa- tion and its output is typically seen by
users, non-critical warnings and errors such as those caused
by invalid metadata are written to the log file instead of
to the terminal. Developers should use the log file to
identify any problems.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v Be verbose: Say which scrollkeeper-install
and scrollkeeper- uninstall commands are being run to bring
the database up to date.</p>

<p>-q Run in quiet mode, suppressing output of all but the
most seri- ous warning and error messages to STDOUT. Note
that most output to the log file will be unchanged.</p>

<p>-n Use the network to retrieve the DTD if it is not
available via the systems XML catalog.</p>

<p>-p database-directory Use database-directory as the
directory for the scrollkeeper database rather than the
usual one obtained by running scroll- keeper-config
--pkglocalstatedir.</p>

<p>-o omf-directories Examine the directories named in
omf-directories rather than the one usual one obtained by
running scrollkeeper-config --omfdir (or specified in the
OMF_DIR environment variable if set). The omf-directories
should be a colon-separated list of directories.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT OMF_DIR If no -o option is specified, this
variable overrides the scrol- lkeeper-config-provided OMF
directory. It should be a colon- separated list of
directories.</p>
