<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5x) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The driver auto-detects all device information necessary
to initialize the card. However, if you have problems with
auto-detection, you can specify:</p>

<p>VideoRam - in kilobytes MemBase - physical address of
the linear framebuffer IOBase - physical address of the MMIO
registers ChipID - PCI DEVICE ID</p>

<p>In addition, the following driver Options are
supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;SWcursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Selects
software cursor. The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enables
or disables all hardware acceleration. The default is to
enable hardware acceleration.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Dac6Bit&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enables
or disables the use of 6 bits per color component when in 8
bpp mode (emulates VGA mode). By default, all 8 bits per
color component are used. The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;VideoKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
overrides the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay
key. The default value is 0x1E.</p>

<p>Option &quot;UseFBDev&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable use of an OS-specific framebuffer device
interface (which is not supported on all OSs). MergedFB does
not work when this option is in use. See fbdevhw(4) for
further information. The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AGPMode&quot; &quot;integer&quot; Set AGP
data transfer rate. (used only when DRI is enabled) 1 -- x1
(default) 2 -- x2 4 -- x4 8 -- x8 others -- invalid</p>

<p>Option &quot;AGPFastWrite&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable AGP fast write. Enabling this option is frequently
the cause of instability. Used only when the DRI is enabled.
The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;BusType&quot; &quot;string&quot; Used to
replace previous ForcePCIMode option. Should only be used
when drivers bus detection is incorrect or you want to force
a AGP card to PCI mode. Should NEVER force a PCI card to AGP
bus. PCI -- PCI bus AGP -- AGP bus PCIE -- PCI Express
(falls back to PCI at present) (used only when DRI is
enabled) The default is auto detect.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DDCMode&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Force to
use the modes queried from the connected monitor. The
default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DisplayPriority&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Used to prevent flickering or tearing problem caused by
display buffer underflow. AUTO -- Driver calculated
(default). BIOS -- Remain unchanged from BIOS setting. Use
this if the calculation is not correct for your card. HIGH
-- Force to the highest priority. Use this if you have
problem with above options. This may affect performance
slightly. The default value is AUTO.</p>

<p>Option &quot;MonitorLayout&quot; &quot;string&quot; This
option is used to overwrite the detected monitor types. This
is only required when driver makes a false detection. The
possible monitor types are: NONE -- Not connected CRT --
Analog CRT monitor TMDS -- Desktop flat panel LVDS -- Laptop
flat panel This option can be used in following format:
Option &quot;MonitorLayout&quot; &quot;[type on primary],
[type on secondary]&quot; For example, Option
&quot;MonitorLayout&quot; &quot;CRT, TMDS&quot;</p>

<p>Primary/Secondary head for dual-head cards: (when only
one port is used, it will be treated as the primary
regardless) Primary head: DVI port on DVI+VGA cards LCD
output on laptops Internal TMDS port on DVI+DVI cards
Secondary head: VGA port on DVI+VGA cards VGA port on
laptops External TMDS port on DVI+DVI cards</p>

<p>The default value is undefined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;MergedFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
enables merged framebuffer mode. In this mode you have a
single shared framebuffer with two viewports looking into
it. It is similar to Xinerama, but has some advantages. It
is faster than Xinerama, the DRI works on both heads, and it
sup- ports clone modes. Merged framebuffer mode provides two
linked viewports looking into a single large shared
framebuffer. The size of the frame- buffer is determined by
the Virtual keyword defined on the Screen section of your
xorg.conf file. It works just like regu- lar virtual desktop
except you have two viewports looking into it instead of
one. For example, if you wanted a desktop composed of two
1024x768 viewports looking into a single desktop you would
create a vir- tual desktop of 2048x768 (left/right) or
1024x1536 (above/below), e.g., Virtual 2048 768 or Virtual
1024 1536 The virtual desktop can be larger than larger than
the size of the viewports looking into it. In this case the
linked viewports will scroll around in the virtual desktop.
Viewports with different sizes are also supported (e.g., one
that is 1024x768 and one that is 640x480). In this case the
smaller viewport will scroll relative to the larger one such
that none of the virtual desktop is inaccessible. If you do
not define a virtual desktop the driver will create one
based on the orienta- tion of the heads and size of the
largest defined mode in the display section that is
supported on each head. The relation of the viewports in
specified by the CRT2Position Option. The options are Clone
, LeftOf , RightOf , Above , and Below. MergedFB is enabled
by default if a monitor is detected on each output. If no
position is given it defaults to clone mode (the old clone
options are now deprecated, also, the option OverlayOnCRTC2
has been replaced by the Xv attribute XV_SWITCHCRT; the
overlay can be switched to CRT1 or CRT2 on the fly in clone
mode). The maximum framebuffer size that the 2D acceleration
engine can handle is 8192x8192. The maximum framebuffer size
that the 3D engine can handle is 2048x2048. Note: Page
flipping does not work well in certain configurations with
MergedFB. If you see rendering errors or other strange
behavior, disable page flipping. Also MergedFB is not
compatible with the UseFBDev option. The default value is
undefined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CRT2HSync&quot; &quot;string&quot; Set the
horizontal sync range for the secondary monitor. It is not
required if a DDC-capable monitor is connected. For example,
Option &quot;CRT2HSync&quot; &quot;30.0-86.0&quot; The
default value is undefined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CRT2VRefresh&quot; &quot;string&quot; Set
the vertical refresh range for the secondary monitor. It is
not required if a DDC-capable monitor is connected. For
example, Option &quot;CRT2VRefresh&quot;
&quot;50.0-120.0&quot; The default value is undefined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CRT2Position&quot; &quot;string&quot; Set
the relationship of CRT2 relative to CRT1. Valid options
are: Clone , LeftOf , RightOf , Above , and Below For
example, Option &quot;CRT2Position&quot; &quot;RightOf&quot;
This option also supports an offset. This is most useful
when MergedNonRectangular is enabled. For example if you
want CRT2 to be offset 100 pixels down from the start of
CRT1, youd type: Option &quot;CRT2Position&quot;
&quot;LeftOf 100&quot; The offset is vertical for LeftOf and
RightOf and horizontal for Above and Below. Offsets can be
positive or negative. The default value is Clone.</p>

<p>Option &quot;MetaModes&quot; &quot;string&quot;
MetaModes are mode combinations for CRT1 and CRT2. If you
are using merged frame buffer mode and want to change modes
(CTRL- ALT-+/-), these define which modes will be switched
to on CRT1 and CRT2. The MetaModes are defined as
CRT1Mode-CRT2Mode (800x600-1024x768). Modes listed
individually (800x600) define clone modes, that way you can
mix clone modes with non-clone modes. Also some programs
require &quot;standard&quot; modes. If you want to add clone
modes of different refreshes or sizes to the mix, they are
defined as CRT1Mode+CRT2Mode (800x600+1024x768). Note: Any
mode you use in the MetaModes must be defined in the Screen
section of your xorg.conf file. Modes not defined there will
be ignored when the MetaModes are parsed since the driver
uses them to make sure the monitors can handle those modes.
If you do not define a MetaMode the driver will create one
based on the orientation of the heads and size of the
largest defined mode in the display section that is
supported on each head. Modes 1024x768 800x600 640x480 For
example, Option &quot;MetaModes&quot;
&quot;1024x768-1024x768 800x600-1024x768 640x480-800x600
800x600&quot; The default value is undefined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;MergedXinerama&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Since merged framebuffer mode does not use Xinerama, apps
are not able to intelligently place windows. Merged
framebuffer mode provides its own pseudo-Xinerama. This
allows Xinerama compliant applications to place windows
appropriately. There are some caveats. Since merged
framebuffer mode is able to change relative screen sizes and
orientations on the fly, as well has having overlapping
viewports, pseudo-Xinerama, might not always provide the
right hints. Also many Xinerama compli- ant applications
only query Xinerama once at startup; if the information
changes, they may not be aware of the change. If you are
already using Xinerama (e.g., a single head card and a
dualhead card providing three heads), pseudo-Xinerama will
be disabled. This option allows you turn off the driver
provided pseudo-Xin- erama extension. The default value is
TRUE.</p>

<p>Option &quot;MergedXineramaCRT2IsScreen0&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; By default the pseudo-Xinerama provided
by the driver makes the left-most or bottom head Xinerama
screen 0. Certain Xinerama- aware applications do special
things with screen 0. To change that behavior, use this
option. The default value is undefined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;MergedDPI&quot; &quot;string&quot; The
driver will attempt to figure out an appropriate DPI based
on the DDC information and the orientation of the heads when
in merged framebuffer mode. If this value does not suit you,
you can manually set the DPI using this option. For example,
Option &quot;MergedDPI&quot; &quot;100 100&quot; The default
value is undefined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;MergedNonRectangular&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; If you are using MergedFB with two modes
of different sizes, turn this option on to keep the smaller
head from scrolling within the larger virtual desktop and to
keep the mouse from moving into that area. Applications that
are not Xinerama aware can potentially end up stranded in
this area. The default value is FALSE.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ColorTiling&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Frame
buffer can be addressed either in linear or tiled mode.
Tiled mode can provide significant performance benefits with
3D applications, for 2D it shouldn t matter much. Tiling
will be disabled if the virtual x resolution exceeds 2048
(3968 for R300 and above), if option UseFBDev is used, or
(if DRI is enabled) the drm module is too old. If this
option is enabled, a new dri driver is required for direct
rendering too. Color tiling will be automatically disabled
in interlaced or doublescan screen modes. The default value
is on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;IgnoreEDID&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Do not
use EDID data for mode validation, but DDC is still used for
monitor detection. This is different from NoDDC option. The
default value is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;PanelSize&quot; &quot;string&quot; Should
only be used when driver cannot detect the correct panel
size. Apply to both desktop (TMDS) and laptop (LVDS) digital
panels. When a valid panel size is specified, the timings
col- lected from DDC and BIOS will not be used. If you have
a panel with timings different from that of a standard VESA
mode, you have to provide this information through the
Modeline. For example, Option &quot;PanelSize&quot;
&quot;1400x1050&quot; The default value is none.</p>

<p>Option &quot;PanelOff&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
panel output. The default value is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EnablePageFlip&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable page flipping for 3D acceleration. This will increase
performance but not work correctly in some rare cases, hence
the default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ForceMinDotClock&quot;
&quot;frequency&quot; Override minimum dot clock. Some
Radeon BIOSes report a minimum dot clock unsuitable (too
high) for use with television sets even when they actually
can produce lower dot clocks. If this is the case you can
override the value here. Note that using this option may
damage your hardware. You have been warned. The fre- quency
parameter may be specified as a float value with standard
suffixes like &quot;k&quot;, &quot;kHz&quot;, &quot;M&quot;,
&quot;MHz&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;RenderAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enables or disables hardware Render acceleration. This
driver does not support component alpha (subpixel)
rendering. It is only supported on Radeon series up to and
including 9200 (9500/9700 and newer unsupported). The
default is to enable Render acceleration.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Chooses between available acceleration architectures. Valid
options are XAA and EXA. XAA is the traditional acceleration
architecture and support for it is very stable. EXA is a
newer acceleration architecture with better performance for
the Render and Composite extensions, but the rendering code
for it is newer and possibly unstable. The default is
XAA.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelDFS&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Use or
dont use accelerated EXA DownloadFromScreen hook when
possible (only when Direct Rendering is enabled, e.g.).
Default: off with AGP due to issues with GPU-&gt;host
transfers with some AGP bridges, on otherwise.</p>

<p>Option &quot;FBTexPercent&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Amount of video RAM to reserve for OpenGL textures, in
percent. With EXA, the remainder of video RAM is reserved
for EXA off- screen management. Specifying 0 results in all
offscreen video RAM being reserved for EXA and only GART
memory being available for OpenGL textures. This may improve
EXA performance, but beware that it may cause problems with
OpenGL drivers from Mesa versions older than 6.4. With XAA,
specifiying lower percentage than what gets reserved without
this option has no effect, but the driver tries to increase
the video RAM reserved for textures to the amount specified
roughly. Default: 50.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DepthBits&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Precision in bits per pixel of the shared depth buffer used
for 3D acceleration. Valid values are 16 and 24. When this
is 24, there will also be a hardware accelerated stencil
buffer, but the combined depth/stencil buffer will take up
twice as much video RAM as when its 16. Default: The same as
the screen depth.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DMAForXv&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Try or
don t try to use DMA for Xv image transfers. This will
reduce CPU usage when playing big videos like DVDs, but may
cause instabilities. Default: on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SubPixelOrder&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Force subpixel order to specified order. Subpixel order is
used for subpixel decimation on flat panels. NONE -- No
subpixel (CRT like displays) RGB -- in horizontal RGB order
(most flat panels) BGR -- in horizontal BGR order (some flat
panels)</p>

<p>This option is intended to be used in following cases:
1. The default subpixel order is incorrect for your panel.
2. Enable subpixel decimation on analog panels. 3. Adjust to
one display type in dual-head clone mode setup. 4. Get
better performance with Render acceleration on digital
panels (use NONE setting). The default is NONE for CRT, RGB
for digital panels</p>

<p>Option &quot;DynamicClocks&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable dynamic clock scaling. The on-chip clocks will scale
dynamically based on usage. This can help reduce heat and
increase battery life by reducing power usage. Some users
report reduced 3D performance with this enabled. The default
is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;BIOSHotkeys&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable BIOS hotkey output switching. This allows the BIOS to
toggle outputs using hotkeys (e.g., fn-f7, etc.). Since the
driver does not support ACPI, there is no way to validate
modes on an output switch and the BIOS can potentially
change things behind the drivers back. The default is
off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;VGAAccess&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Tell
the driver if it can do legacy VGA IOs to the card. This is
necessary for properly resuming consoles when in VGA text
mode, but shouldn t be if the console is using radeonfb or
some other graphic mode driver. Some platforms like PowerPC
have issues with those, and they arent necessary unless you
have a real text mode in console. The default is off on
PowerPC and on on other architectures.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ReverseDDC&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; When
BIOS connector informations aren t available, use this
option to reverse the mapping of the 2 main DDC ports. Use
this if the X serve obviously detects the wrong display for
each con- nector. This is typically needed on the Radeon
9600 cards bun- dled with Apple G5s. The default is off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;LVDSProbePLL&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; When
BIOS panel informations arent available (like on Power-
Books), it may still be necessary to use the firmware
provided PLL values for the panel or flickering will happen.
This option will force probing of the current value
programmed in the chip when X is launched in that case. This
is only useful for LVDS panels (laptop internal panels). The
default is on.</p>
