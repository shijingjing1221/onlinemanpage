<p>READAHEAD(2) Linux Programmer s Manual READAHEAD(2)</p>

<p>NAME readahead - perform file readahead into page
cache</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t readahead(int fd, off64_t *offset, size_t
count);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION readahead() populates the page cache with
data from a file so that sub- sequent reads from that file
will not block on disk I/O. The fd argu- ment is a file
descriptor identifying the file which is to be read. The
offset argument specifies the starting point from which data
is to be read and count specifies the number of bytes to be
read. I/O is performed in whole pages, so that offset is
effectively rounded down to a page boundary and bytes are
read up to the next page boundary greater than or equal to
(offset+count). readahead() does not read beyond the end of
the file. readahead() blocks until the specified data has
been read. The current file offset of the open file referred
to by fd is left unchanged.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, readahead() returns 0; on
failure, -1 is returned, with errno set to indicate the
cause of the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF fd is not a valid file descriptor or is not
open for reading.</p>

<p>EINVAL fd does not refer to a file type to which
readahead() can be applied.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The readahead() system call is Linux
specific, and its use should be avoided in portable
applications.</p>

<p>NOTES The readahead() system call appeared in Linux
2.4.13.</p>
