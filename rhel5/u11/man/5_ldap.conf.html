<p>LDAP.CONF(5) LDAP.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME ldap.conf, .ldaprc - ldap configuration file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/ldap.conf, .ldaprc</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the environment variable LDAPNOINIT is
defined, all defaulting is disabled.</p>

<p>The ldap.conf configuration file is used to set
system-wide defaults to be applied when running ldap
clients.</p>

<p>Users may create an optional configuration file, ldaprc
or .ldaprc, in their home directory which will be used to
override the system-wide defaults file. The file ldaprc in
the current working directory is also used.</p>

<p>Additional configuration files can be specified using
the LDAPCONF and LDAPRC environment variables. LDAPCONF may
be set to the path of a configuration file. This path can be
absolute or relative to the cur- rent working directory. The
LDAPRC, if defined, should be the basename of a file in the
current working directory or in the users home direc-
tory.</p>

<p>Environmental variables may also be used to augment the
file based defaults. The name of the variable is the option
name with an added prefix of LDAP. For example, to define
BASE via the environment, set the variable LDAPBASE to the
desired value.</p>

<p>Some options are user-only. Such options are ignored if
present in the ldap.conf (or file specified by
LDAPCONF).</p>

<p>OPTIONS The configuration options are case-insensitive;
their value, on a case by case basis, may be case-sensitive.
The different configuration options are:</p>

<p>URI &lt;ldap[s]://[name[:port]] ...&gt; Specifies the
URI(s) of an LDAP server(s) to which the LDAP library should
connect. The URI scheme may be either ldap or ldaps which
refer to LDAP over TCP and LDAP over SSL (TLS) respectively.
Each servers name can be specified as a domain- style name
or an IP address literal. Optionally, the servers name can
followed by a : and the port number the LDAP server is
listening on. If no port number is provided, the default
port for the scheme is used (389 for ldap://, 636 for
ldaps://). A space separated list of URIs may be
provided.</p>

<p>BASE &lt;base&gt; Specifies the default base DN to use
when performing ldap opera- tions. The base must be
specified as a Distinguished Name in LDAP format.</p>

<p>BINDDN &lt;dn&gt; Specifies the default bind DN to use
when performing ldap opera- tions. The bind DN must be
specified as a Distinguished Name in LDAP format. This is a
user-only option.</p>

<p>HOST &lt;name[:port] ...&gt; Specifies the name(s) of an
LDAP server(s) to which the LDAP library should connect.
Each servers name can be specified as a domain-style name or
an IP address and optionally followed by a : and the port
number the ldap server is listening on. A space separated
list of hosts may be provided. HOST is depre- cated in favor
of URI.</p>

<p>NETWORK_TIMEOUT &lt;integer&gt; Specifies the timeout
(in seconds) after which the poll(2)/select(2) following a
connect(2) returns in case of no activity.</p>

<p>PORT &lt;port&gt; Specifies the default port used when
connecting to LDAP servers(s). The port may be specified as
a number. PORT is deprecated in favor of URI.</p>

<p>REFERRALS &lt;on/true/yes/off/false/no&gt; Specifies if
the client should automatically follow referrals returned by
LDAP servers. The default is on. Note that the command line
tools ldapsearch(1) &amp;co always override this option.</p>

<p>SIZELIMIT &lt;integer&gt; Specifies a size limit to use
when performing searches. The number should be a
non-negative integer. SIZELIMIT of zero (0) specifies
unlimited search size.</p>

<p>TIMELIMIT &lt;integer&gt; Specifies a time limit to use
when performing searches. The number should be a
non-negative integer. TIMELIMIT of zero (0) specifies
unlimited search time to be used.</p>

<p>DEREF &lt;when&gt; Specifies how alias dereferencing is
done when performing a search. The &lt;when&gt; can be
specified as one of the following key- words:</p>

<p>never Aliases are never dereferenced. This is the
default.</p>

<p>searching Aliases are dereferenced in subordinates of
the base object, but not in locating the base object of the
search.</p>

<p>finding Aliases are only dereferenced when locating the
base object of the search.</p>

<p>always Aliases are dereferenced both in searching and in
locat- ing the base object of the search.</p>

<p>SASL OPTIONS If OpenLDAP is built with Simple
Authentication and Security Layer sup- port, there are more
options you can specify.</p>

<p>SASL_MECH &lt;mechanism&gt; Specifies the SASL mechanism
to use. This is a user-only option.</p>

<p>SASL_REALM &lt;realm&gt; Specifies the SASL realm. This
is a user-only option.</p>

<p>SASL_AUTHCID &lt;authcid&gt; Specifies the
authentication identity. This is a user-only option.</p>

<p>SASL_AUTHZID &lt;authcid&gt; Specifies the proxy
authorization identity. This is a user-only option.</p>

<p>SASL_SECPROPS &lt;properties&gt; Specifies Cyrus SASL
security properties. The &lt;properties&gt; can be specified
as a comma-separated list of the following:</p>

<p>none (without any other properties) causes the
properties defaults (&quot;noanonymous,noplain&quot;) to be
cleared.</p>

<p>noplain disables mechanisms susceptible to simple
passive attacks.</p>

<p>noactive disables mechanisms susceptible to active
attacks.</p>

<p>nodict disables mechanisms susceptible to passive
dictionary attacks.</p>

<p>noanonymous disables mechanisms which support anonymous
login.</p>

<p>forwardsec requires forward secrecy between
sessions.</p>

<p>passcred requires mechanisms which pass client
credentials (and allows mechanisms which can pass
credentials to do so).</p>

<p>minssf=&lt;factor&gt; specifies the minimum acceptable
security strength factor as an integer approximating the
effective key length used for encryption. 0 (zero) implies
no protection, 1 implies integrity protection only, 56
allows DES or other weak ciphers, 112 allows triple DES and
other strong ciphers, 128 allows RC4, Blowfish and other
modern strong ciphers. The default is 0.</p>

<p>maxssf=&lt;factor&gt; specifies the maximum acceptable
security strength factor as an integer (see minssf
description). The default is INT_MAX.</p>

<p>maxbufsize=&lt;factor&gt; specifies the maximum security
layer receive buffer size allowed. 0 disables security
layers. The default is 65536.</p>

<p>TLS OPTIONS If OpenLDAP is built with Transport Layer
Security support, there are more options you can specify.
These options are used when an ldaps:// URI is selected (by
default or otherwise) or when the application nego- tiates
TLS by issuing the LDAP Start TLS operation.</p>

<p>TLS_CACERT &lt;filename&gt; Specifies the file that
contains certificates for all of the Certificate Authorities
the client will recognize. This is the preferred method for
specifying the list of Certificate Author- ity
certificates.</p>

<p>TLS_CACERTDIR &lt;path&gt; Specifies the path of a
directory that contains Certificate Authority certificates
in separate individual files. The TLS_CACERT is always used
before TLS_CACERTDIR. The use of TLS_CACERTDIR is
discouraged. Instead, bundle all Certificate Authority
certificates into a single file and use the TLS_CACERT
option to specify that file.</p>

<p>TLS_CERT &lt;filename&gt; Specifies the file that
contains the client certificate. This is a user-only
option.</p>

<p>TLS_KEY &lt;filename&gt; Specifies the file that
contains the private key that matches the certificate stored
in the TLS_CERT file. Currently, the pri- vate key must not
be protected with a password, so it is of critical
importance that the key file is protected carefully. This is
a user-only option.</p>

<p>TLS_CIPHER_SUITE &lt;cipher-suite-spec&gt; Specifies
acceptable cipher suite and preference order.
&lt;cipher-suite-spec&gt; should be a cipher specification
for OpenSSL, e.g., HIGH:MEDIUM:+SSLv2.</p>

<p>TLS_RANDFILE &lt;filename&gt; Specifies the file to
obtain random bits from when /dev/[u]ran- dom is not
available. Generally set to the name of the EGD/PRNGD
socket. The environment variable RANDFILE can also be used
to specify the filename.</p>

<p>TLS_REQCERT &lt;level&gt; Specifies what checks to
perform on server certificates in a TLS session, if any. The
&lt;level&gt; can be specified as one of the fol- lowing
keywords:</p>

<p>never The client will not request or check any server
certifi- cate.</p>

<p>allow The server certificate is requested. If no
certificate is provided, the session proceeds normally. If a
bad cer- tificate is provided, it will be ignored and the
session proceeds normally.</p>

<p>try The server certificate is requested. If no
certificate is provided, the session proceeds normally. If a
bad cer- tificate is provided, the session is immediately
termi- nated.</p>

<p>demand | hard These keywords are equivalent. The server
certificate is requested. If no certificate is provided, or
a bad cer- tificate is provided, the session is immediately
termi- nated. This is the default setting.</p>

<p>TLS_CRLCHECK &lt;level&gt; Specifies if the Certificate
Revocation List (CRL) of the CA should be used to verify if
the server certificates have not been revoked. This requires
TLS_CACERTDIR parameter to be set. &lt;level&gt; can be
specified as one of the following keywords:</p>

<p>none No CRL checks are performed</p>

<p>peer Check the CRL of the peer certificate</p>

<p>all Check the CRL for a whole certificate chain</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES LDAPNOINIT disable all
defaulting</p>

<p>LDAPCONF path of a configuration file</p>

<p>LDAPRC basename of ldaprc file in $HOME or $CWD</p>

<p>LDAP&lt;option-name&gt; Set &lt;option-name&gt; as from
ldap.conf</p>

<p>FILES /etc/openldap/ldap.conf system-wide ldap
configuration file</p>

<p>$HOME/ldaprc, $HOME/.ldaprc user ldap configuration
file</p>

<p>$CWD/ldaprc local ldap configuration file</p>
