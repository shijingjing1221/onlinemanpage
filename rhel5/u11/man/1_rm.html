<p>NAME rm - remove files or directories</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rm [OPTION]... FILE...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents the GNU version
of rm. rm removes each specified file. By default, it does
not remove directories.</p>

<p>If a file is unwritable, the standard input is a tty,
and the -f or --force option is not given, rm prompts the
user for whether to remove the file. If the response is not
affirmative, the file is skipped.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).</p>

<p>-f, --force ignore nonexistent files, never prompt</p>

<p>-i, --interactive prompt before any removal</p>

<p>--no-preserve-root do not treat / specially (the
default)</p>

<p>--preserve-root fail to operate recursively on /</p>

<p>-r, -R, --recursive remove directories and their
contents recursively</p>

<p>-v, --verbose explain what is being done</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>By default, rm does not remove directories. Use the
--recursive (-r or -R) option to remove each listed
directory, too, along with all of its contents.</p>

<p>To remove a file whose name starts with a -, for example
-foo, use one of these commands:</p>

<p>rm -- -foo</p>

<p>rm ./-foo</p>

<p>Note that if you use rm to remove a file, it is usually
possible to recover the contents of that file. If you want
more assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable,
consider using shred.</p>
