<p>NAME gzexe - compress executable files in place</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gzexe [ name ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gzexe utility allows you to compress
executables in place and have them automatically uncompress
and execute when you run them (at a penalty in performance).
For example if you execute gzexe /bin/cat it will create the
following two files: -r-xr-xr-x 1 root bin 9644 Feb 11 11:16
/bin/cat -r-xr-xr-x 1 bin bin 24576 Nov 23 13:21 /bin/cat~
/bin/cat~ is the original file and /bin/cat is the
self-uncompressing executable file. You can remove /bin/cat~
once you are sure that /bin/cat works properly.</p>

<p>This utility is most useful on systems with very small
disks.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Decompress the given executables instead of
compressing them.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO gzip(1), znew(1), zmore(1), zcmp(1),
zforce(1)</p>

<p>CAVEATS The compressed executable is a shell script.
This may create some secu- rity holes. In particular, the
compressed executable relies on the PATH environment
variable to find gzip and some other utilities (tail, chmod,
ln, sleep).</p>

<p>BUGS gzexe attempts to retain the original file
attributes on the compressed executable, but you may have to
fix them manually in some cases, using chmod or chown.</p>
