<p>DNSSEC-SIGNZONE(8) BIND9 DNSSEC-SIGNZONE(8)</p>

<p>NAME dnssec-signzone - DNSSEC zone signing tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dnssec-signzone [-a] [-c class] [-d directory]
[-e end-time] [-f output-file] [-g] [-h] [-k key] [-l
domain] [-i interval] [-n nthreads] [-o origin] [-p] [-r
randomdev] [-s start-time] [-t] [-v level] [-z] {zonefile}
[key...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dnssec-signzone signs a zone. It generates
NSEC and RRSIG records and produces a signed version of the
zone. The security status of delegations from the signed
zone (that is, whether the child zones are secure or not) is
determined by the presence or absence of a keyset file for
each child zone.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Verify all generated signatures.</p>

<p>-c class Specifies the DNS class of the zone.</p>

<p>-k key Treat specified key as a key signing key ignoring
any key flags. This option may be specified multiple
times.</p>

<p>-l domain Generate a DLV set in addition to the key
(DNSKEY) and DS sets. The domain is appended to the name of
the records.</p>

<p>-d directory Look for keyset files in directory as the
directory</p>

<p>-D directory Look for zone signing keys in directory as
the directory</p>

<p>-g Generate DS records for child zones from keyset
files. Existing DS records will be removed.</p>

<p>-s start-time Specify the date and time when the
generated RRSIG records become valid. This can be either an
absolute or relative time. An absolute start time is
indicated by a number in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation;
20000530144500 denotes 14:45:00 UTC on May 30th, 2000. A
relative start time is indicated by +N, which is N seconds
from the current time. If no start-time is specified, the
current time minus 1 hour (to allow for clock skew) is
used.</p>

<p>-e end-time Specify the date and time when the generated
RRSIG records expire. As with start-time, an absolute time
is indicated in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation. A time relative to
the start time is indicated with +N, which is N seconds from
the start time. A time relative to the current time is
indicated with now+N. If no end-time is specified, 30 days
from the start time is used as a default.</p>

<p>-f output-file The name of the output file containing
the signed zone. The default is to append .signed to the
input filename.</p>

<p>-h Prints a short summary of the options and arguments
to dnssec-signzone.</p>

<p>-i interval When a previously-signed zone is passed as
input, records may be resigned. The interval option
specifies the cycle interval as an offset from the current
time (in seconds). If a RRSIG record expires after the cycle
interval, it is retained. Otherwise, it is considered to be
expiring soon, and it will be replaced.</p>

<p>The default cycle interval is one quarter of the
difference between the signature end and start times. So if
neither end-time or start-time are specified,
dnssec-signzone generates signatures that are valid for 30
days, with a cycle interval of 7.5 days. Therefore, if any
existing RRSIG records are due to expire in less than 7.5
days, they would be replaced.</p>

<p>-n ncpus Specifies the number of threads to use. By
default, one thread is started for each detected CPU.</p>

<p>-o origin The zone origin. If not specified, the name of
the zone file is assumed to be the origin.</p>

<p>-p Use pseudo-random data when signing the zone. This is
faster, but less secure, than using real random data. This
option may be useful when signing large zones or when the
entropy source is limited.</p>

<p>-r randomdev Specifies the source of randomness. If the
operating system does not provide a /dev/random or
equivalent device, the default source of randomness is
keyboard input. randomdev specifies the name of a character
device or file containing random data to be used instead of
the default. The special value keyboard indicates that
keyboard input should be used.</p>

<p>-t Print statistics at completion.</p>

<p>-v level Sets the debugging level.</p>

<p>-z Ignore KSK flag on key when determining what to
sign.</p>

<p>zonefile The file containing the zone to be signed.</p>

<p>key Specify which keys should be used to sign the zone.
If no keys are specified, then the zone will be examined for
DNSKEY records at the zone apex. If these are found and
there are matching private keys, in the current directory,
then these will be used for signing.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following command signs the example.com zone
with the DSA key generated by dnssec-keygen
(Kexample.com.+003+17247). The zones keys must be in the
master file (db.example.com). This invocation looks for
keyset files, in the current directory, so that DS records
can be generated from them (-g).</p>

<p>% dnssec-signzone -g -o example.com db.example.com
Kexample.com.+003+17247 db.example.com.signed %</p>

<p>In the above example, dnssec-signzone creates the file
db.example.com.signed. This file should be referenced in a
zone statement in a named.conf file.</p>

<p>This example re-signs a previously signed zone with
default parameters. The private keys are assumed to be in
the current directory.</p>

<p>% cp db.example.com.signed db.example.com %
dnssec-signzone -o example.com db.example.com
db.example.com.signed %</p>
