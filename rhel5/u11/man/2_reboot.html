<p>REBOOT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual REBOOT(2)</p>

<p>NAME reboot - reboot or enable/disable Ctrl-Alt-Del</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS For libc4 and libc5 the library call and the
system call are identical, and since kernel version 2.1.30
there are symbolic names LINUX_REBOOT_* for the constants
and a fourth argument to the call:</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include
&lt;linux/reboot.h&gt;</p>

<p>int reboot(int magic, int magic2, int flag, void
*arg);</p>

<p>Under glibc some of the constants involved have gotten
symbolic names RB_*, and the library call is a 1-argument
wrapper around the 3-argu- ment system call:</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/reboot.h&gt;</p>

<p>int reboot(int flag);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The reboot() call reboots the system, or
enables/disables the reboot keystroke (abbreviated CAD,
since the default is Ctrl-Alt-Delete; it can be changed
using loadkeys(1)).</p>

<p>This system call will fail (with EINVAL) unless magic
equals LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC1 (that is, 0xfee1dead) and magic2
equals LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2 (that is, 672274793). However,
since 2.1.17 also LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2A (that is, 85072278)
and since 2.1.97 also LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2B (that is,
369367448) and since 2.5.71 also LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2C (that
is, 537993216) are permitted as value for magic2. (The
hexadecimal values of these constants are meaningful.) The
flag argument can have the following values:</p>

<p>LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART (RB_AUTOBOOT, 0x1234567). The
message Restarting system. is printed, and a default restart
is performed immediately. If not preceded by a sync(2), data
will be lost.</p>

<p>LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_HALT (RB_HALT_SYSTEM, 0xcdef0123; since
1.1.76). The message System halted. is printed, and the
system is halted. Control is given to the ROM monitor, if
there is one. If not preceded by a sync(2), data will be
lost.</p>

<p>LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_POWER_OFF (0x4321fedc; since 2.1.30).
The message Power down. is printed, the system is stopped,
and all power is removed from the system, if possible. If
not preceded by a sync(2), data will be lost.</p>

<p>LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART2 (0xa1b2c3d4; since 2.1.30).
The message Restarting system with command %s is printed,
and a restart (using the command string given in arg) is
performed immediately. If not preceded by a sync(2), data
will be lost.</p>

<p>LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_CAD_ON (RB_ENABLE_CAD, 0x89abcdef). CAD
is enabled. This means that the CAD keystroke will
immediately cause the action associated with
LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART.</p>

<p>LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_CAD_OFF (RB_DISABLE_CAD, 0). CAD is
disabled. This means that the CAD keystroke will cause a
SIGINT signal to be sent to init (process 1), whereupon this
process may decide upon a proper action (maybe: kill all
processes, sync, reboot).</p>

<p>Only the superuser may use this function.</p>

<p>The precise effect of the above actions depends on the
architecture. For the i386 architecture, the additional
argument does not do anything at present (2.1.122), but the
type of reboot can be determined by ker- nel command line
arguments (reboot=...) to be either warm or cold, and either
hard or through the BIOS.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT Problem with getting userspace data under
LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART2.</p>

<p>EINVAL Bad magic numbers or flag.</p>

<p>EPERM The calling process has insufficient privilege to
call reboot(); the CAP_SYS_BOOT capability is required.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO reboot() is Linux specific, and should not
be used in programs intended to be portable.</p>

ctrlaltdel(8), halt(8), reboot(8)</p>
