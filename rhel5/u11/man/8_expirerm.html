<p>EXPIRERM(8) EXPIRERM(8)</p>

<p>NAME expirerm - remove articles that have been
expired.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS expirerm file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Expirerm is a script that removes a list of
files. The specified file lists the files. It is sorted, and
then fed into a pipeline responsi- ble for doing the
removal, normally fastrm(8). If there seemed to be a problem
removing the files, then mail is sent to the news
administra- tor. If there were no problems, then file is
renamed to &lt;pathlog in inn.conf&gt;/expire.list where it
is kept (for safety) until the next time expiration is
done.</p>
