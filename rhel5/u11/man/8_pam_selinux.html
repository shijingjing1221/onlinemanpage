<p>PAM_SELINUX(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_SELINUX(8)</p>

<p>NAME pam_selinux - PAM module to set the default
security context</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_selinux.so [close] [debug] [open] [nottys]
[verbose] [select_context] [use_current_range]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In a nutshell, pam_selinux sets up the
default security context for the next execed shell.</p>

<p>When an application opens a session using pam_selinux,
the shell that gets executed will be run in the default
security context, or if the user chooses and the pam file
allows the selected security context. Also the controlling
tty will have its security context modified to match the
users.</p>

<p>Adding pam_selinux into a pam file could cause other pam
modules to change their behavior if the exec another
application. The close and open option help mitigate this
problem. close option will only cause the close portion of
the pam_selinux to execute, and open will only cause the
open portion to run. You can add pam_selinux to the config
file twice. Add the pam_selinux close as the executes the
open pass through the modules, pam_selinux open_session will
happen last. When PAM executes the close pass through the
modules pam_selinux close_session will happen first.</p>

<p>OPTIONS close Only execute the close_session portion of
the module.</p>

<p>debug Turns on debugging via syslog(3).</p>

<p>open Only execute the open_session portion of the
module.</p>

<p>nottys Do not try to setup the ttys security
context.</p>

<p>verbose attempt to inform the user when security context
is set.</p>

<p>select_context Attempt to ask the user for a custom
security context role. If MLS is on ask also for sensitivity
level.</p>

<p>use_current_range Use the sensitivity range of the
process for the user context. This option and the
select_context option are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>MODULE SERVICES PROVIDED Only the session service is
supported.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_AUTH_ERR Unable to get or set a valid
context.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS The security context was set
successfull.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN The user is not known to the
system.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES auth required pam_unix.so session required
pam_permit.so session optional pam_selinux.so</p>
