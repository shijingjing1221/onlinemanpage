<p>NAME synaptics - Synaptics touchpad driver for
XOrg/XFree86.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION This is a driver for the Synaptics TouchPad
for XOrg/XFree86 4.x. A Synaptics touchpad by default
operates in compatibility mode by emulat- ing a standard
mouse. However, by using a dedicated driver, more advanced
features of the touchpad becomes available, such as:</p>

<p>&middot; Movement with adjustable, non-linear
acceleration and speed.</p>

<p>&middot; Button events through short touching of the
touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; Double-Button events through double short
touching of the touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; Dragging through short touching and holding
down the finger on the touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; Middle and right button events on the upper and
lower corner of the touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; Vertical scrolling (button four and five
events) through moving the finger on the right side of the
touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; The up/down button sends button four/five
events.</p>

<p>&middot; Horizontal scrolling (button six and seven
events) through moving the finger on the lower side of the
touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; The multi-buttons send button four/five events,
and six/seven events for horizontal scrolling.</p>

<p>&middot; Adjustable finger detection.</p>

<p>&middot; Multifinger taps: two finger for middle button
and three finger for right button events. (Needs hardware
support. Not all models implement this feature.)</p>

<p>&middot; Run-time configuration using shared memory.
This means you can change parameter settings without
restarting the X server.</p>

<p>Note that depending on the touchpad firmware, some of
these features might be available even without using the
synaptics driver. Note also that some functions are not
available on all touchpad models, because they need support
from the touchpad hardware/firmware. (Multifinger taps for
example.)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The driver behavior can be configured with
parameters. These parame- ters are options in the
InputDevice section in the XOrg/XFree86 config file. See the
INSTALL file for a working example. If you have the
SHMConfig parameter enabled, these parameters can also be
changed at runtime with the synclient(1) program. The
following parameters are available:</p>

are used for scrolling (Left- RightScrolling), these buttons
will send auto-repeating 6/7 events, with the delay between
repeats determined by ScrollBut- tonRepeat.</p>

<p>CoastingSpeed (Float) Coasting threshold scrolling

<p>The LeftEdge, RightEdge, TopEdge and BottomEdge
parameters are used to define the edge and corner areas of
the touchpad. The parameters split the touchpad area in 9
pieces, like this:</p>

<p>| | | LeftEdge | RightEdge +-----+-------------+---+
Physical top edge | 1 | 2 | 3 | +-----+-------------+---+
TopEdge | | | | | 4 | 5 | 6 | | | | |
+-----+-------------+---+ BottomEdge | 7 | 8 | 9 |
+-----+-------------+---+ Physical bottom edge |Physical
left edge | Physical right edge</p>

<p>Coordinates to the left of LeftEdge are part of the left
edge (areas 1, 4 and 7), coordinates to the left of LeftEdge
and above TopEdge (area 1) are part of the upper left
corner, etc. A good way to find appro- priate edge
parameters is to enable the SHMConfig option and run
&quot;syn- client -m 1&quot; to see the x/y coordinates
corresponding to different positions on the touchpad.</p>

<p>A tap event happens when the finger is touched and
released in a time interval shorter than MaxTapTime, and the
touch and release coordinates are less than MaxTapMove units
apart. A &quot;touch&quot; event happens when the Z value
goes above FingerHigh, and an &quot;untouch&quot; event
happens when the Z value goes below FingerLow.</p>

<p>The MaxDoubleTapTime parameter has the same function as
the MaxTapTime parameter, but for the second, third, etc tap
in a tap sequence. If you cant perform double clicks fast
enough (for example, xmms depends on fast double clicks),
try reducing this parameter. If you cant get word selection
to work in xterm (ie button down, button up, button down,
move mouse), try increasing this parameter.</p>

<p>The ClickTime parameter controls the delay between the
button down and button up X events generated in response to
a tap event. A too long value can cause undesirable
autorepeat in scroll bars and a too small value means that
visual feedback from the gui application you are interacting
with is harder to see.</p>

<p>The MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor parameters
control the pointer motion speed. The speed value defines
the scaling between touchpad coordinates and screen
coordinates. When moving the finger very slowly, the
MinSpeed value is used, when moving very fast the MaxSpeed
value is used. When moving the finger at moderate speed, you
get a pointer motion speed somewhere between MinSpeed and
MaxSpeed. If you dont want any acceleration, set MinSpeed
and MaxSpeed to the same value.</p>

<p>The MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor parameters don t
have any effect on scrolling speed. Scrolling speed is
determined solely from the VertScrollDelta and
HorizScrollDelta parameters. To disable vertical or
horizontal scrolling, set VertScrollDelta or
HorizScrollDelta to zero.</p>

<p>When hitting an egde, movement can be automatically
continued. If EdgeMotionUseAlways is false, edge motion is
only used when dragging. With EdgeMotionUseAlways set to
true, it is also used for normal cursor movements.</p>

<p>Edge motion speed is calculated by taking into account
the amount of pressure applied to the touchpad. The
sensitivity can be adjusted using the EdgeMotion parameters.
If the pressure is below EdgeMotion- MinZ,
EdgeMotionMinSpeed is used, and if the pressure is greater
than EdgeMotionMaxZ, EdgeMotionMaxSpeed is used. For a
pressure value between EdgeMotionMinZ and EdgeMotionMaxZ,
the speed is increased lin- early.</p>

<p>Since most synaptics touchpad models dont have a button
that corre- sponds to the middle button on a mouse, the
driver can emulate middle mouse button events. If you press
both the left and right mouse but- tons at almost the same
time (no more than EmulateMidButtonTime mil- liseconds
apart) the driver generates a middle mouse button event.</p>

<p>Circular scrolling acts like a scrolling wheel on the
trackpad. Scrolling is engaged when a drag starts in the
given CircScrollTrigger region, which can be all edges, a
particular side, or a particular cor- ner. Once scrolling is
engaged, moving your finger in clockwise cir- cles around
the trackpad will generate scroll down events and counter
clockwise scroll up events. Lifting your finger will
disengage circu- lar scrolling. Use tight circles near the
center of the pad for fast scrolling and large circles for
better control. When used together with vertical scrolling,
hitting the upper or lower right corner will seamlessly
switch over from vertical to circular scrolling.</p>

<p>Coasting is enabled by setting the CoastingSpeed
parameter to a non- zero value. When coasting is enabled,
horizontal/vertical scrolling can continue after the finger
is released from the lower/right edge of the touchpad. The
driver computes the scrolling speed corresponding to the
finger speed immediately before the finger leaves the
touchpad. If this scrolling speed is larger than the
CoastingSpeed parameter (mea- sured in scroll events per
second), the scrolling will continue with the same speed in
the same direction until the finger touches the touchpad
again.</p>
