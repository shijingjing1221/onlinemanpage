<p>NAME rcp - remote file copy</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rcp [-p] [-x] [-k realm ] [-c ccachefile] [-C
configfile] [-D port] [-N] [-PN | -PO] file1 file2</p>

<p>rcp [-p] [-x] [-k realm] [-r] [-D port] [-N] [-PN | -PO]
file ... directory</p>

<p>rcp [-f | -t] ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rcp copies files between machines. Each file
or directory argument is either a remote file name of the
form rhost:path, or a local file name (containing no :
characters, or a / before any :s).</p>

<p>By default, the mode and owner of file2 are preserved if
it already existed; otherwise the mode of the source file
modified by the umask(2) on the destination host is
used.</p>

<p>If path is not a full path name, it is interpreted
relative to your login directory on rhost. A path on a
remote host may be quoted (using &quot;, or &acute;) so that
the metacharacters are interpreted remotely.</p>

<p>Rcp does not prompt for passwords; it uses Kerberos
authentication when connecting to rhost. Each user may have
a private authorization list in a file .k5login in his login
directory. Each line in this file should contain a Kerberos
principal name of the form princi- pal/instance@realm. If
there is a ~/.k5login file, then access is granted to the
account if and only if the originating user is authenti-
cated to one of the principals named in the ~/.k5login file.
Other- wise, the originating user will be granted access to
the account if and only if the authenticated principal name
of the user can be mapped to the local account name using
the aname -&gt; lname mapping rules (see krb5_anadd(8) for
more details).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p attempt to preserve (duplicate) the
modification times and modes of the source files in the
copies, ignoring the umask.</p>

<p>-x encrypt all information transferring between
hosts.</p>

<p>-k realm obtain tickets for the remote host in realm
instead of the remote host s realm as determined by
krb_realmofhost(3).</p>

<p>-c ccachefile change the default credentials cache file
to ccachefile</p>

<p>-C configfile change the default configuration file to
configfile</p>

<p>-r if any of the source files are directories, copy each
subtree rooted at that name; in this case the destination
must be a directory.</p>

<p>-PN</p>

<p>-PO Explicitly request new or old version of the
Kerberos rcmd protocol. The new protocol avoids many
security problems found in the old one, but is not
interoperable with older servers. (An &quot;input/output
error&quot; and a closed connection is the most likely
result of attempting this combination.) If neither option is
specified, some simple heuristics are used to guess which to
try.</p>

<p>-D port connect to port port on the remote machine.</p>

<p>-N use a network connection, even when copying files on
the local machine (used for testing purposes).</p>

<p>-f -t These options are for internal use only. They tell
the remotely-running rcp process (started via the Kerberos
remote shell daemon) which direction files are being sent.
These options should not be used by the user. In particular,
-f does not mean that the users Kerberos ticket should be
forwarded!</p>

<p>Rcp handles third party copies, where neither source nor
target files are on the current machine. Hostnames may also
take the form rname@rhost to use rname rather than the
current user name on the remote host.</p>

<p>FILES ~/.k5login (on remote host) - file containing
Kerberos principals that are allowed access.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO cp(1), ftp(1), rsh(1), rlogin(1), kerberos(3),
krb_getrealm(3), kshd(8), rcp(1) [UCB version]</p>

<p>BUGS Rcp doesn t detect all cases where the target of a
copy might be a file in cases where only a directory should
be legal.</p>

<p>Rcp is confused by any output generated by commands in a
.login, .pro- file, or .cshrc file on the remote host.</p>

<p>Kerberos is only used for the first connection of a
third-party copy; the second connection uses the standard
Berkeley rcp protocol.</p>
