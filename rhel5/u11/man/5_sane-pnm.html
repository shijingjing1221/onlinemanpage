<p>sane-pnm(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy sane-pnm(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-pnm - SANE PNM image reader pseudo-backend</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-pnm library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) back- end that provides access to
PNM (Portable aNyMap files, which covers PBM bitmap files,
PGM grayscale files, and PPM pixmap files). The pur- pose of
this backend is primarly to aid in debugging of SANE
frontends. It also serves as an illustrative example of a
minimal SANE backend.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend provides two devices called 0
and 1.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION No configuration required.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib*/sane/libsane-pnm.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib*/sane/libsane-pnm.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_PNM If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of
128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>BUGS If the pnm backend is installed and saned is used
to allow users on remote computers to scan on the local
machine, pnm files can be read by the remote user. This is
limited to the files saned can access (usually its running
as user &quot;sane&quot;). All pnm files can be read if
saned runs as root which isnt recommended anyway. The pnm
backend is disabled by default. If you want to use it,
enable it with configure (see configure --help for details).
Be sure that only trusted users can access the pnm backend
over saned.</p>
