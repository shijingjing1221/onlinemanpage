<p>SYSINFO(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SYSINFO(2)</p>

<p>NAME sysinfo - returns information on overall system
statistics</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/sysinfo.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sysinfo(struct sysinfo *info);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Until Linux 2.3.16, sysinfo() used to return
information in the follow- ing structure:</p>

<p>struct sysinfo { long uptime; /* Seconds since boot */
unsigned long loads[3]; /* 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages
*/ unsigned long totalram; /* Total usable main memory size
*/ unsigned long freeram; /* Available memory size */
unsigned long sharedram; /* Amount of shared memory */
unsigned long bufferram; /* Memory used by buffers */
unsigned long totalswap; /* Total swap space size */
unsigned long freeswap; /* swap space still available */
unsigned short procs; /* Number of current processes */ char
_f[22]; /* Pads structure to 64 bytes */ };</p>

<p>and the sizes were given in bytes. Since Linux 2.3.23
(i386), 2.3.48 (all architectures) the structure is</p>

<p>struct sysinfo { long uptime; /* Seconds since boot */
unsigned long loads[3]; /* 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages
*/ unsigned long totalram; /* Total usable main memory size
*/ unsigned long freeram; /* Available memory size */
unsigned long sharedram; /* Amount of shared memory */
unsigned long bufferram; /* Memory used by buffers */
unsigned long totalswap; /* Total swap space size */
unsigned long freeswap; /* swap space still available */
unsigned short procs; /* Number of current processes */
unsigned long totalhigh; /* Total high memory size */
unsigned long freehigh; /* Available high memory size */
unsigned int mem_unit; /* Memory unit size in bytes */ char
_f[20-2*sizeof(long)-sizeof(int)]; /* Padding for libc5 */
};</p>

<p>and the sizes are given as multiples of mem_unit
bytes.</p>

<p>sysinfo() provides a simple way of getting overall
system statistics. This is more portable than reading
/dev/kmem. For an example of its use, see intro(2).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT pointer to struct sysinfo is invalid</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function is Linux-specific, and
should not be used in programs intended to be portable.</p>

<p>The Linux kernel has a sysinfo() system call since
0.98.pl6. Linux libc contains a sysinfo() routine since
5.3.5, and glibc has one since 1.90.</p>
