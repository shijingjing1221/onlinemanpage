<p>NAME plainrsa-gen - generator for Plain RSA keys</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS plainrsa-gen [-b bits] [-e pubexp] [-f outfile]
[-h]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION plainrsa-gen can be used to generate Plain
RSA keys for authentication purposes. Using Plain RSA keys
is optional. Other possibilities are Pre-shared keys or
X.509 certificates.</p>

<p>-b bits bit length of the key. Default is 1024,
recommended length is 2048 or even 4096 bits. Note that
generating longer keys takes more time.</p>

<p>-e pubexp value of the RSA public exponent. Default is
0x3. Dont change this unless you really know what you are
doing!</p>

<p>-f outfile write the resulting key to outfile instead of
stdout. If the file already exists it won t be overwritten.
You wouldnt like to lose your private key by accident, would
you?</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILE FORMAT This is the secret private key that
should never leave your computer:</p>

<p>: RSA { # RSA 1024 bits # pubkey=0sAQOrWlcwbAIdNSMhDt...
Modulus: 0xab5a57306c021d3523... PublicExponent: 0x03
PrivateExponent: 0x723c3a2048... Prime1:
0xd309b30e6adf9d85c01... Prime2: 0xcfdc2a8aa5b2b3c90e3...
Exponent1: 0x8cb122099c9513ae... Exponent2:
0x8a92c7071921cd30... Coefficient: 0x722751305eafe9... }</p>

<p>The line pubkey=0sAQOrW... of the private key contains a
public key that should be stored in the other peers
configuration in this format:</p>

<p>: PUB 0sAQOrWlcwbAIdNSMhDt...</p>

<p>You can also specify from and to addresses for which the
key is valid:</p>

<p>0.0.0.0/0 10.20.30.0/24 : PUB
0sAQOrWlcwbAIdNSMhDt...</p>
