<p>READLINK(2) Linux Programmer s Manual READLINK(2)</p>

<p>NAME readlink - read value of a symbolic link</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t readlink(const char *path, char *buf, size_t
bufsiz);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION readlink() places the contents of the
symbolic link path in the buffer buf, which has size bufsiz.
readlink() does not append a null byte to buf. It will
truncate the contents (to a length of bufsiz characters), in
case the buffer is too small to hold all of the
contents.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The call returns the count of characters
placed in the buffer if it succeeds, or a -1 if an error
occurs, placing the error code in errno.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES Search permission is denied for a
component of the path prefix. (See also
path_resolution(2).)</p>

<p>EFAULT buf extends outside the processs allocated
address space.</p>

<p>EINVAL bufsiz is not positive.</p>

<p>EINVAL The named file is not a symbolic link.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from the file
system.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
translating the pathname.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG A pathname, or a component of a pathname,
was too long.</p>

<p>ENOENT The named file does not exist.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.4BSD (the readlink() function call
appeared in 4.2BSD), POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>HISTORY In versions of glibc up to and including glibc
2.4, the return type of readlink() was declared as int.
Nowadays, the return type is declared as ssize_t, as (newly)
required in POSIX.1-2001.</p>
