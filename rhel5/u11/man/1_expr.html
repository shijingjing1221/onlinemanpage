<p>NAME expr - evaluate expressions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS expr EXPRESSION expr OPTION</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION --help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>Print the value of EXPRESSION to standard output. A
blank line below separates increasing precedence groups.
EXPRESSION may be:</p>

<p>ARG1 | ARG2 ARG1 if it is neither null nor 0, otherwise
ARG2</p>

<p>ARG1 &amp; ARG2 ARG1 if neither argument is null or 0,
otherwise 0</p>

<p>ARG1 &lt; ARG2 ARG1 is less than ARG2</p>

<p>ARG1 &lt;= ARG2 ARG1 is less than or equal to ARG2</p>

<p>ARG1 = ARG2 ARG1 is equal to ARG2</p>

<p>ARG1 != ARG2 ARG1 is unequal to ARG2</p>

<p>ARG1 &gt;= ARG2 ARG1 is greater than or equal to
ARG2</p>

<p>ARG1 &gt; ARG2 ARG1 is greater than ARG2</p>

<p>ARG1 + ARG2 arithmetic sum of ARG1 and ARG2</p>

<p>ARG1 - ARG2 arithmetic difference of ARG1 and ARG2</p>

<p>ARG1 * ARG2 arithmetic product of ARG1 and ARG2</p>

<p>ARG1 / ARG2 arithmetic quotient of ARG1 divided by
ARG2</p>

<p>ARG1 % ARG2 arithmetic remainder of ARG1 divided by
ARG2</p>

<p>STRING : REGEXP anchored pattern match of REGEXP in
STRING</p>

<p>match STRING REGEXP same as STRING : REGEXP</p>

<p>substr STRING POS LENGTH substring of STRING, POS
counted from 1</p>

<p>index STRING CHARS index in STRING where any CHARS is
found, or 0</p>

<p>length STRING length of STRING</p>

<p>+ TOKEN interpret TOKEN as a string, even if it is a</p>

<p>keyword like match or an operator like /</p>

<p>( EXPRESSION ) value of EXPRESSION</p>

<p>Beware that many operators need to be escaped or quoted
for shells. Comparisons are arithmetic if both ARGs are
numbers, else lexicographi- cal. Pattern matches return the
string matched between and or null; if and are not used,
they return the number of characters matched or 0.</p>

<p>Exit status is 0 if EXPRESSION is neither null nor 0, 1
if EXPRESSION is null or 0, 2 if EXPRESSION is syntactically
invalid, and 3 if an error occurred.</p>
