<p>curl_easy_cleanup(3) libcurl Manual
curl_easy_cleanup(3)</p>

<p>NAME curl_easy_cleanup - End a libcurl easy session</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>void curl_easy_cleanup(CURL *handle);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function must be the last function to
call for an easy session. It is the opposite of the
curl_easy_init(3) function and must be called with the same
handle as input that the curl_easy_init call returned.</p>

<p>This will effectively close all connections this handle
has used and possibly has kept open until now. Don t call
this function if you intend to transfer more files.</p>

<p>When you ve called this, you can safely remove all the
strings youve previously told libcurl to use, as it won t
use them anymore now.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE None</p>

<p>SEE ALSO curl_easy_init(3),</p>
