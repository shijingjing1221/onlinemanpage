<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>NAME gcalctool - a desktop calculator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gcalctool [ -D ] [ -E ] [ -a accuracy ] [ -v ]
[ -? ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gcalctool is a desktop calculator. It has
been designed to be used with either the mouse or the
keyboard. It is visually similar to a lot of hand-held
calculators. There are basic, financial and scientific
modes. Some of the calculator keys have menu marks. This
indicates that there is a menu associated with that key.
Each key is discussed in more detail below.</p>

<p>One of the most important things to remember about
gcalctool is that calculations are performed from left to
right, with no arithmetic precedence. If you need arithmetic
precedence, then you should use parentheses (see below).</p>

<p>Internal arithmetic is now done with multi-precision
floating point numbers. Accuracy can be adjusted from zero
to nine numeric places in fixed notation, but numbers can be
displayed in engineering and scien- tific notation as well.
There is also an option to show or remove trailing zeroes
after the numeric point. The calculator reverts to
scientific notation when the number is larger than the
display would allow in fixed notation. In the scientific
mode, the base of operation can be changed between binary,
octal, decimal and hexadecimal. Numbers are initially
displayed in fixed notation to nine numeric places, with
trailing zeroes removed, in the decimal base.</p>

<p>You can use the Copy and Paste functions in conjunction
with the numeric display to store or retrieve characters
from the clipboard. You can also remove the last digit
entered, completely clear the displayed entry and totally
reset the calculator.</p>

<p>There are ten memory registers. Numbers can be stored or
retrieved in these locations, and arithmetic can be
performed upon register con- tents.</p>

<p>On startup, gcalctool will use several configuration
resources stored in a gconf database. These are listed in
detail in the resources sec- tion of these manual pages. Any
constants or function definitions that the user defines are
also stored in this database.</p>

<p>Context sensitive help is also available. Control-F1
toggles whether tooltip help is displayed for the item which
currently has focus.</p>

rate window. About Gcalctool [ Control-A ] Display
information about this application, including the version
number and the author. CALCULATOR BUTTONS This section
describes the calculator keys present in the main gcalctool
window. gcalctool has three modes; basic, financial and sci-
entific. The keys associated with each of these modes are
described in separate sections below.</p>

<p>Keyboard equivalents appear in the square brackets. Note
that Alt fol- lowed by a letter indicates that the Alt key
and this key should be pressed together.</p>

<p>BASIC MODE Numerical Keys [ 0-9 . = &lt;Return&gt; ].
Enter a digit (decimal digits 0-9) into the display. The .
character acts as the numeric point, and = (or Return) is
used to complete numerical entry.</p>

<p>Upto forty digits may be entered.</p>

<p>Arithmetical Operations [ + - x * / ]. Perform an
arithmetical operation using the previous entry and the next
entry as operands. Addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division are denoted by the characters +, -, * and /
respectively (x is also synonymous with multiplication).</p>

<p>Number Manipulation Operators. Int [ i ] Return the
integer portion of the current entry. Frac [ : ] Return the
fractional portion of the current entry. Abs [ u ] Return
the absolute value of the current entry. +/- [ c ] Change
the arithmetic sign of the current entry. 1/x [ r ] Return
the value of 1 divided by the current entry. x^2 [ @ ]
Return the square of the current entry. % [ % ] Perform a
percentage calculation using the last entry and the next
entry. Sqrt [ s ] Perform a square root operation on the
current entry.</p>

<p>Menu Operations. Each of these operations has a popup
menu associated with it. It is also possible to use just the
keyboard to achieve the same results. The first keyboard
value selects the menu operation; the second key- board
character selects the new value for this operation. Unlike
the menu facility available with the mouse, there is no
visual feedback on what choices are available to you, so the
user has to know what item they wish to select. Acc [ a ]
Set the display accuracy. Between 0 and 9 [ 0-9 ]
significant digits can be displayed. Rcl [ R ] Retrieve
memory register value. There are ten memory registers [ 0-9
]. Sto [ S ] Store value in memory register. There are ten
memory registers [ 0-9 ]. The register number may be pre-
ceded by an arithmetic operation (addition, subtrac- tion,
multiplication or division), in which case the specified
operation is carried out between the dis- played entry and
the value currently in the selected memory register, and the
result is placed in the mem- ory register. Exch [ X ]
Exchange the current display with the contents of a memory
register. There are ten memory registers [ 0-9 ]. Other
Operations. Clr [ Delete ] Clear the display, and reset the
calculator. CE [ Control-Back Space or Escape ] Clear the
display. Bksp [ Back Space ] Remove the rightmost character
of the current entry, and recalculate the displayed
value.</p>

<p>FINANCIAL MODE An example of how to use each of these
financial calculations, is available via the tooltip help
facility. Ctrm [ m ] Compounding term. Computes the number
of compounding periods it will take an investment of present
value pv to grow to a future value of fv, earning a fixed
interest rate int per compounding period. Memory register
usage: Register 0 int (periodic interest rate). Register 1
fv (future value). Register 2 pv (present value).</p>

<p>Ddb [ d ] Double-declining depreciation. Computes the
deprecia- tion allowance on an asset for a specified period
of time, using the double-declining balance method. Memory
register usage: Register 0 cost (amount paid for asset).
Register 1 salvage (value of asset at end of life). Register
2 life (useful life of the asset). Register 3 period (time
period for deprecia- tion allowance).</p>

<p>Fv [ v ] Future value. This calculation determines the
future value of an investment. It computes the future value
based on a series of equal payments, each of amount pmt,
earning periodic interest rate int, over the number of
payment periods in term. Memory register usage: Register 0
pmt (periodic payment). Register 1 int (periodic interest
rate). Register 2 n (number of periods).</p>

<p>Pmt [ P ] Periodic payment. Computes the amount of the
periodic payment of a loan. Most installment loans are com-
puted like ordinary annuities, in that payments are made at
the end of each payment period. Memory register usage:
Register 0 prin (principal). Register 1 int (periodic
interest rate). Register 2 n (term).</p>

<p>Pv [ p ] Present value. Determines the present value of
an investment. It computes the present value based on a
series of equal payments, each of amount pmt, dis- counted
at periodic interest rate int, over the num- ber of periods
in term. Memory register usage: Register 0 pmt (periodic
payment). Register 1 int (periodic interest rate). Register
2 n (term).</p>

<p>Rate [ T ] Periodic interest rate. Returns the periodic
interest necessary for a present value of pv to grow to a
future value of fv over the number of compounding periods in
term. Memory register usage: Register 0 fv (future value).
Register 1 pv (present value). Register 2 n (term).</p>

<p>Sln [ l ] Straight-line depreciation. Computes the
straight- line depreciation of an asset for one period. The
straight-line method of depreciation divides the depreciable
cost (cost - salvage) evenly over the useful life of an
asset. The useful life is the num- ber of periods (typically
years) over which an asset is depreciated. Memory register
usage: Register 0 cost (cost of the asset). Register 1
salvage (salvage value of the asset). Register 2 life
(useful life of the asset).</p>

<p>Syd [ Y ] Sum-of-the-years-digits depreciation. The
sum-of-the- years -digits method of depreciation accelerates
the rate of depreciation, so that more depreciation expense
occurs in earlier periods than in later ones. The
depreciable cost is the actual cost minus salvage value. The
useful life is the number of periods (typ- ically years)
over which an asset is depreciated. Memory register usage:
Register 0 cost (cost of the asset). Register 1 salvage
(salvage value of the asset). Register 2 life (useful life
of the asset). Register 3 period (period for which
depreciation is computed).</p>

<p>Term [ t ] Payment period. Returns the number of payment
periods in the term of an ordinary annuity necessary to
accu- mulate a future value of fv, earning a periodic
interest rate of int. Each payment is equal to amount pmt.
Memory register usage: Register 0 pmt (periodic payment).
Register 1 fv (future value). Register 2 int (periodic
interest rate).</p>

<p>SCIENTIFIC MODE This section describes the functionality
available in the calculators scientific mode. This also
includes a special mode panel used for set- ting various
options.</p>

execute a function expression. There can be upto ten
functions expression defined by the user [0 - 9]. There are
no default function values.</p>

<p>Scientific buttons. &lt; [ &lt; ] Shift the current
entry to the left. The shift can be between 1 and 15 places
[ 1-9, A-F ]. This calculator key has a popup menu
associated with it. &gt; [ &gt; ] Shift the current entry to
the right. The shift can be between 1 and 15 places [ 1-9,
A-F ]. This calcu- lator key has a popup menu associated
with it. &amp;16 [ ] ] Truncate the current entry to a 16
bit unsigned inte- ger. &amp;32 [ [ ] Truncate the current
entry to a 32 bit unsigned inte- ger. ( and ) [ ( and ) ]
Parentheses. Allow precedence with arithmetic calcu-
lations. Note that parentheses can be nested to any level,
and gcalctool provides a visual feedback of what is being
typed in, in the calculator display. The calculation doesn t
take place until the last parenthesis is matched, then the
display is updated with the new result. Exp [ e ] This is
used to allow numbers to be entered in scien- tific
notation. The mantissa should be initially entered, then the
Exp key selected. The exponent is then entered. If no
numerical input had occurred when the Exp key was selected,
then a mantissa of 1.0 is assumed. e^x [ { ] Returns e
raised to the power of the current entry. 10^x [ } ] Returns
10 raised to the power of the current entry. y^x [ y ] Take
the last entry and raise it to the power of the next entry.
x! [ ! ] Return the factorial of the current entry. Note
that the factorial function is only valid for positive
integers. Rand [ ? ] Return a random number between 0.0 and
1.0. Hexadecimal Keys [ A-F ] The hexadecimal numerical
digits A-F. These buttons will be insensitive unless the
calculator is cur- rently in the hexadecimal mode. Cos [ J ]
Return the trigonometric cosine, arc cosine, hyper- bolic
cosine or inverse hyperbolic cosine of the cur- rent
display, depending upon the current settings of the
hyperbolic and inverse function switches. The result is
displayed in the current trigonometric units (degrees,
radians or grads). Sin [ K ] Return the trigonometric sine,
arc sine, hyperbolic sine or inverse hyperbolic sine of the
current dis- play, depending upon the current settings of
the hyperbolic and inverse function switches. The result is
displayed in the current trigonometric units (degrees,
radians or grads). Tan [ L ] Return the trigonometric
tangent, arc tangent, hyper- bolic tangent or inverse
hyperbolic tangent of the current display, depending upon
the current settings of the hyperbolic and inverse function
switches. The result is displayed in the current
trigonometric units (degrees, radians or grads). Ln [ N ]
Return the natural logarithm of the current entry. Log [ G ]
Return the base 10 logarithm of the current entry. Or [ | ]
Perform a logical OR operation on the current entry and the
next entry, And [ &amp; ] Perform a logical AND operation on
the current entry and the next entry, treating both numbers
as unsigned long integers. Not [ ~ ] Perform a logical NOT
operation on the current entry. Xor [ ^ ] Perform a logical
XOR operation on the current entry and the next entry,
treating both numbers as unsigned long integers. Xnor [ n ]
