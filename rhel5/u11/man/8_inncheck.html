<p>INNCHECK(8) INNCHECK(8)</p>

<p>NAME inncheck - check inn configuration and database
files.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS inncheck [ -a ] [ -v ] [ -pedantic ] [ -f ] [
-perm ] [ -noperm ] [ file=value | file ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Inncheck examines various configuration
files and databases and veri- fies things about them. Things
verified depend on the file being checked, but generally are
things like permissions, ownership, syntax errors in config
files, etc.</p>

<p>Inncheck does not make changes to any files it just
reports what it thinks may be wrong, and it is up to the
operator to fix the problem.</p>

<p>The set of files checked may be restricted by using file
or file=value arguments. For example, putting incoming.conf
causes only the incom- ing.conf file to be checked. Using
incoming.conf=/tmp/incoming.conf on the command line will
cause inncheck to only verify the incoming.conf file, and it
will perform the checks on the file /tmp/incoming.conf file
instead of the default one.</p>

<p>Valid values for file are:</p>

<p>active control.ctl expire.ctl incoming.conf inn.conf
moderators newsfeeds overview.fmt nntpsend.ctl passwd.nntp
readers.conf</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a If any file value or file=value pairs (see
below) are given, then normally only the files they refer to
are checked. Use the -a flag to specify that all files
should be checked regardless. In this case the form
file=value will be the more useful.</p>

<p>-v Use the -v option to get more verbose output.</p>

<p>-pedantic Use the -pedantic option to get reports on
things that are not necessarily wrong, but may indicate a
bad configuration such as inn.conf missing a key.</p>

<p>-f Use the -f flag to have inncheck print the
appropriate chown/chgrp/chmod command necessary to fix a
problem that it reports. Any other output lines will be
prefixed with a # character to make the output be valid
input for a shell. Note that the -perm flag must be used as
well when using this flag.</p>

<p>-perm Inncheck checks all files for permission problems.
If the -perm flag is used, then only the files specified by
the file or file=value command line arguments will be
checked for problems other than permission problems.</p>

<p>-noperm To avoid doing any checking of file permissions
or ownership, use the -noperm option.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To have inncheck check all files for syntax and
permission problems simply:</p>

<p>inncheck</p>

<p>To have inncheck check all files for permission problems
and to verify the syntax of the active and incoming.conf
files do:</p>

<p>inncheck -perm active incoming.conf</p>

<p>To fix the permissions problems noted in the output of
the above com- mand, modify it as follow:</p>

<p>inncheck -f -perm | sh</p>

<p>To have inncheck check the test newsfeeds file in
/var/tmp/news- feeds.testing, do:</p>

<p>inncheck newsfeeds=/var/tmp/newsfeeds.testing</p>

<p>To have inncheck check all the files as it normally
does, but to spec- ify a different location for the
newsfeeds file, so:</p>

<p>inncheck -a newsfeeds=/var/tmp/newsfeeds.testing</p>

<p>BUGS If the -f and -perm options are used together,
along with -a or some file or file=value arguments that
refer to a file with a syntax problem, then the output will
no longer be valid input for a shell.</p>
