<p>NAME inotify - monitoring file system events</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The inotify API provides a mechanism for
monitoring file system events. Inotify can be used to
monitor individual files, or to monitor directo- ries. When
a directory is monitored, inotify will return events for the
directory itself, and for files inside the directory.</p>

<p>The following system calls are used with this API:
inotify_init(), ino- tify_add_watch(), inotify_rm_watch(),
read(), and close().</p>

<p>inotify_init(2) creates an inotify instance and returns
a file descrip- tor referring to the inotify instance.</p>

<p>inotify_add_watch(2) manipulates the &quot;watch
list&quot; associated with an inotify instance. Each item
(&quot;watch&quot;) in the watch list specifies the pathname
of a file or directory, along with some set of events that
the kernel should monitor for the file referred to by that
pathname. ino- tify_add_watch() either creates a new watch
item, or modifies an exist- ing watch. Each watch has a
unique &quot;watch descriptor&quot;, an integer returned by
inotify_add_watch() when the watch is created.</p>

<p>inotify_rm_watch(2) removes an item from an inotify
watch list.</p>

<p>When all file descriptors referring to an inotify
instance have been closed, the underlying object and its
resources are freed for re-use by the kernel; all associated
watches are automatically freed.</p>

<p>To determine what events have occurred, an application
read(2)s from the inotify file descriptor. If no events have
so far occurred, then, assuming a blocking file descriptor,
read() will block until at least one event occurs.</p>

<p>Each successful read() returns a buffer containing one
or more of the following structures:</p>

<p>struct inotify_event { int wd; /* Watch descriptor */
uint32_t mask; /* Mask of events */ uint32_t cookie; /*
Unique cookie associating related events (for rename(2)) */
uint32_t len; /* Size of name field */ char name[]; /*
Optional null-terminated name */ };</p>

<p>wd identifies the watch for which this event occurs. It
is one of the watch descriptors returned by a previous call
to inotify_add_watch().</p>

<p>mask contains bits that describe the event that occurred
(see below).</p>

<p>cookie is a unique integer that connects related events.
Currently this is only used for rename events, and allows
the resulting pair of IN_MOVE_FROM and IN_MOVE_TO events to
be connected by the application.</p>

<p>The name field is only present when an event is returned
for a file inside a watched directory; it identifies the
file pathname relative to the watched directory. This
pathname is null-terminated, and may include further null
bytes to align subsequent reads to a suitable address
boundary.</p>

<p>The len field counts all of the bytes in name, including
the null bytes; the length of each inotify_event structure
is thus sizeof(ino- tify_event)+len.</p>

<p>inotify events The inotify_add_watch(2) mask argument
and the mask field of the ino- tify_event structure returned
when read(2)ing an inotify file descrip- tor are both bit
masks identifying inotify events. The following bits can be
specified in mask when calling inotify_add_watch() and may
be returned in the mask field returned by read():</p>

<p>Bit Description IN_ACCESS File was accessed (read) (*)
IN_ATTRIB Metadata changed (permissions, timestamps,
extended attributes, etc.) (*) IN_CLOSE_WRITE File opened
for writing was closed (*) IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE File not opened
for writing was closed (*) IN_CREATE File/directory created
in watched directory (*) IN_DELETE File/directory deleted
from watched directory (*) IN_DELETE_SELF Watched
file/directory was itself deleted IN_MODIFY File was
modified (*) IN_MOVE_SELF Watched file/directory was itself
moved IN_MOVED_FROM File moved out of watched directory (*)
IN_MOVED_TO File moved into watched directory (*) IN_OPEN
File was opened (*)</p>

<p>When monitoring a directory, the events marked with an
asterisk (*) above can occur for files in the directory, in
which case the name field in the returned inotify_event
structure identifies the name of the file within the
directory.</p>

<p>The IN_ALL_EVENTS macro is defined as a bit mask of all
of the above events. This macro can be used as the mask
argument when calling ino- tify_add_watch().</p>

<p>Two additional convenience macros are IN_MOVE, which
equates to IN_MOVED_FROM|IN_MOVED_TO, and IN_CLOSE which
equates to IN_CLOSE_WRITE|IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE.</p>

<p>The following further bits can be specified in mask when
calling ino- tify_add_watch():</p>

<p>Bit Description IN_DONT_FOLLOW Don t dereference
pathname if it is a symbolic link IN_MASK_ADD Add (OR)
events to watch mask for this pathname if it already exists
(instead of replacing mask) IN_ONESHOT Monitor pathname for
one event, then remove from watch list IN_ONLYDIR Only watch
pathname if it is a directory</p>

<p>The following bits may be set in the mask field returned
by read():</p>

<p>Bit Description IN_IGNORED Watch was removed explicitly
(inotify_rm_watch()) or automatically (file was deleted, or
file system was unmounted) IN_ISDIR Subject of this event is
a directory IN_Q_OVERFLOW Event queue overflowed (wd is -1
for this event) IN_UNMOUNT File system containing watched
object was unmounted</p>

<p>/proc interfaces The following interfaces can be used to
limit the amount of kernel mem- ory consumed by inotify:</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events The value in this
file is used when an application calls ino- tify_init(2) to
set an upper limit on the number of events that can be
queued to the corresponding inotify instance. Events in
excess of this limit are dropped, but an IN_Q_OVERFLOW event
is always generated.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances This specifies
an upper limit on the number of inotify instances that can
be created per real user ID.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches This specifies a
limit on the number of watches that can be associated with
each inotify instance.</p>

<p>NOTES Inotify file descriptors can be monitored using
select(2), poll(2), and epoll(7).</p>

<p>If successive output inotify events produced on the
inotify file descriptor are identical (same wd, mask,
cookie, and name) then they are coalesced into a single
event.</p>

<p>The events returned by reading from an inotify file
descriptor form an ordered queue. Thus, for example, it is
guaranteed that when renaming from one directory to another,
events will be produced in the correct order on the inotify
file descriptor.</p>

<p>The FIONREAD ioctl() returns the number of bytes
available to read from an inotify file descriptor.</p>

<p>Inotify monitoring of directories is not recursive: to
monitor subdi- rectories under a directory, additional
watches must be created.</p>

<p>VERSIONS Inotify was merged into the 2.6.13 Linux
kernel. The required library interfaces were added to glibc
in version 2.4.</p>

<p>BUGS In kernels before 2.6.16, the IN_ONESHOT mask flag
does not work.</p>

<p>As at glibc 2.4, the definitions for IN_DONT_FOLLOW,
IN_MASK_ADD, and IN_ONLYDIR are missing from
&lt;sys/inotify.h&gt;.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The inotify API is Linux specific.</p>
