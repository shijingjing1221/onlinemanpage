<p>NAME gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known - This function will
return true if the given OID is known</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/x509.h&gt;</p>

<p>int gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known(const char * oid);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS const char * oid holds an Object Identifier in
a null terminated string</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function will inform about known DN
OIDs. This is useful since functions like
gnutls_x509_crt_set_dn_by_oid() use the information on known
OIDs to properly encode their input. Object Identifiers that
are not known are not encoded by these functions, and their
input is stored directly into the ASN.1 structure. In that
case of unknown OIDs, you have the responsibility of DER
encoding your data.</p>

<p>Returns 1 on known OIDs and 0 otherwise.</p>
