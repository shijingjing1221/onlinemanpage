<p>CONTROLCHAN(8) CONTROLCHAN(8)</p>

<p>NAME controlchan - channel-fed control message
handler</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS controlchan</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Controlchan removes the responsibility for
handling control messages (except cancels) from innd(8) and
instead processes them from a channel or file feed. To
reduce load, controlchan keeps a copy of control.ctl in
memory and checks permissions (including any required PGP
headers) before any scripts are called. Also, the default
(bad message) case is handled internally. The drop case is
handled with far less fuss.</p>

<p>Normally, controlchan is invoked by innd(8) as
configured in newsfeeds. An example entry is below. Make
sure that youve created the newsgroup control.cancel so that
controlchan doesnt have to scan through can- cels, which it
wont process anyway.</p>

<p>controlchan! :!*,control,control.*,!control.cancel
:Tc,Wnsm :&lt;pathbin in inn.conf&gt;/controlchan</p>

<p>Note that in the (very, very unlikely) event that you
need to process ihave/sendme control messages, be sure that
logipaddr is set to false in inn.conf, because in this case
controlchan needs a site name, not an IP address.</p>

<p>Controlchan tries to report all log messages through
syslog(3), unless connected to an interactive terminal. To
enable syslog(3) ing for ver- sions of Perl prior to 5.6.0,
you will need to have run h2ph on your system include files
at some point (this is required to make Sys::Syslog work).
If you have not done so, do this:</p>

<p>cd /usr/include h2ph * sys/*</p>

<p>If you run FreeBSD, you will need to run the following
in addition:</p>

<p>h2ph machine/*</p>
