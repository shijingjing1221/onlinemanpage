<p>NAME iftab - static information about the network
interfaces</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file /etc/iftab contains descriptive
information about the various network interfaces. iftab is
only used by the program ifrename(8) to assign a consistent
network interface name to each network interface.</p>

<p>/etc/iftab defines a set of mappings. Each mapping
contains an inter- face name and a set of selectors. The
selectors allow ifrename to iden- tify each network
interface on the system. If a network interface matches all
descriptors of a mapping, ifrename attempt to change the
name of the interface to the interface name given by the
mapping.</p>

<p>MAPPINGS Each mapping is described on a separate line,
it starts with an inter- face name, and contains a set of
descriptors, separated by space or tabs.</p>

<p>The relationship between descriptors of a mapping is a
logical and. A mapping matches a network interface only is
all the descriptors match. If a network interface doesn t
support a specific descriptor, it wont match any mappings
using this descriptor.</p>

<p>If you want to use alternate descriptors for an
interface name (logical or), specify two different mappings
with the same interface name (one on each line). Ifrename
always use the first matching mapping starting from the end
of iftab, therefore more restrictive mapping should be
specified last.</p>

<p>INTERFACE NAME The first part of each mapping is an
interface name. If a network interface matches all
descriptors of a mapping, ifrename attempt to change the
name of the interface to the interface name given by the
mapping.</p>

<p>The interface name of a mapping is either a plain
interface name (such as eth2 or wlan1) or a interface name
pattern containing a single wild- card (such as eth* or
wlan*). In case of wildcard, the kernel replace the * with
the lowest available integer making this interface name
unique. Note that wildcard is only supported for kernel
2.6.1 and 2.4.30 and later.</p>

<p>It is discouraged to try to map interfaces to default
interfaces names such as eth0, wlan0 or ppp0. The kernel use
those as the default name for any new interface, therefore
most likely an interface will already use this name and
prevent ifrename to use it. Even if you use takeover, the
interface may already be up in some cases. Not using those
name will allow you to immediately spot unconfigured or new
interfaces. Good names are either totally unique and
meaningfull, such as mydsl or privatehub, or use larger
integer, such as eth5 or wlan5. The second type is usually
easier to integrate in various network utilities.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTORS Each descriptor is composed of a descriptor
name and descriptor value. Descriptors specify a static
attribute of a network interface, the goal is to uniquely
identify each piece of hardware.</p>

<p>Most users will only use the mac selector, other
selectors are for more specialised setup.</p>

<p>mac mac address Matches the MAC Address of the interface
with the specified MAC address. The MAC address of the
interface can be shown using ifconfig(8) or ip(8). The
specified MAC address may contain a * for wilcard matching.
This is the most common selector, as most interfaces have a
unique MAC address allowing to identify network interfaces
with- out ambiguity. However, some interfaces dont have a
valid MAC address until they are brought up, in such case
using this selector is tricky.</p>

<p>arp arp type Matches the ARP Type (also called Link
Type) of the interface with the specified ARP type. The ARP
Type of the interface can be shown using ifconfig(8) or
ip(8). This selector is useful when a driver create multiple
network interfaces for a single network card.</p>

<p>driver driver name Matches the Driver Name of the
interface with the specified driver name. The Driver Name of
the interface can be shown using ethtool -i(8).</p>

<p>businfo bus information Matches the Bus Information of
the interface with the specified bus information. The Bus
Information of the interface can be shown using ethtool
-i(8).</p>

<p>firmware firmware revision Matches the Firmware Revision
of the interface with the firmware revision information. The
Firmware Revision of the interface can be shown using
ethtool -i(8).</p>

<p>baseaddress base address Matches the Base Address of the
interface with the specified base address. The Base Address
of the interface can be shown using ifconfig(8). Because
most cards use dynamic allocation of the Base Address, this
selector is only useful for ISA and EISA cards.</p>

<p>irq irq line Matches the IRQ Line (interrupt) of the
interface with the spec- ified IRQ line. The IRQ Line of the
interface can be shown using ifconfig(8). Because there are
IRQ Lines may be shared, this selector is usu- ally not
sufficient to uniquely identify an interface.</p>

<p>iwproto wireless protocol Matches the Wireless Protocol
of the interface with the speci- fied wireless protocol. The
Wireless Protocol of the interface can be shown using
iwconfig(8). This selector is only supported on wireless
interfaces and is not sufficient to uniquely identify an
interface.</p>

<p>pcmciaslot pcmcia slot Matches the Pcmcia Socket number
of the interface with the spec- ified slot number. Pcmcia
Socket number of the interface can be shown using cardctl
ident(8). This selector is usually only supported on 16 bits
cards, for 32 bits cards it is advised to use the selector
businfo.</p>

<p>SYSFS{filename} value Matches the sysfs attribute given
by filename to the specified value. sysfs attributes of the
interface can be read in one of the directory in the
directory /sys/class/net/. For example, the filename address
is the MAC address of the device and should be identical to
the selector mac. The sysfs filesystem is only supported
with 2.6.X kernel and need to be mounted. sysfs selectors
are not as efficient as other selectors, therefore they
should be avoided for maximum performance.</p>
