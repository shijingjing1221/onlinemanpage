<p>NAME texdoctk - GUI for easier access of TeX package and
program documenta- tions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS texdoctk -[aq]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION texdoctk is a GUI for easier access to a
large part of the vast amount of package and program
documentations and tutorials for TeX and its different
derivates (mainly LaTeX). It is optimized and included in
the teTeX and fpTeX distributions and also available with
TeXLive.</p>

<p>The documentation is grouped into 17 categories; the
18th button of the main panel is inactive by default and
intended for use with local addi- tions (see section
CONFIGURATION below).</p>

<p>In the settings window you see a checkbox in the
html-&gt;ps and text-&gt;ps converter menus for switching
on/off output redirect. This is due to the fact that some
converters do not write their output into a file but to
stdout by default, so a redirect is needed, e.g.</p>

<p>a2ps myfile.txt &gt;myfile.ps</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v verbose: enable some viewer messages which
are otherwise sent to stderr, as well as some warning popup
windows. This can also be set in a configuration file.</p>

<p>-a autoview: autostart viewer if a listbox contains only
one item (this will frequently happen in search results).
This can also be set in a configuration file.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The configuration is controlled by the
system default concfiguration file
($TEXMFMAIN)/texdoctk/texdocrc.defaults, most of whose
entries can though be overridden by the users own optional
~/.texdocrc files and/or command line options.</p>

<p>The Settings menu and configuration files The Settings
menu is used to change the user-definable settings of tex-
doctk for the duration of the programm call or as new
defaults. The latter case is the purpose of the Save button,
which generates or rewrites the user s own ~/.texdocrc file.
The system defaults cannot be edited with the Settings
menu.</p>

<p>Paths The TEXMF-type paths on the system are reported,
and the user can specify the name of the subdirectory of
$HOMETEXMF, where the personal documentation is stored.</p>

<p>General viewer behaviour</p>

<p>Suppress error messages toggle verbose mode (see option
-v); default is off.</p>

<p>Autostart viewer for one-item listboxes if a listbox
contains only one item (see option -a)</p>

<p>Use text viewer for unknown file format i.e. treat the
file as plain text. texdoctk should recognize the usual file
formats and also relate names like README to plain text, but
some docs may have freely invented names. Default is on; if
switched off, trying to view such files will raise an error.
The switch does not influence printing: unrecognized formats
cannot be printed.</p>

<p>Change viewer colours using either RGB triplets in the
format #rrggbb or the standardized names.</p>

<p>DVI/PostScript/PDF/HTML/Plain text For text files,
texdoctk provides an own viewer. If this viewer is disabled,
but no alternative viewer is specified, texdoctk tries to
read the content of the environment variable $PAGER.</p>

<p>If you want to print the documentations, you will need
convert- ers to turn non-PS files into PostScript. Here are
some sugges- tions:</p>

<p>dvi-&gt;ps: dvips (is part of teTeX)
(http://www.radical- eye.com/dvips.html)</p>

<p>pdf-&gt;ps: pdf2ps (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost) or
Acrobat Reader (http://www.adobe.com)</p>

<p>html-&gt;ps: html2ps
(http://user.it.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html)</p>

<p>plain text-&gt;ps: a2ps
(http://www-inf.enst.fr/~demaille/a2ps/)</p>

<p>The html-&gt;ps and text-&gt;ps converter menus for
switching on/off output redirect. This is due to the fact
that some converters do not write their output into a file
but to stdout by default, so a redirect is needed, e.g. a2ps
myfile.txt &gt;myfile.ps</p>

<p>The system-wide configuration file is
($TEXMFMAIN)/texdoctk/tex- docrc.defaults and should only be
writeable by the administrator of the installation using any
text editor. The optional user configuration file is
~/.texdocrc and can override all but those system settings
which affect the installation as a whole. The preferred way
of changing it is through the Settings menu.</p>

<p>The databases texdoctk comes with a default database
file ($TEXMFMAIN)/texdoctk/tex- doctk.dat with a special
format. It is divided into 17 sections corre- sponding to
the 17 buttons that are active by default. Each section
begins with a line</p>

<p>@section_name</p>

<p>where section_name is the text as it appears in the
button. This title is followed by the descriptive entries
for each documentation, which have this format:</p>

<p>package-label;Short description for listbox (opt.
package-name);path in doc directory;optional keywords</p>

<p>(without breaking the line!). Comments (initiated with a
#) and empty lines are ignored by the program. The second
field is the text dis- played in the selection listboxes of
texdoctk, and you will usually want to mention the name of
the package in parens along with it; the first field is a
unique label for the package for internal use of the program
which will usually be chosen identical to the package name,
but can be different if there is more than one documentation
file coming with a package.</p>

<p>The administrator will probably install additional
packages in the local texmf tree. The corresponding
documentation can be made accessi- ble by an additional
database $TEXMFLOCAL/texdoctk/texdoctk-local.dat.
Furthermore, individual users possibly install additional
packages in an texmf subdirectory of their $HOME, for which
they can make an individual database themselves as
$TEXMFHOME/texdoctk/texdoctk- pers.dat. After creating such
files, texhash must be executed.</p>

<p>Both types of databases must have the same structure as
the system database, although they need (and should) not
include all its sections if there are no additional entries.
For example, if the the package foo is added to the local
tree such that its documentation file is ($TEXM-
FLOCAL)/doc/latex/foo/foo.dvi and it is decided that it fits
best into the existing category Graphics, texdoctk-local.dat
would look like this:</p>

<p>@Graphics foo;Create bells and whistles
(foo);latex/foo/foo.dvi;decoration</p>

<p>The entry for foo will then be appended to the list of
entries in the Graphics category. The 18th button can be
activated in the same way, but using a new category name;
possible entries at the beginning of the database which have
not been assigned to a category will be assigned to the
default Miscellaneous, making the 18th button active with
that label. Note that you cannot have more than 18
categories; if there are more, only the one defined last
will appear and be used.</p>

<p>If the documentation is included in the .sty file
instead of a proper documentation file, the optional
keywords should start with -?- directly after the semicolon,
where ? is 0, 1, 2 or 3; these are flags which indicate in
which part of the .sty the instructions are placed and
should help texdoctk to extract the documentation from the
style and present it without the code, which would normally
be of little use.</p>

<p>0 no specific place, scattered between the code</p>

<p>1 at end, behind \ndinput; some .sty files have
well-organized documentation behind the end of the actual
code, where TeX doesnt see it upon compilation</p>

<p>2 at beginning, terminated by %%%%%%; in some other
cases, some usage information is at the beginning of the
.sty as a comment terminated by a line full of %</p>

<p>3 as 2, but with a blank line as termination</p>

<p>See the system database for plenty of examples.</p>

<p>FILES $TEXMFMAIN/texdoctk/texdocrc.defaults system-wide
configuration file</p>

<p>~/.texdocrc (optional) personal configuration file; can
also be cre- ated with the Settings menu</p>

<p>$TEXMFMAIN/texdoctk/texdoctk.dat default database file
for documenta- tion files of the distribution</p>

<p>$TEXMFLOCAL/texdoctk/texdoctk-local.dat (optional) local
database file for documentation files</p>

<p>$TEXMFHOME/texdoctk/texdoctk-pers.dat (optional)
personal database file of individual users for documentation
files</p>

<p>BUGS Widget placement in topic toplevels becomes ugly
when the toplevel is stretched or shrunk.</p>

<p>The font in the frame labels of the Settings menu are
not forced to the default font; this will become visible
e.g. at hi-res screens, where the label font is not scaled
up.</p>

<p>Netscape and Mozilla error output will be written to
stderr even if the quiet mode was set.</p>
