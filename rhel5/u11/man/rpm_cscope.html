<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) CSCOPE(1)
CSCOPE(1)</p>

<p>NAME cscope - interactively examine a C program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cscope [-bCcdehkLlqRTUuVv] [-Fsymfile]
[-freffile] [-Iincdir] [-iname- file] [-[0-9]pattern] [-pn]
[-sdir] [files]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cscope is an interactive, screen-oriented
tool that allows the user to browse through C source files
for specified elements of code.</p>

<p>By default, cscope examines the C (.c and .h), lex (.l),
and yacc (.y) source files in the current directory. cscope
may also be invoked for source files named on the command
line. In either case, cscope searches the standard
directories for #include files that it does not find in the
current directory. cscope uses a symbol cross-reference,
called cscope.out by default, to locate functions, function
calls, macros, variables, and preprocessor symbols in the
files.</p>

<p>cscope builds the symbol cross-reference the first time
it is used on the source files for the program being
browsed. On a subsequent invoca- tion, cscope rebuilds the
cross-reference only if a source file has changed or the
list of source files is different. When the cross-refer-
ence is rebuilt, the data for the unchanged files are copied
from the old cross-reference, which makes rebuilding faster
than the initial build.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Some command line arguments can only occur as
the the ony argument in the execution of cscope. They cause
the program to just print out some output and exit
immediately:</p>

<p>-h View the long usage help display.</p>

<p>-V Print on the first line of screen the version number
of cscope.</p>

<p>--help Same as -h</p>

<p>--version Same as -V</p>

<p>The following options can appear in any combination:</p>

<p>-b Build the cross-reference only.</p>

<p>-C Ignore letter case when searching.</p>

<p>-c Use only ASCII characters in the cross-reference
file, that is, do not compress the data.</p>

<p>-d Do not update the cross-reference.</p>

<p>-e Suppress the &lt;Ctrl&gt;-e command prompt between
files.</p>

<p>-Fsymfile Read symbol reference lines from symfile. (A
symbol reference file is created by &gt; and &gt;&gt;, and
can also be read using the &lt; command, described under
Issuing Subsequent Requests, below.)</p>

<p>-freffile Use reffile as the cross-reference file name
instead of the default &quot;cscope.out&quot;.</p>

<p>-Iincdir Look in incdir (before looking in $INCDIR, the
standard place for header files, normally /usr/include) for
any #include files whose names do not begin with / and that
are not specified on the command line or in namefile below.
(The #include files may be specified with either double
quotes or angle brackets.) The incdir directory is searched
in addition to the current directory (which is searched
first) and the standard list (which is searched last). If
more than one occurrence of -I appears, the directories are
searched in the order they appear on the command line.</p>

<p>-inamefile Browse through all source files whose names
are listed in name- file (file names separated by spaces,
tabs, or new-lines) instead of the default name list file,
which is called cscope.files. If this option is specified,
cscope ignores any file names appearing on the command line.
The argument namefile can be set to - to accept a list of
files from the standard input. Filenames in the namefile
that contain whitespace have to be enclosed in &quot;double
quotes&quot;. Inside such quoted file- names, any
double-quote and backslash characters have to be escaped by
backslashes.</p>

<p>-k Kernel Mode, turns off the use of the default include
dir (usually /usr/include) when building the database, since
kernel source trees generally do not use it.</p>

<p>-L Do a single search with line-oriented output when
used with the -num pattern option.</p>

<p>-l Line-oriented interface (see Line-Oriented Interface
below).</p>

<p>-[0-9]pattern Go to input field num (counting from 0)
and find pattern.</p>

<p>-Ppath Prepend path to relative file names in a
pre-built cross-refer- ence file so you do not have to
change to the directory where the cross-reference file was
built. This option is only valid with the -d option.</p>

<p>-pn Display the last n file path components instead of
the default (1). Use 0 to not display the file name at
all.</p>

<p>-q Enable fast symbol lookup via an inverted index. This
option causes cscope to create 2 more files (default names
cscope.in.out and cscope.po.out) in addition to the nor- mal
database. This allows a faster symbol search algorithm that
provides noticeably faster lookup performance for large
projects.</p>

<p>-R Recurse subdirectories during search for source
files.</p>

<p>-sdir Look in dir for additional source files. This
option is ignored if source files are given on the command
line.</p>

<p>-T Use only the first eight characters to match against
C symbols. A regular expression containing special
characters other than a period (.) will not match any symbol
if its minimum length is greater than eight characters.</p>

<p>-U Check file time stamps. This option will update the
time stamp on the database even if no files have
changed.</p>

<p>-u Unconditionally build the cross-reference file
(assume that all files have changed).</p>

<p>-v Be more verbose in line-oriented mode. Output
progress updates during database building and searches.</p>

<p>files A list of file names to operate on.</p>

<p>The -I, -c, -k, -p, -q, and -T options can also be in
the cscope.files file.</p>

<p>Requesting the initial search</p>

<p>After the cross-reference is ready, cscope will display
this menu:</p>

<p>Find this C symbol: Find this function definition: Find
functions called by this function: Find functions calling
this function: Find this text string: Change this text
string: Find this egrep pattern: Find this file: Find files
#including this file:</p>

<p>Press the &lt;Up&gt; or &lt;Down&gt; keys repeatedly to
move to the desired input field, type the text to search
for, and then press the &lt;Return&gt; key.</p>

<p>Issuing subsequent requests If the search is successful,
any of these single-character commands can be used:</p>

<p>0-9a-zA-Z Edit the file referenced by the given line
number.</p>

<p>&lt;Space&gt; Display next set of matching lines.</p>

<p>&lt;Tab&gt; Alternate between the menu and the list of
matching lines</p>

<p>&lt;Up&gt; Move to the previous menu item (if the cursor
is in the menu) or move to the previous matching line (if
the cursor is in the matching line list.)</p>

<p>&lt;Down&gt; Move to the next menu item (if the cursor
is in the menu) or move to the next matching line (if the
cursor is in the matching line list.)</p>

<p>+ Display next set of matching lines.</p>

<p>- Display previous set of matching lines.</p>

<p>^e Edit displayed files in order.</p>

<p>&gt; Write the displayed list of lines to a file.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Append the displayed list of lines to a
file.</p>

<p>&lt; Read lines from a file that is in symbol reference
format (cre- ated by &gt; or &gt;&gt;), just like the -F
option.</p>

<p>^ Filter all lines through a shell command and display
the result- ing lines, replacing the lines that were already
there.</p>

<p>| Pipe all lines to a shell command and display them
without changing them.</p>

<p>At any time these single-character commands can also be
used:</p>

<p>&lt;Return&gt; Move to next input field.</p>

<p>^n Move to next input field.</p>

<p>^p Move to previous input field.</p>

<p>^y Search with the last text typed.</p>

<p>^b Move to previous input field and search pattern.</p>

<p>^f Move to next input field and search pattern.</p>

<p>^c Toggle ignore/use letter case when searching. (When
ignoring letter case, search for FILE will match File and
file.)</p>

<p>^r Rebuild the cross-reference.</p>

<p>! Start an interactive shell (type ^d to return to
cscope).</p>

<p>^l Redraw the screen.</p>

<p>? Give help information about cscope commands.</p>

<p>^d Exit cscope.</p>

<p>NOTE: If the first character of the text to be searched
for matches one of the above commands, escape it by typing a
(backslash) first.</p>

<p>Substituting new text for old text</p>

<p>After the text to be changed has been typed, cscope will
prompt for the new text, and then it will display the lines
containing the old text. Select the lines to be changed with
these single-character commands:</p>

<p>0-9a-zA-Z Mark or unmark the line to be changed.</p>

<p>* Mark or unmark all displayed lines to be changed.</p>

<p>&lt;Space&gt; Display next set of lines.</p>

<p>+ Display next set of lines.</p>

<p>- Display previous set of lines.</p>

<p>a Mark or unmark all lines to be changed.</p>

<p>^d Change the marked lines and exit.</p>

<p>&lt;Esc&gt; Exit without changing the marked lines.</p>

<p>! Start an interactive shell (type ^d to return to
cscope).</p>

<p>^l Redraw the screen.</p>

<p>? Give help information about cscope commands.</p>

<p>Special keys</p>

<p>If your terminal has arrow keys that work in vi, you can
use them to move around the input fields. The up-arrow key
is useful to move to the previous input field instead of
using the &lt;Tab&gt; key repeatedly. If you have
&lt;CLEAR&gt;, &lt;NEXT&gt;, or &lt;PREV&gt; keys they will
act as the ^l, +, and - commands, respectively.</p>

<p>Line-Oriented interface</p>

<p>The -l option lets you use cscope where a
screen-oriented interface would not be useful, for example,
from another screen-oriented program.</p>

<p>cscope will prompt with &gt;&gt; when it is ready for an
input line starting with the field number (counting from 0)
immediately followed by the search pattern, for example,
lmain finds the definition of the main function.</p>

<p>If you just want a single search, instead of the -l
option use the -L and -num pattern options, and you wont get
the &gt;&gt; prompt.</p>

<p>For -l, cscope outputs the number of reference lines
cscope: 2 lines</p>

<p>For each reference found, cscope outputs a line
consisting of the file name, function name, line number, and
line text, separated by spaces, for example, main.c main 161
main(argc, argv)</p>

<p>Note that the editor is not called to display a single
reference, unlike the screen-oriented interface.</p>

<p>You can use the c command to toggle ignore/use letter
case when search- ing. (When ignoring letter case, search
for FILE will match File and file.)</p>

<p>You can use the r command to rebuild the database.</p>

<p>cscope will quit when it detects end-of-file, or when
the first charac- ter of an input line is ^d or q.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CSCOPE_EDITOR Overrides the EDITOR
and VIEWER variables. Use this if you wish to use a
different editor with cscope than that specified by your
EDITOR/VIEWER variables.</p>

<p>CSCOPE_LINEFLAG Format of the line number flag for your
editor. By default, cscope invokes your editor via the
equivalent of editor +N file , where N is the line number
that the editor should jump to. This format is used by both
emacs and vi. If your edi- tor needs something different,
specify it in this variable, with %s as a placeholder for
the line number. Ex: if your editor needs to be invoked as
editor -#103 file to go to line 103, set this variable to
-#%s.</p>

<p>CSCOPE_LINEFLAG_AFTER_FILE Set this variable to yes if
your editor needs to be invoked with the line number option
after the filename to be edited. To continue the example
from CSCOPE_LINEFLAG, above: if your editor needs to see
editor file -#number, set this environment variable. Users
of most standard editors (vi, emacs) do not need to set this
variable.</p>

<p>EDITOR Preferred editor, which defaults to vi.</p>

<p>HOME Home directory, which is automatically set at
login.</p>

<p>INCLUDEDIRS Colon-separated list of directories to
search for #include files.</p>

<p>SHELL Preferred shell, which defaults to sh.</p>

<p>SOURCEDIRS Colon-separated list of directories to search
for additional source files.</p>

<p>TERM Terminal type, which must be a screen terminal.</p>

<p>TERMINFO Terminal information directory full path name.
If your terminal is not in the standard terminfo directory,
see curses and terminfo for how to make your own terminal
description.</p>

<p>TMPDIR Temporary file directory, which defaults to
/var/tmp.</p>

<p>VIEWER Preferred file display program (such as less),
which overrides EDITOR (see above).</p>

<p>VPATH A colon-separated list of directories, each of
which has the same directory structure below it. If VPATH is
set, cscope searches for source files in the directories
specified; if it is not set, cscope searches only in the
current directory.</p>

<p>FILES cscope.files Default files containing -I, -p, -q,
and -T options and the list of source files (overridden by
the -i option).</p>

<p>cscope.out Symbol cross-reference file (overridden by
the -f option), which is put in the home directory if it
cannot be created in the cur- rent directory.</p>

<p>cscope.in.out cscope.po.out Default files containing the
inverted index used for quick sym- bol searching (-q
option). If you use the -f option to rename the
cross-reference file (so its not cscope.out), the names for
these inverted index files will be created by adding .in and
.po to the name you supply with -f. For example, if you
indicated -f xyz, then these files would be named xyz.in and
xyz.po.</p>

<p>INCDIR Standard directory for #include files (usually
/usr/include).</p>

<p>Notices cscope recognizes function definitions of the
form: fname blank ( args ) white arg_decs white {</p>

<p>where: fname is the function name</p>

<p>blank is zero or more spaces or tabs, not including
newlines</p>

<p>args is any string that does not contain a &quot; or a
newline</p>

<p>white is zero or more spaces, tabs, or newlines</p>

<p>arg_decs are zero or more argument declarations
(arg_decs may include comments and white space)</p>

<p>It is not necessary for a function declaration to start
at the begin- ning of a line. The return type may precede
the function name; cscope will still recognize the
declaration. Function definitions that deviate from this
form will not be recognized by cscope.</p>

<p>The Function column of the search output for the menu
option Find functions called by this function: input field
will only display the first function called in the line,
that is, for this function</p>

<p>e() { return (f() + g()); }</p>

<p>the display would be</p>

<p>Functions called by this function: e File Function Line
a.c f 3 return(f() + g());</p>

<p>Occasionally, a function definition or call may not be
recognized because of braces inside #if statements.
Similarly, the use of a vari- able may be incorrectly
recognized as a definition.</p>

<p>A typedef name preceding a preprocessor statement will
be incorrectly recognized as a global definition, for
example,</p>

<p>LDFILE * #if AR16WR</p>

<p>Preprocessor statements can also prevent the recognition
of a global definition, for example,</p>

<p>char flag #ifdef ALLOCATE_STORAGE = -1 #endif ;</p>

<p>A function declaration inside a function is incorrectly
recognized as a function call, for example,</p>

<p>f() { void g(); }</p>

<p>is incorrectly recognized as a call to g.</p>

<p>cscope recognizes C++ classes by looking for the class
keyword, but doesnt recognize that a struct is also a class,
so it doesnt recog- nize inline member function definitions
in a structure. It also doesnt expect the class keyword in a
typedef , so it incorrectly recognizes X as a definition
in</p>

<p>typedef class X * Y;</p>

<p>It also doesnt recognize operator function
definitions</p>

<p>Bool Feature::operator==(const Feature &amp; other) {
... }</p>

<p>Nor does it recognize function definitions with a
function pointer argument</p>

<p>ParseTable::Recognize(int startState, char *pattern, int
finishState, void (*FinalAction)(char *)) { ... }</p>
