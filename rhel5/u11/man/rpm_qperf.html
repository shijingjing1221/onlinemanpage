<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) QPERF(1) User Commands
QPERF(1)</p>

<p>NAME qperf - Measure RDMA and IP performance</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS qperf qperf SERVERNODE [OPTIONS] TESTS</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION qperf measures bandwidth and latency between
two nodes. It can work over TCP/IP as well as the RDMA
transports. On one of the nodes, qperf is typically run with
no arguments designating it the server node. One may then
run qperf on a client node to obtain measurements such as
bandwidth, latency and cpu utilization.</p>

<p>In its most basic form, qperf is run on one node in
server mode by invoking it with no arguments. On the other
node, it is run with two arguments: the name of the server
node followed by the name of the test. A list of tests can
be found in the section, TESTS. A variety of options may
also be specified.</p>

<p>One can get more detailed information on qperf by using
the --help option. Below are examples of using the --help
option:</p>

<p>qperf --help examples Some examples of using qperf qperf

<p>EXAMPLES In these examples, we first run qperf on a node
called myserver in server mode by invoking it with no
arguments. In all the subsequent examples, we run qperf on
another node and connect to the server which we assume has a
hostname of myserver.</p>

<p>To run a TCP bandwidth and latency test: qperf myserver
tcp_bw tcp_lat</p>

<p>To run a SDP bandwidth test for 10 seconds: qperf
myserver -t 10 sdp_bw</p>

<p>To run a UDP latency test and then cause the server to
terminate: qperf myserver udp_lat quit</p>

<p>To measure the RDMA UD latency and bandwidth: qperf
myserver ud_lat ud_bw</p>

<p>To measure RDMA UC bi-directional bandwidth: qperf
myserver rc_bi_bw</p>

<p>To get a range of TCP latencies with a message size from
1 to 64K qperf myserver -oo msg_size:1:64K:*2 -vu
tcp_lat</p>

<p>OPTIONS -ar, --access_recv OnOff If OnOff is non-zero,
data is accessed once received. Other- wise, data is
ignored. By default, OnOff is 0. This can help to mimic some
applications.</p>

<p>-ar1 Cause received data to be accessed.</p>

<p>-ap, --alt_port Port Set alternate path port. This
enables automatic path failover.</p>

<p>-lap, --loc_alt_port Port Set local alternate path port.
This enables automatic path failover.</p>

<p>-rap, --rem_alt_port Port Set remote alternate path
port. This enables automatic path failover.</p>

<p>-ca, --cpu_affinity PN Set cpu affinity to PN. CPUs are
numbered sequentially from 0. If PN is &quot;any&quot;, any
cpu is allowed otherwise the cpu is limited to the one
specified.</p>

<p>-lca, --loc_cpu_affinity PN Set local processor affinity
to PN.</p>

<p>-rca, --rem_cpu_affinity PN Set remote processor
affinity to PN.</p>

<p>-f, --flip OnOff If non-zero, cause sender and receiver
to play opposite roles.</p>

<p>-f1 Cause sender and receiver to play opposite
roles.</p>

<p>-h, --help Topic Print out information about Topic. To
see the list of topics, type qperf --help</p>

<p>-H, --host Host Run test between the current node and
the qperf running on node Host. This can also be specified
as the first non-option argu- ment.</p>

<p>-i, --id Device:Port Use RDMA Device and Port.</p>

<p>-li, --loc_id Device:Port Use local RDMA Device and
Port.</p>

<p>-ri, --rem_id Device:Port Use remote RDMA Device and
Port.</p>

<p>-lp, --listen_port Port Set the port we listen on to
ListenPort. This must be set to the same port on both the
server and client machines. The default value is 19765.</p>

<p>-oo, --loop Var:Init:Last:Incr Run a test multiple times
sequencing through a series of values. Var is the loop
variable; Init is the initial value; Last is the value it
must not exceed and Incr is the increment. It is use- ful to
set the --verbose_used (-vu) option in conjunction with this
option.</p>

<p>-m, --msg_size Size Set the message size to Size. The
default value varies by test. It is assumed that the value
is specified in bytes however, a trailing kib or K, mib or
M, or gib or G indicates that the size is being specified in
kibibytes, mebibytes or gibibytes respec- tively while a
trailing kb or k, mb or m, or gb or g indicates kilobytes,
megabytes or gigabytes respectively.</p>

<p>-mt, --mtu_size Size Set the MTU size. Only relevant to
the RDMA UC/RC tests. Units are specified in the same manner
as the --msg_size option.</p>

<p>-n, --no_msgs N Set test duration by number of messages
sent instead of time.</p>

<p>-cp, --cq_poll OnOff Turn polling mode on or off. This
is only relevant to the RDMA tests and determines whether
they poll or wait on the completion queues. If OnOff is 0,
they wait; otherwise they poll.</p>

<p>-lcp, --loc_cq_poll OnOff Locally turn polling mode on
or off.</p>

<p>-rcp, --rem_cq_poll OnOff Remotely turn polling mode on
or off.</p>

<p>-cp1 Turn polling mode on.</p>

<p>-lcp1 Turn local polling mode on.</p>

<p>-rcp1 Turn remote polling mode on.</p>

<p>-ip, --ip_port Port Use Port to run the socket tests.
This is different from --lis- ten_port which is used for
synchronization. This is only rele- vant for the socket
tests and refers to the TCP/UDP/SDP/RDS/SCTP port that the
test is run on.</p>

<p>-e, --precision Digits Set the number of significant
digits that are used to report results.</p>

<p>-nr, --rd_atomic Max Set the number of in-flight
operations that can be handled for a RDMA read or atomic
operation to Max. This is only relevant to the RDMA Read and
Atomic tests.</p>

<p>-lnr, --loc_rd_atomic Max Set local read/atomic
count.</p>

<p>-rnr, --rem_rd_atomic Max Set remote read/atomic
count.</p>

<p>-sl, --service_level SL Set RDMA service level to SL.
This is only used by the RDMA tests. The service level must
be between 0 and 15. The default service level is 0.</p>

<p>-lsl, --loc_service_level SL Set local service
level.</p>

<p>-rsl, --rem_service_level SL Set remote service
level.</p>

<p>-sb, --sock_buf_size Size Set the socket buffer size.
This is only relevant to the socket tests.</p>

<p>-lsb, --loc_sock_buf_size Size Set local socket buffer
size.</p>

<p>-rsb, --rem_sock_buf_size Size Set remote socket buffer
size.</p>

<p>-sp, --src_path_bits N Set source path bits. If the LMC
is not zero, this will cause the connection to use a LID
with the low order LMC bits set to N.</p>

<p>-lsp, --loc_src_path_bits N Set local source path
bits.</p>

<p>-rsp, --rem_src_path_bits N Set remote source path
bits.</p>

<p>-sr, --static_rate Rate Force InfiniBand static rate.
Rate can be one of: 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 120,
1xSDR (2.5 Gbps), 1xDDR (5 Gbps), 1xQDR (10 Gbps), 4xSDR
(2.5 Gbps), 4xDDR (5 Gbps), 4xQDR (10 Gbps), 8xSDR (2.5
Gbps), 8xDDR (5 Gbps), 8xQDR (10 Gbps).</p>

<p>-lsr, --loc_static_rate Force local InfiniBand static
rate</p>

<p>-rsr, --rem_static_rate Force remote InfiniBand static
rate</p>

<p>-t, --time Time Set test duration to Time. Specified in
seconds however a trailing m, h or d indicates that the time
is specified in min- utes, hours or days respectively.</p>

<p>-to, --timeout Time Set timeout to Time. This is the
timeout used for various things such as exchanging messages.
The default is 5 seconds.</p>

<p>-lto, --loc_timeout Time Set local timeout to Time. This
may be used on the server to set the timeout when initially
exchanging data with each client. However, as soon as we
receive the client s parameters, the client s remote timeout
will override this parameter.</p>

<p>-rto, --rem_timeout Time Set remote timeout to Time.</p>

<p>-un, --unify_nodes Unify the nodes. Describe them in
terms of local and remote rather than send and receive.</p>

<p>-uu, --unify_units Unify the units that results are
shown in. Uses the lowest com- mon denominator. Helpful for
scripts.</p>

<p>-ub, --use_bits_per_sec Use bits/sec rather than
bytes/sec when displaying networking speed.</p>

<p>-cm, --use_cm OnOff Use the RDMA Connection Manager (CM)
if OnOff is non-zero. It is necessary to use the CM for
iWARP devices. The default is to establish the connection
without using the CM. This only works for the tests that use
the RC transport.</p>

<p>-cm1 Use RDMA Connection Manager.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Provide more detailed output. Turns on
-vc, -vs, -vt and -vu.</p>

<p>-vc, --verbose_conf Provide information on
configuration.</p>

<p>-vs, --verbose_stat Provide information on
statistics.</p>

used.</p>

<p>-vv, --verbose_more Provide even more detailed output.
Turns on -vvc, -vvs, -vvt and -vvu.</p>

<p>-vvc, --verbose_more_conf Provide more information on
configuration.</p>

<p>-vvs, --verbose_more_stat Provide more information on
statistics.</p>

<p>-vvt, --verbose_more_time Provide more information on
timing.</p>

<p>-vvu, --verbose_more_used Provide more information on
parameters used.</p>

<p>-V, --version The current version of qperf is
printed.</p>

<p>-ws, --wait_server Time If the server is not ready,
continue to try connecting for Time seconds before giving
up. The default is 5 seconds.</p>

<p>BUGS None of the RDMA tests are available if qperf is
compiled without the RDMA libraries. The -f option is not
yet implemented in many of the tests.</p>
