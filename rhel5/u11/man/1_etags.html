<p>DESCRIPTION The etags program is used to create a tag
table file, in a format un- derstood by emacs(1); the ctags
program is used to create a similar ta- ble in a format
understood by vi(1). Both forms of the program under- stand
the syntax of C, Objective C, C++, Java, Fortran, Ada,
Cobol, Er- lang, LaTeX, Emacs Lisp/Common Lisp, makefiles,
Pascal, Perl, Postscript, Python, Prolog, Scheme and most
assembler-like syntaxes. Both forms read the files specified
on the command line, and write a tag table (defaults: TAGS
for etags, tags for ctags) in the current working directory.
Files specified with relative file names will be recorded in
the tag table with file names relative to the directory
where the tag table resides. Files specified with absolute
file names will be recorded with absolute file names. The
programs recognize the language used in an input file based
on its file name and contents. The --language switch can be
used to force parsing of the file names following the switch
according to the given language, overriding guess- es based
on filename extensions.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Some options make sense only for the vi style
tag files produced by ctags; etags does not recognize them.
The programs accept unambiguous abbreviations for long
option names.</p>

<p>-a, --append Append to existing tag file. (For vi-format
tag files, see also --update.)</p>

<p>-B, --backward-search Tag files written in the format
expected by vi contain regular expression search
instructions; the -B option writes them using the delimiter
?, to search backwards through files. The de- fault is to
use the delimiter / , to search forwards through files. Only
ctags accepts this option.</p>

<p>--declarations In C and derived languages, create tags
for function declara- tions, and create tags for extern
variables unless --no-globals is used.</p>

<p>-d, --defines Create tag entries for C preprocessor
constant definitions and enum constants, too. This is the
default behavior for etags.</p>

<p>-D, --no-defines Do not create tag entries for C
preprocessor constant defini- tions and enum constants. This
may make the tags file much smaller if many header files are
tagged. This is the default behavior for ctags.</p>

<p>-g, --globals Create tag entries for global variables in
C, C++, Objective C, Java, and Perl. This is the default
behavior for etags.</p>

<p>-G, --no-globals Do not tag global variables. Typically
this reduces the file size by one fourth. This is the
default behavior for ctags.</p>

<p>-i file, --include=file Include a note in the tag file
indicating that, when searching for a tag, one should also
consult the tags file file after checking the current file.
This options is only accepted by etags.</p>

<p>-I, --ignore-indentation Dont rely on indentation as
much as we normally do. Currently, this means not to assume
that a closing brace in the first col- umn is the final
brace of a function or structure definition in C and
C++.</p>

<p>-l language, --language=language Parse the following
files according to the given language. More than one such
options may be intermixed with filenames. Use --help to get
a list of the available languages and their de- fault
filename extensions. The auto language can be used to
restore automatic detection of language based on the file
name. The none language may be used to disable language
parsing al- together; only regexp matching is done in this
case (see the --regex option).</p>

<p>-m, --members Create tag entries for variables that are
members of structure- like constructs in C++, Objective C,
Java.</p>

<p>-M, --no-members Do not tag member variables. This is
the default behavior.</p>

<p>--packages-only Only tag packages in Ada files.</p>

<p>-o tagfile, --output=tagfile Explicit name of file for
tag table; overrides default TAGS or tags. (But ignored with
-v or -x.)</p>

<p>-r regexp, --regex=regexp</p>

<p>--ignore-case-regex=regexp Make tags based on regexp
matching for each line of the files following this option,
in addition to the tags made with the standard parsing based
on language. When using --regex, case is significant, while
it is not with --ignore-case-regex. May be freely intermixed
with filenames and the -R option. The regexps are
cumulative, i.e. each option will add to the previous ones.
The regexps are of the form: /tagregexp[/nameregexp]/</p>

<p>where tagregexp is used to match the lines that must be
tagged. It should not match useless characters. If the match
is such that more characters than needed are unavoidably
matched by tagregexp, it may be useful to add a nameregexp,
to narrow down the tag scope. ctags ignores regexps without
a nameregexp. The syntax of regexps is the same as in emacs,
augmented with inter- vals of the form m,n, as in ed or
grep. Here are some examples. All the regexps are quoted to
protect them from shell interpretation.</p>

<p>Tag the DEFVAR macros in the emacs source files:
--regex=/[ t]*DEFVAR_[A-Z_ t(]+&quot;([^&quot;]+)&quot;_</p>

<p>Tag VHDL files (this example is a single long line,
broken here for formatting reasons): --language=none
--regex=_ /[ t]*(ARCHITECTURE|_ CONFIGURA- TION) +[^ ]*
+OF/_ --regex=_ /[ t]*_(ATTRIBUTE|ENTITY|FUNC- TION|PACKAGE(
BODY)?_ |PROCEDURE|PRO- CESS|TYPE)[ t]+([^ t(]+)/3/_</p>

<p>Tag TCL files (this last example shows the usage of a
tagreg- exp): --lang=none --regex=/proc[ t]+([^ t]+)/1/_</p>

<p>A regexp can be preceded by {lang}, thus restricting it
to match lines of files of the specified language. Use etags
--help to obtain a list of the recognised languages. This
feature is par- ticularly useful inside regex files. A regex
file contains one regex per line. Empty lines, and those
lines beginning with space or tab are ignored. Lines
beginning with @ are references to regex files whose name
follows the @ sign. Other lines are considered regular
expressions like those following --regex. For example, the
command etags --regex=@regex.file *.c reads the regexes
contained in the file regex.file.</p>

<p>-R, --no-regex Don t do any more regexp matching on the
following files. May be freely intermixed with filenames and
the --regex option.</p>

<p>-t, --typedefs Record typedefs in C code as tags. Since
this is the default behaviour of etags, only ctags accepts
this option.</p>

<p>-T, --typedefs-and-c++ Generate tag entries for
typedefs, struct, enum, and union tags, and C++ member
functions. Since this is the default behaviour of etags,
only ctags accepts this option.</p>

<p>-u, --update Update tag entries for files specified on
command line, leaving tag entries for other files in place.
Currently, this is imple- mented by deleting the existing
entries for the given files and then rewriting the new
entries at the end of the tags file. It is often faster to
simply rebuild the entire tag file than to use this. Only
ctags accepts this option.</p>

<p>-v, --vgrind Instead of generating a tag file, write
index (in vgrind format) to standard output. Only ctags
accepts this option.</p>

<p>-w, --no-warn Suppress warning messages about duplicate
entries. The etags program does not check for duplicate
entries, so this option is not allowed with it.</p>

<p>-x, --cxref Instead of generating a tag file, write a
cross reference (in cxref format) to standard output. Only
ctags accepts this op- tion.</p>

<p>-h, -H, --help Print usage information.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print the current version of the program
(same as the version of the emacs etags is shipped
with).</p>
