<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) ncurses(3X)
ncurses(3X)</p>

<p>NAME ncurses - CRT screen handling and optimization
package</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curses.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ncurses library routines give the user a
terminal-independent method of updating character screens
with reasonable optimization. This implementation is new
curses (ncurses) and is the approved replacement for 4.4BSD
classic curses, which has been discontinued. This describes
ncurses version 5.5 (patch 20060715).</p>

<p>The ncurses routines emulate the curses(3X) library of
System V Release 4 UNIX, and the XPG4 curses standard (XSI
curses) but the ncurses library is freely redistributable in
source form. Differences from the SVr4 curses are summarized
under the EXTENSIONS and PORTABILITY sec- tions below and
described in detail in the respective EXTENSIONS,
PORTABILITY and BUGS sections of individual man pages.</p>

<p>A program using these routines must be linked with the
-lncurses option, or (if it has been generated) with the
debugging library -lncurses_g. (Your system integrator may
also have installed these libraries under the names -lcurses
and -lcurses_g.) The ncurses_g library generates trace logs
(in a file called trace in the current directory) that
describe curses actions. See also the section on ALTERNATE
CONFIGURATIONS.</p>

<p>The ncurses package supports: overall screen, window and
pad manipula- tion; output to windows and pads; reading
terminal input; control over terminal and curses input and
output options; environment query rou- tines; color
manipulation; use of soft label keys; terminfo capabili-
ties; and access to low-level terminal-manipulation
routines.</p>

<p>To initialize the routines, the routine initscr or
newterm must be called before any of the other routines that
deal with windows and screens are used. The routine endwin
must be called before exiting. To get character-at-a-time
input without echoing (most interactive, screen oriented
programs want this), the following sequence should be
used:</p>

<p>initscr(); cbreak(); noecho();</p>

<p>Most programs would additionally use the sequence:</p>

<p>nonl(); intrflush(stdscr, FALSE); keypad(stdscr,
TRUE);</p>

<p>Before a curses program is run, the tab stops of the
terminal should be set and its initialization strings, if
defined, must be output. This can be done by executing the
tput init command after the shell environ- ment variable
TERM has been exported. tset(1) is usually responsible for
doing this. [See terminfo(5) for further details.]</p>

<p>The ncurses library permits manipulation of data
structures, called windows, which can be thought of as
two-dimensional arrays of charac- ters representing all or
part of a CRT screen. A default window called stdscr, which
is the size of the terminal screen, is supplied. Others may
be created with newwin.</p>

<p>Note that curses does not handle overlapping windows,
thats done by the panel(3X) library. This means that you can
either use stdscr or divide the screen into tiled windows
and not using stdscr at all. Mix- ing the two will result in
unpredictable, and undesired, effects.</p>

<p>Windows are referred to by variables declared as WINDOW
*. These data structures are manipulated with routines
described here and elsewhere in the ncurses manual pages.
Among which the most basic routines are move and addch. More
general versions of these routines are included with names
beginning with w, allowing the user to specify a window. The
routines not beginning with w affect stdscr.)</p>

<p>After using routines to manipulate a window, refresh is
called, telling curses to make the users CRT screen look
like stdscr. The characters in a window are actually of type
chtype, (character and attribute data) so that other
information about the character may also be stored with each
character.</p>

<p>Special windows called pads may also be manipulated.
These are windows which are not constrained to the size of
the screen and whose contents need not be completely
displayed. See curs_pad(3X) for more informa- tion.</p>

<p>In addition to drawing characters on the screen, video
attributes and colors may be supported, causing the
characters to show up in such modes as underlined, in
reverse video, or in color on terminals that support such
display enhancements. Line drawing characters may be
specified to be output. On input, curses is also able to
translate arrow and function keys that transmit escape
sequences into single val- ues. The video attributes, line
drawing characters, and input values use names, defined in
&lt;curses.h&gt;, such as A_REVERSE, ACS_HLINE, and
KEY_LEFT.</p>

<p>If the environment variables LINES and COLUMNS are set,
or if the pro- gram is executing in a window environment,
line and column information in the environment will override
information read by terminfo. This would effect a program
running in an AT&amp;T 630 layer, for example, where the
size of a screen is changeable (see ENVIRONMENT).</p>

<p>If the environment variable TERMINFO is defined, any
program using curses checks for a local terminal definition
before checking in the standard place. For example, if TERM
is set to att4424, then the com- piled terminal definition
is found in</p>

<p>/usr/share/terminfo/a/att4424.</p>

<p>(The a is copied from the first letter of att4424 to
avoid creation of huge directories.) However, if TERMINFO is
set to $HOME/myterms, curses first checks</p>

<p>$HOME/myterms/a/att4424,</p>

<p>and if that fails, it then checks</p>

<p>/usr/share/terminfo/a/att4424.</p>

<p>This is useful for developing experimental definitions
or when write permission in /usr/share/terminfo is not
available.</p>

<p>The integer variables LINES and COLS are defined in
&lt;curses.h&gt; and will be filled in by initscr with the
size of the screen. The constants TRUE and FALSE have the
values 1 and 0, respectively.</p>

<p>The curses routines also define the WINDOW * variable
curscr which is used for certain low-level operations like
clearing and redrawing a screen containing garbage. The
curscr can be used in only a few rou- tines.</p>

<p>Routine and Argument Names Many curses routines have two
or more versions. The routines prefixed with w require a
window argument. The routines prefixed with p require a pad
argument. Those without a prefix generally use stdscr.</p>

<p>The routines prefixed with mv require a y and x
coordinate to move to before performing the appropriate
action. The mv routines imply a call to move before the call
to the other routine. The coordinate y always refers to the
row (of the window), and x always refers to the column. The
upper left-hand corner is always (0,0), not (1,1).</p>

<p>The routines prefixed with mvw take both a window
argument and x and y coordinates. The window argument is
always specified before the coor- dinates.</p>

<p>In each case, win is the window affected, and pad is the
pad affected; win and pad are always pointers to type
WINDOW.</p>

<p>Option setting routines require a Boolean flag bf with
the value TRUE or FALSE; bf is always of type bool. The
variables ch and attrs below are always of type chtype. The
types WINDOW, SCREEN, bool, and chtype are defined in
&lt;curses.h&gt;. The type TERMINAL is defined in
&lt;term.h&gt;. All other arguments are integers.</p>

<p>Routine Name Index The following table lists each curses
routine and the name of the man- ual page on which it is
described. Routines flagged with * are ncurses-specific, not
described by XPG4 or present in SVr4.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Routines that return an integer return ERR
upon failure and an integer value other than ERR upon
successful completion, unless otherwise noted in the routine
descriptions.</p>

<p>All macros return the value of the w version, except
setscrreg, wsetscrreg, getyx, getbegyx, and getmaxyx. The
return values of setscrreg, wsetscrreg, getyx, getbegyx, and
getmaxyx are undefined (i.e., these should not be used as
the right-hand side of assignment statements).</p>

<p>Routines that return pointers return NULL on error.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The following environment symbols are useful
for customizing the run- time behavior of the ncurses
library. The most important ones have been already discussed
in detail.</p>

<p>BAUDRATE The debugging library checks this environment
symbol when the application has redirected output to a file.
The symbols numeric value is used for the baudrate. If no
value is found, ncurses uses 9600. This allows testers to
construct repeatable test-cases that take into account costs
that depend on baudrate.</p>

<p>CC When set, change occurrences of the command_character
(i.e., the cmdch capability) of the loaded terminfo entries
to the value of this symbol. Very few terminfo entries
provide this feature.</p>

<p>COLUMNS Specify the width of the screen in characters.
Applications run- ning in a windowing environment usually
are able to obtain the width of the window in which they are
executing. If neither the COLUMNS value nor the terminal s
screen size is available, ncurses uses the size which may be
specified in the terminfo database (i.e., the cols
capability).</p>

<p>It is important that your application use a correct size
for the screen. This is not always possible because your
application may be running on a host which does not honor
NAWS (Negotiations About Window Size), or because you are
temporarily running as another user. However, setting
COLUMNS and/or LINES overrides the librarys use of the
screen size obtained from the operating sys- tem.</p>

<p>Either COLUMNS or LINES symbols may be specified
independently. This is mainly useful to circumvent legacy
misfeatures of terminal descriptions, e.g., xterm which
commonly specifies a 65 line screen. For best results, lines
and cols should not be specified in a terminal description
for terminals which are run as emula- tions.</p>

<p>Use the use_env function to disable all use of external
environ- ment (including system calls) to determine the
screen size.</p>

<p>ESCDELAY Specifies the total time, in milliseconds, for
which ncurses will await a character sequence, e.g., a
function key. The default value, 1000 milliseconds, is
enough for most uses. However, it is made a variable to
accommodate unusual applications.</p>

<p>The most common instance where you may wish to change
this value is to work with slow hosts, e.g., running on a
network. If the host cannot read characters rapidly enough,
it will have the same effect as if the terminal did not send
characters rapidly enough. The library will still see a
timeout.</p>

<p>Note that xterm mouse events are built up from character
sequences received from the xterm. If your application makes
heavy use of multiple-clicking, you may wish to lengthen
this default value because the timeout applies to the
composed multi-click event as well as the individual
clicks.</p>

<p>In addition to the environment variable, this
implementation pro- vides a global variable with the same
name. Portable applications should not rely upon the
presence of ESCDELAY in either form, but setting the
environment variable rather than the global variable does
not create problems when compiling an application.</p>

<p>HOME Tells ncurses where your home directory is. That is
where it may read and write auxiliary terminal
descriptions:</p>

<p>$HOME/.termcap $HOME/.terminfo</p>

<p>LINES Like COLUMNS, specify the height of the screen in
characters. See COLUMNS for a detailed description.</p>

<p>MOUSE_BUTTONS_123 This applies only to the OS/2 EMX
port. It specifies the order of buttons on the mouse. OS/2
numbers a 3-button mouse inconsis- tently from other
platforms:</p>

<p>1 = left 2 = right 3 = middle.</p>

<p>This symbol lets you customize the mouse. The symbol
must be three numeric digits 1-3 in any order, e.g., 123 or
321. If it is not specified, ncurses uses 132.</p>

<p>NCURSES_ASSUMED_COLORS Override the compiled-in
assumption that the terminals default colors are
white-on-black (see assume_default_colors(3X)). You may set
the foreground and background color values with this envi-
ronment variable by proving a 2-element list:
foreground,back- ground. For example, to tell ncurses to not
assume anything about the colors, set this to
&quot;-1,-1&quot;. To make it green-on-black, set it to
&quot;2,0&quot;. Any positive value from zero to the
terminfo max_colors value is allowed.</p>

<p>NCURSES_NO_HARD_TABS Ncurses may use tabs as part of the
cursor movement optimization. In some cases, your terminal
driver may not handle these properly. Set this environment
variable to disable the feature. You can also adjust your
stty settings to avoid the problem.</p>

<p>NCURSES_NO_MAGIC_COOKIES Some terminals use a
magic-cookie feature which requires special handling to make
highlighting and other video attributes display properly.
You can suppress the highlighting entirely for these
terminals by setting this environment variable.</p>

<p>NCURSES_NO_PADDING Most of the terminal descriptions in
the terminfo database are written for real
&quot;hardware&quot; terminals. Many people use terminal
emulators which run in a windowing environment and use
curses- based applications. Terminal emulators can duplicate
all of the important aspects of a hardware terminal, but
they do not have the same limitations. The chief limitation
of a hardware terminal from the standpoint of your
application is the management of dataflow, i.e., timing.
Unless a hardware terminal is interfaced into a terminal
concentrator (which does flow control), it (or your
application) must manage dataflow, preventing overruns. The
cheapest solution (no hardware cost) is for your program to
do this by pausing after operations that the terminal does
slowly, such as clearing the display.</p>

<p>As a result, many terminal descriptions (including the
vt100) have delay times embedded. You may wish to use these
descriptions, but not want to pay the performance
penalty.</p>

<p>Set the NCURSES_NO_PADDING symbol to disable all but
mandatory padding. Mandatory padding is used as a part of
special control sequences such as flash.</p>

<p>NCURSES_NO_SETBUF Normally ncurses enables buffered
output during terminal initial- ization. This is done (as in
SVr4 curses) for performance rea- sons. For testing
purposes, both of ncurses and certain applica- tions, this
feature is made optional. Setting the NCURSES_NO_SET- BUF
variable disables output buffering, leaving the output in
the original (usually line buffered) mode.</p>

<p>NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS During initialization, the ncurses
library checks for special cases where VT100 line-drawing
(and the corresponding alternate character set capabilities)
described in the terminfo are known to be missing.
Specifically, when running in a UTF-8 locale, the Linux
console emulator and the GNU screen program ignore these.
Ncurses checks the TERM environment variable for these. For
other special cases, you should set this environment
variable. Doing this tells ncurses to use Unicode values
which correspond to the VT100 line-drawing glyphs. That
works for the special cases cited, and is likely to work for
terminal emulators.</p>

<p>When setting this variable, you should set it to a
nonzero value. Setting it to zero (or to a nonnumber)
disables the special check for Linux and screen.</p>

<p>NCURSES_TRACE During initialization, the ncurses
debugging library checks the NCURSES_TRACE symbol. If it is
defined, to a numeric value, ncurses calls the trace
function, using that value as the argu- ment.</p>

<p>The argument values, which are defined in curses.h,
provide sev- eral types of information. When running with
traces enabled, your application will write the file trace
to the current directory.</p>

<p>TERM Denotes your terminal type. Each terminal type is
distinct, though many are similar.</p>

<p>TERMCAP If the ncurses library has been configured with
termcap support, ncurses will check for a terminal s
description in termcap form if it is not available in the
terminfo database.</p>

<p>The TERMCAP symbol contains either a terminal
description (with newlines stripped out), or a file name
telling where the informa- tion denoted by the TERM symbol
exists. In either case, setting it directs ncurses to ignore
the usual place for this information, e.g.,
/etc/termcap.</p>

<p>TERMINFO Overrides the directory in which ncurses
searches for your termi- nal description. This is the
simplest, but not the only way to change the list of
directories. The complete list of directories in order
follows:</p>

<p>- the last directory to which ncurses wrote, if any, is
searched first</p>

<p>- the directory specified by the TERMINFO symbol</p>

<p>- $HOME/.terminfo</p>

<p>- directories listed in the TERMINFO_DIRS symbol</p>

<p>- one or more directories whose names are configured and
compiled into the ncurses library, e.g.,
/usr/share/terminfo</p>

<p>TERMINFO_DIRS Specifies a list of directories to search
for terminal descrip- tions. The list is separated by colons
(i.e., &quot;:&quot;) on Unix, semi- colons on OS/2 EMX. All
of the terminal descriptions are in ter- minfo form, which
makes a subdirectory named for the first letter of the
terminal names therein.</p>

<p>TERMPATH If TERMCAP does not hold a file name then
ncurses checks the TERMPATH symbol. This is a list of
filenames separated by spaces or colons (i.e.,
&quot;:&quot;) on Unix, semicolons on OS/2 EMX. If the
TERMPATH symbol is not set, ncurses looks in the files
/etc/term- cap, /usr/share/misc/termcap and $HOME/.termcap,
in that order.</p>

<p>The library may be configured to disregard the following
variables when the current user is the superuser (root), or
if the application uses setuid or setgid permissions:
$TERMINFO, $TERMINFO_DIRS, $TERMPATH, as well as $HOME.</p>

<p>ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS Several different
configurations are possible, depending on the config- ure
script options used when building ncurses. There are a few
main options whose effects are visible to the applications
developer using ncurses:</p>

<p>--disable-overwrite The standard include for ncurses is
as noted in SYNOPSIS:</p>

<p>#include &lt;curses.h&gt;</p>

<p>This option is used to avoid filename conflicts when
ncurses is not the main implementation of curses of the
computer. If ncurses is installed disabling overwrite, it
puts its headers in a subdi- rectory, e.g.,</p>

<p>#include &lt;ncurses/curses.h&gt;</p>

<p>It also omits a symbolic link which would allow you to
use -lcurses to build executables.</p>

<p>--enable-widec The configure script renames the library
and (if the --disable- overwrite option is used) puts the
header files in a different subdirectory. All of the library
names have a &quot;w&quot; appended to them, i.e., instead
of</p>

<p>-lncurses</p>

<p>you link with</p>

<p>-lncursesw</p>

<p>You must also define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED when
compiling for the wide-character library to use the extended
(wide-character) func- tions. The curses.h file which is
installed for the wide-charac- ter library is designed to be
compatible with the normal librarys header. Only the size of
the WINDOW structure differs, and very few applications
require more than a pointer to WINDOWs. If the headers are
installed allowing overwrite, the wide-character library s
headers should be installed last, to allow applications to
be built using either library from the same set of
headers.</p>

<p>--with-shared</p>

<p>--with-normal</p>

<p>--with-debug</p>

<p>--with-profile The shared and normal (static) library
names differ by their suf- fixes, e.g., libncurses.so and
libncurses.a. The debug and profiling libraries add a
&quot;_g&quot; and a &quot;_p&quot; to the root names
respectively, e.g., libncurses_g.a and libncurses_p.a.</p>

<p>--with-trace The trace function normally resides in the
debug library, but it is sometimes useful to configure this
in the shared library. Con- figure scripts should check for
the function s existence rather than assuming it is always
in the debug library.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/tabset directory containing
initialization files for the terminal capa- bility database
/usr/share/terminfo terminal capability database</p>

<p>SEE ALSO terminfo(5) and related pages whose names begin
&quot;curs_&quot; for detailed routine descriptions.</p>

<p>EXTENSIONS The ncurses library can be compiled with an
option (-DUSE_GETCAP) that falls back to the old-style
/etc/termcap file if the terminal setup code cannot find a
terminfo entry corresponding to TERM. Use of this feature is
not recommended, as it essentially includes an entire term-
cap compiler in the ncurses startup code, at significant
cost in core and startup cycles.</p>

<p>The ncurses library includes facilities for capturing
mouse events on certain terminals (including xterm). See the
curs_mouse(3X) manual page for details.</p>

<p>The ncurses library includes facilities for responding
to window resiz- ing events, e.g., when running in an xterm.
See the resizeterm(3X) and wresize(3X) manual pages for
details. In addition, the library may be configured with a
SIGWINCH handler.</p>

<p>The ncurses library extends the fixed set of function
key capabilities of terminals by allowing the application
designer to define additional key sequences at runtime. See
the define_key(3X) key_defined(3X), and keyok(3X) manual
pages for details.</p>

<p>The ncurses library can exploit the capabilities of
terminals which implement the ISO-6429 SGR 39 and SGR 49
controls, which allow an application to reset the terminal
to its original foreground and back- ground colors. From the
users perspective, the application is able to draw colored
text on a background whose color is set independently,
providing better control over color contrasts. See the
default_col- ors(3X) manual page for details.</p>

<p>The ncurses library includes a function for directing
application out- put to a printer attached to the terminal
device. See the curs_print(3X) manual page for details.</p>

<p>PORTABILITY The ncurses library is intended to be
BASE-level conformant with the XSI Curses standard. The
EXTENDED XSI Curses functionality (including color support)
is supported.</p>

<p>A small number of local differences (that is, individual
differences between the XSI Curses and ncurses calls) are
described in PORTABILITY sections of the library man
pages.</p>

<p>The routine has_key is not part of XPG4, nor is it
present in SVr4. See the curs_getch(3X) manual page for
details.</p>

<p>The routine slk_attr is not part of XPG4, nor is it
present in SVr4. See the curs_slk(3X) manual page for
details.</p>

<p>The routines getmouse, mousemask, ungetmouse,
mouseinterval, and wen- close relating to mouse interfacing
are not part of XPG4, nor are they present in SVr4. See the
curs_mouse(3X) manual page for details.</p>

<p>The routine mcprint was not present in any previous
curses implementation. See the curs_print(3X) manual page
for details.</p>

<p>The routine wresize is not part of XPG4, nor is it
present in SVr4. See the wresize(3X) manual page for
details.</p>

<p>In historic curses versions, delays embedded in the
capabilities cr, ind, cub1, ff and tab activated
corresponding delay bits in the UNIX tty driver. In this
implementation, all padding is done by NUL sends. This
method is slightly more expensive, but narrows the interface
to the UNIX kernel significantly and increases the package s
portability correspondingly.</p>

<p>NOTES The header file &lt;curses.h&gt; automatically
includes the header files &lt;stdio.h&gt; and
&lt;unctrl.h&gt;.</p>

<p>If standard output from a ncurses program is re-directed
to something which is not a tty, screen updates will be
directed to standard error. This was an undocumented feature
of AT&amp;T System V Release 3 curses.</p>
