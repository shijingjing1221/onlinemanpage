<p>NAME scrollkeeper-gen-seriesid - generate a unique id
for a document series for use in an OMF metadata file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS scrollkeeper-gen-seriesid [--help]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This generates a unique id for use as the
seriesid attribute to the relation element in the OMF
metadata. This id is referred to as the &quot;series
id&quot; or &quot;seriesid&quot;.</p>

<p>The seriesid is used to specify a group (or series) of
documents which are related. For example, multiple versions,
formats, and translations of a single document are
considered to be in the same series. Thus, any new version,
translation, etc. of a pre-existing document should inherit
the seriesid of the original document. Only document series
which have never been assigned a seriesid in the past should
use scrol- lkeeper-gen-seriesid to obtain a new
seriesid.</p>

<p>ScrollKeeper uses the seriesid of documents to identify
which documents are related to each other. For example, when
creating the contents list, ScrollKeeper must identify if
two documents are in the same series in order to display the
most complete set of documents on the system, using locale
fallback for documents which may not be translated into a
given locale, without displaying the same document in two
locales.</p>
