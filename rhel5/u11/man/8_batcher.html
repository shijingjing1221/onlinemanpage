<p>BATCHER(8) BATCHER(8)</p>

<p>NAME batcher - article-batching backend for
InterNetNews</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS batcher [ -a arts ] [ -A total_arts ] [ -b size
] [ -B total_size ] [ -i string ] [ -N num_batches ] [ -p
process ] [ -r ] [ -s separator ] [ -S alt_spool ] [ -v ]
host [ input ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Batcher reads uses a list of files to
prepare news batches for the specified host. It is normally
invoked by a script run out of cron(8) that uses shlock(1)
to lock the host name, followed by a ctlinnd(8) command to
flush the batchfile.</p>

<p>Batcher reads the named input file, or standard input if
no file is given. Relative pathnames are interpreted from
the &lt;pathoutgoing in inn.conf&gt; directory. The input is
taken as a sequence of lines; blank lines and lines starting
with a number sign ( # ) are ignored. All other lines should
consist of one or two fields separated by a single space.
The first field is either the storage token of an article or
the name of a file holding an article; if it is not an an
absolute pathname or storage token, it is taken relative to
&lt;patharti- cles in inn.conf&gt;. The second field, if
present, specifies the size of the article in bytes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -S alt_spool The -S flag may be used to specify
an alternate spool direc- tory to use if the article is not
found; this would perhaps be an NFS-mounted spool directory
of a master server with longer expiration times.</p>

<p>-r By default, the program reports errors to &lt;pathlog
in inn.conf&gt;/errlog. To suppress this redirection and
report errors to standard error, use the -r flag.</p>

<p>-v Upon exit, batcher reports statistics via syslog(3).
If the -v flag is used, they will also be printed on the
standard output.</p>

<p>-b size Batcher collects the text of the named articles
into batches. To limit the size of each batch, use the -b
flag. The default size is 60 kilobytes. Using -b 0 allows
unlimited batch sizes.</p>

<p>-a arts To limit the number of articles in each batch,
use the -a flag. The default is no limit. A new batch will
be started when either the byte count or number of articles
written exceeds the specified limits.</p>

<p>-B total_size To limit the total number of bytes written
for all batches, use the -B flag.</p>

<p>-A total_arts To limit the total number of articles that
can be batched use the -A flag.</p>

<p>-N num_batches To limit the total number of batches that
should be created use the -N flag.</p>

<p>In all three of the above cases, the default is zero,
that is, no limit.</p>

<p>-i string A batch starts with an identifying line to
specify the unpacking method to be used on the receiving
end. When the -i flag is used, the initial string, string,
followed by a newline, will be output at the start of every
batch. The default is to have no initial string.</p>

<p>-s separator Each article starts with a separator line
to indicate the size of the article. To specify the
separator use the -s flag. This is a sprintf(3) format
string which can have a single %ld parameter which will be
given the size of the article. If the separator is not
empty, then the string and a newline will be output before
every article. The default separator is #! rnews %ld.</p>

<p>-p process By default, batches are written to standard
output, which is not useful when more than one output batch
is created. Use the -p flag to specify the shell command
that should be created (via popen(3)) whenever a new batch
is started. The process is a sprintf(3) format string which
can have a single %s param- eter which will be given the
host name. A common value is:</p>

<p>( echo #! cunbatch ; exec compress ) | uux - -r -z
%s!rnews</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS If the input is exhausted, batcher will exit
with a zero status. If any of the limits specified with the
-B, -A, or -N flags is reached, or if there is an error
writing the batch, then batcher will try to spool the
remaining input, copying it to a file. If there was no input
filename, standard input will be copied to &lt;pathoutgoing
in inn.conf&gt;/host and the program will exit. If an input
filename was given, the input will be copied to a temporary
file named input.bch (if input is an absolute pathname) or
&lt;pathoutgoing in inn.conf&gt;/input.bch (if the filename
does not begin with a slash). Once the input is copied,
batcher will try to rename this temporary file to be the
name of the input file, and then exit.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of an interrupt or termination signal,
batcher will finish sending the current article, close the
batch, and then rewrite the batchfile according as described
in the previous paragraph.</p>
