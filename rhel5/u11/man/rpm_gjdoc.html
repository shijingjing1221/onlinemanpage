<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>gjdoc --help</p>

<p>gjdoc --version</p>

<p>Only the most useful options are listed here; see below
for the remain- der.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Gjdoc can be used in two ways: as a
stand-alone documentation tool, or as a driver for a
user-specified Doclet.</p>

<p>In the default mode, Gjdoc will use the Standard Doclet
HtmlDoclet to generate a set of HTML pages. The canonical
usage is:</p>

<p>gjdoc -s src/java/ -all -d api-docs/</p>

<p>Here, src/java/ is the root of your source code class
hierarchy, -all means that all valid Java files found under
this root directory should be processed, and api-docs/ is
the directory where the generated docu- mentation should be
placed.</p>

<p>To learn more about running Doclets other than the
Standard Doclet, refer to the manual.</p>

<p>Selecting which Source Files to Process</p>

<p>-s pathlist -sourcepath pathlist Look for source files
in the specified directory or directories.</p>

<p>pathlist should be one or more directory paths separated
by your platforms path separator (usually : or ;).</p>

<p>If this option is not given, gjdoc will look for source
files in the current directory.</p>

<p>The directories specified should be root directories in
terms of the Java package system. For example, if you want
to generate doc- umentation for classes in package foo.bar,
you must specify the directory containing the top-level foo
sub-directory, not the directory foo/bar/ in which the Java
source files reside.</p>

<p>The short-hand alias -s is specific to gjdoc and not
compatible to Sun javadoc.</p>

<p>-all [EXPERIMENTAL] Process all valid Java source files
found in the directories listed in the source path and their
sub-directories.</p>

<p>This is an option specific to gjdoc and not compatible
to Sun javadoc.</p>

<p>-subpackages pkg:pkg:... Process the classes in the
given Java packages and all sub-pack- ages, recursively.
Note that multiple package names must be sepa- rated with
colons instead of whitespace.</p>

<p>-exclude pkg:pkg:... Do not process classes in the given
Java packages and all sub-pack- ages, recursively. This
option can be used in conjunction with -all or -subpackages
in order to exclude individual packages or package sub-trees
from the output.</p>

<p>packages... Process all classes in the given Java
packages.</p>

<p>sourcefiles... Process the classes in the given Java
source files.</p>

<p>Specifying the Format of Input Files</p>

<p>-source release Assume that the source files are
targeted at the given release of the Java platform.</p>

<p>release should be the version number of a Java platform
release in the format MAJOR.MINOR, for example 1.4.</p>

<p>This option is currently ignored except that an error is
raised if a release number other than 1.2, 1.3 or 1.4 is
specified.</p>

<p>-encoding charset Assume that the source files are
encoded using charset.</p>

<p>Examples for charset are US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1 or
UTF-8.</p>

<p>The semantics of charset are identical to those of
java.nio.charset.Charset.forName(String).</p>

<p>-breakiterator Use the locales java.text.BreakIterator
instead of the internal first sentence detector.</p>

<p>By default, gjdoc uses an internal algorithm to
determine where a sentence ends. When this option is given,
it will instead use the java.text.BreakIterator instance for
the locale given with -locale (or the default locale).</p>

<p>This option should be specified when applying gjdoc to
source code commented in a non-latin language for which the
default first sen- tence detector does not work. For all
other cases, the default (do not use BreakIterator) produces
better results at the time of this writing.</p>

<p>Interlinking with other Documentation Sets</p>

<p>-link url Create hyperlinks to another documentation
set.</p>

<p>By default, gjdoc will only create hyperlinks to classes
in the source set. Use this option to additionally create
hyperlinks to classes covered by the specified documentation
set.</p>

<p>url should be the root URL of the other documentation
set. For example, to add hyperlinks to GNU Classpath,
specify the following:</p>

<p>-link http://developer.classpath.org/doc/</p>

<p>The -link option can be specified multiple times.</p>

<p>Note that specifying the -link option will cause an HTTP
access every time gjdoc is invoked. You can use -linkoffline
instead to avoid this access.</p>

<p>-linkoffline url file Create hyperlinks to another
documentation set which is also present on the local file
system.</p>

<p>This option works exactly like -link, except that it
accesses the local file system instead of the network for
determining which classes are covered by the linked
documentation set.</p>

<p>When using -linkoffline the remote documentation set is
not accessed at all, which can significantly speed up
generation time depending on your network connection. The
generated hyperlinks to the documentation set however refer
to the remote set, not to the local one, so that you can
distribute the documentation without any further
dependencies.</p>

<p>The -linkoffline option can be specified multiple
times.</p>

<p>-noqualifier pkg:pkg:... Do not qualify names of classes
in the given packages with their package name.</p>

<p>By default, a class name is displayed unqualified only
if the class is part of the source set or a linked
documentation set, and quali- fied with the name of its
containing package if it is not. You can use this option to
force unqualified names for classes even if they are not
part of the documentation set.</p>

<p>For example, usually a reference to the String class is
represented fully-qualified as java.lang.String (unless you
link to the appro- priate documentation set using -link)
because it isn t part of the documentation set. You can
specify -noqualifier java.lang to ren- der the same
references just as String.</p>

<p>Note that for all unqualified class names, a tooltip is
provided when you place your mouse pointer over it in the
HTML documenta- tion.</p>

<p>-noqualifier all Omit package name qualifier from all
class names.</p>

<p>Specify this option to omit package name qualifiers
altogether,</p>

<p>Selecting which Information to Generate</p>

<p>-public Only include public members of public classes in
the output. By default, protected class members are included
as well.</p>

<p>-protected Include public or protected members of public
classes in the out- put. This is the default.</p>

<p>-package Include public, protected and package-private
members of public and package-private classes.</p>

<p>-private Include all classes and class members
regardless of their access level.</p>

<p>-splitindex Generate one index page per letter instead
of a single, monolithic index page.</p>

<p>By default, the index created by the Standard Doclet
contains all entries on a single page. This is fine for
small documentation sets, but for large sets you should
specify this option.</p>

<p>-nosince Ignore @since tags in javadoc comments.</p>

<p>By default, the generated output contains sections
listing the ver- sion of your API since which the package,
class or class member in question exists when this tag is
encountered. Specify this option to omit this
information.</p>

<p>-notree Do not generate any tree pages.</p>

<p>By default, the generated output includes one
inheritance tree per package, and - if the documentation set
consists of multiple pack- ages - a page with the full
inheritance tree. Specify this option to omit generation of
these pages.</p>

<p>-noindex Do not output the alphabetical index.</p>

<p>By default, gjdoc generates an alphabetical index of all
program elements in the documentation set (packages,
classes, inner classes, constructors, methods, and fields).
Specify this option to omit this information.</p>

<p>-nohelp Do not generate the help page.</p>

<p>This option is currently ignored as the Standard Doclet
doesnt provide a help page.</p>

<p>-nodeprecated Do not output inline information about
deprecated packages, classes or class members.</p>

<p>By default, the Standard Doclet adds a highlighted
paragraph with deprecation information to the description of
each deprecated pro- gram element. Specify this option to
omit this information.</p>

<p>-nodeprecatedlist Do not output the summary page for
deprecated API elements.</p>

<p>By default, the Standard Doclet generates a page listing
all depre- cated API elements along with a deprecation
description which usu- ally includes the reason for
deprecation and possible alternatives. Specify this option
to omit this information.</p>

<p>-nonavbar Do not output the navigation bar, header, and
footer.</p>

<p>By default, each output page is equipped with a top
navigation bar (which may include a user-specified header)
and a bottom navigation bar (which may include a
user-specified footer). Specify this option to omit this
decoration.</p>

<p>-nocomment Omit all documentation text from the
generated files and output only declarations and program
element relationships.</p>

<p>This option is here for compatibility with javadoc. If
you plan on extracting information about your project via
gjdoc, you should consider using a different Doclet for your
purposes instead, for example XmlDoclet. You could also use
the Doclet API directly by implementing a new Doclet.</p>

<p>-linksource Generate a page with syntax-highlighted
source code for each class. By default, this page is not
generated.</p>

<p>The source code can be accessed by clicking on the
button labelled &quot;Source&quot; in the navigation bar, or
by clicking on the name of a constructor, field, method, or
inner class in the detail section of a class documentation
page.</p>

<p>-use Generate a page with cross-reference information.
By default, this page is not generated.</p>

<p>The cross-reference information can be accessed by
clicking on the button labelled Use in the navigation
bar.</p>

<p>The Use page lists all classes/interfaces in the
documentation set that extend/implement the class (type) in
question; fields of the type; methods or constructors
accepting a parameter of the type; methods returning the
type; and methods or constructors throwing the type.</p>

<p>-author Include author information in the output.</p>

<p>When specified, author information as specified using
the @author tag in javadoc comments is incorporated into the
output. By default, @author tags are ignored.</p>

<p>-version Include version information in the output.</p>

<p>When specified, version information as specified using
the @version tag in javadoc comments is incorporated into
the output. By default, @version tags are ignored.</p>

<p>-licensetext Assume that the first comment in each
source file contains the license text, and add license
information to the footer of each generated class page.</p>

<p>This is an option specific to gjdoc and not compatible
to Sun javadoc.</p>

<p>This option is intended for use with free and open
source projects where source code is typically prefixed with
a boilerplate license comment, when there are legal reasons
for including the license in the documentation.</p>

<p>-docfilessubdirs Recursively copy all files in the
doc-files sub-directory of each package directory.</p>

<p>Usually, only the files in the doc-files sub-directory
are copied without descending recursively.</p>

<p>-excludedocfilessubdir name:name:... Do not copy some
directories directly under the doc-files sub- directories
when descending recursively.</p>

<p>The argument to this option should be a colon-separated
list of directory names.</p>

<p>This option only makes sense if -docfilessubdirs is also
specified. In this case, any sub-directory located directly
beneath a doc- files directory is omitted if listed.</p>

<p>Custom Documentation Tags</p>

<p>-tagletpath pathlist Search pathlist when loading
subsequent Taglet classes specified using -taglet.</p>

<p>pathlist should be one or more paths to a directory or
jar file, separated by your platforms path separator
(usually : or ;).</p>

<p>-taglet classname Register a Taglet.</p>

<p>classname should be the fully-qualified name of a Java
class imple- menting com.sun.tools.doclets.Taglet.</p>

<p>The Taglet classes will be loaded from the classpath
specified using -tagletpath, from the classpath specified
using -classpath and from the default classpath.</p>

<p>See the documentation of com.sun.tools.doclets.Taglet
for further information.</p>

<p>Note that for simple tags, there is also -tag.</p>

<p>-tag tagspec Register a generic Taglet.</p>

<p>The format of tagspec must be
&lt;tagname&gt;:&lt;flags&gt;:&quot;&lt;taghead&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>tagname is the tag name to match, without the leading @
sign.</p>

<p>flags is one or more of the following characters, where
each char- acter specifies a source code context in which
the tag is to be recognized.</p>

<p>a all contexts</p>

<p>c constructors</p>

<p>f fields</p>

<p>m methods</p>

<p>o overview</p>

<p>p packages</p>

<p>t types (classes, interfaces, exceptions, errors)</p>

<p>X special character which temporarily disables the
Taglet alto- gether.</p>

<p>taghead is the string to display in the header of the
section devoted to the tag in question.</p>

<p>For example, to define a tag matching @cvsid which is to
be accepted in overview, package and type pages and which is
labelled with the header CVS ID, you would specify:</p>

<p>-tag cvsid:tpo:&quot;CVS ID&quot;</p>

<p>Lets say that a class javadoc comment contains</p>

<p>@cvsid $Id: invoke.texi,v 1.3 2005/05/23 21:54:09 julian
Exp $</p>

<p>Then the HTML output will contain something like</p>

<p>CVS ID: $Id: invoke.texi,v 1.3 2005/05/23 21:54:09
julian Exp $</p>

<p>Running Other Doclets</p>

<p>-docletpath pathlist Search pathlist when loading
classes for the Doclet specified using -doclet.</p>

<p>pathlist should be one or more paths to a directory or
jar file, separated by your platforms path separator
(usually : or ;).</p>

<p>-doclet className Run the specified doclet instead of
the standard HtmlDoclet.</p>

<p>className should be the fully-qualified name of a class
which has a public default constructor and contain a method
with the following signature:</p>

<p>import com.sun.javadoc.RootDoc; public static boolean
start(RootDoc rootDoc)</p>

<p>The Doclet classes will be loaded from the classpath
specified using -docletpath, from the classpath specified
using -classpath and from the default classpath.</p>

<p>The start method should process the information exposed
by the Doclet API via rootDoc and return true on success,
false on fail- ure.</p>

<p>If you are using a third-party doclet, refer to its
documentation for further instructions. Note that support
for third-party doclets is experimental. Please report any
problems you encounter, or provide feedback when
successfully running third-party applets.</p>

<p>This option can be specified multiple times, in which
case all doclets are executed with the same information tree
exposed via the Doclet API for each Doclet run.</p>

<p>Adding Information to the Output</p>

<p>-windowtitle text Use text as the browser window title
prefix.</p>

<p>When specified, the browser window title for each page
will be pre- fixed with text instead of the default string
Generated API Docu- mentation.</p>

<p>text should be plain text (it should not contain HTML
tags).</p>

<p>-doctitle text Set the header text of the overview page
to text.</p>

<p>text should be a short plain text string.</p>

<p>When generating documentation for a single package,
specifying this option forces generation of the overview
page.</p>

<p>-header htmltext Add htmltext to the right upper corner
of every generated page. htmltext is usually set to the name
of the project being docu- mented.</p>

<p>-footer htmltext Add htmltext to the right bottom corner
of every generated page. htmltext is often set to the same
value as for -header.</p>

<p>-bottom htmltext Add htmltext to the very bottom of
every generated page, spanning the whole width of the page.
When specified, htmltext usually con- sists of a copyright
notice and/or links to other project pages.</p>

<p>-addstylesheet file Augment the default CSS style sheets
with the user-specified stylesheet file.</p>

<p>The given stylesheet is simply loaded by each HTML page
in addition to the default ones, as the last stylesheet.</p>

<p>Note that the CSS cascading rules apply. That is, your
style prop- erties will only be assigned if they have a
higher cascading order than gjdocs default style. One simple
way to make sure that this is the case is to declare your
overrides !important.</p>

<p>See
&lt;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/cascade.html#cascading-order&gt;.</p>

<p>-group heading pkgwildcard:pkgwildcard:... Arrange the
given packages in a separate group on the overview page.</p>

<p>The first argument should be a short plain text which is
used as the title of the package group. The second argument
should be a colon-separated list of package wildcards. The
group will consist of all packages in the documentation set
whose name matches any of the given wildcards.</p>

<p>There is only one wildcard character, *, which matches
both letters in package name components and the . separating
package name compo- nents. For example, j*regex would match
package java.util.regex. A more useful example would be
javax.swing* to match javax.swing and all of its
sub-packages.</p>

<p>This option can be given multiple times.</p>

<p>FIXME: Information about group nesting here.</p>

<p>gjdoc -group &quot;Core Classes&quot; java* -group
&quot;Swing&quot; javax.swing* -group &quot;XML APIs&quot;
javax.xml* -group &quot;Other Extensions&quot; javax*
...</p>

<p>-overview file Add the XHTML body fragment from file to
the overview page.</p>

<p>file should contain an XHTML fragment with the HTML body
tag as the root node.</p>

<p>This option can be used to supply a description of the
documenta- tion set as a whole.</p>

<p>When specified, the first sentence of the fragment will
be put above the tables listing the documented packages,
along with a link to the full copy of the fragment which is
put below the tables.</p>

<p>When generating documentation for a single package,
specifying this option forces generation of the overview
page.</p>

<p>-stylesheetfile file Use the CSS stylesheet in file
instead of the default CSS stylesheets.</p>

<p>If you only want to override parts of the default
stylesheets, use -addstylesheet instead.</p>

<p>-title text Deprecated. Use -doctitle text instead.</p>

<p>-helpfile file This option is currently ignored.</p>

<p>When implemented, it will use the XHTML fragment in file
for the help page contents instead of the default help
text.</p>

<p>Controlling the Output.</p>

<p>-d directory Place all output files into directory (and
sub-directories). direc- tory will be created if it does not
exist, including all non-exist- ing parent directories and
all required sub-directories.</p>

<p>If not specified, output will be placed into the current
directory.</p>

<p>-locale name Use locale name instead of the default
locale for all purposes.</p>

<p>name should be a locale specifier in the form
ll_CC[_VAR] where ll is a lowercase two-letter ISO-639
language code, CC is an optional uppercase two-letter
ISO-3166 country code, and VAR is an optional variant code.
For example, en specifies English, en_US specifies US
English, and en_US_WIN specifies a deviant variant of the US
English locale.</p>

<p>Note that the semantics of this option correspond
exactly to those of the constructors of class
java.util.Locale.</p>

<p>This option currently only determines which Collator is
being used for sorting output elements. This means that the
locale will only have an effect when you are using non-ASCII
characters in identi- fiers.</p>

<p>-charset charset Deprecated. Override the specified
encoding in output XHTML files with the one given by
charset.</p>

<p>If this option is not given, the encoding specification
in output XHTML is chosen to match the encoding used when
writing the file (the encoding given with -docencoding, or
your platforms default encoding).</p>

<p>The semantics for charset are specified here:
&lt;http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#NT-EncName&gt;.
For all practical purposes, they are identical to those of
the other options accepting charset parameters.</p>

<p>This option is here for compatibility with javadoc and
should be avoided.</p>

<p>-docencoding charset Use the given charset encoding when
writing output files instead of your platforms default
encoding.</p>

<p>Examples for charset are US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1 or
UTF-8.</p>

<p>The semantics of this option correspond exactly to those
of the constructors of class java.util.Locale.</p>

<p>-validhtml Force generation of valid XHTML code. This
breaks compatibility to the traditional Javadoc tool to some
extent.</p>

<p>If this option is specified, anchor names will be
mangled so that they are valid according to the XHTML 1.1
specification. However, a documentation set generated with
this option cannot be linked to properly using the
traditional Javadoc tool. It can be linked to just fine
using Gjdoc, though.</p>

<p>Without this option, anchor names for executable class
members use the traditional format, for example:
foo(String,int[]) . This is compatible to the traditional
Javadoc tool, but according to both the HTML 4.0 and XHTML
1.0 and 1.1 specifications, this format includes illegal
characters. Parentheses, square brackets, and the comma are
not allowed in anchor names.</p>

<p>-baseurl url Hardwire a page URL relative to url into
each generated page.</p>

<p>If you are generating documentation which will
exclusively be available at a certain URL, you should use
this option to specify this URL.</p>

<p>This can help avoid certain redirect attacks used by
spammers, and it can be helpful for certain web clients.</p>

<p>Verbosity Options</p>

<p>-quiet Suppress all output except for warnings and error
messages.</p>

<p>-verbose Be very verbose about what gjdoc is doing.</p>

<p>This option is currently ignored.</p>

<p>Virtual Machine Options</p>

<p>Sun s javadoc tool seems to be based on javac and as
such it seems to operate on the VM level. gjdoc, in
contrast, is a pure Java applica- tion.</p>

<p>Therefore, gjdoc can only fake, or simulate, the
following VM-level options.</p>

<p>-classpath pathlist Set the Virtual Machine classpath to
pathlist.</p>

<p>In most cases you should use -docletpath or -tagletpath
instead of this option.</p>

<p>pathlist should be one or more paths to a directory or
jar file, separated by your platforms path separator
(usually : or ;).</p>

<p>If this option is not intercepted at the wrapper level,
gjdoc cur- rently fakes it by calling
System.setProperty(&quot;java.class.path&quot;, pathlist);
and outputs a warning.</p>

<p>-bootclasspath pathlist Set the Virtual Machine
bootclasspath to pathlist.</p>

<p>If this option is not intercepted at the wrapper level,
gjdoc out- puts a warning.</p>

<p>-Jvmopt Pass an arbitrary parameter to the Virtual
Machine gjdoc runs on.</p>

<p>If this option is not intercepted at the wrapper level,
gjdoc tries to emulate the option and outputs a warning.</p>

<p>Currently, only the VM option -D for setting system
properties is emulated.</p>
