<p>GETGROUPS(2) Linux Programmer s Manual GETGROUPS(2)</p>

<p>NAME getgroups, setgroups - get/set list of
supplementary group IDs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getgroups(int size, gid_t list[]);</p>

<p>#include &lt;grp.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setgroups(size_t size, const gid_t *list);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION getgroups() Up to size supplementary group
IDs (of the calling process) are returned in list. It is
unspecified whether the effective group ID of the calling
process is included in the returned list. (Thus, an
application should also call getegid(2) and add or remove
the resulting value.) If size is zero, list is not modi-
fied, but the total number of supplementary group IDs for
the process is returned.</p>

<p>setgroups() Sets the supplementary group IDs for the
process. Appropriate privileges (Linux: the CAP_SETGID
capability) are required.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE getgroups() On success, the number of
supplementary group IDs is returned. On error, -1 is
returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>setgroups() On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT list has an invalid address.</p>

<p>EINVAL For setgroups(), size is greater than NGROUPS (32
for Linux 2.0.32). For getgroups(), size is less than the
number of sup- plementary group IDs, but is not zero.</p>

<p>EPERM The calling process has insufficient privilege to
call set- groups().</p>

<p>NOTES A process can have up to at least NGROUPS_MAX
supplementary group IDs in addition to the effective group
ID. The set of supplementary group IDs is inherited from the
parent process and may be changed using set- groups(). The
maximum number of supplementary group IDs can be found using
sysconf(3): long ngroups_max; ngroups_max =
sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX); The maximal return value of
getgroups() cannot be larger than one more than the value
obtained this way.</p>

<p>The prototype for setgroups() is only available if
_BSD_SOURCE is defined.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD. The getgroups() function is
in POSIX.1-2001. Since set- groups() requires privilege, it
is not covered by POSIX.1-2001.</p>
