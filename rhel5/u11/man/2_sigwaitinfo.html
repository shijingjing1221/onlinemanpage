<p>SIGWAITINFO(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SIGWAITINFO(2)</p>

<p>NAME sigwaitinfo, sigtimedwait - synchronously wait for
queued signals</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sigwaitinfo(const sigset_t *set, siginfo_t
*info);</p>

<p>int sigtimedwait(const sigset_t *set, siginfo_t *info,
const struct timespec *timeout);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sigwaitinfo() suspends execution of the
calling process until one of the signals in set is
delivered. (If one of the signals in set is already pending
for the calling process, sigwaitinfo() will return
immediately with information about that signal.)</p>

<p>sigwaitinfo() removes the delivered signal from the
calling processs list of pending signals and returns the
signal number as its function result. If the info argument
is not NULL, then it returns a structure of type siginfo_t
(see sigaction(2)) containing information about the
signal.</p>

<p>Signals returned via sigwaitinfo() are delivered in the
usual order; see signal(7) for further details.</p>

<p>sigtimedwait() operates in exactly the same way as
sigwaitinfo() except that it has an additional argument,
timeout, which enables an upper bound to be placed on the
time for which the process is suspended. This argument is of
the following type:</p>

<p>struct timespec { long tv_sec; /* seconds */ long
tv_nsec; /* nanoseconds */ }</p>

<p>If both fields of this structure are specified as 0, a
poll is per- formed: sigtimedwait() returns immediately,
either with information about a signal that was pending for
the caller, or with an error if none of the signals in set
was pending.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, both sigwaitinfo() and
sigtimedwait() return a signal num- ber (i.e., a value
greater than zero). On failure both calls return -1, with
errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN No signal in set was delivered within the
timeout period speci- fied to sigtimedwait().</p>

<p>EINTR The wait was interrupted by a signal handler.
(This handler was for a signal other than one of those in
set.)</p>

<p>EINVAL timeout was invalid.</p>

<p>NOTES In normal usage, the calling program blocks the
signals in set via a prior call to sigprocmask() (so that
the default disposition for these signals does not occur if
they are delivered between successive calls to sigwaitinfo()
or sigtimedwait()) and does not establish handlers for these
signals. In a multithreaded program, the signal should be
blocked in all threads to prevent the signal being delivered
to a thread other than the one calling sigwaitinfo() or
sigtimedwait()).</p>

<p>POSIX leaves the meaning of a NULL value for the timeout
argument of sigtimedwait() unspecified, permitting the
possibility that this has the same meaning as a call to
sigwaitinfo(), and indeed this is what is done on Linux.</p>
