<p>NAME xsri - set the root window background in X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xsri [OPTION]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Allows the display of text, patterns, and
images in the root window, so users can customize the
XDM-style login screen and/or the normal X background.</p>

<p>The image displayed by xsri is composed of three
layers:</p>

<p>1) A background color or gradient</p>

<p>2) An optional tiled image</p>

<p>3) An optional emblem image</p>

<p>OPTIONS Mode Selection Options --set Set the background,
by the standard method used for setting a users background
(_XROOTPMAP_ID, ESETROOT_PMAP_I point to the pixmap ID,
pixmap ID is owned by a persistant X connection which must
be killed with XKillClient). This is the default mode.</p>

<p>--run Maintains the background while running, but does
not set it. This mode may take less memory than SET, since
xsri can use mul- tiple windows to display the image, and
will work better on Pseudo-color displays. On exit, the
background will be in an undefined state.</p>

<p>--test The image is displayed in a window which is half
the width and height of the screen.</p>

<p>Background Color and Gradient Options --color=COLOR1 Set
the background color.</p>

<p>--color2=COLOR2 If set, the background will be a
gradient.</p>

<p>--hgradient Draw a horizontal gradient from COLOR1 at
the left to COLOR2 at the right. (Default if --color2 is
given.)</p>

<p>--vgradient Draw a vertical gradient from COLOR1 at the
top to COLOR2 at the bottom. (Default if --color2 is
given.)</p>

<p>Tiled Image Options --tile=IMAGE The image to tile.</p>

<p>--tile-alpha={0-255} The alpha value of the tile (255 ==
fully opaque, default)</p>

<p>Emblem Options --emblem=IMAGE Set the emblem image to
IMAGE.</p>

<p>--emblem-alpha={0-255} Set the alpha value of the
emblem. The default is 255 ( == fully opaque).</p>

<p>--emboss Emboss the emblem on the background.</p>

<p>--geometry=[WIDTHxHEIGHT][+X+Y] Set the location or size
of the emblem. Either the width and height or the location
may be omitted.</p>

<p>--center-x Center the emblem in the X direction.</p>

<p>--center-y Center the emblem in the Y direction.</p>

<p>--scale-width[=PERCENT] Scale the emblem horizontally to
a fraction of the width of the screen. 100% is the
default.</p>

<p>--scale-height[=PERCENT] Scale the emblem vertically to
a fraction of the height of the screen. 100% is the
default.</p>

<p>--avoid=WIDTHxHEIGHT[+X+Y] Shrink the width and/or
height of the emblem as necessary to avoid the given
rectangle. If X and Y are not specified, the rectangle is
centered. (Implies --keep-aspect.)</p>

<p>--keep-aspect The width or height of the emblem will be
shrunk as needed to maintain the aspect ratio.</p>

<p>PLACEMENT AND SCALING The placement and scaling item
algorithm, specified exactly:</p>

<p>Set w and h to width and height of the image.</p>

<p>If --geometry=WxH was specifed, set w to W, h to H. If
--scale- width=PERCENT was specified, set w to (PERCENT/100)
* screen_width. If --scale-height=PERCENT was specified, set
h to (PERCENT/100) * screen_height.</p>

<p>Define the horizontal gravity point to be at center if
--center-x was specified; otherwise, at right if
--geometry=-X was specified; other- wise at left.</p>

<p>Define the vertical gravity point to be at center if
--center-y was specified; otherwise, at bottom if
--geometry=-Y was specified; other- wise at top.</p>

<p>If --center-x, was specified, set x to center the image
on the screen; otherwise, if the position was specified via
geometry, use that; other- wise set x = 0.</p>

<p>If --center-y, was specified, set y to center the image
on the screen; otherwise, if the position was specified via
geometry, use that; other- wise set y = 0.</p>

<p>If --keep-aspect or --avoid was specified, then if the
aspect ratio is narrower than that of the image, shrink the
height to make the aspect ratio match; if the aspect ratio
is wider than that of the image, shrink the height to make
the apsect ratio match, keeping the gravity point at the
same location.</p>

<p>If --avoid was specified, shrink the image, keeping the
aspect ratio the same and the gravity point in the same
place to avoid the given rectangle. If this isn t possible,
do not display the emblem.</p>
