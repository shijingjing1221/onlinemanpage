<p>NAME diff3 - find differences between three files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS diff3 [options] mine older yours</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The diff3 command compares three files and
outputs descriptions of their differences.</p>

<p>The files to compare are mine, older, and yours. At most
one of these three file names may be -, which tells diff3 to
read the standard input for that file.</p>

<p>Options Below is a summary of all of the options that
GNU diff3 accepts. Mul- tiple single letter options (unless
they take an argument) can be com- bined into a single
command line argument.</p>

<p>-a Treat all files as text and compare them
line-by-line, even if they do not appear to be text.</p>

<p>-A Incorporate all changes from older to yours into
mine, surround- ing all conflicts with bracket lines.</p>

<p>-B Old behavior of -A. Shows non-conflicts.</p>

<p>-e Generate an ed script that incorporates all the
changes from older to yours into mine.</p>

<p>-E Like -e, except bracket lines from overlapping
changes first and third files. With -e, an overlapping
change looks like this:</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; mine lines from mine
======= lines from yours &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
yours</p>

<p>--ed Generate an ed script that incorporates all the
changes from older to yours into mine.</p>

<p>--easy-only Like -e, except output only the
nonoverlapping changes.</p>

<p>-i Generate w and q commands at the end of the ed script
for System V compatibility. This option must be combined
with one of the -AeExX3 options, and may not be combined
with -m.</p>

<p>--initial-tab Output a tab rather than two spaces before
the text of a line in normal format. This causes the
alignment of tabs in the line to look normal.</p>

<p>-L label --label=label Use the label label for the
brackets output by the -A, -E and -X options. This option
may be given up to three times, one for each input file. The
default labels are the names of the input files. Thus diff3
-L X -L Y -L Z -m A B C acts like diff3 -m A B C , except
that the output looks like it came from files named X, Y and
Z rather than from files named A, B and C.</p>

<p>-m --merge Apply the edit script to the first file and
send the result to standard output. Unlike piping the output
from diff3 to ed, this works even for binary files and
incomplete lines. -A is assumed if no edit script option is
specified.</p>

<p>--overlap-only Like -e, except output only the
overlapping changes.</p>

<p>--show-all Incorporate all unmerged changes from older
to yours into mine, surrounding all overlapping changes with
bracket lines.</p>

<p>--show-overlap Like -e, except bracket lines from
overlapping changes first and third files.</p>

<p>-T Output a tab rather than two spaces before the text
of a line in normal format. This causes the alignment of
tabs in the line to look normal.</p>

<p>--text Treat all files as text and compare them
line-by-line, even if they do not appear to be text.</p>

<p>-v --version Output the version number of diff3.</p>

<p>-x Like -e, except output only the overlapping
changes.</p>

<p>-X Like -E, except output only the overlapping changes.
In other words, like -x, except bracket changes as in
-E.</p>

<p>-3 Like -e, except output only the nonoverlapping
changes.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO cmp(1), comm(1), diff(1), ed(1), patch(1),
sdiff(1).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS An exit status of 0 means diff3 was
successful, 1 means some conflicts were found, and 2 means
trouble.</p>
