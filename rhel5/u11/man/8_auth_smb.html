<p>AUTH_SMB(8) InterNetNews Documentation AUTH_SMB(8)</p>

<p>NAME auth_smb - nnrpd Samba authenticator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS auth_smb server [backup_server] domain</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program does authentication for nnrpd
against an SMB server. It passes the received username and
password to server for validation in the specified SMB
domain. A backup server may optionally be supplied; if it is
missing, only server is used.</p>

<p>If authentication is successful, the original username
is returned as the authentication identity. Brief errors,
including incorrect pass- word and failure contacting the
server, are logged.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following readers.conf(5) fragment grants
access to users who can authenticate against an SMB
server:</p>

<p>auth windows { auth: &quot;auth_smb pdc.example.com
bdc.example.com USERS&quot; default-domain:
&quot;users.example.com&quot; }</p>

<p>access internal { users: &quot;*@users.example.com&quot;
newsgroups: example.* }</p>

<p>Access is granted to the example.* groups after
successful authentica- tion.</p>

<p>BUGS We should link against an external SMB library
rather than maintain one within the INN source tree.</p>
