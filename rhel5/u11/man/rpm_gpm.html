<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>NAME gpm - a cut and paste utility and mouse server for
virtual consoles</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gpm [ options ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This package tries to be a useful mouse
server for applications running on the Linux console. It is
based on the &quot;selection&quot; package, and some of its
code comes from selection itself. This package is intended
as a replacement for &quot;selection&quot; as a
cut-and-paste mechanism; it also pro- vides additional
facilities. The &quot;selection&quot; package offered the
first cut-and-paste implementation for Linux using two mouse
buttons, and the cut buffer is still called &quot;selection
buffer&quot; or just &quot;selection&quot; throughout this
document. The information below is extracted from the
texinfo file, which is the preferred source of
information.</p>

<p>The gpm executable is meant to act like a daemon (thus,
gpmd would be a better name for it). This section is meant
to describe the command-line options for gpm, while its
internals are outlined in the next section.</p>

<p>Due to restrictions in the ioctl(TIOCLINUX) system call,
gpm must be run by the superuser. The restrictions have been
added in the last 1.1 kernels to fix a security hole related
to selection and screen dumping.</p>

<p>The server can be configured to match the user s taste,
and any appli- cation using the mouse will inherit the
servers attitude. From release 1.02 up to 1.19.2 is was
possible for any user logged on the system console to change
the mouse feeling using the -q option. This is no longer
possible for security reasons.</p>

<p>As of 0.97 the server program puts itself in the
background. To kill gpm you can just reinvoke it with the -k
cmdline switch, although kil- lall gpm can be a better
choice.</p>

<p>SPECIAL COMMANDS Version 1.10 adds the capability to
execute special commands on certain circumstances. Special
commands default to rebooting and halting the system, but
the user can specify his/her personal choice. The capabil-
ity to invoke commands using the mouse is a handy one for
programmers, because it allows to issue a clean shutdown
when the keyboard is locked and no network is available to
restore the system to a sane state.</p>

<p>Special commands are toggled by triple-clicking the left
and right but- ton -- an unlikely event during normal mouse
usage. The easiest way to triple-click is pressing one of
the buttons and triple-click the other one. When special
processing is toggled, a message appears on the con- sole
(and the speaker beeps twice, if you have a speaker); if the
user releases all the buttons and presses one of them again
within three seconds, then the special command corresponding
to the button is exe- cuted.</p>

<p>The default special commands are:</p>

<p>left button Reboot the system by signalling the init
process</p>

<p>middle button (if any) Execute /sbin/shutdown -h now</p>

<p>right button Execute /sbin/shutdown -r now</p>

<p>The -S command line switch enables special command
processing and allows to change the three special commands.
To accept the default com- mands use -S &quot;&quot; (i.e.,
specify an empty argument). To specify your own commands,
use a colon-separated list to specify commands associated to
the left, middle and right button. If any of the commands is
empty, it is interpreted as send a signal to the init
process. This particular operation is supported, in addition
to executing external commands, because sometimes bad bugs
put the system to the impossibility to fork; in these rare
case the programmer should be able to shutdown the system
anyways, and killing init from a running process is the only
way to do it.</p>

<p>As an example, -S &quot;:telinit 1:/sbin/halt&quot;,
associates killing init to the left button, going single
user to the middle one, and halting the system to the right
button.</p>

<p>System administrators should obviously be careful about
special com- mands, as gpm runs with superuser permissions.
Special commands are best suited for computers whose mouse
can be physically accessed only by trusted people.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS Available command line options are
the following:</p>

<p>-a accel Set the acceleration value used when a single
motion event is longer than delta (see -d).</p>

<p>-A[limit] Start up with selection pasting disabled. This
is intended as a security measure; a plausible attack on a
system seems to be to stuff a nasty shell command into the
selection buffer (rm -rf /) including the terminating line
break, then all the victim has to do is click the middle
mouse button .. As of version 1.17.2, this has developed
into a more general aging mechanism; the gpm daemon can
disable (age) selection pasting automatically after a period
of inactivity. To enable this mode just give the optional
limit parameter (no space in between !) which is interpreted
as the time in seconds for which a selection is con- sidered
valid and pastable. As of version 1.15.7, a trivial program
called disable-paste is provided. The following makes a good
addition to /etc/profile if you allow multiple users to work
on your console.</p>

<p>case $( /usr/bin/tty ) in /dev/tty[0-9]*)
/usr/bin/disable-paste ;; esac</p>

<p>-b baud Set the baud rate.</p>

<p>-B sequence Set the button sequence. 123 is the normal
sequence, 321 can be used by left-handed people, and 132 can
be useful with two-but- ton mice (especially within Emacs).
All the button permutations are allowable.</p>

<p>-d delta Set the delta value. When a single motion event
is longer than delta, accel is used as a multiplying factor.
(Must be 2 or above)</p>

<p>-D Do not automatically enter background operation when
started, and log messages to the standard error stream, not
the syslog mechanism. This is useful for debugging; in
previous releases it was done with a compile-time
option.</p>

<p>-g number With glidepoint devices, emulate the specified
button with tap- ping. number must be 1, 2, or 3, and refers
to the button num- ber before the -B button remapping is
performed. This option applies to the mman and ps2 decoding.
No button is emulated by default because the ps2 tapping is
incompatible with some normal ps2 mice</p>

<p>-h Print a summary of command line options.</p>

<p>-i interval Set interval to be used as an upper time
limit for multiple clicks. If the interval between button-up
and button-down events is less than limit, the press is
considered a double or triple click. Time is in
milliseconds.</p>

<p>-k Kill a running gpm. This can be used by busmouse
users to kill gpm before running X (unless they use -R or
the single-open lim- itation is removed from the
kernel).</p>

<p>-l charset Choose the inword() look up table. The
charset argument is a list of characters. - is used to
specify a range and is used to escape the next character or
to provide octal codes. Only visible character can appear in
charset because control charac- ters cat appear in text-mode
video memory, whence selection is cut.</p>

<p>-m filename Choose the mouse file to open. Must be
before -t and -o.</p>

<p>-M Enable multiple mode. The daemon will read two
different mouse devices. Any subsequent option will refer to
the second device, while any preceding option will be used
for the first device. This option automatically forces the
repeater (-R) option on.</p>

<p>-o list-of-extra-options The option works similary to
the -o option of mount; it is used to specify a list of
extra options that are specific to each mouse type. The list
is comma-separated. The options dtr, rts or both are used by
the serial initialization to toggle the modem lines like,
compatibly with earlier gpm versions; note however that
using -o dtr associated with non-plain-serial mouse types
may now generate an error. And by the way, use -o after -m
and after -t.</p>

<p>-p Forces the pointer to be visible while selecting.
This is the behaviour of selection-1.7, but it is sometimes
confusing. The default is not to show the pointer, which can
be confusing as well.</p>

<p>-r number Set the responsiveness. A higher
responsiveness is used for a faster cursor motion.</p>

<p>-R[name] Causes gpm to act as a repeater: any mouse data
received while in graphic mode will be produced on the fifo
/dev/gpmdata in protocol name, given as an optional argument
(no space in between !). In principle, you can use the same
names as for the -t option, although repeating into some
protocols may not be implemented for a while. In addition,
you can specify raw as the name, to repeat the mouse data
byte by byte, without any protocol translation. If name is
omitted, it defaults to msc. Using gpm in repeater mode, you
can configure the X server to use its fifo as a mouse
device. This option is useful for bus- mouse owners to
override the single-open limitation. It is also an easy way
to manage those stupid dual-mode mice which force you to
keep the middle button down while changing video mode. The
option is forced on by the -M option.</p>

<p>-s number Set the sample rate for the mouse device.</p>

<p>-S commands Enable special-command processing, and
optionally specify custom commands as a colon-separated
list. See above for a detailed description of special
commands.</p>

<p>-t name Set the mouse type. Use -t help to get a list of
allowable types. Since version 1.18.1, the list also shows
which protocols are available as repeaters (see -R above),
by marking them with an asterisk (*).</p>

<p>Use -t after you selected the mouse device with -m.</p>

<p>-v Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>-V[verbosity increment] Raise or decrease the maximum
level of messages that will be logged. Thus a positive
argument has the effect of making the program more verbose.
One can also give a negative argument to hush the program;
due to getopt(3) rules, any optional argument needs to be
passed without a space in between! When omitting the
argument, the increment defaults to 1. Default verbosity
level is 5 (LOG_NOTICE).</p>

<p>-2 Force two buttons. This means that the middle button,
if any, will be taken as it was the right one.</p>

<p>-3 Force three buttons. By default the mouse is
considered to be a 2-buttons one, until the middle button is
pressed. If three but- tons are there, the right one is used
to extend the selection, and the middle one is used to paste
it. Beware: if you use the -3 option with a 2-buttons mouse,
you wont be able to paste the selection.</p>

<p>OPERATION To select text press the left mouse button and
drag the mouse. To paste text in the same or another
console, press the middle button. The right button is used
to extend the selection, like in xterm.</p>

<p>Two-button mice use the right button to paste text.</p>

<p>Double and triple clicks select whole word and whole
lines. Use of the -p option is recommended for best visual
feedback.</p>

<p>If a trailing space after the contents of a line is
highlighted, and if there is no other text on the remainder
of the line, the rest of the line will be selected
automatically. If a number of lines are selected,
highlighted trailing spaces on each line will be removed
from the selection buffer.</p>

<p>Any output on the virtual console holding the selection
will clear the highlighted selection from the screen, to
maintain integrity of the display, although the contents of
the paste buffer will be unaffected.</p>

<p>The selection mechanism is disabled if the controlling
virtual console is placed in graphics mode, for example when
running X11, and is re- enabled when text mode is resumed.
(But see BUGS section below.)</p>

<p>BUGS The gpm server may have problems interacting with
X: if your mouse is a single-open device (i.e. a bus mouse),
you should kill gpm before starting X, or use the -R option
(see above). To kill gpm just invoke gpm -k. This problem
doesnt apply to serial mice.</p>

<p>Two instances of gpm cant run on the same system. If you
have two mice use the -M option (see above).</p>

<p>While the current console is in graphic mode, gpm sleeps
until text mode is back (unless -R is used). Thus, it wont
reply to clients. Any- ways, it is unlikely that mouse-eager
clients will spur out in hidden consoles.</p>

<p>The clients shipped out with gpm are not updated, thus
there are poten- tial security risks when using them.</p>
