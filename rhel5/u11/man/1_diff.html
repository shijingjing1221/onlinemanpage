<p>NAME diff - find differences between two files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS diff [options] from-file to-file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In the simplest case, diff compares the
contents of the two files from- file and to-file. A file
name of - stands for text read from the stan- dard input. As
a special case, diff - - compares a copy of standard input
to itself.</p>

<p>If from-file is a directory and to-file is not, diff
compares the file in from-file whose file name is that of
to-file, and vice versa. The non-directory file must not be
-.</p>

<p>If both from-file and to-file are directories, diff
compares corre- sponding files in both directories, in
alphabetical order; this compar- ison is not recursive
unless the -r or --recursive option is given. diff never
compares the actual contents of a directory as if it were a
file. The file that is fully specified may not be standard
input, because standard input is nameless and the notion of
file with the same name does not apply.</p>

<p>diff options begin with -, so normally from-file and
to-file may not begin with -. However, -- as an argument by
itself treats the remain- ing arguments as file names even
if they begin with -.</p>

<p>Options Below is a summary of all of the options that
GNU diff accepts. Most options have two equivalent names,
one of which is a single letter pre- ceded by -, and the
other of which is a long name preceded by --. Mul- tiple
single letter options (unless they take an argument) can be
com- bined into a single command line word: -ac is
equivalent to -a -c. Long named options can be abbreviated
to any unique prefix of their name. Brackets ([ and ])
indicate that an option takes an optional argument.</p>

<p>-lines Show lines (an integer) lines of context. This
option does not specify an output format by itself; it has
no effect unless it is combined with -c or -u. This option
is obsolete. For proper operation, patch typically needs at
least two lines of context.</p>

<p>-a Treat all files as text and compare them
line-by-line, even if they do not seem to be text.</p>

<p>-b Ignore changes in amount of white space.</p>

<p>-B Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank
lines.</p>

<p>--brief Report only whether the files differ, not the
details of the differences.</p>

<p>-c Use the context output format.</p>

<p>-C lines --context[=lines] Use the context output
format, showing lines (an integer) lines of context, or
three if lines is not given. For proper opera- tion, patch
typically needs at least two lines of context.</p>

<p>--changed-group-format=format Use format to output a
line group containing differing lines from both files in
if-then-else format.</p>

<p>-d Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set of
changes. This makes diff slower (sometimes much slower).</p>

<p>-D name Make merged if-then-else format output,
conditional on the pre- processor macro name.</p>

<p>-e --ed Make output that is a valid ed script.</p>

<p>--exclude=pattern When comparing directories, ignore
files and subdirectories whose basenames match pattern.</p>

<p>--exclude-from=file When comparing directories, ignore
files and subdirectories whose basenames match any pattern
contained in file.</p>

<p>--expand-tabs Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to
preserve the alignment of tabs in the input files.</p>

<p>-f Make output that looks vaguely like an ed script but
has changes in the order they appear in the file.</p>

<p>-F regexp In context and unified format, for each hunk
of differences, show some of the last preceding line that
matches regexp.</p>

<p>--forward-ed Make output that looks vaguely like an ed
script but has changes in the order they appear in the
file.</p>

<p>-h This option currently has no effect; it is present
for Unix com- patibility.</p>

<p>-H Use heuristics to speed handling of large files that
have numer- ous scattered small changes.</p>

<p>--horizon-lines=lines Do not discard the last lines
lines of the common prefix and the first lines lines of the
common suffix.</p>

<p>-i Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and
lower-case letters equivalent.</p>

<p>-I regexp Ignore changes that just insert or delete
lines that match reg- exp.</p>

<p>--ifdef=name Make merged if-then-else format output,
conditional on the pre- processor macro name.</p>

<p>--ignore-all-space Ignore white space when comparing
lines.</p>

<p>--ignore-blank-lines Ignore changes that just insert or
delete blank lines.</p>

<p>--ignore-case Ignore changes in case; consider upper-
and lower-case to be the same.</p>

<p>--ignore-matching-lines=regexp Ignore changes that just
insert or delete lines that match reg- exp.</p>

<p>--ignore-space-change Ignore changes in amount of white
space.</p>

<p>--initial-tab Output a tab rather than a space before
the text of a line in normal or context format. This causes
the alignment of tabs in the line to look normal.</p>

<p>-l Pass the output through pr to paginate it.</p>

<p>-L label --label=label Use label instead of the file
name in the context format and unified format headers.</p>

<p>--left-column Print only the left column of two common
lines in side by side format.</p>

<p>--line-format=format Use format to output all input
lines in in-then-else format.</p>

<p>--minimal Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller
set of changes. This makes diff slower (sometimes much
slower).</p>

<p>-n Output RCS-format diffs; like -f except that each
command speci- fies the number of lines affected.</p>

<p>-N --new-file In directory comparison, if a file is
found in only one direc- tory, treat it as present but empty
in the other directory.</p>

<p>--new-group-format=format Use format to output a group
of lines taken from just the second file in if-then-else
format.</p>

<p>--new-line-format=format Use format to output a line
taken from just the second file in if-then-else format.</p>

<p>--old-group-format=format Use format to output a group
of lines taken from just the first file in if-then-else
format.</p>

<p>--old-line-format=format Use format to output a line
taken from just the first file in if-then-else format.</p>

<p>-p Show which C function each change is in.</p>

<p>-P When comparing directories, if a file appears only in
the second directory of the two, treat it as present but
empty in the other.</p>

<p>--paginate Pass the output through pr to paginate
it.</p>

<p>-q Report only whether the files differ, not the details
of the differences.</p>

<p>-r When comparing directories, recursively compare any
subdirecto- ries found.</p>

<p>--rcs Output RCS-format diffs; like -f except that each
command speci- fies the number of lines affected.</p>

<p>--recursive When comparing directories, recursively
compare any subdirecto- ries found.</p>

<p>--report-identical-files -s Report when two files are
the same.</p>

<p>-S file When comparing directories, start with the file
file. This is used for resuming an aborted comparison.</p>

<p>--from-file=file Compare file to all operands. file can
be a directory.</p>

<p>--to-file=file Compare all operands to file. file can be
a directory.</p>

<p>--sdiff-merge-assist Print extra information to help
sdiff. sdiff uses this option when it runs diff. This option
is not intended for users to use directly.</p>

<p>--show-c-function Show which C function each change is
in.</p>

<p>--show-function-line=regexp In context and unified
format, for each hunk of differences, show some of the last
preceding line that matches regexp.</p>

<p>--side-by-side Use the side by side output format.</p>

<p>--speed-large-files Use heuristics to speed handling of
large files that have numer- ous scattered small
changes.</p>

<p>--starting-file=file When comparing directories, start
with the file file. This is used for resuming an aborted
comparison.</p>

<p>--suppress-common-lines Do not print common lines in
side by side format.</p>

<p>-t Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the
alignment of tabs in the input files.</p>

<p>-T Output a tab rather than a space before the text of a
line in normal or context format. This causes the alignment
of tabs in the line to look normal.</p>

<p>--text Treat all files as text and compare them
line-by-line, even if they do not appear to be text.</p>

<p>-u Use the unified output format.</p>

a file appears only in the second directory of the two,
treat it as present but empty in the other.</p>

<p>-U lines --unified[=lines] Use the unified output
format, showing lines (an integer) lines of context, or
three if lines is not given. For proper opera- tion, patch
typically needs at least two lines of context.</p>

<p>-w Ignore white space when comparing lines.</p>

<p>-W columns --width=columns Use an output width of
columns in side by side format.</p>
