<p>PERLDIAG(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLDIAG(1)</p>

<p>NAME perldiag - various Perl diagnostics</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These messages are classified as follows
(listed in increasing order of desperation):</p>

<p>(W) A warning (optional). (D) A deprecation (optional).
(S) A severe warning (default). (F) A fatal error
(trappable). (P) An internal error you should never see
(trappable). (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable). (A) An
alien error message (not generated by Perl).</p>

<p>The majority of messages from the first three
classifications above (W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using
the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma.</p>

<p>If a message can be controlled by the
&quot;warnings&quot; pragma, its warning category is
included with the classification letter in the description
below.</p>

<p>Optional warnings are enabled by using the
&quot;warnings&quot; pragma or the -w and -W switches.
Warnings may be captured by setting $SIG{__WARN__} to a
reference to a routine that will be called on each warning
instead of printing it. See perlvar.</p>

<p>Default warnings are always enabled unless they are
explicitly disabled with the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma or
the -X switch.</p>

<p>Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.
See &quot;eval&quot; in perlfunc. In almost all cases,
warnings may be selectively disabled or promoted to fatal
errors using the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma. See
warnings.</p>

<p>The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard
to upper or lower-case. Some of these messages are generic.
Spots that vary are denoted with a %s or other printf-style
escape. These escapes are ignored by the alphabetical order,
as are all characters other than letters. To look up your
message, just ignore anything that is not a letter.</p>

<p>accept() on closed socket %s (W closed) You tried to do
an accept on a closed socket. Did you forget to check the
return value of your socket() call? See &quot;accept&quot;
in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Allocation too large: %lx (X) You can t allocate more
than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</p>

<p>! allowed only after types %s (F) The ! is allowed in
pack() or unpack() only after certain types. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such
or use &amp; (W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared
has the same name as a Perl keyword, and you have used the
name without qualification for calling one or the other.
Perl decided to call the builtin because the subroutine is
not imported.</p>

<p>To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put
an amper- sand before the subroutine name, or qualify the
name with its pack- age. Alternatively, you can import the
subroutine (or pretend that its imported with the &quot;use
subs&quot; pragma).</p>

<p>To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the
&quot;CORE::&quot; prefix on the operator (e.g.
&quot;CORE::log($x)&quot;) or declare the sub- routine to be
an object method (see &quot;Subroutine Attributes&quot; in
perlsub or attributes).</p>

<p>Ambiguous range in transliteration operator (F) You
wrote something like &quot;tr/a-z-0//&quot; which doesnt
mean any- thing at all. To include a &quot;-&quot; character
in a transliteration, put it either first or last. (In the
past, &quot;tr/a-z-0//&quot; was synonymous with
&quot;tr/a-y//&quot;, which was probably not what you would
have expected.)</p>

<p>Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s (W ambiguous)(S) You
said something that may not be interpreted the way you
thought. Normally it s pretty easy to disambiguate it by
supplying a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or
declara- tion.</p>

<p>and &lt; may not both be specified on command line (F)
An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line
redi- rection, and found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you
also tried to redirect STDIN using &lt;. Only one STDIN
stream to a customer, please.</p>

<p>and &gt; may not both be specified on command line (F)
An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line
redi- rection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both
to a file and into a pipe to another command. You need to
choose one or the other, though nothings stopping you from
piping into a program or Perl script which splits output
into two streams, such as</p>

<p>open(OUT,&quot;&gt;$ARGV[0]&quot;) or die &quot;Can t
write to $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;; while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) { print;
print OUT; } close OUT;</p>

<p>Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s) (W misc) The
pattern match (&quot;//&quot;), substitution
(&quot;s///&quot;), and transliteration (&quot;tr///&quot;)
operators work on scalar values. If you apply one of them to
an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to a
scalar value -- the length of an array, or the popula- tion
info of a hash -- and then work on that scalar value. This
is probably not what you meant to do. See &quot;grep&quot;
in perlfunc and &quot;map&quot; in perlfunc for
alternatives.</p>

<p>Args must match #! line (F) The setuid emulator requires
that the arguments Perl was invoked with match the arguments
specified on the #! line. Since some systems impose a
one-argument limit on the #! line, try com- bining switches;
for example, turn &quot;-w -U&quot; into
&quot;-wU&quot;.</p>

<p>Arg too short for msgsnd (F) msgsnd() requires a string
at least as long as sizeof(long).</p>

<p>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element (F) The
argument to exists() must be a hash or array element, such
as:</p>

<p>$foo{$bar} $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]</p>

<p>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or slice (F)
The argument to delete() must be either a hash or array ele-
ment, such as:</p>

<p>$foo{$bar} $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]</p>

<p>or a hash or array slice, such as:</p>

<p>@foo[$bar, $baz, $xyzzy]
@{$ref-&gt;[12]}{&quot;susie&quot;, &quot;queue&quot;}</p>

<p>%s argument is not a subroutine name (F) The argument to
exists() for &quot;exists &amp;sub&quot; must be a
subroutine name, and not a subroutine call. &quot;exists
&amp;sub()&quot; will generate this error.</p>

<p>Argument &quot;%s&quot; isnt numeric%s (W numeric) The
indicated string was fed as an argument to an oper- ator
that expected a numeric value instead. If youre fortunate
the message will identify which operator was so
unfortunate.</p>

<p>Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer &quot;%s&quot;
(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl
I/O system you forgot the ) that closes the argument list.
(Layers take care of transforming data between external and
internal repre- sentations.) Perl stopped parsing the layer
list at this point and did not attempt to push this layer.
If your program didnt explic- itly request the failing
operation, it may be the result of the value of the
environment variable PERLIO.</p>

<p>Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s() (D
deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array
names in some spots. This is now heavily deprecated.</p>

<p>assertion botched: %s (P) The malloc package that comes
with Perl had an internal fail- ure.</p>

<p>Assertion failed: file &quot;%s&quot; (P) A general
assertion failed. The file in question must be exam-
ined.</p>

<p>Assignment to both a list and a scalar (F) If you assign
to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd argu- ments must
either both be scalars or both be lists. Otherwise Perl wont
know which context to supply to the right side.</p>

<p>A thread exited while %d threads were running (W
threads)(S) When using threaded Perl, a thread (not
necessarily the main thread) exited while there were still
other threads run- ning. Usually its a good idea to first
collect the return values of the created threads by joining
them, and only then exit from the main thread. See
threads.</p>

<p>Attempt to access disallowed key %s in a restricted hash
(F) The failing code has attempted to get or set a key which
is not in the current set of allowed keys of a restricted
hash.</p>

<p>Attempt to bless into a reference (F) The CLASSNAME
argument to the bless() operator is expected to be the name
of the package to bless the resulting object into. Youve
supplied instead a reference to something: perhaps you
wrote</p>

<p>bless $self, $proto;</p>

<p>when you intended</p>

<p>bless $self, ref($proto) $proto;</p>

<p>If you actually want to bless into the stringified
version of the reference supplied, you need to stringify it
yourself, for example by:</p>

<p>bless $self, &quot;$proto&quot;;</p>

<p>Attempt to delete disallowed key %s from a restricted
hash (F) The failing code attempted to delete from a
restricted hash a key which is not in its key set.</p>

<p>Attempt to delete readonly key %s from a restricted hash
(F) The failing code attempted to delete a key whose value
has been declared readonly from a restricted hash.</p>

<p>Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%lx (P internal) All SV
objects are supposed to be allocated from are- nas that will
be garbage collected on exit. An SV was discovered to be
outside any of those arenas.</p>

<p>Attempt to free nonexistent shared string (P internal)
Perl maintains a reference counted internal table of strings
to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other
strings. This indicates someone tried to decrement the
reference count of a string that can no longer be found in
the table.</p>

<p>Attempt to free temp prematurely (W debugging)
Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the
free_tmps() routine. This indicates that something else is
freeing the SV before the free_tmps() routine gets a chance,
which means that the free_tmps() routine will be freeing an
unreferenced scalar when it does try to free it.</p>

<p>Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers (P internal)
The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.</p>

<p>Attempt to free unreferenced scalar (W internal) Perl
went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to see if
it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to
0 earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably
was freed. This could indicate that SvREFCNT_dec() was
called too many times, or that SvREFCNT_inc() was called too
few times, or that the SV was mortalized when it shouldnt
have been, or that memory has been corrupted.</p>

<p>Attempt to join self (F) You tried to join a thread from
within itself, which is an impossible task. You may be
joining the wrong thread, or you may need to move the join()
to some other thread.</p>

<p>Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value (W pack) You
tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a
function, or a computed expression) to the &quot;p&quot;
pack() template. This means the result contains a pointer to
a location that could become invalid anytime, even before
the end of the current state- ment. Use literals or global
values as arguments to the &quot;p&quot; pack() template to
avoid this warning.</p>

<p>Attempt to set length of freed array (W) You tried to
set the length of an array which has been freed. You can do
this by storing a reference to the scalar representing the
last index of an array and later assigning through that
refer- ence. For example</p>

<p>$r = do {my @a; a}; $$r = 503</p>

<p>Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr (W substr)
You supplied a reference as the first argument to sub- str()
used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange. Perhaps you
forgot to dereference it first. See &quot;substr&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>Bad arg length for %s, is %d, should be %s (F) You
passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of msgctl(), sem-
ctl() or shmctl(). In C parlance, the correct sizes are,
respec- tively, sizeof(struct msqid_ds *), sizeof(struct
semid_ds *), and sizeof(struct shmid_ds *).</p>

<p>Bad evalled substitution pattern (F) You ve used the
&quot;/e&quot; switch to evaluate the replacement for a
substitution, but perl found a syntax error in the code to
evalu- ate, most likely an unexpected right brace }.</p>

<p>Bad filehandle: %s (F) A symbol was passed to something
wanting a filehandle, but the symbol has no filehandle
associated with it. Perhaps you didnt do an open(), or did
it in another package.</p>

<p>Bad free() ignored (S malloc) An internal routine called
free() on something that had never been malloc()ed in the
first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled by setting
environment variable &quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot; to 0.</p>

<p>This message can be seen quite often with DB_File on
systems with &quot;hard&quot; dynamic linking, like
&quot;AIX&quot; and &quot;OS/2&quot;. It is a bug of
&quot;Berkeley DB&quot; which is left unnoticed if
&quot;DB&quot; uses forgiving system malloc().</p>

<p>Bad hash (P) One of the internal hash routines was
passed a null HV pointer.</p>

<p>Bad index while coercing array into hash (F) The index
looked up in the hash found as the 0 th element of a
pseudo-hash is not legal. Index values must be at 1 or
greater. See perlref.</p>

<p>Badly placed ()s (A) Youve accidentally run your script
through csh instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually
feed your script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p>Bad name after %s:: (F) You started to name a symbol by
using a package prefix, and then didnt finish the symbol. In
particular, you cant interpo- late outside of quotes, so</p>

<p>$var = myvar; $sym = mypack::$var;</p>

<p>is not the same as</p>

<p>$var = myvar; $sym = &quot;mypack::$var&quot;;</p>

<p>Bad realloc() ignored (S malloc) An internal routine
called realloc() on something that had never been malloc()ed
in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled by
setting environment variable &quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot; to
1.</p>

<p>Bad symbol for array (P) An internal request asked to
add an array entry to something that wasnt a symbol table
entry.</p>

<p>Bad symbol for filehandle (P) An internal request asked
to add a filehandle entry to some- thing that wasnt a symbol
table entry.</p>

<p>Bad symbol for hash (P) An internal request asked to add
a hash entry to something that wasnt a symbol table
entry.</p>

<p>Bareword found in conditional (W bareword) The compiler
found a bareword where it expected a con- ditional, which
often indicates that an or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part of
the last argument of the previous construct, for
example:</p>

<p>open FOO die;</p>

<p>It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been
inter- preted as a bareword:</p>

<p>use constant TYPO =&gt; 1; if (TYOP) { print
&quot;foo&quot; }</p>

<p>The &quot;strict&quot; pragma is useful in avoiding such
errors.</p>

<p>Bareword &quot;%s&quot; not allowed while &quot;strict
subs&quot; in use (F) With &quot;strict subs&quot; in use, a
bareword is only allowed as a sub- routine identifier, in
curly brackets or to the left of the &quot;=&gt;&quot;
symbol. Perhaps you need to predeclare a subroutine?</p>

<p>Bareword &quot;%s&quot; refers to nonexistent package (W
bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form
&quot;Foo::&quot;, but the compiler saw no other uses of
that namespace before that point. Perhaps you need to
predeclare a package?</p>

<p>BEGIN failed--compilation aborted (F) An untrapped
exception was raised while executing a BEGIN sub- routine.
Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is
exited.</p>

<p>BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted (F)
Perl found a &quot;BEGIN {}&quot; subroutine (or a
&quot;use&quot; directive, which implies a &quot;BEGIN
{}&quot;) after one or more compilation errors had already
occurred. Since the intended environment for the &quot;BEGIN
{}&quot; could not be guaranteed (due to the errors), and
since subse- quent code likely depends on its correct
operation, Perl just gave up.</p>

<p>1 better written as $1 (W syntax) Outside of patterns,
backreferences live on as vari- ables. The use of
backslashes is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a
substitution, but stylistically its better to use the
variable form because other Perl programmers will expect it,
and it works better if there are more than 9
backreferences.</p>

<p>Binary number &gt; 0b11111111111111111111111111111111
non-portable (W portable) The binary number you specified is
larger than 2**32-1 (4294967295) and therefore non-portable
between systems. See perl- port for more on portability
concerns.</p>

<p>bind() on closed socket %s (W closed) You tried to do a
bind on a closed socket. Did you for- get to check the
return value of your socket() call? See &quot;bind&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>binmode() on closed filehandle %s (W unopened) You tried
binmode() on a filehandle that was never opened. Check you
control flow and number of arguments.</p>

<p>Bit vector size &gt; 32 non-portable (W portable) Using
bit vector sizes larger than 32 is non-portable.</p>

<p>Bizarre copy of %s in %s (P) Perl detected an attempt to
copy an internal value that is not copyable.</p>

<p>Buffer overflow in prime_env_iter: %s (W internal) A
warning peculiar to VMS. While Perl was preparing to iterate
over %ENV, it encountered a logical name or symbol
definition which was too long, so it was truncated to the
string shown.</p>

<p>Callback called exit (F) A subroutine invoked from an
external package via call_sv() exited by calling exit.</p>

<p>%s() called too early to check prototype (W prototype)
You ve called a function that has a prototype before the
parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl
could not check that the call conforms to the prototype. You
need to either add an early prototype declaration for the
subroutine in question, or move the subroutine definition
ahead of the call to get proper prototype checking.
Alternatively, if you are certain that youre calling the
function correctly, you may put an amper- sand before the
name to avoid the warning. See perlsub.</p>

<p>Cannot compress integer in pack (F) An argument to
pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was too large to compress. The BER
compressed integer format can only be used with positive
inte- gers, and you attempted to compress Infinity or a very
large number (&gt; 1e308). See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>Cannot compress negative numbers in pack (F) An argument
to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was negative. The BER compressed
integer format can only be used with positive integers. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Can only compress unsigned integers in pack (F) An
argument to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was not an integer. The
BER com- pressed integer format can only be used with
positive integers, and you attempted to compress something
else. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Cant bless non-reference value (F) Only hard references
may be blessed. This is how Perl &quot;enforces&quot;
encapsulation of objects. See perlobj.</p>

<p>Cant call method &quot;%s&quot; in empty package
&quot;%s&quot; (F) You called a method correctly, and it
correctly indicated a package functioning as a class, but
that package doesn t have ANY- THING defined in it, let
alone methods. See perlobj.</p>

<p>Cant call method &quot;%s&quot; on an undefined value
(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot
filled by the object reference or package name contains an
undefined value. Something like this will reproduce the
error:</p>

<p>$BADREF = undef; process $BADREF 1,2,3;
$BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);</p>

<p>Cant call method &quot;%s&quot; on unblessed reference
(F) A method call must know in what package its supposed to
run. It ordinarily finds this out from the object reference
you supply, but you didnt supply an object reference in this
case. A refer- ence isnt an object reference until it has
been blessed. See per- lobj.</p>

<p>Can t call method &quot;%s&quot; without a package or
object reference (F) You used the syntax of a method call,
but the slot filled by the object reference or package name
contains an expression that returns a defined value which is
neither an object reference nor a package name. Something
like this will reproduce the error:</p>

<p>$BADREF = 42; process $BADREF 1,2,3;
$BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);</p>

<p>Cant chdir to %s (F) You called &quot;perl
-x/foo/bar&quot;, but &quot;/foo/bar&quot; is not a
directory that you can chdir to, possibly because it doesnt
exist.</p>

<p>Cant check filesystem of script &quot;%s&quot; for
nosuid (P) For some reason you cant check the filesystem of
the script for nosuid.</p>

<p>Cant coerce array into hash (F) You used an array where
a hash was expected, but the array has no information on how
to map from keys to array indices. You can do that only with
arrays that have a hash reference at index 0.</p>

<p>Cant coerce %s to integer in %s (F) Certain types of
SVs, in particular real symbol table entries (typeglobs),
can t be forced to stop being what they are. So you cant say
things like:</p>

<p>*foo += 1;</p>

<p>You CAN say</p>

<p>$foo = *foo; $foo += 1;</p>

<p>but then $foo no longer contains a glob.</p>

<p>Cant coerce %s to number in %s (F) Certain types of SVs,
in particular real symbol table entries (typeglobs), can t
be forced to stop being what they are.</p>

<p>Cant coerce %s to string in %s (F) Certain types of SVs,
in particular real symbol table entries (typeglobs), can t
be forced to stop being what they are.</p>

<p>Cant create pipe mailbox (P) An error peculiar to VMS.
The process is suffering from exhausted quotas or other
plumbing problems.</p>

<p>Cant declare class for non-scalar %s in &quot;%s&quot;
(F) Currently, only scalar variables can be declared with a
spe- cific class qualifier in a &quot;my&quot; or
&quot;our&quot; declaration. The seman- tics may be extended
for other types of variables in future.</p>

<p>Cant declare %s in &quot;%s&quot; (F) Only scalar,
array, and hash variables may be declared as &quot;my&quot;
or &quot;our&quot; variables. They must have ordinary
identifiers as names.</p>

<p>Cant do inplace edit: %s is not a regular file (S
inplace) You tried to use the -i switch on a special file,
such as a file in /dev, or a FIFO. The file was ignored.</p>

<p>Cant do inplace edit on %s: %s (S inplace) The creation
of the new file failed for the indicated reason.</p>

<p>Cant do inplace edit without backup (F) Youre on a
system such as MS-DOS that gets confused if you try reading
from a deleted (but still opened) file. You have to say
&quot;-i.bak&quot;, or some such.</p>

<p>Cant do inplace edit: %s would not be unique (S inplace)
Your filesystem does not support filenames longer than 14
characters and Perl was unable to create a unique filename
dur- ing inplace editing with the -i switch. The file was
ignored.</p>

<p>Can t do {n,m} with n &gt; m in regex; marked by &lt;--
HERE in m/%s/ (F) Minima must be less than or equal to
maxima. If you really want your regexp to match something 0
times, just put {0}. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discov- ered. See
perlre.</p>

<p>Cant do setegid! (P) The setegid() call failed for some
reason in the setuid emula- tor of suidperl.</p>

<p>Cant do seteuid! (P) The setuid emulator of suidperl
failed for some reason.</p>

<p>Cant do setuid (F) This typically means that ordinary
perl tried to exec suidperl to do setuid emulation, but
couldnt exec it. It looks for a name of the form sperl5.000
in the same directory that the perl exe- cutable resides
under the name perl5.000, typically /usr/local/bin on Unix
machines. If the file is there, check the execute permis-
sions. If it isnt, ask your sysadmin why he and/or she
removed it.</p>

<p>Cant do waitpid with flags (F) This machine doesn t have
either waitpid() or wait4(), so only waitpid() without flags
is emulated.</p>

<p>Cant emulate -%s on #! line (F) The #! line specifies a
switch that doesn t make sense at this point. For example,
itd be kind of silly to put a -x on the #! line.</p>

<p>Cant exec &quot;%s&quot;: %s (W exec) A system(),
exec(), or piped open call could not execute the named
program for the indicated reason. Typical reasons include:
the permissions were wrong on the file, the file wasnt found
in $ENV{PATH}, the executable in question was compiled for
another architecture, or the #! line in a script points to
an interpreter that cant be run for similar reasons. (Or
maybe your system doesnt support #! at all.)</p>

<p>Cant exec %s (F) Perl was trying to execute the
indicated program for you because that s what the #! line
said. If thats not what you wanted, you may need to mention
&quot;perl&quot; on the #! line somewhere.</p>

<p>Cant execute %s (F) You used the -S switch, but the
copies of the script to execute found in the PATH did not
have correct permissions.</p>

<p>Cant find an opnumber for &quot;%s&quot; (F) A string of
a form &quot;CORE::word&quot; was given to prototype(), but
there is no builtin with the name &quot;word&quot;.</p>

<p>Cant find %s character property &quot;%s&quot; (F) You
used &quot;{}&quot; or &quot;P{}&quot; but the character
property by that name could not be found. Maybe you
misspelled the name of the prop- erty (remember that the
names of character properties consist only of alphanumeric
characters), or maybe you forgot the &quot;Is&quot; or
&quot;In&quot; prefix?</p>

<p>Cant find label %s (F) You said to goto a label that
isnt mentioned anywhere that its possible for us to go to.
See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Cant find %s on PATH (F) You used the -S switch, but the
script to execute could not be found in the PATH.</p>

<p>Cant find %s on PATH, . not in PATH (F) You used the -S
switch, but the script to execute could not be found in the
PATH, or at least not with the correct permissions. The
script exists in the current directory, but PATH prohibits
run- ning it.</p>

<p>Cant find %s property definition %s (F) You may have
tried to use &quot;&quot; which means a Unicode property
(for example &quot;{Lu}&quot; is all uppercase letters). If
you did mean to use a Unicode property, see perlunicode for
the list of known properties. If you didn t mean to use a
Unicode property, escape the &quot;&quot;, either by
&quot;\p&quot; (just the &quot;&quot;) or by &quot;Q&quot;
(the rest of the string, until possible &quot;</p>

<p>Cant find string terminator %s anywhere before EOF (F)
Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines. This message
means that the closing delimiter was omitted. Because
bracketed quotes count nesting levels, the following is
missing its final parenthesis:</p>

<p>print q(The character ( starts a side comment.);</p>

<p>If youre getting this error from a here-document, you
may have included unseen whitespace before or after your
closing tag. A good programmer s editor will have a way to
help you find these charac- ters.</p>

<p>Cant fork (F) A fatal error occurred while trying to
fork while opening a pipeline.</p>

<p>Cant get filespec - stale stat buffer? (S) A warning
peculiar to VMS. This arises because of the differ- ence
between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model
Perl assumes. Under VMS, access checks are done by filename,
rather than by bits in the stat buffer, so that ACLs and
other protections can be taken into account. Unfortunately,
Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all the necessary
information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to the
access checking routine. It will try to retrieve the
filespec using the device name and FID present in the stat
buffer, but this works only if you havent made a sub-
sequent call to the CRTL stat() routine, because the device
name is overwritten with each call. If this warning appears,
the name lookup failed, and the access checking routine gave
up and returned FALSE, just to be conservative. (Note: The
access checking routine knows about the Perl
&quot;stat&quot; operator and file tests, so you shouldn t
ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it
arises only if some internal code takes stat buffers
lightly.)</p>

<p>Cant get pipe mailbox device name (P) An error peculiar
to VMS. After creating a mailbox to act as a pipe, Perl cant
retrieve its name for later use.</p>

<p>Cant get SYSGEN parameter value for MAXBUF (P) An error
peculiar to VMS. Perl asked $GETSYI how big you want your
mailbox buffers to be, and didnt get an answer.</p>

<p>Cant &quot;goto&quot; into the middle of a foreach loop
(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump into
the middle of a foreach loop. You cant get there from here.
See &quot;goto&quot; in perl- func.</p>

<p>Cant &quot;goto&quot; out of a pseudo block (F) A
&quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump out of what
might look like a block, except that it isn t a proper
block. This usually occurs if you tried to jump out of a
sort() block or subroutine, which is a no-no. See
&quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Cant goto subroutine from an eval-%s (F) The &quot;goto
subroutine&quot; call cant be used to jump out of an eval
&quot;string&quot; or block.</p>

<p>Cant goto subroutine outside a subroutine (F) The deeply
magical &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can only replace
one subroutine call for another. It cant manufacture one out
of whole cloth. In general you should be calling it out of
only an AUTOLOAD routine anyway. See &quot;goto&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>Cant ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default (W signal)
Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD
signal (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled. Since disabling
this signal will interfere with proper determination of exit
status of child processes, Perl has reset the signal to its
default value. This situation typically indicates that the
parent program under which Perl may be running (e.g. cron)
is being very careless.</p>

<p>Cant &quot;last&quot; outside a loop block (F) A
&quot;last&quot; statement was executed to break out of the
current block, except that there s this itty bitty problem
called there isnt a current block. Note that an
&quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesnt count as a
&quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesnt a block given to
sort(), map() or grep(). You can usually double the curlies
to get the same effect though, because the inner curlies
will be considered a block that loops once. See
&quot;last&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Cant load %s for module %s (F) The module you tried to
load failed to load a dynamic exten- sion. This may either
mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one that is
incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is
known to happen between major versions of perl), or (more
likely) that your dynamic extension was built against an
older ver- sion of the library that is installed on your
system. You may need to rebuild your old dynamic
extensions.</p>

<p>Cant localize lexical variable %s (F) You used local on
a variable name that was previously declared as a lexical
variable using &quot;my&quot;. This is not allowed. If you
want to localize a package variable of the same name,
qualify it with the package name.</p>

<p>Cant localize pseudo-hash element (F) You said something
like &quot;local $ar-&gt;{&rsquo;key&rsquo;}&quot;, where
$ar is a reference to a pseudo-hash. That hasn t been
implemented yet, but you can get a similar effect by
localizing the corresponding array element directly --
&quot;local
$ar-&gt;[$ar-&gt;[0]{&rsquo;key&rsquo;}]&quot;.</p>

<p>Cant localize through a reference (F) You said something
like &quot;local $$ref&quot;, which Perl cant cur- rently
handle, because when it goes to restore the old value of
whatever $ref pointed to after the scope of the local() is
fin- ished, it can t be sure that $ref will still be a
reference.</p>

<p>Cant locate %s (F) You said to &quot;do&quot; (or
&quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot;) a file that couldnt
be found. Perl looks for the file in all the locations
mentioned in @INC, unless the file name included the full
path to the file. Perhaps you need to set the PERL5LIB or
PERL5OPT environment vari- able to say where the extra
library is, or maybe the script needs to add the library
name to @INC. Or maybe you just misspelled the name of the
file. See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc and lib.</p>

<p>Cant locate auto/%s.al in @INC (F) A function (or
method) was called in a package which allows autoload, but
there is no function to autoload. Most probable causes are a
misprint in a function/method name or a failure to
&quot;AutoSplit&quot; the file, say, by doing &quot;make
install&quot;.</p>

<p>Cant locate loadable object for module %s in @INC (F)
The module you loaded is trying to load an external library,
like for example, &quot;foo.so&quot; or &quot;bar.dll&quot;,
but the DynaLoader module was unable to locate this library.
See DynaLoader.</p>

<p>Cant locate object method &quot;%s&quot; via package
&quot;%s&quot; (F) You called a method correctly, and it
correctly indicated a package functioning as a class, but
that package doesn t define that particular method, nor does
any of its base classes. See per- lobj.</p>

<p>Cant locate package %s for @%s::ISA (W syntax) The @ISA
array contained the name of another package that doesnt seem
to exist.</p>

<p>Cant locate PerlIO%s (F) You tried to use in open() a
PerlIO layer that does not exist, e.g. open(FH,
&quot;&gt;:nosuchlayer&quot;, &quot;somefile&quot;).</p>

<p>Cant make list assignment to ENV on this system (F) List
assignment to %ENV is not supported on some systems, notably
VMS.</p>

<p>Cant modify %s in %s (F) You arent allowed to assign to
the item indicated, or other- wise try to change it, such as
with an auto-increment.</p>

<p>Cant modify nonexistent substring (P) The internal
routine that does assignment to a substr() was handed a
NULL.</p>

<p>Cant modify non-lvalue subroutine call (F) Subroutines
meant to be used in lvalue context should be declared as
such, see &quot;Lvalue subroutines&quot; in perlsub.</p>

<p>Cant msgrcv to read-only var (F) The target of a msgrcv
must be modifiable to be used as a receive buffer.</p>

<p>Cant &quot;next&quot; outside a loop block (F) A
&quot;next&quot; statement was executed to reiterate the
current block, but there isnt a current block. Note that an
&quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesnt count as a
&quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesnt a block given to
sort(), map() or grep(). You can usually double the curlies
to get the same effect though, because the inner curlies
will be consid- ered a block that loops once. See
&quot;next&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Cant open %s: %s (S inplace) The implicit opening of a
file through use of the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; filehandle,
either implicitly under the &quot;-n&quot; or &quot;-p&quot;
command-line switches, or explicitly, failed for the
indicated reason. Usually this is because you dont have read
permission for a file which you named on the command
line.</p>

<p>Cant open a reference (W io) You tried to open a scalar
reference for reading or writing, using the 3-arg open()
syntax :</p>

<p>open FH, &gt;, $ref;</p>

<p>but your version of perl is compiled without perlio, and
this form of open is not supported.</p>

<p>Cant open bidirectional pipe (W pipe) You tried to say
&quot;open(CMD, &quot;cmd&quot;)&quot;, which is not sup-
ported. You can try any of several modules in the Perl
library to do this, such as IPC::Open2. Alternately, direct
the pipes output to a file using &quot;&gt;&quot;, and then
read it in under a different file handle.</p>

<p>Cant open error file %s as stderr (F) An error peculiar
to VMS. Perl does its own command line redi- rection, and
couldnt open the file specified after 2&gt; or 2&gt;&gt; on
the command line for writing.</p>

<p>Cant open input file %s as stdin (F) An error peculiar
to VMS. Perl does its own command line redi- rection, and
couldnt open the file specified after &lt; on the com- mand
line for reading.</p>

<p>Cant open output file %s as stdout (F) An error peculiar
to VMS. Perl does its own command line redi- rection, and
couldnt open the file specified after &gt; or &gt;&gt; on
the command line for writing.</p>

<p>Cant open output pipe (name: %s) (P) An error peculiar
to VMS. Perl does its own command line redi- rection, and
couldnt open the pipe into which to send data des- tined for
stdout.</p>

<p>Cant open perl script%s (F) The script you specified
cant be opened for the indicated rea- son.</p>

<p>If youre debugging a script that uses #!, and normally
relies on the shells $PATH search, the -S option causes perl
to do that search, so you dont have to type the path or
&lsquo;which $scriptname&lsquo;.</p>

<p>Cant read CRTL environ (S) A warning peculiar to VMS.
Perl tried to read an element of %ENV from the CRTL s
internal environment array and discovered the array was
missing. You need to figure out where your CRTL mis- placed
its environ or define PERL_ENV_TABLES (see perlvms) so that
environ is not searched.</p>

<p>Cant redefine active sort subroutine %s (F) Perl
optimizes the internal handling of sort subroutines and
keeps pointers into them. You tried to redefine one such
sort sub- routine when it was currently active, which is not
allowed. If you really want to do this, you should write
&quot;sort { &amp;func } @x&quot; instead of &quot;sort func
@x&quot;.</p>

<p>Cant &quot;redo&quot; outside a loop block (F) A
&quot;redo&quot; statement was executed to restart the
current block, but there isnt a current block. Note that an
&quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesnt count as a
&quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesnt a block given to
sort(), map() or grep(). You can usually double the curlies
to get the same effect though, because the inner curlies
will be consid- ered a block that loops once. See
&quot;redo&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Cant remove %s: %s, skipping file (S inplace) You
requested an inplace edit without creating a backup file.
Perl was unable to remove the original file to replace it
with the modified file. The file was left unmodified.</p>

<p>Cant rename %s to %s: %s, skipping file (S inplace) The
rename done by the -i switch failed for some rea- son,
probably because you dont have write permission to the
direc- tory.</p>

<p>Cant reopen input pipe (name: %s) in binary mode (P) An
error peculiar to VMS. Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and
tried to reopen it to accept binary data. Alas, it
failed.</p>

<p>Cant resolve method %s overloading %s in package %s (FP)
Error resolving overloading specified by a method name (as
opposed to a subroutine reference): no such method callable
via the package. If method name is &quot;???&quot;, this is
an internal error.</p>

<p>Cant reswap uid and euid (P) The setreuid() call failed
for some reason in the setuid emula- tor of suidperl.</p>

<p>Cant return %s from lvalue subroutine (F) Perl detected
an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such as temporary or
readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue. This
is not allowed.</p>

<p>Cant return outside a subroutine (F) The return
statement was executed in mainline code, that is, where
there was no subroutine call to return out of. See
perlsub.</p>

<p>Cant return %s to lvalue scalar context (F) You tried to
return a complete array or hash from an lvalue subroutine,
but you called the subroutine in a way that made Perl think
you meant to return only one value. You probably meant to
write parentheses around the call to the subroutine, which
tell Perl that the call should be in list context.</p>

<p>Cant stat script &quot;%s&quot; (P) For some reason you
cant fstat() the script even though you have it open
already. Bizarre.</p>

<p>Cant swap uid and euid (P) The setreuid() call failed
for some reason in the setuid emula- tor of suidperl.</p>

<p>Cant take log of %g (F) For ordinary real numbers, you
cant take the logarithm of a negative number or zero. There
s a Math::Complex package that comes standard with Perl,
though, if you really want to do that for the negative
numbers.</p>

<p>Cant take sqrt of %g (F) For ordinary real numbers, you
can t take the square root of a negative number. Theres a
Math::Complex package that comes stan- dard with Perl,
though, if you really want to do that.</p>

<p>Cant undef active subroutine (F) You can t undefine a
routine thats currently running. You can, however, redefine
it while its running, and you can even undef the redefined
subroutine while the old routine is running. Go figure.</p>

<p>Cant unshift (F) You tried to unshift an
&quot;unreal&quot; array that can t be unshifted, such as
the main Perl stack.</p>

<p>Cant upgrade that kind of scalar (P) The internal
sv_upgrade routine adds &quot;members&quot; to an SV, making
it into a more specialized kind of SV. The top several SV
types are so specialized, however, that they cannot be
interconverted. This message indicates that such a
conversion was attempted.</p>

<p>Cant upgrade to undef (P) The undefined SV is the bottom
of the totem pole, in the scheme of upgradability. Upgrading
to undef indicates an error in the code calling
sv_upgrade.</p>

<p>Cant use anonymous symbol table for method lookup (F)
The internal routine that does method lookup was handed a
sym- bol table that doesnt have a name. Symbol tables can
become anonymous for example by undefining stashes:
&quot;undef %Some::Pack- age::&quot;.</p>

<p>Cant use an undefined value as %s reference (F) A value
used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must
be a defined value. This helps to delurk some insidious
errors.</p>

<p>Cant use bareword (&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while
&quot;strict refs&quot; in use (F) Only hard references are
allowed by &quot;strict refs&quot;. Symbolic references are
disallowed. See perlref.</p>

<p>Cant use %! because Errno.pm is not available (F) The
first time the %! hash is used, perl automatically loads the
Errno.pm module. The Errno module is expected to tie the %!
hash to provide symbolic names for $! errno values.</p>

<p>Cant use %s for loop variable (F) Only a simple scalar
variable may be used as a loop variable on a foreach.</p>

<p>Cant use global %s in &quot;my&quot; (F) You tried to
declare a magical variable as a lexical variable. This is
not allowed, because the magic can be tied to only one
location (namely the global variable) and it would be
incredibly confusing to have variables in your program that
looked like magi- cal variables but werent.</p>

<p>Cant use &quot;my %s&quot; in sort comparison (F) The
global variables $a and $b are reserved for sort compar-
isons. You mentioned $a or $b in the same line as the
&lt;=&gt; or cmp operator, and the variable had earlier been
declared as a lexical variable. Either qualify the sort
variable with the package name, or rename the lexical
variable.</p>

<p>Cant use %s ref as %s ref (F) Youve mixed up your
reference types. You have to dereference a reference of the
type needed. You can use the ref() function to test the type
of the reference, if need be.</p>

<p>Can t use string (&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while
&quot;strict refs&quot; in use (F) Only hard references are
allowed by &quot;strict refs&quot;. Symbolic references are
disallowed. See perlref.</p>

<p>Cant use subscript on %s (F) The compiler tried to
interpret a bracketed expression as a subscript. But to the
left of the brackets was an expression that didnt look like
a hash or array reference, or anything else sub-
scriptable.</p>

<p>Cant use c to mean $%c in expression (W syntax) In an
ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that
creates a reference to its argument. The use of backslash to
indicate a backreference to a matched substring is valid
only as part of a regular expression pattern. Trying to do
this in ordi- nary Perl code produces a value that prints
out looking like SCALAR(0xdecaf). Use the $1 form
instead.</p>

<p>Cant weaken a nonreference (F) You attempted to weaken
something that was not a reference. Only references can be
weakened.</p>

<p>Cant x= to read-only value (F) You tried to repeat a
constant value (often the undefined value) with an
assignment operator, which implies modifying the value
itself. Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary,
and repeat that.</p>

<p>Character in &quot;C&quot; format wrapped in pack (W
pack) You said</p>

<p>pack(&quot;C&quot;, $x)</p>

<p>where $x is either less than 0 or more than 255; the
&quot;C&quot; format is only for encoding native operating
system characters (ASCII, EBCDIC, and so on) and not for
Unicode characters, so Perl behaved as if you meant</p>

<p>pack(&quot;C&quot;, $x &amp; 255)</p>

<p>If you actually want to pack Unicode codepoints, use the
&quot;U&quot; format instead.</p>

<p>Character in &quot;c&quot; format wrapped in pack (W
pack) You said</p>

<p>pack(&quot;c&quot;, $x)</p>

<p>where $x is either less than -128 or more than 127; the
&quot;c&quot; format is only for encoding native operating
system characters (ASCII, EBCDIC, and so on) and not for
Unicode characters, so Perl behaved as if you meant</p>

<p>pack(&quot;c&quot;, $x &amp; 255);</p>

<p>If you actually want to pack Unicode codepoints, use the
&quot;U&quot; format instead.</p>

<p>close() on unopened filehandle %s (W unopened) You tried
to close a filehandle that was never opened.</p>

<p>Code missing after / (F) You had a (sub-)template that
ends with a /. There must be another template code following
the slash. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>%s: Command not found (A) Youve accidentally run your
script through csh instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or
manually feed your script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p>Compilation failed in require (F) Perl could not compile
a file specified in a &quot;require&quot; state- ment. Perl
uses this generic message when none of the errors that it
encountered were severe enough to halt compilation
immediately.</p>

<p>Complex regular subexpression recursion limit (%d)
exceeded (W regexp) The regular expression engine uses
recursion in complex situations where back-tracking is
required. Recursion depth is limited to 32766, or perhaps
less in architectures where the stack cannot grow
arbitrarily. (&quot;Simple&quot; and &quot;medium&quot;
situations are handled without recursion and are not subject
to a limit.) Try shortening the string under examination;
looping in Perl code (e.g. with &quot;while&quot;) rather
than in the regular expression engine; or rewriting the
regular expression so that it is simpler or back- tracks
less. (See perlfaq2 for information on Mastering Regular
Expressions.)</p>

<p>cond_broadcast() called on unlocked variable (W threads)
Within a thread-enabled program, you tried to call
cond_broadcast() on a variable which wasnt locked. The
cond_broad- cast() function is used to wake up another
thread that is waiting in a cond_wait(). To ensure that the
signal isnt sent before the other thread has a chance to
enter the wait, it is usual for the signaling thread to
first wait for a lock on variable. This lock attempt will
only succeed after the other thread has entered cond_wait()
and thus relinquished the lock.</p>

<p>cond_signal() called on unlocked variable (W threads)
Within a thread-enabled program, you tried to call
cond_signal() on a variable which wasnt locked. The
cond_signal() function is used to wake up another thread
that is waiting in a cond_wait(). To ensure that the signal
isnt sent before the other thread has a chance to enter the
wait, it is usual for the signal- ing thread to first wait
for a lock on variable. This lock attempt will only succeed
after the other thread has entered cond_wait() and thus
relinquished the lock.</p>

<p>connect() on closed socket %s (W closed) You tried to do
a connect on a closed socket. Did you forget to check the
return value of your socket() call? See &quot;con-
nect&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Constant(%s)%s: %s (F) The parser found inconsistencies
either while attempting to define an overloaded constant, or
when trying to find the character name specified in the
&quot;.}&quot; escape. Perhaps you forgot to load the
corresponding &quot;overload&quot; or &quot;charnames&quot;
pragma? See charnames and overload.</p>

<p>Constant is not %s reference (F) A constant value
(perhaps declared using the &quot;use constant&quot; pragma)
is being dereferenced, but it amounts to the wrong type of
reference. The message indicates the type of reference that
was expected. This usually indicates a syntax error in
dereferencing the constant value. See &quot;Constant
Functions&quot; in perlsub and con- stant.</p>

<p>Constant subroutine %s redefined (S) You redefined a
subroutine which had previously been eligible for inlining.
See &quot;Constant Functions&quot; in perlsub for commentary
and workarounds.</p>

<p>Constant subroutine %s undefined (W misc) You undefined
a subroutine which had previously been eli- gible for
inlining. See &quot;Constant Functions&quot; in perlsub for
com- mentary and workarounds.</p>

<p>Copy method did not return a reference (F) The method
which overloads &quot;=&quot; is buggy. See &quot;Copy
Constructor&quot; in overload.</p>

<p>CORE::%s is not a keyword (F) The CORE:: namespace is
reserved for Perl keywords.</p>

<p>corrupted regexp pointers (P) The regular expression
engine got confused by what the regular expression compiler
gave it.</p>

<p>corrupted regexp program (P) The regular expression
engine got passed a regexp program with- out a valid magic
number.</p>

<p>Corrupt malloc ptr 0x%lx at 0x%lx (P) The malloc package
that comes with Perl had an internal fail- ure.</p>

<p>Count after length/code in unpack (F) You had an unpack
template indicating a counted-length string, but you have
also specified an explicit size for the string. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Deep recursion on subroutine &quot;%s&quot; (W
recursion) This subroutine has called itself (directly or
indi- rectly) 100 times more than it has returned. This
probably indi- cates an infinite recursion, unless youre
writing strange bench- mark programs, in which case it
indicates something else.</p>

<p>defined(@array) is deprecated (D deprecated) defined()
is not usually useful on arrays because it checks for an
undefined scalar value. If you want to see if the array is
empty, just use &quot;if (@array) { # not empty }&quot; for
example.</p>

<p>defined(%hash) is deprecated (D deprecated) defined() is
not usually useful on hashes because it checks for an
undefined scalar value. If you want to see if the hash is
empty, just use &quot;if (%hash) { # not empty }&quot; for
example.</p>

<p>%s defines neither package nor VERSION--version check
failed (F) You said something like &quot;use Module 42&quot;
but in the Module file there are neither package
declarations nor a $VERSION.</p>

<p>Delimiter for here document is too long (F) In a here
document construct like &quot;&lt;&lt;FOO&quot;, the label
&quot;FOO&quot; is too long for Perl to handle. You have to
be seriously twisted to write code that triggers this
error.</p>

<p>DESTROY created new reference to dead object %s (F) A
DESTROY() method created a new reference to the object which
is just being DESTROYed. Perl is confused, and prefers to
abort rather than to create a dangling reference.</p>

<p>Did not produce a valid header See Server error.</p>

<p>%s did not return a true value (F) A required (or used)
file must return a true value to indicate that it compiled
correctly and ran its initialization code cor- rectly. Its
traditional to end such a file with a &quot;1;&quot;, though
any true value would do. See &quot;require&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>(Did you mean &amp;%s instead?) (W) You probably
referred to an imported subroutine &amp;FOO as $FOO or some
such.</p>

<p>(Did you mean &quot;local&quot; instead of
&quot;our&quot;?) (W misc) Remember that &quot;our&quot;
does not localize the declared global variable. You have
declared it again in the same lexical scope, which seems
superfluous.</p>

<p>(Did you mean $ or @ instead of %?) (W) You probably
said %hash{$key} when you meant $hash{$key} or @hash{@keys}.
On the other hand, maybe you just meant %hash and got
carried away.</p>

<p>Died (F) You passed die() an empty string (the
equivalent of &quot;die &quot;&quot;&quot;) or you called it
with no args and both $@ and $_ were empty.</p>

<p>Document contains no data See Server error.</p>

<p>%s does not define %s::VERSION--version check failed (F)
You said something like &quot;use Module 42&quot; but the
Module did not define a &quot;$VERSION.&quot;</p>

<p>/ does not take a repeat count (F) You cannot put a
repeat count of any kind right after the / code. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Dont know how to handle magic of type %s (P) The
internal handling of magical variables has been cursed.</p>

<p>do_study: out of memory (P) This should have been caught
by safemalloc() instead.</p>

<p>(Do you need to predeclare %s?) (S syntax) This is an
educated guess made in conjunction with the message &quot;%s
found where operator expected&quot;. It often means a sub-
routine or module name is being referenced that hasn t been
declared yet. This may be because of ordering problems in
your file, or because of a missing &quot;sub&quot;,
&quot;package&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot;
statement. If youre referencing something that isnt defined
yet, you dont actually have to define the subroutine or
package before the current location. You can use an empty
&quot;sub foo;&quot; or &quot;package FOO;&quot; to enter a
&quot;forward&quot; declaration.</p>

<p>dump() better written as CORE::dump() (W misc) You used
the obsolescent &quot;dump()&quot; built-in function, with-
out fully qualifying it as &quot;CORE::dump()&quot;. Maybe
its a typo. See &quot;dump&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Duplicate free() ignored (S malloc) An internal routine
called free() on something that had already been freed.</p>

<p>Duplicate modifier %c after %c in %s (W) You have
applied the same modifier more than once after a type in a
pack template. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>elseif should be elsif (S syntax) There is no keyword
&quot;elseif&quot; in Perl because Larry thinks it s ugly.
Your code will be interpreted as an attempt to call a method
named &quot;elseif&quot; for the class returned by the
follow- ing block. This is unlikely to be what you want.</p>

<p>Empty %s (F) &quot;&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are used to
introduce a named Unicode property, as described in
perlunicode and perlre. You used &quot;&quot; or
&quot;P&quot; in a regular expression without specifying the
property name.</p>

<p>entering effective %s failed (F) While under the
&quot;use filetest&quot; pragma, switching the real and
effective uids or gids failed.</p>

<p>%ENV is aliased to %s (F) You re running under taint
mode, and the %ENV variable has been aliased to another
hash, so it doesnt reflect anymore the state of the program
s environment. This is potentially insecure.</p>

<p>Error converting file specification %s (F) An error
peculiar to VMS. Because Perl may have to deal with file
specifications in either VMS or Unix syntax, it converts
them to a single form when it must operate on them directly.
Either youve passed an invalid file specification to Perl,
or youve found a case the conversion routines don t handle.
Drat.</p>

<p>%s: Eval-group in insecure regular expression (F) Perl
detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular
expression that contains the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot;
zero-width assertion, which is unsafe. See &quot;(?{ code
})&quot; in perlre, and perlsec.</p>

<p>%s: Eval-group not allowed at run time (F) Perl tried to
compile a regular expression containing the &quot;(?{ ...
})&quot; zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when
the pat- tern contains interpolated values. Since that is a
security risk, it is not allowed. If you insist, you may
still do this by explic- itly building the pattern from an
interpolated string at run time and using that in an eval().
See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p>%s: Eval-group not allowed, use re eval (F) A regular
expression contained the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot; zero-width
assertion, but that construct is only allowed when the
&quot;use re &rsquo;eval&rsquo;&quot; pragma is in effect.
See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p>Excessively long &lt;&gt; operator (F) The contents of a
&lt;&gt; operator may not exceed the maximum size of a Perl
identifier. If youre just trying to glob a long list of
filenames, try using the glob() operator, or put the
filenames into a variable and glob that.</p>

<p>exec? Im not *that* kind of operating system (F) The
&quot;exec&quot; function is not implemented in MacPerl. See
perl- port.</p>

<p>Execution of %s aborted due to compilation errors (F)
The final summary message when a Perl compilation fails.</p>

<p>Exiting eval via %s (W exiting) You are exiting an eval
by unconventional means, such as a goto, or a loop control
statement.</p>

<p>Exiting format via %s (W exiting) You are exiting a
format by unconventional means, such as a goto, or a loop
control statement.</p>

<p>Exiting pseudo-block via %s (W exiting) You are exiting
a rather special block construct (like a sort block or
subroutine) by unconventional means, such as a goto, or a
loop control statement. See &quot;sort&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>Exiting subroutine via %s (W exiting) You are exiting a
subroutine by unconventional means, such as a goto, or a
loop control statement.</p>

<p>Exiting substitution via %s (W exiting) You are exiting
a substitution by unconventional means, such as a return, a
goto, or a loop control statement.</p>

<p>Explicit blessing to (assuming package main) (W misc)
You are blessing a reference to a zero length string. This
has the effect of blessing the reference into the package
main. This is usually not what you want. Consider providing
a default target package, e.g. bless($ref, $p MyPackage
);</p>

<p>%s: Expression syntax (A) Youve accidentally run your
script through csh instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or
manually feed your script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p>%s failed--call queue aborted (F) An untrapped exception
was raised while executing a CHECK, INIT, or END subroutine.
Processing of the remainder of the queue of such routines
has been prematurely ended.</p>

<p>False [] range &quot;%s&quot; in regex; marked by &lt;--
HERE in m/%s/ (W regexp) A character class range must start
and end at a literal character, not another character class
like &quot;&quot; or &quot;[:alpha:]&quot;. The
&quot;-&quot; in your false range is interpreted as a
literal &quot;-&quot;. Con- sider quoting the &quot;-&quot;,
&quot;&minus;&quot;. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered. See
perlre.</p>

<p>Fatal VMS error at %s, line %d (P) An error peculiar to
VMS. Something untoward happened in a VMS system service or
RTL routine; Perl s exit status should provide more details.
The filename in &quot;at %s&quot; and the line number in
&quot;line %d&quot; tell you which section of the Perl
source code is distressed.</p>

<p>fcntl is not implemented (F) Your machine apparently
doesnt implement fcntl(). What is this, a PDP-11 or
something?</p>

<p>Filehandle %s opened only for input (W io) You tried to
write on a read-only filehandle. If you intended it to be a
read-write filehandle, you needed to open it with
&quot;+&lt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&quot; or
&quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with &quot;&lt;&quot; or
nothing. If you intended only to write the file, use
&quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;. See
&quot;open&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Filehandle %s opened only for output (W io) You tried to
read from a filehandle opened only for writing, If you
intended it to be a read/write filehandle, you needed to
open it with &quot;+&lt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&quot; or
&quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with &quot;&lt;&quot; or
nothing. If you intended only to read from the file, use
&quot;&lt;&quot;. See &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc. Another
possibility is that you attempted to open filedescriptor 0
(also known as STDIN) for output (maybe you closed STDIN
earlier?).</p>

<p>Filehandle %s reopened as %s only for input (W io) You
opened for reading a filehandle that got the same file-
handle id as STDOUT or STDERR. This occurred because you
closed STDOUT or STDERR previously.</p>

<p>Filehandle STDIN reopened as %s only for output (W io)
You opened for writing a filehandle that got the same file-
handle id as STDIN. This occurred because you closed STDIN
previ- ously.</p>

<p>Final $ should be or $name (F) You must now decide
whether the final $ in a string was meant to be a literal
dollar sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name that
happens to be missing. So you have to put either the
backslash or the name.</p>

<p>flock() on closed filehandle %s (W closed) The
filehandle youre attempting to flock() got itself closed
some time before now. Check your control flow. flock()
operates on filehandles. Are you attempting to call flock()
on a dirhandle by the same name?</p>

<p>Format not terminated (F) A format must be terminated by
a line with a solitary dot. Perl got to the end of your file
without finding such a line.</p>

<p>Format %s redefined (W redefine) You redefined a format.
To suppress this warning, say</p>

<p>{ no warnings redefine; eval &quot;format NAME
=...&quot;; }</p>

<p>Found = in conditional, should be == (W syntax) You
said</p>

<p>if ($foo = 123)</p>

<p>when you meant</p>

<p>if ($foo == 123)</p>

<p>(or something like that).</p>

<p>%s found where operator expected (S syntax) The Perl
lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator. If it
sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see
an operator, it gives you this warning. Usually it indicates
that an operator or delimiter was omitted, such as a
semicolon.</p>

<p>gdbm store returned %d, errno %d, key &quot;%s&quot; (S)
A warning from the GDBM_File extension that a store
failed.</p>

<p>gethostent not implemented (F) Your C library apparently
doesn t implement gethostent(), prob- ably because if it
did, itd feel morally obligated to return every hostname on
the Internet.</p>

<p>get%sname() on closed socket %s (W closed) You tried to
get a socket or peer socket name on a closed socket. Did you
forget to check the return value of your socket() call?</p>

<p>getpwnam returned invalid UIC %#o for user
&quot;%s&quot; (S) A warning peculiar to VMS. The call to
&quot;sys$getuai&quot; underlying the &quot;getpwnam&quot;
operator returned an invalid UIC.</p>

<p>getsockopt() on closed socket %s (W closed) You tried to
get a socket option on a closed socket. Did you forget to
check the return value of your socket() call? See
&quot;getsockopt&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Global symbol &quot;%s&quot; requires explicit package
name (F) Youve said &quot;use strict vars&quot;, which
indicates that all vari- ables must either be lexically
scoped (using &quot;my&quot;), declared beforehand using
&quot;our&quot;, or explicitly qualified to say which pack-
age the global variable is in (using &quot;::&quot;).</p>

<p>glob failed (%s) (W glob) Something went wrong with the
external program(s) used for &quot;glob&quot; and
&quot;&lt;*.c&gt;&quot;. Usually, this means that you
supplied a &quot;glob&quot; pattern that caused the external
program to fail and exit with a nonzero status. If the
message indicates that the abnormal exit resulted in a
coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell) is
broken. If so, you should change all of the csh-related
vari- ables in config.sh: If you have tcsh, make the
variables refer to it as if it were csh (e.g.
&quot;full_csh=&rsquo;/usr/bin/tcsh&rsquo;&quot;);
otherwise, make them all empty (except that
&quot;d_csh&quot; should be &rsquo;undef&rsquo;) so that
Perl will think csh is missing. In either case, after
editing con- fig.sh, run &quot;./Configure -S&quot; and
rebuild Perl.</p>

<p>Glob not terminated (F) The lexer saw a left angle
bracket in a place where it was expecting a term, so its
looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and not
finding it. Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a &quot;less
than&quot;.</p>

<p>Got an error from DosAllocMem (P) An error peculiar to
OS/2. Most probably you re using an obso- lete version of
Perl, and this should not happen anyway.</p>

<p>goto must have label (F) Unlike with &quot;next&quot; or
&quot;last&quot;, youre not allowed to goto an unspecified
destination. See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>()-group starts with a count (F) A ()-group started with
a count. A count is supposed to follow something: a template
character or a ()-group. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>%s had compilation errors (F) The final summary message
when a &quot;perl -c&quot; fails.</p>

<p>Had to create %s unexpectedly (S internal) A routine
asked for a symbol from a symbol table that ought to have
existed already, but for some reason it didnt, and had to be
created on an emergency basis to prevent a core dump.</p>

<p>Hash %%s missing the % in argument %d of %s() (D
deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the % on hash names
in some spots. This is now heavily deprecated.</p>

<p>%s has too many errors (F) The parser has given up
trying to parse the program after 10 errors. Further error
messages would likely be uninformative.</p>

<p>Hexadecimal number &gt; 0xffffffff non-portable (W
portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger
than 2**32-1 (4294967295) and therefore non-portable between
systems. See perlport for more on portability concerns.</p>

<p>Identifier too long (F) Perl limits identifiers (names
for variables, functions, etc.) to about 250 characters for
simple names, and somewhat more for compound names (like
$A::B). Youve exceeded Perls limits. Future versions of Perl
are likely to eliminate these arbitrary limitations.</p>

<p>Illegal binary digit %s (F) You used a digit other than
0 or 1 in a binary number.</p>

<p>Illegal binary digit %s ignored (W digit) You may have
tried to use a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.
Interpretation of the binary number stopped before the
offending digit.</p>

<p>Illegal character %s (carriage return) (F) Perl normally
treats carriage returns in the program text as it would any
other whitespace, which means you should never see this
error when Perl was built using standard options. For some
reason, your version of Perl appears to have been built
without this sup- port. Talk to your Perl administrator.</p>

<p>Illegal character in prototype for %s : %s (W syntax) An
illegal character was found in a prototype declara- tion.
Legal characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ],
&amp;, and .</p>

<p>Illegal declaration of anonymous subroutine (F) When
using the &quot;sub&quot; keyword to construct an anonymous
subrou- tine, you must always specify a block of code. See
perlsub.</p>

<p>Illegal declaration of subroutine %s (F) A subroutine
was not declared correctly. See perlsub.</p>

<p>Illegal division by zero (F) You tried to divide a
number by 0. Either something was wrong in your logic, or
you need to put a conditional in to guard against
meaningless input.</p>

<p>Illegal hexadecimal digit %s ignored (W digit) You may
have tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or A - F, a -
f in a hexadecimal number. Interpretation of the hex-
adecimal number stopped before the illegal character.</p>

<p>Illegal modulus zero (F) You tried to divide a number by
0 to get the remainder. Most numbers dont take to this
kindly.</p>

<p>Illegal number of bits in vec (F) The number of bits in
vec() (the third argument) must be a power of two from 1 to
32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).</p>

<p>Illegal octal digit %s (F) You used an 8 or 9 in an
octal number.</p>

<p>Illegal octal digit %s ignored (W digit) You may have
tried to use an 8 or 9 in an octal number. Interpretation of
the octal number stopped before the 8 or 9.</p>

<p>Illegal switch in PERL5OPT: %s (X) The PERL5OPT
environment variable may only be used to set the following
switches: -[DIMUdmtw].</p>

<p>Ill-formed CRTL environ value &quot;%s&quot; (W
internal) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read the
CRTL s internal environ array, and encountered an element
without the &quot;=&quot; delimiter used to separate keys
from values. The element is ignored.</p>

<p>Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: %s (W internal) A
warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read a logi- cal name
or CLI symbol definition when preparing to iterate over
%ENV, and didnt see the expected delimiter between key and
value, so the line was ignored.</p>

<p>(in cleanup) %s (W misc) This prefix usually indicates
that a DESTROY() method raised the indicated exception.
Since destructors are usually called by the system at
arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number
of times, the warning is issued only once for any number of
failures that would otherwise result in the same mes- sage
being repeated.</p>

<p>Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the
&quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; flag could also result in this
warning. See &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; in perlcall.</p>

<p>In EBCDIC the v-string components cannot exceed
2147483647 (F) An error peculiar to EBCDIC. Internally,
v-strings are stored as Unicode code points, and encoded in
EBCDIC as UTF-EBCDIC. The UTF-EBCDIC encoding is limited to
code points no larger than 2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF).</p>

<p>Insecure dependency in %s (F) You tried to do something
that the tainting mechanism didnt like. The tainting
mechanism is turned on when you re running setuid or setgid,
or when you specify -T to turn it on explicitly. The
tainting mechanism labels all data that s derived directly
or indirectly from the user, who is considered to be
unworthy of your trust. If any such data is used in a
&quot;dangerous&quot; operation, you get this error. See
perlsec for more information.</p>

<p>Insecure directory in %s (F) You cant use system(),
exec(), or a piped open in a setuid or setgid script if
$ENV{PATH} contains a directory that is writable by the
world. Also, the PATH must not contain any relative direc-
tory. See perlsec.</p>

<p>Insecure $ENV{%s} while running %s (F) You cant use
system(), exec(), or a piped open in a setuid or setgid
script if any of $ENV{PATH}, $ENV{IFS}, $ENV{CDPATH},
$ENV{ENV}, $ENV{BASH_ENV} or $ENV{TERM} are derived from
data sup- plied (or potentially supplied) by the user. The
script must set the path to a known value, using trustworthy
data. See perlsec.</p>

<p>Integer overflow in %s number (W overflow) The
hexadecimal, octal or binary number you have spec- ified
either as a literal or as an argument to hex() or oct() is
too big for your architecture, and has been converted to a
floating point number. On a 32-bit architecture the largest
hexadecimal, octal or binary number representable without
overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively. Note that
Perl transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point
representation internally--subject to loss of pre- cision
errors in subsequent operations.</p>

<p>Internal disaster in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in
m/%s/ (P) Something went badly wrong in the regular
expression parser. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular
expression about where the prob- lem was discovered.</p>

<p>Internal inconsistency in tracking vforks (S) A warning
peculiar to VMS. Perl keeps track of the number of times
youve called &quot;fork&quot; and &quot;exec&quot;, to
determine whether the current call to &quot;exec&quot;
should affect the current script or a sub- process (see
&quot;exec LIST&quot; in perlvms). Somehow, this count has
become scrambled, so Perl is making a guess and treating
this &quot;exec&quot; as a request to terminate the Perl
script and execute the specified command.</p>

<p>Internal urp in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/
(P) Something went badly awry in the regular expression
parser. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression
about where the problem was discovered.</p>

<p>%s (...) interpreted as function (W syntax) Youve run
afoul of the rule that says that any list operator followed
by parentheses turns into a function, with all the list
operators arguments found inside the parentheses. See
&quot;Terms and List Operators (Leftward)&quot; in
perlop.</p>

<p>Invalid %s attribute: %s The indicated attribute for a
subroutine or variable was not recog- nized by Perl or by a
user-supplied handler. See attributes.</p>

<p>Invalid %s attributes: %s The indicated attributes for a
subroutine or variable were not rec- ognized by Perl or by a
user-supplied handler. See attributes.</p>

<p>Invalid conversion in %s: &quot;%s&quot; (W printf) Perl
does not understand the given format conversion. See
&quot;sprintf&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Invalid escape in the specified encoding in regex;
marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (W regexp) The numeric escape
(for example &quot;&quot;) of value &lt; 256 didn t
correspond to a single character through the conversion from
the encoding specified by the encoding pragma. The escape
was replaced with REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFD) instead.
The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about where
the escape was discov- ered.</p>

<p>Invalid [] range &quot;%s&quot; in regex; marked by
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F) The range specified in a character
class had a minimum charac- ter greater than the maximum
character. One possibility is that you forgot the
&quot;{}&quot; from your ending &quot;&quot; - &quot;ithout
the curly braces can go only up to &quot;ff&quot;. The
&lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about where the
problem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p>Invalid range &quot;%s&quot; in transliteration operator
(F) The range specified in the tr/// or y/// operator had a
minimum character greater than the maximum character. See
perlop.</p>

<p>Invalid separator character %s in attribute list (F)
Something other than a colon or whitespace was seen between
the elements of an attribute list. If the previous attribute
had a parenthesised parameter list, perhaps that list was
terminated too soon. See attributes.</p>

<p>Invalid separator character %s in PerlIO layer
specification %s (W layer) When pushing layers onto the Perl
I/O system, something other than a colon or whitespace was
seen between the elements of a layer list. If the previous
attribute had a parenthesised parame- ter list, perhaps that
list was terminated too soon.</p>

<p>Invalid type %s in %s (F) The given character is not a
valid pack or unpack type. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.
(W) The given character is not a valid pack or unpack type
but used to be silently ignored.</p>

<p>ioctl is not implemented (F) Your machine apparently
doesnt implement ioctl(), which is pretty strange for a
machine that supports C.</p>

<p>ioctl() on unopened %s (W unopened) You tried ioctl() on
a filehandle that was never opened. Check you control flow
and number of arguments.</p>

<p>IO layers (like &quot;%s&quot;) unavailable (F) Your
Perl has not been configured to have PerlIO, and therefore
you cannot use IO layers. To have PerlIO Perl must be
configured with useperlio.</p>

<p>IO::Socket::atmark not implemented on this architecture
(F) Your machine doesn t implement the sockatmark()
functionality, neither as a system call or an ioctl call
(SIOCATMARK).</p>

<p>%s is not a code reference (W overload) The second
(fourth, sixth, ...) argument of over- load::constant needs
to be a code reference. Either an anonymous subroutine, or a
reference to a subroutine.</p>

<p>%s is not an overloadable type (W overload) You tried to
overload a constant type the overload package is unaware
of.</p>

<p>junk on end of regexp (P) The regular expression parser
is confused.</p>

<p>Label not found for &quot;last %s&quot; (F) You named a
loop to break out of, but youre not currently in a loop of
that name, not even if you count where you were called from.
See &quot;last&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Label not found for &quot;next %s&quot; (F) You named a
loop to continue, but youre not currently in a loop of that
name, not even if you count where you were called from. See
&quot;last&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Label not found for &quot;redo %s&quot; (F) You named a
loop to restart, but youre not currently in a loop of that
name, not even if you count where you were called from. See
&quot;last&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>leaving effective %s failed (F) While under the
&quot;use filetest&quot; pragma, switching the real and
effective uids or gids failed.</p>

<p>length/code after end of string in unpack (F) While
unpacking, the string buffer was already used up when an
unpack length/code combination tried to obtain more data.
This results in an undefined value for the length. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perl- func.</p>

<p>listen() on closed socket %s (W closed) You tried to do
a listen on a closed socket. Did you forget to check the
return value of your socket() call? See &quot;listen&quot;
in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Lookbehind longer than %d not implemented in regex;
marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F) There is currently a
limit on the length of string which look- behind can handle.
This restriction may be eased in a future release. The
&lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about where the
problem was discovered.</p>

<p>lstat() on filehandle %s (W io) You tried to do an lstat
on a filehandle. What did you mean by that? lstat() makes
sense only on filenames. (Perl did a fstat() instead on the
filehandle.)</p>

<p>Lvalue subs returning %s not implemented yet (F) Due to
limitations in the current implementation, array and hash
values cannot be returned in subroutines used in lvalue con-
text. See &quot;Lvalue subroutines&quot; in perlsub.</p>

<p>Malformed integer in [] in pack (F) Between the brackets
enclosing a numeric repeat count only digits are permitted.
See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Malformed integer in [] in unpack (F) Between the
brackets enclosing a numeric repeat count only digits are
permitted. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Malformed PERLLIB_PREFIX (F) An error peculiar to OS/2.
PERLLIB_PREFIX should be of the form</p>

<p>prefix1;prefix2</p>

<p>or prefix1 prefix2</p>

<p>with nonempty prefix1 and prefix2. If
&quot;prefix1&quot; is indeed a prefix of a builtin library
search path, prefix2 is substituted. The error may appear if
components are not found, or are too long. See
&quot;PERLLIB_PREFIX&quot; in perlos2.</p>

<p>Malformed prototype for %s: %s (F) You tried to use a
function with a malformed prototype. The syntax of function
prototypes is given a brief compile-time check for obvious
errors like invalid characters. A more rigorous check is run
when the function is called.</p>

<p>Malformed UTF-8 character (%s) (S utf8) (F) Perl
detected something that didnt comply with UTF-8 encoding
rules.</p>

<p>One possible cause is that you read in data that you
thought to be in UTF-8 but it wasnt (it was for example
legacy 8-bit data). Another possibility is careless use of
utf8::upgrade().</p>

<p>Malformed UTF-16 surrogate Perl thought it was reading
UTF-16 encoded character data but while doing it Perl met a
malformed Unicode surrogate.</p>

<p>%s matches null string many times in regex; marked by
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (W regexp) The pattern youve specified
would be an infinite loop if the regular expression engine
didnt specifically check for that. The &lt;-- HERE shows in
the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p>&quot;%s&quot; may clash with future reserved word (W)
This warning may be due to running a perl5 script through a
perl4 interpreter, especially if the word that is being
warned about is &quot;use&quot; or &quot;my&quot;.</p>

<p>% may not be used in pack (F) You can t pack a string by
supplying a checksum, because the checksumming process loses
information, and you can t go the other way. See
&quot;unpack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Method for operation %s not found in package %s during
blessing (F) An attempt was made to specify an entry in an
overloading table that doesn t resolve to a valid
subroutine. See overload.</p>

<p>Method %s not permitted See Server error.</p>

<p>Might be a runaway multi-line %s string starting on line
%d (S) An advisory indicating that the previous error may
have been caused by a missing delimiter on a string or
pattern, because it eventually ended earlier on the current
line.</p>

<p>Misplaced _ in number (W syntax) An underscore
(underbar) in a numeric constant did not separate two
digits.</p>

<p>Missing argument to -%c (F) The argument to the
indicated command line switch must follow immediately after
the switch, without intervening spaces.</p>

<p>Missing %sbrace%s on (F) Wrong syntax of character name
literal &quot;harname}&quot; within double-quotish
context.</p>

<p>Missing comma after first argument to %s function (F)
While certain functions allow you to specify a filehandle or
an &quot;indirect object&quot; before the argument list,
this ain t one of them.</p>

<p>Missing command in piped open (W pipe) You used the
&quot;open(FH, &quot; command&quot;)&quot; or &quot;open(FH,
&quot;command &quot;)&quot; construction, but the command
was missing or blank.</p>

<p>Missing control char name in (F) A double-quoted string
ended with &quot; control character name.</p>

<p>Missing name in &quot;my sub&quot; (F) The reserved
syntax for lexically scoped subroutines requires that they
have a name with which they can be found.</p>

<p>Missing $ on loop variable (F) Apparently youve been
programming in csh too much. Variables are always mentioned
with the $ in Perl, unlike in the shells, where it can vary
from one line to the next.</p>

<p>(Missing operator before %s?) (S syntax) This is an
educated guess made in conjunction with the message &quot;%s
found where operator expected&quot;. Often the missing
operator is a comma.</p>

<p>Missing right brace on %s (F) Missing right brace in
&quot;{...}&quot; or &quot;P{...}&quot;.</p>

<p>Missing right curly or square bracket (F) The lexer
counted more opening curly or square brackets than closing
ones. As a general rule, you ll find it s missing near the
place you were last editing.</p>

<p>(Missing semicolon on previous line?) (S syntax) This is
an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
&quot;%s found where operator expected&quot;. Don t
automatically put a semicolon on the previous line just
because you saw this mes- sage.</p>

<p>Modification of a read-only value attempted (F) You
tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value of a
constant. You didnt, of course, try &quot;2 = 1&quot;,
because the compiler catches that. But an easy way to do the
same thing is:</p>

<p>sub mod { $_[0] = 1 } mod(2);</p>

<p>Another way is to assign to a substr() thats off the end
of the string.</p>

<p>Yet another way is to assign to a &quot;foreach&quot;
loop VAR when VAR is aliased to a constant in the look
LIST:</p>

<p>$x = 1; foreach my $n ($x, 2) { $n *= 2; # modifies the
$x, but fails on attempt to modify the 2 }</p>

<p>Modification of non-creatable array value attempted, %s
(F) You tried to make an array value spring into existence,
and the subscript was probably negative, even counting from
end of the array backwards.</p>

<p>Modification of non-creatable hash value attempted, %s
(P) You tried to make a hash value spring into existence,
and it couldnt be created for some peculiar reason.</p>

<p>Module name must be constant (F) Only a bare module name
is allowed as the first argument to a &quot;use&quot;.</p>

<p>Module name required with -%c option (F) The
&quot;-M&quot; or &quot;-m&quot; options say that Perl
should load some module, but you omitted the name of the
module. Consult perlrun for full details about
&quot;-M&quot; and &quot;-m&quot;.</p>

<p>More than one argument to open (F) The &quot;open&quot;
function has been asked to open multiple files. This can
happen if you are trying to open a pipe to a command that
takes a list of arguments, but have forgotten to specify a
piped open mode. See &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc for
details.</p>

<p>msg%s not implemented (F) You dont have System V message
IPC on your system.</p>

<p>Multidimensional syntax %s not supported (W syntax)
Multidimensional arrays arent written like $foo[1,2,3].
Theyre written like $foo[1][2][3], as in C.</p>

<p>/ must be followed by a*, A* or Z* (F) You had a pack
template indicating a counted-length string, Currently the
only things that can have their length counted are a*, A* or
Z*. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>/ must follow a numeric type in unpack (F) You had an
unpack template that contained a /, but this did not follow
some unpack specification producing a numeric value. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>&quot;my sub&quot; not yet implemented (F) Lexically
scoped subroutines are not yet implemented. Dont try that
yet.</p>

<p>&quot;my&quot; variable %s cant be in a package (F)
Lexically scoped variables arent in a package, so it doesnt
make sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on
the front. Use local() if you want to localize a package
variable.</p>

<p>Name &quot;%s::%s&quot; used only once: possible typo (W
once) Typographical errors often show up as unique variable
names. If you had a good reason for having a unique name,
then just mention it again somehow to suppress the message.
The &quot;our&quot; declaration is provided for this
purpose.</p>

<p>NOTE: This warning detects symbols that have been used
only once so $c, @c, %c, *c, &amp;c, sub c{}, c(), and c
(the filehandle or format) are considered the same; if a
program uses $c only once but also uses any of the others it
will not trigger this warning.</p>

<p>Negative / count in unpack (F) The length count obtained
from a length/code unpack operation was negative. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Negative length (F) You tried to do a
read/write/send/recv operation with a buffer length that is
less than 0. This is difficult to imagine.</p>

<p>Negative offset to vec in lvalue context (F) When
&quot;vec&quot; is called in an lvalue context, the second
argument must be greater than or equal to zero.</p>

<p>Nested quantifiers in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in
m/%s/ (F) You cant quantify a quantifier without intervening
parenthe- ses. So things like ** or +* or ?* are illegal.
The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about where
the problem was discovered.</p>

<p>Note that the minimal matching quantifiers,
&quot;*?&quot;, &quot;+?&quot;, and &quot;??&quot; appear to
be nested quantifiers, but aren t. See perlre.</p>

<p>%s never introduced (S internal) The symbol in question
was declared but somehow went out of scope before it could
possibly have been used.</p>

<p>Newline in left-justified string for %s (W printf) There
is a newline in a string to be left justified by
&quot;printf&quot; or &quot;sprintf&quot;.</p>

<p>The padding spaces will appear after the newline, which
is probably not what you wanted. Usually you should remove
the newline from the string and put formatting characters in
the &quot;sprintf&quot; format.</p>

<p>No %s allowed while running setuid (F) Certain
operations are deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or
setgid script to even be allowed to attempt. Generally
speaking there will be another way to do what you want that
is, if not secure, at least securable. See perlsec.</p>

<p>No comma allowed after %s (F) A list operator that has a
filehandle or &quot;indirect object&quot; is not allowed to
have a comma between that and the following argu- ments.
Otherwise itd be just another one of the arguments.</p>

<p>One possible cause for this is that you expected to have
imported a constant to your name space with use or import
while no such importing took place, it may for example be
that your operating system does not support that particular
constant. Hopefully you did use an explicit import list for
the constants you expect to see, please see &quot;use&quot;
in perlfunc and &quot;import&quot; in perlfunc. While an
explicit import list would probably have caught this error
earlier it naturally does not remedy the fact that your
operating system still does not support that constant. Maybe
you have a typo in the constants of the symbol import list
of use or import or in the con- stant name at the line where
this error was triggered?</p>

<p>No command into which to pipe on command line (F) An
error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a at the end of the command line, so
it doesnt know where you want to pipe the output from this
command.</p>

<p>No DB::DB routine defined (F) The currently executing
code was compiled with the -d switch, but for some reason
the current debugger (e.g. perl5db.pl or a
&quot;Devel::&quot; module) didnt define a routine to be
called at the beginning of each statement.</p>

<p>No dbm on this machine (P) This is counted as an
internal error, because every machine should supply dbm
nowadays, because Perl comes with SDBM. See SDBM_File.</p>

<p>No DB::sub routine defined (F) The currently executing
code was compiled with the -d switch, but for some reason
the current debugger (e.g. perl5db.pl or a
&quot;Devel::&quot; module) didnt define a
&quot;DB::sub&quot; routine to be called at the beginning of
each ordinary subroutine call.</p>

<p>No -e allowed in setuid scripts (F) A setuid script cant
be specified by the user.</p>

<p>No error file after 2&gt; or 2&gt;&gt; on command line
(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command
line redirection, and found a 2&gt; or a 2&gt;&gt; on the
command line, but can t find the name of the file to which
to write data destined for stderr.</p>

<p>No group ending character %c found in template (F) A
pack or unpack template has an opening ( or [ without its
matching counterpart. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>No input file after &lt; on command line (F) An error
peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a &lt; on the command line, but cant
find the name of the file from which to read data for
stdin.</p>

<p>No #! line (F) The setuid emulator requires that scripts
have a well-formed #! line even on machines that don t
support the #! construct.</p>

<p>&quot;no&quot; not allowed in expression (F) The
&quot;no&quot; keyword is recognized and executed at compile
time, and returns no useful value. See perlmod.</p>

<p>No output file after &gt; on command line (F) An error
peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a lone &gt; at the end of the command
line, so it doesnt know where you wanted to redirect
stdout.</p>

<p>No output file after &gt; or &gt;&gt; on command line
(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command
line redirection, and found a &gt; or a &gt;&gt; on the
command line, but cant find the name of the file to which to
write data destined for stdout.</p>

<p>No package name allowed for variable %s in
&quot;our&quot; (F) Fully qualified variable names are not
allowed in &quot;our&quot; decla- rations, because that
doesnt make much sense under existing semantics. Such syntax
is reserved for future extensions.</p>

<p>No Perl script found in input (F) You called &quot;perl
-x&quot;, but no line was found in the file begin- ning with
#! and containing the word &quot;perl&quot;.</p>

<p>No setregid available (F) Configure didn t find anything
resembling the setregid() call for your system.</p>

<p>No setreuid available (F) Configure didn t find anything
resembling the setreuid() call for your system.</p>

<p>No %s specified for -%c (F) The indicated command line
switch needs a mandatory argument, but you havent specified
one.</p>

<p>No such class %s (F) You provided a class qualifier in a
&quot;my&quot; or &quot;our&quot; declaration, but this
class doesn t exist at this point in your program.</p>

<p>No such pipe open (P) An error peculiar to VMS. The
internal routine my_pclose() tried to close a pipe which
hadnt been opened. This should have been caught earlier as
an attempt to close an unopened filehandle.</p>

<p>No such pseudo-hash field &quot;%s&quot; (F) You tried
to access an array as a hash, but the field name used is not
defined. The hash at index 0 should map all valid field
names to array indices for that to work.</p>

<p>No such pseudo-hash field &quot;%s&quot; in variable %s
of type %s (F) You tried to access a field of a typed
variable where the type does not know about the field name.
The field names are looked up in the %FIELDS hash in the
type package at compile time. The %FIELDS hash is %usually
set up with the fields pragma.</p>

<p>No such signal: SIG%s (W signal) You specified a signal
name as a subscript to %SIG that was not recognized. Say
&quot;kill -l&quot; in your shell to see the valid signal
names on your system.</p>

<p>Not a CODE reference (F) Perl was trying to evaluate a
reference to a code value (that is, a subroutine), but found
a reference to something else instead. You can use the ref()
function to find out what kind of ref it really was. See
also perlref.</p>

<p>Not a format reference (F) I m not sure how you managed
to generate a reference to an anonymous format, but this
indicates you did, and that it didnt exist.</p>

<p>Not a GLOB reference (F) Perl was trying to evaluate a
reference to a &quot;typeglob&quot; (that is, a symbol table
entry that looks like *foo), but found a refer- ence to
something else instead. You can use the ref() function to
find out what kind of ref it really was. See perlref.</p>

<p>Not a HASH reference (F) Perl was trying to evaluate a
reference to a hash value, but found a reference to
something else instead. You can use the ref() function to
find out what kind of ref it really was. See perlref.</p>

<p>Not an ARRAY reference (F) Perl was trying to evaluate a
reference to an array value, but found a reference to
something else instead. You can use the ref() function to
find out what kind of ref it really was. See perlref.</p>

<p>Not a perl script (F) The setuid emulator requires that
scripts have a well-formed #! line even on machines that don
t support the #! construct. The line must mention perl.</p>

<p>Not a SCALAR reference (F) Perl was trying to evaluate a
reference to a scalar value, but found a reference to
something else instead. You can use the ref() function to
find out what kind of ref it really was. See perlref.</p>

<p>Not a subroutine reference (F) Perl was trying to
evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a
subroutine), but found a reference to something else
instead. You can use the ref() function to find out what
kind of ref it really was. See also perlref.</p>

<p>Not a subroutine reference in overload table (F) An
attempt was made to specify an entry in an overloading table
that doesnt somehow point to a valid subroutine. See
overload.</p>

<p>Not enough arguments for %s (F) The function requires
more arguments than you specified.</p>

<p>Not enough format arguments (W syntax) A format
specified more picture fields than the next line supplied.
See perlform.</p>

<p>%s: not found (A) Youve accidentally run your script
through the Bourne shell instead of Perl. Check the #! line,
or manually feed your script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p>no UTC offset information; assuming local time is UTC
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl was unable to find the
local timezone offset, so it s assuming that local system
time is equiva- lent to UTC. If its not, define the logical
name SYS$TIME- ZONE_DIFFERENTIAL to translate to the number
of seconds which need to be added to UTC to get local
time.</p>

<p>Non-string passed as bitmask (W misc) A number has been
passed as a bitmask argument to select(). Use the vec()
function to construct the file descriptor bitmasks for
select. See &quot;select&quot; in perlfunc</p>

<p>Null filename used (F) You cant require the null
filename, especially because on many machines that means the
current directory! See &quot;require&quot; in perl-
func.</p>

<p>NULL OP IN RUN (P debugging) Some internal routine
called run() with a null opcode pointer.</p>

<p>Null picture in formline (F) The first argument to
formline must be a valid format picture specification. It
was found to be empty, which probably means you supplied it
an uninitialized value. See perlform.</p>

<p>Null realloc (P) An attempt was made to realloc
NULL.</p>

<p>NULL regexp argument (P) The internal pattern matching
routines blew it big time.</p>

<p>NULL regexp parameter (P) The internal pattern matching
routines are out of their gourd.</p>

<p>Number too long (F) Perl limits the representation of
decimal numbers in programs to about 250 characters. Youve
exceeded that length. Future ver- sions of Perl are likely
to eliminate this arbitrary limitation. In the meantime, try
using scientific notation (e.g. &quot;1e6&quot; instead of
&quot;1_000_000&quot;).</p>

<p>Octal number in vector unsupported (F) Numbers with a
leading 0 are not currently allowed in vectors. The octal
number interpretation of such numbers may be supported in a
future version.</p>

<p>Octal number &gt; 037777777777 non-portable (W portable)
The octal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems. See
perl- port for more on portability concerns.</p>

<p>See also perlport for writing portable code.</p>

<p>Odd number of arguments for overload::constant (W
overload) The call to overload::constant contained an odd
number of arguments. The arguments should come in pairs.</p>

<p>Odd number of elements in anonymous hash (W misc) You
specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</p>

<p>Odd number of elements in hash assignment (W misc) You
specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</p>

<p>Offset outside string (F) You tried to do a
read/write/send/recv operation with an offset pointing
outside the buffer. This is difficult to imagine. The sole
exception to this is that &quot;sysread()&quot;ing past the
buffer will extend the buffer and zero pad the new area.</p>

<p>%s() on unopened %s (W unopened) An I/O operation was
attempted on a filehandle that was never initialized. You
need to do an open(), a sysopen(), or a socket() call, or
call a constructor from the FileHandle package.</p>

<p>-%s on unopened filehandle %s (W unopened) You tried to
invoke a file test operator on a filehan- dle that isn t
open. Check your control flow. See also &quot;-X&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>oops: oopsAV (S internal) An internal warning that the
grammar is screwed up.</p>

<p>oops: oopsHV (S internal) An internal warning that the
grammar is screwed up.</p>

<p>Operation &quot;%s&quot;: no method found, %s (F) An
attempt was made to perform an overloaded operation for
which no handler was defined. While some handlers can be
autogen- erated in terms of other handlers, there is no
default handler for any operation, unless
&quot;fallback&quot; overloading key is specified to be
true. See overload.</p>

<p>Operator or semicolon missing before %s (S ambiguous)
You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser was
expecting an operator. The parser has assumed you really
meant to use an operator, but this is highly likely to be
incorrect. For example, if you say &quot;*foo *foo&quot; it
will be inter- preted as if you said &quot;*foo *
foo&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;our&quot; variable %s redeclared (W misc) You seem
to have already declared the same global once before in the
current lexical scope.</p>

<p>Out of memory! (X) The malloc() function returned 0,
indicating there was insuffi- cient remaining memory (or
virtual memory) to satisfy the request. Perl has no option
but to exit immediately.</p>

<p>At least in Unix you may be able to get past this by
increasing your process datasize limits: in csh/tcsh use
&quot;limit&quot; and &quot;limit datasize n&quot; (where
&quot;n&quot; is the number of kilobytes) to check the
current limits and change them, and in ksh/bash/zsh use
&quot;ulimit -a&quot; and &quot;ulimit -d n&quot;,
respectively.</p>

<p>Out of memory during %s extend (X) An attempt was made
to extend an array, a list, or a string beyond the largest
possible memory allocation.</p>

<p>Out of memory during &quot;large&quot; request for %s
(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was
insuffi- cient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to
satisfy the request. However, the request was judged large
enough (compile-time default is 64K), so a possibility to
shut down by trapping this error is granted.</p>

<p>Out of memory during request for %s (XF) The malloc()
function returned 0, indicating there was insuf- ficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the
request.</p>

<p>The request was judged to be small, so the possibility
to trap it depends on the way perl was compiled. By default
it is not trap- pable. However, if compiled for this, Perl
may use the contents of $^M as an emergency pool after
die()ing with this message. In this case the error is
trappable once, and the error message will include the line
and file where the failed request happened.</p>

<p>Out of memory during ridiculously large request (F) You
cant allocate more than 2^31+&quot;small amount&quot; bytes.
This error is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl
program. e.g., $arr[time] instead of $arr[$time].</p>

<p>Out of memory for yacc stack (F) The yacc parser wanted
to grow its stack so it could continue parsing, but
realloc() wouldnt give it more memory, virtual or
otherwise.</p>

<p>@ outside of string in unpack (F) You had a template
that specified an absolute position outside the string being
unpacked. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>%s package attribute may clash with future reserved
word: %s (W reserved) A lowercase attribute name was used
that had a pack- age-specific handler. That name might have
a meaning to Perl itself some day, even though it doesnt
yet. Perhaps you should use a mixed-case attribute name,
instead. See attributes.</p>

<p>pack/unpack repeat count overflow (F) You cant specify a
repeat count so large that it overflows your signed
integers. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>page overflow (W io) A single call to write() produced
more lines than can fit on a page. See perlform.</p>

<p>panic: %s (P) An internal error.</p>

<p>panic: ck_grep (P) Failed an internal consistency check
trying to compile a grep.</p>

<p>panic: ck_split (P) Failed an internal consistency check

<p>panic: Devel::DProf inconsistent subroutine return (P)
Devel::DProf called a subroutine that exited using
goto(LABEL), last(LABEL) or next(LABEL). Leaving that way a
subroutine called from an XSUB will lead very probably to a
crash of the interpreter. This is a bug that will hopefully
one day get fixed.</p>

<p>panic: last (P) We popped the context stack to a block
context, and then dis- covered it wasnt a block context.</p>

<p>panic: leave_scope clearsv (P) A writable lexical
variable became read-only somehow within the scope.</p>

<p>panic: leave_scope inconsistency (P) The savestack
probably got out of sync. At least, there was an invalid
enum on the top of it.</p>

<p>panic: magic_killbackrefs (P) Failed an internal

respect to the map() function.</p>

<p>panic: memory wrap (P) Something tried to allocate more
memory than possible.</p>

which scratch pad it was allo- cating and freeing
temporaries and lexicals from.</p>

<p>panic: pad_free curpad (P) The compiler got confused
about which scratch pad it was allo- cating and freeing
temporaries and lexicals from.</p>

<p>panic: pad_free po (P) An invalid scratch pad offset was

<p>panic: pad_swipe curpad (P) The compiler got confused
about which scratch pad it was allo- cating and freeing
temporaries and lexicals from.</p>

<p>panic: pad_swipe po (P) An invalid scratch pad offset

<p>panic: pp_iter (P) The foreach iterator got called in a
non-loop context frame.</p>

<p>panic: pp_match%s (P) The internal pp_match() routine
was called with invalid opera- tional data.</p>

<p>panic: pp_split (P) Something terrible went wrong in
setting up for the split.</p>

<p>panic: realloc (P) Something requested a negative number
of bytes of realloc.</p>

<p>panic: restartop (P) Some internal routine requested a
goto (or something like it), and didnt supply the
destination.</p>

<p>panic: return (P) We popped the context stack to a
subroutine or eval context, and then discovered it wasn t a
subroutine or eval context.</p>

<p>panic: scan_num (P) scan_num() got called on something

length.</p>

<p>panic: yylex (P) The lexer got into a bad state while
processing a case modi- fier.</p>

<p>Parentheses missing around &quot;%s&quot; list (W
parenthesis) You said something like</p>

<p>my $foo, $bar = @_;</p>

<p>when you meant</p>

<p>my ($foo, $bar) = @_;</p>

<p>Remember that &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, and
&quot;local&quot; bind tighter than comma.</p>

<p>&quot;-p&quot; destination: %s (F) An error occurred
during the implicit output invoked by the &quot;-p&quot;
command-line switch. (This output goes to STDOUT unless
youve redirected it with select().)</p>

<p>(perhaps you forgot to load &quot;%s&quot;?) (F) This is
an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
&quot;Cant locate object method means that a method requires
a package that has not been loaded.</p>

<p>Perl %s required--this is only version %s, stopped (F)
The module in question uses features of a version of Perl
more recent than the currently running version. How long has
it been since you upgraded, anyway? See &quot;require&quot;
in perlfunc.</p>

<p>PERL_SH_DIR too long (F) An error peculiar to OS/2.
PERL_SH_DIR is the directory to find the
&quot;sh&quot;-shell in. See &quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot; in
perlos2.</p>

<p>PERL_SIGNALS illegal: &quot;%s&quot; See
&quot;PERL_SIGNALS&quot; in perlrun for legal values.</p>

<p>perl: warning: Setting locale failed. (S) The whole
warning message will look something like:</p>

<p>perl: warning: Setting locale failed. perl: warning:
Please check that your locale settings: LC_ALL =
&quot;En_US&quot;, LANG = (unset) are supported and
installed on your system. perl: warning: Falling back to the
standard locale (&quot;C&quot;).</p>

<p>Exactly what were the failed locale settings varies. In
the above the settings were that the LC_ALL was
&quot;En_US&quot; and the LANG had no value. This error
means that Perl detected that you and/or your operating
system supplier and/or system administrator have set up the
so-called locale system but Perl could not use those
settings. This was not dead serious, fortunately: there is a
&quot;default locale&quot; called &quot;C&quot; that Perl
can and will use, the script will be run. Before you really
fix the problem, however, you will get the same error
message each time you run Perl. How to really fix the prob-
lem can be found in perllocale section LOCALE PROBLEMS.</p>

<p>Permission denied (F) The setuid emulator in suidperl
decided you were up to no good.</p>

<p>pid %x not a child (W exec) A warning peculiar to VMS.
Waitpid() was asked to wait for a process which isnt a
subprocess of the current process. While this is fine from
VMS perspective, its probably not what you intended.</p>

<p>P must have an explicit size in unpack (F) The unpack
format P must have an explicit size, not &quot;*&quot;.</p>

<p>-P not allowed for setuid/setgid script (F) The script
would have to be opened by the C preprocessor by name, which
provides a race condition that breaks security.</p>

<p>POSIX class [:%s:] unknown in regex; marked by &lt;--
HERE in m/%s/ (F) The class in the character class [: :]
syntax is unknown. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered. Note that
the POSIX character classes do not have the &quot;is&quot;
prefix the corresponding C interfaces have: in other words,
its &quot;[[:print:]]&quot;, not &quot;isprint&quot;. See
perlre.</p>

<p>POSIX getpgrp cant take an argument (F) Your system has
POSIX getpgrp(), which takes no argument, unlike the BSD
version, which takes a pid.</p>

<p>POSIX syntax [%s] belongs inside character classes in
regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (W regexp) The
character class constructs [: :], [= =], and [. .] go inside
character classes, the [] are part of the construct, for
example: /[012[:alpha:]345]/. Note that [= =] and [. .] are
not currently implemented; they are simply placeholders for
future extensions and will cause fatal errors. The &lt;--
HERE shows in the regular expression about where the problem
was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p>POSIX syntax [. .] is reserved for future extensions in
regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F regexp) Within
regular expression character classes ([]) the syntax
beginning with &quot;[.&quot; and ending with &quot;.]&quot;
is reserved for future extensions. If you need to represent
those character sequences inside a regular expression
character class, just quote the square brackets with the
backslash: &quot;and &quot;.]&quot;. The &lt;-- HERE shows
in the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p>POSIX syntax [= =] is reserved for future extensions in
regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F) Within regular
expression character classes ([]) the syntax beginning with
&quot;[=&quot; and ending with &quot;=]&quot; is reserved
for future extensions. If you need to represent those
character sequences inside a regular expression character
class, just quote the square brackets with the backslash:
&quot;and &quot;=]&quot;. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the
regular expression about where the problem was discovered.
See perlre.</p>

<p>Possible attempt to put comments in qw() list (W qw)
qw() lists contain items separated by whitespace; as with
literal strings, comment characters are not ignored, but are
instead treated as literal data. (You may have used
different delimiters than the parentheses shown here; braces
are also fre- quently used.)</p>

<p>You probably wrote something like this:</p>

<p>@list = qw( a # a comment b # another comment );</p>

<p>when you should have written this:</p>

<p>@list = qw( a b );</p>

<p>If you really want comments, build your list the
old-fashioned way, with quotes and commas:</p>

<p>@list = ( a, # a comment b, # another comment );</p>

<p>Possible attempt to separate words with commas (W qw)
qw() lists contain items separated by whitespace; therefore
commas aren t needed to separate the items. (You may have
used different delimiters than the parentheses shown here;
braces are also frequently used.)</p>

<p>You probably wrote something like this:</p>

<p>qw! a, b, c !;</p>

<p>which puts literal commas into some of the list items.
Write it without commas if you dont want them to appear in
your data:</p>

<p>qw! a b c !;</p>

<p>Possible memory corruption: %s overflowed 3rd argument
(F) An ioctl() or fcntl() returned more than Perl was
bargaining for. Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but
puts a sentinel byte at the end of the buffer just in case.
This sentinel byte got clobbered, and Perl assumes that
memory is now corrupted. See &quot;ioctl&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>Possible precedence problem on bitwise %c operator (W
precedence) Your program uses a bitwise logical operator in
con- junction with a numeric comparison operator, like this
:</p>

<p>if ($x &amp; $y == 0) { ... }</p>

<p>This expression is actually equivalent to &quot;$x &amp;
($y == 0)&quot;, due to the higher precedence of
&quot;==&quot;. This is probably not what you want. (If you
really meant to write this, disable the warning, or, bet-
ter, put the parentheses explicitly and write &quot;$x &amp;
($y == 0)&quot;).</p>

<p>Possible unintended interpolation of %s in string (W
ambiguous) You said something like @foo in a double-quoted
string but there was no array @foo in scope at the time. If
you wanted a literal @foo, then write it as @foo; otherwise
find out what happened to the array you apparently lost
track of.</p>

<p>Possible Y2K bug: %s (W y2k) You are concatenating the
number 19 with another number, which could be a potential
Year 2000 problem.</p>

<p>pragma &quot;attrs&quot; is deprecated, use &quot;sub
NAME : ATTRS&quot; instead (D deprecated) You have written
something like this:</p>

<p>sub doit { use attrs qw(locked); }</p>

<p>You should use the new declaration syntax instead.</p>

<p>sub doit : locked { ...</p>

<p>The &quot;use attrs&quot; pragma is now obsolete, and is
only provided for backward-compatibility. See
&quot;Subroutine Attributes&quot; in perlsub.</p>

<p>Precedence problem: open %s should be open(%s) (S
precedence) The old irregular construct</p>

<p>open FOO die;</p>

<p>is now misinterpreted as</p>

<p>open(FOO die);</p>

<p>because of the strict regularization of Perl 5s grammar
into unary and list operators. (The old open was a little of
both.) You must put parentheses around the filehandle, or
use the new &quot;or&quot; operator instead of
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>Premature end of script headers See Server error.</p>

<p>printf() on closed filehandle %s (W closed) The
filehandle youre writing to got itself closed some- time
before now. Check your control flow.</p>

<p>print() on closed filehandle %s (W closed) The
filehandle youre printing on got itself closed sometime
before now. Check your control flow.</p>

<p>Process terminated by SIG%s (W) This is a standard
message issued by OS/2 applications, while *nix applications
die in silence. It is considered a feature of the OS/2 port.
One can easily disable this by appropriate sighan- dlers,
see &quot;Signals&quot; in perlipc. See also &quot;Process
terminated by SIGTERM/SIGINT&quot; in perlos2.</p>

<p>Prototype mismatch: %s vs %s (S prototype) The
subroutine being declared or defined had previ- ously been
declared or defined with a different function prototype.</p>

<p>Prototype not terminated (F) You ve omitted the closing
parenthesis in a function prototype definition.</p>

<p>Pseudo-hashes are deprecated (D deprecated)
Pseudo-hashes were deprecated in Perl 5.8.0 and they will be
removed in Perl 5.10.0, see perl58delta for more details.
You can continue to use the &quot;fields&quot; pragma.</p>

<p>Quantifier follows nothing in regex; marked by &lt;--
HERE in m/%s/ (F) You started a regular expression with a
quantifier. Backslash it if you meant it literally. The
&lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about where the
problem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p>Quantifier in {,} bigger than %d in regex; marked by
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F) There is currently a limit to the
size of the min and max val- ues of the {min,max} construct.
The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about where
the problem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p>Quantifier unexpected on zero-length expression; marked
by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (W regexp) You applied a regular
expression quantifier in a place where it makes no sense,
such as on a zero-width assertion. Try putting the
quantifier inside the assertion instead. For example, the
way to match &quot;abc&quot; provided that it is followed by
three repe- titions of &quot;xyz&quot; is
&quot;/abc(?=(?:xyz){3})/&quot;, not
&quot;/abc(?=xyz){3}/&quot;.</p>

<p>The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about
where the prob- lem was discovered.</p>

<p>Range iterator outside integer range (F) One (or both)
of the numeric arguments to the range operator
&quot;..&quot; are outside the range which can be
represented by integers internally. One possible workaround
is to force Perl to use magi- cal string increment by
prepending &quot;0&quot; to your numbers.</p>

<p>readline() on closed filehandle %s (W closed) The
filehandle you re reading from got itself closed sometime
before now. Check your control flow.</p>

<p>read() on closed filehandle %s (W closed) You tried to
read from a closed filehandle.</p>

<p>read() on unopened filehandle %s (W unopened) You tried
to read from a filehandle that was never opened.</p>

<p>Reallocation too large: %lx (F) You cant allocate more
than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</p>

<p>realloc() of freed memory ignored (S malloc) An internal
routine called realloc() on something that had already been
freed.</p>

<p>Recompile perl with -DDEBUGGING to use -D switch (F
debugging) You cant use the -D option unless the code to
pro- duce the desired output is compiled into Perl, which
entails some overhead, which is why its currently left out
of your copy.</p>

<p>Recursive inheritance detected in package %s (F) More
than 100 levels of inheritance were used. Probably indi-
cates an unintended loop in your inheritance hierarchy.</p>

<p>Recursive inheritance detected while looking for method
%s (F) More than 100 levels of inheritance were encountered
while invoking a method. Probably indicates an unintended
loop in your inheritance hierarchy.</p>

<p>Reference found where even-sized list expected (W misc)
You gave a single reference where Perl was expecting a list
with an even number of elements (for assignment to a hash).
This usually means that you used the anon hash constructor
when you meant to use parens. In any case, a hash requires
key/value pairs.</p>

<p>%hash = { one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, }; # WRONG %hash = [
qw/ an anon array / ]; # WRONG %hash = ( one =&gt; 1, two
=&gt; 2, ); # right %hash = qw( one 1 two 2 ); # also
fine</p>

<p>Reference is already weak (W misc) You have attempted to
weaken a reference that is already weak. Doing so has no
effect.</p>

<p>Reference miscount in sv_replace() (W internal) The
internal sv_replace() function was handed a new SV with a
reference count of other than 1.</p>

<p>Reference to nonexistent group in regex; marked by
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F) You used something like
&quot;7&quot; in your regular expression, but there are not
at least seven sets of capturing parentheses in the
expression. If you wanted to have the character with value 7
inserted into the regular expression, prepend a zero to make
the number at least two digits: &quot; 7&quot;</p>

<p>The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about
where the prob- lem was discovered.</p>

<p>regexp memory corruption (P) The regular expression
engine got confused by what the regular expression compiler
gave it.</p>

<p>Regexp out of space (P) A &quot;cant happen&quot; error,
because safemalloc() should have caught it earlier.</p>

<p>Repeated format line will never terminate (~~ and @#
incompatible) (F) Your format contains the ~~
repeat-until-blank sequence and a numeric field that will
never go blank so that the repetition never terminates. You
might use ^# instead. See perlform.</p>

<p>Reversed %s= operator (W syntax) You wrote your
assignment operator backwards. The = must always comes last,
to avoid ambiguity with subsequent unary operators.</p>

<p>Runaway format (F) Your format contained the ~~
repeat-until-blank sequence, but it produced 200 lines at
once, and the 200th line looked exactly like the 199th line.
Apparently you didnt arrange for the argu- ments to exhaust
themselves, either by using ^ instead of @ (for scalar
variables), or by shifting or popping (for array variables).
See perlform.</p>

<p>Scalars leaked: %d (P) Something went wrong in Perls
internal bookkeeping of scalars: not all scalar variables
were deallocated by the time Perl exited. What this usually
indicates is a memory leak, which is of course bad,
especially if the Perl program is intended to be
long-running.</p>

<p>Scalar value @%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s] (W
syntax) Youve used an array slice (indicated by @) to select
a single element of an array. Generally its better to ask
for a scalar value (indicated by $). The difference is that
$foo[&amp;bar] always behaves like a scalar, both when
assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while
@foo[&amp;bar] behaves like a list when you assign to it,
and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do
weird things if youre expecting only one subscript.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat
the array element as a list, you need to look into how
references work, because Perl will not magically convert
between scalars and lists for you. See perlref.</p>

<p>Scalar value @%s{%s} better written as $%s{%s} (W
syntax) Youve used a hash slice (indicated by @) to select a
single element of a hash. Generally its better to ask for a
scalar value (indicated by $). The difference is that
$foo{&amp;bar} always behaves like a scalar, both when
assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while
@foo{&amp;bar} behaves like a list when you assign to it,
and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do
weird things if youre expecting only one subscript.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat
the hash element as a list, you need to look into how
references work, because Perl will not magically convert
between scalars and lists for you. See perlref.</p>

<p>Script is not setuid/setgid in suidperl (F) Oddly, the
suidperl program was invoked on a script without a setuid or
setgid bit set. This doesn t make much sense.</p>

<p>Search pattern not terminated (F) The lexer couldnt find
the final delimiter of a // or m{} con- struct. Remember
that bracketing delimiters count nesting level. Missing the
leading &quot;$&quot; from a variable $m may cause this
error.</p>

<p>Note that since Perl 5.9.0 a // can also be the
defined-or con- struct, not just the empty search pattern.
Therefore code written in Perl 5.9.0 or later that uses the
// as the defined-or can be misparsed by pre-5.9.0 Perls as
a non-terminated search pattern.</p>

<p>Search pattern not terminated or ternary operator parsed
as search pat- tern (F) The lexer couldnt find the final
delimiter of a &quot;?PATTERN?&quot; construct.</p>

<p>The question mark is also used as part of the ternary
operator (as in &quot;foo ? 0 : 1&quot;) leading to some
ambiguous constructions being wrongly parsed. One way to
disambiguate the parsing is to put parentheses around the
conditional expression, i.e. &quot;(foo) ? 0 : 1&quot;.</p>

<p>%sseek() on unopened filehandle (W unopened) You tried
to use the seek() or sysseek() function on a filehandle that
was either never opened or has since been closed.</p>

<p>select not implemented (F) This machine doesnt implement
the select() system call.</p>

<p>Self-ties of arrays and hashes are not supported (F)
Self-ties are of arrays and hashes are not supported in the
current implementation.</p>

<p>Semicolon seems to be missing (W semicolon) A nearby
syntax error was probably caused by a miss- ing semicolon,
or possibly some other missing operator, such as a
comma.</p>

<p>semi-panic: attempt to dup freed string (S internal) The
internal newSVsv() routine was called to duplicate a scalar
that had previously been marked as free.</p>

<p>sem%s not implemented (F) You don t have System V
semaphore IPC on your system.</p>

<p>send() on closed socket %s (W closed) The socket you re
sending to got itself closed sometime before now. Check your
control flow.</p>

<p>Sequence (? incomplete in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE
in m/%s/ (F) A regular expression ended with an incomplete
extension (?. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered. See
perlre.</p>

<p>Sequence (?%s...) not implemented in regex; marked by
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F) A proposed regular expression
extension has the character reserved but has not yet been
written. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression
about where the problem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p>Sequence (?%s...) not recognized in regex; marked by
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F) You used a regular expression
extension that doesn t make sense. The &lt;-- HERE shows in
the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p>Sequence (?#... not terminated in regex; marked by
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F) A regular expression comment must
be terminated by a closing parenthesis. Embedded parentheses
arent allowed. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discov- ered. See
perlre.</p>

<p>Sequence (?{...}) not terminated or not {}-balanced in
regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F) If the contents of
a (?{...}) clause contains braces, they must balance for
Perl to properly detect the end of the clause. The &lt;--
HERE shows in the regular expression about where the problem
was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p>500 Server error See Server error.</p>

<p>Server error This is the error message generally seen in
a browser window when trying to run a CGI program (including
SSI) over the web. The actual error text varies widely from
server to server. The most frequently-seen variants are
&quot;500 Server error&quot;, &quot;Method (some- thing) not
permitted&quot;, &quot;Document contains no data&quot;,
&quot;Premature end of script headers&quot;, and &quot;Did
not produce a valid header&quot;.</p>

<p>This is a CGI error, not a Perl error.</p>

<p>You need to make sure your script is executable, is
accessible by the user CGI is running the script under
(which is probably not the user account you tested it
under), does not rely on any environment variables (like
PATH) from the user it isn t running under, and isn t in a
location where the CGI server cant find it, basically, more
or less. Please see the following for more information:</p>

<p>http://www.perl.org/CGI_MetaFAQ.html
http://www.htmlhelp.org/faq/cgifaq.html
http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/</p>

<p>You should also look at perlfaq9.</p>

<p>setegid() not implemented (F) You tried to assign to $),
and your operating system doesnt support the setegid()
system call (or equivalent), or at least Con- figure didnt
think so.</p>

<p>seteuid() not implemented (F) You tried to assign to
$&gt;, and your operating system doesnt support the
seteuid() system call (or equivalent), or at least Con-
figure didnt think so.</p>

<p>setpgrp cant take arguments (F) Your system has the
setpgrp() from BSD 4.2, which takes no arguments, unlike
POSIX setpgid(), which takes a process ID and process group
ID.</p>

<p>setrgid() not implemented (F) You tried to assign to $(,
and your operating system doesnt support the setrgid()
system call (or equivalent), or at least Con- figure didnt
think so.</p>

<p>setruid() not implemented (F) You tried to assign to
$&lt;, and your operating system doesnt support the
setruid() system call (or equivalent), or at least Con-
figure didnt think so.</p>

<p>setsockopt() on closed socket %s (W closed) You tried to
set a socket option on a closed socket. Did you forget to
check the return value of your socket() call? See
&quot;setsockopt&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Setuid/gid script is writable by world (F) The setuid
emulator won t run a script that is writable by the world,
because the world might have written on it already.</p>

<p>Setuid script not plain file (F) The setuid emulator
wont run a script that isnt read from a file, but from a
socket, a pipe or another device.</p>

<p>shm%s not implemented (F) You dont have System V shared
memory IPC on your system.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt; should be quotes (F) You wrote &quot;require
&lt;file&gt;&quot; when you should have written
&quot;require &rsquo;file&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p>/%s/ should probably be written as &quot;%s&quot; (W
syntax) You have used a pattern where Perl expected to find
a string, as in the first argument to &quot;join&quot;. Perl
will treat the true or false result of matching the pattern
against $_ as the string, which is probably not what you had
in mind.</p>

<p>shutdown() on closed socket %s (W closed) You tried to
do a shutdown on a closed socket. Seems a bit
superfluous.</p>

<p>SIG%s handler &quot;%s&quot; not defined (W signal) The
signal handler named in %SIG doesnt, in fact, exist. Perhaps
you put it into the wrong package?</p>

<p>sort is now a reserved word (F) An ancient error message
that almost nobody ever runs into any- more. But before sort
was a keyword, people sometimes used it as a filehandle.</p>

<p>Sort subroutine didnt return a numeric value (F) A sort
comparison routine must return a number. You probably blew
it by not using &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot; or &quot;cmp&quot;, or
by not using them cor- rectly. See &quot;sort&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>Sort subroutine didnt return single value (F) A sort
comparison subroutine may not return a list value with more
or less than one element. See &quot;sort&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>splice() offset past end of array (W misc) You attempted
to specify an offset that was past the end of the array
passed to splice(). Splicing will instead commence at the
end of the array, rather than past it. If this isn t what
you want, try explicitly pre-extending the array by
assigning $#array = $offset. See &quot;splice&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>Split loop (P) The split was looping infinitely.
(Obviously, a split shouldnt iterate more times than there
are characters of input, which is what happened.) See
&quot;split&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Statement unlikely to be reached (W exec) You did an
exec() with some statement after it other than a die(). This
is almost always an error, because exec() never returns
unless there was a failure. You probably wanted to use
system() instead, which does return. To suppress this
warning, put the exec() in a block by itself.</p>

<p>stat() on unopened filehandle %s (W unopened) You tried
to use the stat() function on a filehandle that was either
never opened or has since been closed.</p>

<p>Stub found while resolving method &quot;%s&quot;
overloading &quot;%s&quot; (P) Overloading resolution over
@ISA tree may be broken by importa- tion stubs. Stubs should
never be implicitly created, but explicit calls to
&quot;can&quot; may break this.</p>

<p>Subroutine %s redefined (W redefine) You redefined a
subroutine. To suppress this warning, say</p>

<p>{ no warnings redefine; eval &quot;sub name { ...
}&quot;; }</p>

<p>Substitution loop (P) The substitution was looping
infinitely. (Obviously, a substi- tution shouldn t iterate
more times than there are characters of input, which is what
happened.) See the discussion of substitution in &quot;Quote
and Quote-like Operators&quot; in perlop.</p>

<p>Substitution pattern not terminated (F) The lexer
couldnt find the interior delimiter of an s/// or s{}{}
construct. Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting
level. Missing the leading &quot;$&quot; from variable $s
may cause this error.</p>

<p>Substitution replacement not terminated (F) The lexer
couldnt find the final delimiter of an s/// or s{}{}
construct. Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting
level. Missing the leading &quot;$&quot; from variable $s
may cause this error.</p>

<p>substr outside of string (W substr),(F) You tried to
reference a substr() that pointed out- side of a string.
That is, the absolute value of the offset was larger than
the length of the string. See &quot;substr&quot; in
perlfunc. This warning is fatal if substr is used in an
lvalue context (as the left hand side of an assignment or as
a subroutine argument for example).</p>

<p>suidperl is no longer needed since %s (F) Your Perl was
compiled with -DSETUID_SCRIPTS_ARE_SECURE_NOW, but a version
of the setuid emulator somehow got run anyway.</p>

<p>Switch (?(condition)... contains too many branches in
regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F) A
(?(condition)if-clauseelse-clause) construct can have at
most two branches (the if-clause and the else-clause). If
you want one or both to contain alternation, such as using
&quot;thisthatother&quot;, enclose it in clustering
parentheses:</p>

<p>(?(condition)(?:thisthatother)else-clause)</p>

<p>The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about
where the prob- lem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p>Switch condition not recognized in regex; marked by
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F) If the argument to the
(?(...)if-clause else-clause) construct is a number, it can
be only a number. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered. See
perlre.</p>

<p>switching effective %s is not implemented (F) While
under the &quot;use filetest&quot; pragma, we cannot switch
the real and effective uids or gids.</p>

<p>%s syntax (F) The final summary message when a
&quot;perl -c&quot; succeeds.</p>

<p>syntax error (F) Probably means you had a syntax error.
Common reasons include:</p>

<p>A keyword is misspelled. A semicolon is missing. A comma
is missing. An opening or closing parenthesis is missing. An
opening or closing brace is missing. A closing quote is
missing.</p>

<p>Often there will be another error message associated
with the syn- tax error giving more information. (Sometimes
it helps to turn on -w.) The error message itself often
tells you where it was in the line when it decided to give
up. Sometimes the actual error is several tokens before
this, because Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in
a blue moon the only way to figure out what s triggering the
error is to call &quot;perl -c&quot; repeatedly, chopping
away half the program each time to see if the error went
away. Sort of the cybernetic version of 20 questions.</p>

<p>syntax error at line %d: %s unexpected (A) You ve
accidentally run your script through the Bourne shell
instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your
script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p>syntax error in file %s at line %d, next 2 tokens
&quot;%s&quot; (F) This error is likely to occur if you run
a perl5 script through a perl4 interpreter, especially if
the next 2 tokens are &quot;use strict&quot; or &quot;my
$var&quot; or &quot;our $var&quot;.</p>

<p>sysread() on closed filehandle %s (W closed) You tried
to read from a closed filehandle.</p>

<p>sysread() on unopened filehandle %s (W unopened) You
tried to read from a filehandle that was never opened.</p>

<p>System V %s is not implemented on this machine (F) You
tried to do something with a function beginning with
&quot;sem&quot;, &quot;shm&quot;, or &quot;msg&quot; but
that System V IPC is not implemented in your machine. In
some machines the functionality can exist but be
unconfigured. Consult your system support.</p>

<p>syswrite() on closed filehandle %s (W closed) The
filehandle youre writing to got itself closed some- time
before now. Check your control flow.</p>

<p>&quot;-T&quot; and &quot;-B&quot; not implemented on
filehandles (F) Perl cant peek at the stdio buffer of
filehandles when it doesnt know about your kind of stdio.
Youll have to use a file- name instead.</p>

<p>Target of goto is too deeply nested (F) You tried to use
&quot;goto&quot; to reach a label that was too deeply nested
for Perl to reach. Perl is doing you a favor by
refusing.</p>

<p>tell() on unopened filehandle (W unopened) You tried to
use the tell() function on a filehandle that was either
never opened or has since been closed.</p>

<p>That use of $[ is unsupported (F) Assignment to $[ is
now strictly circumscribed, and interpreted as a compiler
directive. You may say only one of</p>

<p>$[ = 0; $[ = 1; ... local $[ = 0; local $[ = 1; ...</p>

<p>This is to prevent the problem of one module changing
the array base out from under another module inadvertently.
See &quot;$[&quot; in per- lvar.</p>

<p>The crypt() function is unimplemented due to excessive
paranoia (F) Configure couldn t find the crypt() function on
your machine, probably because your vendor didnt supply it,
probably because they think the U.S. Government thinks its a
secret, or at least that they will continue to pretend that
it is. And if you quote me on that, I will deny it.</p>

<p>The %s function is unimplemented The function indicated
isn t implemented on this architecture, according to the
probings of Configure.</p>

<p>The stat preceding %s wasnt an lstat (F) It makes no
sense to test the current stat buffer for symbolic linkhood
if the last stat that wrote to the stat buffer already went
past the symlink to get to the real file. Use an actual
file- name instead.</p>

<p>The unique attribute may only be applied to our
variables (F) Currently this attribute is not supported on
&quot;my&quot; or &quot;sub&quot; dec- larations. See
&quot;our&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>This Perl cant reset CRTL environ elements (%s) This
Perl cant set CRTL environ elements (%s=%s) (W internal)
Warnings peculiar to VMS. You tried to change or delete an
element of the CRTLs internal environ array, but your copy
of Perl wasnt built with a CRTL that contained the setenv()
function. Youll need to rebuild Perl with a CRTL that does,
or redefine PERL_ENV_TABLES (see perlvms) so that the
environ array isn t the target of the change to %ENV which
produced the warning.</p>

<p>thread failed to start: %s (W threads)(S) The entry
point function of threads-&gt;create() failed for some
reason.</p>

<p>5.005 threads are deprecated (D deprecated) The
5.005-style threads (activated by &quot;use Thread;&quot;)
are deprecated and one should use the new ithreads instead,
see perl58delta for more details.</p>

<p>times not implemented (F) Your version of the C library
apparently doesnt do times(). I suspect youre not running on
Unix.</p>

<p>&quot;-T&quot; is on the #! line, it must also be used
on the command line (X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in
a Perl script contains the -T option, but Perl was not
invoked with -T in its command line. This is an error
because, by the time Perl discovers a -T in a script, its
too late to properly taint everything from the envi-
ronment. So Perl gives up.</p>

<p>If the Perl script is being executed as a command using
the #! mechanism (or its local equivalent), this error can
usually be fixed by editing the #! line so that the -T
option is a part of Perls first argument: e.g. change
&quot;perl -n -T&quot; to &quot;perl -T -n&quot;.</p>

<p>If the Perl script is being executed as &quot;perl
scriptname&quot;, then the -T option must appear on the
command line: &quot;perl -T scriptname&quot;.</p>

<p>To%s: illegal mapping %s (F) You tried to define a
customized To-mapping for lc(), lcfirst, uc(), or ucfirst()
(or their string-inlined versions), but you specified an
illegal mapping. See &quot;User-Defined Character Proper-
ties&quot; in perlunicode.</p>

<p>Too deeply nested ()-groups (F) Your template contains
()-groups with a ridiculously deep nest- ing level.</p>

<p>Too few args to syscall (F) There has to be at least one
argument to syscall() to specify the system call to call,
silly dilly.</p>

<p>Too late for &quot;-%s&quot; option (X) The #! line (or
local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the -M or -m
option. This is an error because -M and -m options are not
intended for use inside scripts. Use the &quot;use&quot;
pragma instead.</p>

<p>Too late to run %s block (W void) A CHECK or INIT block
is being defined during run time proper, when the
opportunity to run them has already passed. Perhaps you are
loading a file with &quot;require&quot; or &quot;do&quot;
when you should be using &quot;use&quot; instead. Or perhaps
you should put the &quot;require&quot; or &quot;do&quot;
inside a BEGIN block.</p>

<p>Too many args to syscall (F) Perl supports a maximum of
only 14 args to syscall().</p>

<p>Too many arguments for %s (F) The function requires
fewer arguments than you specified.</p>

<p>Too many )s (A) You ve accidentally run your script
through csh instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually
feed your script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p>Too many (s (A) You ve accidentally run your script
through csh instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually
feed your script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p>Trailing in regex m/%s/ (F) The regular expression ends
with an unbackslashed backslash. Backslash it. See
perlre.</p>

<p>Transliteration pattern not terminated (F) The lexer
couldnt find the interior delimiter of a tr/// or tr[][] or
y/// or y[][] construct. Missing the leading &quot;$&quot;
from variables $tr or $y may cause this error.</p>

<p>Transliteration replacement not terminated (F) The lexer
couldnt find the final delimiter of a tr///, tr[][], y/// or
y[][] construct.</p>

<p>%s trapped by operation mask (F) You tried to use an
operator from a Safe compartment in which its disallowed.
See Safe.</p>

<p>truncate not implemented (F) Your machine doesnt
implement a file truncation mechanism that Configure knows
about.</p>

<p>Type of arg %d to %s must be %s (not %s) (F) This
function requires the argument in that position to be of a
certain type. Arrays must be @NAME or &quot;@{EXPR}&quot;.
Hashes must be %NAME or &quot;%{EXPR}&quot;. No implicit
dereferencing is allowed--use the {EXPR} forms as an
explicit dereference. See perlref.</p>

<p>umask not implemented (F) Your machine doesnt implement
the umask function and you tried to use it to restrict
permissions for yourself (EXPR &amp; 0700).</p>

<p>Unable to create sub named &quot;%s&quot; (F) You
attempted to create or access a subroutine with an illegal
name.</p>

<p>Unbalanced context: %d more PUSHes than POPs (W
internal) The exit code detected an internal inconsistency
in how many execution contexts were entered and left.</p>

<p>Unbalanced saves: %d more saves than restores (W
internal) The exit code detected an internal inconsistency
in how many values were temporarily localized.</p>

<p>Unbalanced scopes: %d more ENTERs than LEAVEs (W
internal) The exit code detected an internal inconsistency
in how many blocks were entered and left.</p>

<p>Unbalanced tmps: %d more allocs than frees (W internal)
The exit code detected an internal inconsistency in how many
mortal scalars were allocated and freed.</p>

<p>Undefined format &quot;%s&quot; called (F) The format
indicated doesn t seem to exist. Perhaps its really in
another package? See perlform.</p>

<p>Undefined sort subroutine &quot;%s&quot; called (F) The
sort comparison routine specified doesnt seem to exist.
Perhaps its in a different package? See &quot;sort&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>Undefined subroutine &amp;%s called (F) The subroutine
indicated hasnt been defined, or if it was, it has since
been undefined.</p>

<p>Undefined subroutine called (F) The anonymous subroutine
youre trying to call hasn t been defined, or if it was, it
has since been undefined.</p>

<p>Undefined subroutine in sort (F) The sort comparison
routine specified is declared but doesnt seem to have been
defined yet. See &quot;sort&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Undefined top format &quot;%s&quot; called (F) The
format indicated doesn t seem to exist. Perhaps its really
in another package? See perlform.</p>

<p>Undefined value assigned to typeglob (W misc) An
undefined value was assigned to a typeglob, a la &quot;*foo
= undef&quot;. This does nothing. Its possible that you
really mean &quot;undef *foo&quot;.</p>

<p>%s: Undefined variable (A) Youve accidentally run your
script through csh instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or
manually feed your script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p>unexec of %s into %s failed! (F) The unexec() routine
failed for some reason. See your local FSF representative,
who probably put it there in the first place.</p>

<p>Unicode character %s is illegal (W utf8) Certain Unicode
characters have been designated off-limits by the Unicode
standard and should not be generated. If you really know
what you are doing you can turn off this warning by &quot;no
warn- ings &rsquo;utf8&rsquo;;&quot;.</p>

<p>Unknown BYTEORDER (F) There are no byte-swapping
functions for a machine with this byte order.</p>

<p>Unknown open() mode %s (F) The second argument of
3-argument open() is not among the list of valid modes:
&quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;,
&quot;+&lt;&quot;, &quot;+&gt;&quot;, &quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot;,
&quot;- &quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;&lt;&amp;&quot;,
&quot;&gt;&amp;&quot;.</p>

<p>Unknown PerlIO layer &quot;%s&quot; (W layer) An attempt
was made to push an unknown layer onto the Perl I/O system.
(Layers take care of transforming data between external and
internal representations.) Note that some layers, such as
&quot;mmap&quot;, are not supported in all environments. If
your program didn t explicitly request the failing
operation, it may be the result of the value of the
environment variable PERLIO.</p>

<p>Unknown process %x sent message to prime_env_iter: %s
(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl was reading values for
%ENV before iterating over it, and someone else stuck a
message in the stream of data Perl expected. Someones very
confused, or perhaps trying to subvert Perl s population of
%ENV for nefarious purposes.</p>

<p>Unknown &quot;re&quot; subpragma %s (known ones are: %s)
You tried to use an unknown subpragma of the &quot;re&quot;
pragma.</p>

<p>Unknown switch condition (?(%.2s in regex; marked by
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F) The condition part of a
(?(condition)if-clause else-clause) construct is not known.
The condition may be lookahead or lookbe- hind (the
condition is true if the lookahead or lookbehind is true), a
(?{...}) construct (the condition is true if the code
evaluates to a true value), or a number (the condition is
true if the set of capturing parentheses named by the number
matched).</p>

<p>The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about
where the prob- lem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p>Unknown Unicode option letter %c You specified an
unknown Unicode option. See perlrun documentation of the
&quot;-C&quot; switch for the list of known options.</p>

<p>Unknown Unicode option value %x You specified an unknown
Unicode option. See perlrun documentation of the
&quot;-C&quot; switch for the list of known options.</p>

<p>Unknown warnings category %s (F) An error issued by the
&quot;warnings&quot; pragma. You specified a warn- ings
category that is unknown to perl at this point.</p>

<p>Note that if you want to enable a warnings category
registered by a module (e.g. &quot;use warnings
&rsquo;File::Find&rsquo;&quot;), you must have imported this
module first.</p>

<p>unmatched [ in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F)
The brackets around a character class must match. If you
wish to include a closing bracket in a character class,
backslash it or put it first. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the
regular expression about where the problem was discovered.
See perlre.</p>

<p>unmatched ( in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F)
Unbackslashed parentheses must always be balanced in regular
expressions. If youre a vi user, the % key is valuable for
finding the matching parenthesis. The &lt;-- HERE shows in
the regular expres- sion about where the problem was
discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p>Unmatched right %s bracket (F) The lexer counted more
closing curly or square brackets than opening ones, so youre
probably missing a matching opening bracket. As a general
rule, youll find the missing one (so to speak) near the
place you were last editing.</p>

<p>Unquoted string &quot;%s&quot; may clash with future
reserved word (W reserved) You used a bareword that might
someday be claimed as a reserved word. Its best to put such
a word in quotes, or capitalize it somehow, or insert an
underbar into it. You might also declare it as a
subroutine.</p>

<p>Unrecognized character %s (F) The Perl parser has no
idea what to do with the specified char- acter in your Perl
script (or eval). Perhaps you tried to run a compressed
script, a binary program, or a directory as a Perl pro-
gram.</p>

<p>/%s/: Unrecognized escape \%c in character class passed
through (W regexp) You used a backslash-character
combination which is not recognized by Perl inside character
classes. The character was understood literally.</p>

<p>Unrecognized escape \%c passed through (W misc) You used
a backslash-character combination which is not recognized by
Perl.</p>

<p>Unrecognized escape \%c passed through in regex; marked
by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (W regexp) You used a
backslash-character combination which is not recognized by
Perl. This combination appears in an interpolated variable
or a &quot;&rsquo;&quot;-delimited regular expression. The
character was understood literally. The &lt;-- HERE shows in
the regular expression about where the escape was
discovered.</p>

<p>Unrecognized signal name &quot;%s&quot; (F) You
specified a signal name to the kill() function that was not
recognized. Say &quot;kill -l&quot; in your shell to see the
valid signal names on your system.</p>

<p>Unrecognized switch: -%s (-h will show valid options)
(F) You specified an illegal option to Perl. Dont do that.
(If you think you didnt do that, check the #! line to see if
its sup- plying the bad switch on your behalf.)</p>

<p>Unsuccessful %s on filename containing newline (W
newline) A file operation was attempted on a filename, and
that operation failed, PROBABLY because the filename
contained a new- line, PROBABLY because you forgot to
chomp() it off. See &quot;chomp&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Unsupported directory function &quot;%s&quot; called (F)
Your machine doesn t support opendir() and readdir().</p>

<p>Unsupported function %s (F) This machine doesn t
implement the indicated function, appar- ently. At least,
Configure doesnt think so.</p>

<p>Unsupported function fork (F) Your version of executable
does not support forking.</p>

<p>Note that under some systems, like OS/2, there may be
different flavors of Perl executables, some of which may
support fork, some not. Try changing the name you call Perl
by to &quot;perl_&quot;, &quot;perl__&quot;, and so on.</p>

<p>Unsupported script encoding %s (F) Your program file
begins with a Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) which declares
it to be in a Unicode encoding that Perl cannot read.</p>

<p>Unsupported socket function &quot;%s&quot; called (F)
Your machine doesnt support the Berkeley socket mechanism,
or at least thats what Configure thought.</p>

<p>Unterminated attribute list (F) The lexer found
something other than a simple identifier at the start of an
attribute, and it wasnt a semicolon or the start of a block.
Perhaps you terminated the parameter list of the previous
attribute too soon. See attributes.</p>

<p>Unterminated attribute parameter in attribute list (F)
The lexer saw an opening (left) parenthesis character while
parsing an attribute list, but the matching closing (right)
paren- thesis character was not found. You may need to add
(or remove) a backslash character to get your parentheses to
balance. See attributes.</p>

<p>Unterminated compressed integer (F) An argument to
unpack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was incompatible with the BER
compressed integer format and could not be converted to an
integer. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Unterminated &lt;&gt; operator (F) The lexer saw a left
angle bracket in a place where it was expecting a term, so
its looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and
not finding it. Chances are you left some needed parentheses
out earlier in the line, and you really meant a &quot;less
than&quot;.</p>

<p>untie attempted while %d inner references still exist (W
untie) A copy of the object returned from &quot;tie&quot;
(or &quot;tied&quot;) was still valid when &quot;untie&quot;
was called.</p>

<p>Usage: POSIX::%s(%s) (F) You called a POSIX function
with incorrect arguments. See &quot;FUNCTIONS&quot; in POSIX
for more information.</p>

<p>Usage: Win32::%s(%s) (F) You called a Win32 function
with incorrect arguments. See Win32 for more
information.</p>

<p>Useless (?-%s) - dont use /%s modifier in regex; marked
by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (W regexp) You have used an internal
modifier such as (?-o) that has no meaning unless removed
from the entire regexp:</p>

<p>if ($string =~ /(?-o)$pattern/o) { ... }</p>

<p>must be written as</p>

<p>if ($string =~ /$pattern/) { ... }</p>

<p>The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about
where the prob- lem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p>Useless (?%s) - use /%s modifier in regex; marked by
&lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (W regexp) You have used an internal
modifier such as (?o) that has no meaning unless applied to
the entire regexp:</p>

<p>if ($string =~ /(?o)$pattern/) { ... }</p>

<p>must be written as</p>

<p>if ($string =~ /$pattern/o) { ... }</p>

<p>The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about
where the prob- lem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p>Useless use of %s in void context (W void) You did
something without a side effect in a context that does
nothing with the return value, such as a statement that
doesn t return a value from a block, or the left side of a
scalar comma operator. Very often this points not to
stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl to parse your
program the way you thought it would. For example, youd get
this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python
precedence and said</p>

<p>$one, $two = 1, 2;</p>

<p>when you meant to say</p>

<p>($one, $two) = (1, 2);</p>

<p>Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to
construct a list reference when you should be using square
or curly brackets, for example, if you say</p>

<p>$array = (1,2);</p>

<p>when you should have said</p>

<p>$array = [1,2];</p>

<p>The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a
scalar value, while parentheses do not. So when a
parenthesized list is evaluated in a scalar context, the
comma is treated like Cs comma operator, which throws away
the left argument, which is not what you want. See perlref
for more on this.</p>

<p>This warning will not be issued for numerical constants
equal to 0 or 1 since they are often used in statements
like</p>

<p>1 while sub_with_side_effects();</p>

<p>String constants that would normally evaluate to 0 or 1
are warned about.</p>

<p>Useless use of &quot;re&quot; pragma (W) You did
&quot;use re;&quot; without any arguments. That isnt very
use- ful.</p>

<p>Useless use of sort in scalar context (W void) You used
sort in scalar context, as in :</p>

<p>my $x = sort @y;</p>

<p>This is not very useful, and perl currently optimizes
this away.</p>

<p>Useless use of %s with no values (W syntax) You used the
push() or unshift() function with no argu- ments apart from
the array, like &quot;push(@x)&quot; or
&quot;unshift(@foo)&quot;. That wont usually have any effect
on the array, so is completely useless. It s possible in
principle that push(@tied_array) could have some effect if
the array is tied to a class which implements a PUSH method.
If so, you can write it as &quot;push(@tied_array,())&quot;
to avoid this warning.</p>

<p>&quot;use&quot; not allowed in expression (F) The
&quot;use&quot; keyword is recognized and executed at
compile time, and returns no useful value. See perlmod.</p>

<p>Use of bare &lt;&lt; to mean &lt;&lt;&quot;&quot; is
deprecated (D deprecated) You are now encouraged to use the
explicitly quoted form if you wish to use an empty line as
the terminator of the here-document.</p>

<p>Use of chdir() or chdir(undef) as chdir() deprecated (D
deprecated) chdir() with no arguments is documented to
change to $ENV{HOME} or $ENV{LOGDIR}. chdir(undef) and
chdir() share this behavior, but that has been deprecated.
In future versions they will simply fail.</p>

<p>Be careful to check that what you pass to chdir() is
defined and not blank, else you might find yourself in your
home directory.</p>

<p>Use of /c modifier is meaningless in s/// (W regexp) You
used the /c modifier in a substitution. The /c mod- ifier is
not presently meaningful in substitutions.</p>

<p>Use of /c modifier is meaningless without /g (W regexp)
You used the /c modifier with a regex operand, but didn t
use the /g modifier. Currently, /c is meaningful only when
/g is used. (This may change in the future.)</p>

<p>Use of freed value in iteration (F) Perhaps you modified
the iterated array within the loop? This error is typically
caused by code like the following:</p>

<p>@a = (3,4); @a = () for (1,2,@a);</p>

<p>You are not supposed to modify arrays while they are
being iterated over. For speed and efficiency reasons, Perl
internally does not do full reference-counting of iterated
items, hence deleting such an item in the middle of an
iteration causes Perl to see a freed value.</p>

<p>Use of *glob{FILEHANDLE} is deprecated (D deprecated)
You are now encouraged to use the shorter *glob{IO} form to
access the filehandle slot within a typeglob.</p>

<p>Use of /g modifier is meaningless in split (W regexp)
You used the /g modifier on the pattern for a
&quot;split&quot; operator. Since &quot;split&quot; always
tries to match the pattern repeat- edly, the &quot;/g&quot;
has no effect.</p>

<p>Use of implicit split to @_ is deprecated (D deprecated)
It makes a lot of work for the compiler when you clobber a
subroutines argument list, so its better if you assign the
results of a split() explicitly to an array (or list).</p>

<p>Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is
deprecated (D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature,
&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; subrou- tines are looked up as methods
(using the @ISA hierarchy) even when the subroutines to be
autoloaded were called as plain functions (e.g.
&quot;Foo::bar()&quot;), not as methods (e.g.
&quot;Foo-&gt;bar()&quot; or
&quot;$obj-&gt;bar()&quot;).</p>

<p>This bug will be rectified in future by using method
lookup only for methods &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;s. However,
there is a significant base of existing code that may be
using the old behavior. So, as an interim step, Perl
currently issues an optional warning when non- methods use
inherited &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;s.</p>

<p>The simple rule is: Inheritance will not work when
autoloading non-methods. The simple fix for old code is: In
any module that used to depend on inheriting
&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; for non-methods from a base class named
&quot;BaseClass&quot;, execute &quot;*AUTOLOAD = Base-
Class::AUTOLOAD&quot; during startup.</p>

<p>In code that currently says &quot;use AutoLoader; @ISA =
qw(AutoLoader);&quot; you should remove AutoLoader from @ISA
and change &quot;use AutoLoader;&quot; to &quot;use
AutoLoader &rsquo;AUTOLOAD&rsquo;;&quot;.</p>

<p>Use of %s in printf format not supported (F) You
attempted to use a feature of printf that is accessible from
only C. This usually means theres a better way to do it in
Perl.</p>

<p>Use of $* is deprecated (D deprecated) This variable
magically turned on multi-line pattern matching, both for
you and for any luckless subroutine that you happen to call.
You should use the new &quot;//m&quot; and &quot;//s&quot;
modifiers now to do that without the dangerous
action-at-a-distance effects of $*.</p>

<p>Use of $# is deprecated (D deprecated) This was an
ill-advised attempt to emulate a poorly defined awk feature.
Use an explicit printf() or sprintf() instead.</p>

<p>Use of %s is deprecated (D deprecated) The construct
indicated is no longer recommended for use, generally
because theres a better way to do it, and also because the
old way has bad side effects.</p>

<p>Use of -l on filehandle %s (W io) A filehandle
represents an opened file, and when you opened the file it
already went past any symlink you are presumably trying to
look for. The operation returned &quot;undef&quot;. Use a
filename instead.</p>

<p>Use of &quot;package&quot; with no arguments is
deprecated (D deprecated) You used the &quot;package&quot;
keyword without specifying a package name. So no namespace
is current at all. Using this can cause many otherwise
reasonable constructs to fail in baffling ways. &quot;use
strict;&quot; instead.</p>

<p>Use of reference &quot;%s&quot; as array index (W misc)
You tried to use a reference as an array index; this prob-
ably isn t what you mean, because references in numerical
context tend to be huge numbers, and so usually indicates
programmer error.</p>

<p>If you really do mean it, explicitly numify your
reference, like so: $array[0+$ref]. This warning is not
given for overloaded objects, either, because you can
overload the numification and stringification operators and
then you assumedly know what you are doing.</p>

<p>Use of reserved word &quot;%s&quot; is deprecated (D
deprecated) The indicated bareword is a reserved word.
Future versions of perl may use it as a keyword, so youre
better off either explicitly quoting the word in a manner
appropriate for its context of use, or using a different
name altogether. The warning can be suppressed for
subroutine names by either adding a &quot;&amp;&quot; pre-
fix, or using a package qualifier, e.g.
&quot;&amp;our()&quot;, or &quot;Foo::our()&quot;.</p>

<p>Use of tainted arguments in %s is deprecated (W taint,
deprecated) You have supplied &quot;system()&quot; or
&quot;exec()&quot; with multiple arguments and at least one
of them is tainted. This used to be allowed but will become
a fatal error in a future version of perl. Untaint your
arguments. See perlsec.</p>

<p>Use of uninitialized value%s (W uninitialized) An
undefined value was used as if it were already defined. It
was interpreted as a &quot;&quot; or a 0, but maybe it was a
mistake. To suppress this warning assign a defined value to
your variables.</p>

<p>To help you figure out what was undefined, perl tells
you what operation you used the undefined value in. Note,
however, that perl optimizes your program and the operation
displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear
literally in your program. For example, &quot;that
$foo&quot; is usually optimized into &quot;&quot;that &quot;
. $foo&quot;, and the warning will refer to the
&quot;concatenation (.)&quot; operator, even though there is
no &quot;.&quot; in your program.</p>

<p>Using a hash as a reference is deprecated (D deprecated)
You tried to use a hash as a reference, as in
&quot;%foo-&gt;{&quot;bar&quot;}&quot; or
&quot;%$ref-&gt;{&quot;hello&quot;}&quot;. Versions of perl
&lt;= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax, but shouldnt have. It
is now depre- cated, and will be removed in a future
version.</p>

<p>Using an array as a reference is deprecated (D
deprecated) You tried to use an array as a reference, as in
&quot;@foo-&gt;[23]&quot; or &quot;@$ref-&gt;[99]&quot;.
Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax, but
shouldn t have. It is now deprecated, and will be removed in
a future version.</p>

<p>UTF-16 surrogate %s (W utf8) You tried to generate half
of an UTF-16 surrogate by requesting a Unicode character
between the code points 0xD800 and 0xDFFF (inclusive). That
range is reserved exclusively for the use of UTF-16 encoding
(by having two 16-bit UCS-2 characters); but Perl encodes
its characters in UTF-8, so what you got is a very illegal
character. If you really know what you are doing you can
turn off this warning by &quot;no warnings
&rsquo;utf8&rsquo;;&quot;.</p>

<p>Value of %s can be &quot;0&quot;; test with defined() (W
misc) In a conditional expression, you used &lt;HANDLE&gt;,
&lt;*&gt; (glob), &quot;each()&quot;, or
&quot;readdir()&quot; as a boolean value. Each of these
constructs can return a value of &quot;0&quot;; that would
make the condi- tional expression false, which is probably
not what you intended. When using these constructs in
conditional expressions, test their values with the
&quot;defined&quot; operator.</p>

<p>Value of CLI symbol &quot;%s&quot; too long (W misc) A
warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read the value of an
%ENV element from a CLI symbol table, and found a resultant
string longer than 1024 characters. The return value has
been truncated to 1024 characters.</p>

<p>Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not imported%s (F) While
&quot;use strict&quot; in effect, you referred to a global
variable that you apparently thought was imported from
another module, because something else of the same name
(usually a subroutine) is exported by that module. It
usually means you put the wrong funny character on the front
of your variable.</p>

<p>Variable length lookbehind not implemented in regex;
marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/ (F) Lookbehind is allowed
only for subexpressions whose length is fixed and known at
compile time. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered. See
perlre.</p>

<p>&quot;%s&quot; variable %s masks earlier declaration in
same %s (W misc) A &quot;my&quot; or &quot;our&quot;
variable has been redeclared in the cur- rent scope or
statement, effectively eliminating all access to the
previous instance. This is almost always a typographical
error. Note that the earlier variable will still exist until
the end of the scope or until all closure referents to it
are destroyed.</p>

<p>Variable &quot;%s&quot; may be unavailable (W closure)
An inner (nested) anonymous subroutine is inside a named
subroutine, and outside that is another subroutine; and the
anonymous (innermost) subroutine is referencing a lexical
variable defined in the outermost subroutine. For
example:</p>

<p>sub outermost { my $a; sub middle { sub { $a } } }</p>

<p>If the anonymous subroutine is called or referenced
(directly or indirectly) from the outermost subroutine, it
will share the vari- able as you would expect. But if the
anonymous subroutine is called or referenced when the
outermost subroutine is not active, it will see the value of
the shared variable as it was before and during the *first*
call to the outermost subroutine, which is prob- ably not
what you want.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, it is usually best to make the
middle sub- routine anonymous, using the &quot;sub {}&quot;
syntax. Perl has specific support for shared variables in
nested anonymous subroutines; a named subroutine in between
interferes with this feature.</p>

<p>Variable syntax (A) Youve accidentally run your script
through csh instead of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually
feed your script into Perl yourself.</p>

<p>Variable &quot;%s&quot; will not stay shared (W closure)
An inner (nested) named subroutine is referencing a lexical
variable defined in an outer subroutine.</p>

<p>When the inner subroutine is called, it will probably
see the value of the outer subroutines variable as it was
before and during the *first* call to the outer subroutine;
in this case, after the first call to the outer subroutine
is complete, the inner and outer sub- routines will no
longer share a common value for the variable. In other
words, the variable will no longer be shared.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if the outer subroutine is anonymous and
references a lexical variable outside itself, then the outer
and inner subrou- tines will never share the given
variable.</p>

<p>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner
subroutine anonymous, using the &quot;sub {}&quot; syntax.
When inner anonymous subs that reference variables in outer
subroutines are called or refer- enced, they are
automatically rebound to the current values of such
variables.</p>

<p>Version number must be a constant number (P) The attempt
to translate a &quot;use Module n.n LIST&quot; statement
into its equivalent &quot;BEGIN&quot; block found an
internal inconsistency with the version number.</p>

<p>Warning: somethings wrong (W) You passed warn() an empty
string (the equivalent of &quot;warn &quot;&quot;&quot;) or
you called it with no args and $_ was empty.</p>

<p>Warning: unable to close filehandle %s properly (S) The
implicit close() done by an open() got an error indication
on the close(). This usually indicates your file system ran
out of disk space.</p>

<p>Warning: Use of &quot;%s&quot; without parentheses is
ambiguous (S ambiguous) You wrote a unary operator followed
by something that looks like a binary operator that could
also have been interpreted as a term or unary operator. For
instance, if you know that the rand function has a default
argument of 1.0, and you write</p>

<p>rand + 5;</p>

<p>you may THINK you wrote the same thing as</p>

<p>rand() + 5;</p>

<p>but in actual fact, you got</p>

<p>rand(+5);</p>

<p>So put in parentheses to say what you really mean.</p>

<p>Wide character in %s (W utf8) Perl met a wide character
(&gt;255) when it wasn t expecting one. This warning is by
default on for I/O (like print). The eas- iest way to quiet
this warning is simply to add the &quot;:utf8&quot; layer to
the output, e.g. &quot;binmode STDOUT,
&rsquo;:utf8&rsquo;&quot;. Another way to turn off the
warning is to add &quot;no warnings
&rsquo;utf8&rsquo;;&quot; but that is often closer to
cheating. In general, you are supposed to explicitly mark
the filehandle with an encoding, see open and
&quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>Within []-length %c not allowed (F) The count in the
(un)pack template may be replaced by &quot;[TEM-
PLATE]&quot; only if &quot;TEMPLATE&quot; always matches the
same amount of packed bytes that can be determined from the
template alone. This is not possible if it contains an of
the codes @, /, U, u, w or a *-length. Redesign the
template.</p>

<p>write() on closed filehandle %s (W closed) The
filehandle youre writing to got itself closed some- time
before now. Check your control flow.</p>

<p>%s &quot;s&quot; does not map to Unicode When reading in
different encodings Perl tries to map everything into
Unicode characters. The bytes you read in are not legal in
this encoding, for example</p>

<p>utf8 &quot; does not map to Unicode</p>

<p>if you try to read in the a-diaereses Latin-1 as
UTF-8.</p>

<p>X outside of string (F) You had a (un)pack template that
specified a relative position before the beginning of the
string being (un)packed. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>x outside of string in unpack (F) You had a pack
template that specified a relative position after the end of
the string being unpacked. See &quot;pack&quot; in perl-
func.</p>

<p>YOU HAVENT DISABLED SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!
(F) And you probably never will, because you probably dont
have the sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably
doesnt give a rip about what you want. Your best bet is to
put a setuid C wrap- per around your script.</p>

<p>You need to quote &quot;%s&quot; (W syntax) You assigned
a bareword as a signal handler name. Unfortunately, you
already have a subroutine of that name declared, which means
that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the
assignment is executed, which is probably not what you want.
(If it IS what you want, put an &amp; in front.)</p>

<p>Your random numbers are not that random (F) When trying
to initialise the random seed for hashes, Perl could not get
any randomness out of your system. This usually indicates
Something Very Wrong.</p>
