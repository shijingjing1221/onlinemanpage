<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) CRASH(8) CRASH(8)</p>

<p>NAME crash - Analyze Linux crash dump data or a live
system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS crash [OPTION]... NAMELIST MEMORY-IMAGE
(dumpfile form) crash [OPTION]... [NAMELIST] (live system
form)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Crash is a tool for interactively analyzing
the state of the Linux sys- tem while it is running, or
after a kernel crash has occurred and a core dump has been
created by the netdump, diskdump, LKCD, kdump, xen- dump or
kvmdump facilities. It is loosely based on the SVR4 UNIX
crash command, but has been significantly enhanced by
completely merging it with the gdb(1) debugger. The marriage
of the two effectively combines the kernel-specific nature
of the traditional UNIX crash utility with the source code
level debugging capabilities of gdb(1).</p>

<p>In the dumpfile form, both a NAMELIST and a MEMORY-IMAGE
argument must be entered. In the live system form, the
NAMELIST argument must be entered if the kernels vmlinux
file is not located in a known loca- tion, such as the
/usr/lib/debug/lib/modules/&lt;kernel-version&gt; direc-
tory.</p>

<p>The crash utility has also been extended to support the
analysis of dumpfiles generated by a crash of the Xen
hypervisor. In that case, the NAMELIST argument must be that
of the xen-syms binary. Live system analysis is not
supported for the Xen hypervisor.</p>

<p>The crash utility command set consists of common kernel
core analysis tools such as kernel stack back traces of all
processes, source code disassembly, formatted kernel
structure and variable displays, virtual memory data, dumps
of linked-lists, etc., along with several commands that
delve deeper into specific kernel subsystems. Appropriate
gdb commands may also be entered, which in turn are passed
on to the gdb module for execution. If desired, commands may
be placed in either a $HOME/.crashrc file and/or in a
.crashrc file in the current directory. During
initialization, the commands in $HOME/.crashrc are executed
first, followed by those in the ./.crashrc file.</p>

<p>The crash utility is designed to be independent of Linux
version depen- dencies. When new kernel source code impacts
the correct functionality of crash and its command set, the
utility will be updated to recognize new kernel code
changes, while maintaining backwards compatibility with
earlier releases.</p>

<p>OPTIONS NAMELIST This is a pathname to an uncompressed
kernel image (a vmlinux file), or a Xen hypervisor image (a
xen-syms file) which has been compiled with the
&quot;-g&quot; option. If using the dumpfile form, a vmlinux
file may be compressed in either gzip or bzip2 for-
mats.</p>

<p>MEMORY-IMAGE A kernel core dump file created by the
netdump, diskdump, LKCD kdump, xendump or kvmdump
facilities.</p>

<p>If a MEMORY-IMAGE argument is not entered, the session
will be invoked on the live system, which typically requires
root privi- leges because of the device file used to access
system RAM. By default, /dev/crash will be used if it
exists. If it does not exist, then /dev/mem will be used;
but if the kernel has been configured with
CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, then /proc/kcore will be used. It is
permissible to explicitly enter /dev/crash, /dev/mem or
/proc/kcore.</p>

<p>mapfile If the NAMELIST file is not the same kernel that
is running (live system form), or the kernel that was
running when the sys- tem crashed (dumpfile form), then the
System.map file of the original kernel should be entered on
the command line.</p>

<p>-h [option] --help [option] Without an option argument,
display a crash usage help message. If the option argument
is a crash command name, the help page for that command is
displayed. If it is the string &quot;input&quot;, a page
describing the various crash command line input options is
displayed. If it is the string &quot;output&quot;, a page
describing com- mand line output options is displayed. After
the help message is displayed, crash exits.</p>

<p>-s Proceed directly to the &quot;crash&gt;&quot; prompt
without displaying any version, GPL, or crash initialization
data during startup.</p>

<p>-i file Execute the command(s) contained in file prior
to displaying the &quot;crash&gt;&quot; prompt for
interactive user input.</p>

<p>-d num Set the internal debug level. The higher the
number, the more debugging data will be printed when crash
initializes and runs.</p>

<p>-S Use /boot/System.map as the mapfile.</p>

<p>-e vi | emacs Set the readline(3) command line editing
mode to &quot;vi&quot; or &quot;emacs&quot;. The default
editing mode is &quot;vi&quot;.</p>

<p>-f Force the usage of a compressed vmlinux file if its
original name does not start with &quot;vmlinux&quot;.</p>

<p>-k Indicate that the NAMELIST file is an LKCD
&quot;Kerntypes&quot; debuginfo file.</p>

<p>-t Display the system-crash timestamp and exit.</p>

<p>-L Attempt to lock all of its virtual address space into
memory by calling mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE) during
initialization. If the system call fails, an error message
will be displayed, but the session continues.</p>

<p>-c tty-device Open the tty-device as the console used
for debug messages.</p>

<p>-p page-size If a processors page size cannot be
determined by the dumpfile, and the processor default cannot
be used, use page-size.</p>

<p>-m option=value --machdep option=value Pass an option
and value pair to machine-dependent code. These
architecture-specific option/pairs should only be required
in very rare circumstances:</p>

<p>X86_64: physbase=&lt;physical-address&gt;
irq_eframe_link=&lt;value&gt; max_physmem_bits=&lt;value&gt;
vm=orig (pre-2.6.11 virtual memory address ranges) vm=2.6.11
(2.6.11 and later virtual memory address ranges) vm=xen (Xen
kernel virtual memory address ranges) vm=xen-rhel4 (RHEL4
Xen kernel virtual address ranges) PPC64: vm=orig vm=2.6.14
(4-level page tables) IA64:
phys_start=&lt;physical-address&gt;
init_stack_size=&lt;size&gt; vm=4l (4-level page tables)
ARM: physbase=&lt;physical-address&gt;</p>

<p>-x Automatically load extension modules from a
particular direc- tory. If a directory is specified in the
CRASH_EXTENSIONS shell environment variable, then that
directory will be used. Other- wise
/usr/lib64/crash/extensions (64-bit architectures) or
/usr/lib/crash/extensions (32-bit architectures) will be
used; if they do not exist, then the ./extensions directory
will be used.</p>

<p>--memory_module modname Use the modname as an
alternative kernel module to the crash.ko module that
creates the /dev/crash device.</p>

<p>--memory_device device Use device as an alternative
device to the /dev/crash, /dev/mem or /proc/kcore
devices.</p>

<p>--no_kallsyms Do not use kallsyms-generated symbol
information contained within kernel module object files.</p>

<p>--no_modules Do not access or display any kernel module
related information.</p>

<p>--no_ikconf Do not attempt to read configuration data
that was built into kernels configured with
CONFIG_IKCONFIG.</p>

<p>--no_data_debug Do not verify the validity of all
structure member offsets and structure sizes that it
uses.</p>

<p>--no_kmem_cache Do not initialize the kernel s slab
cache infrastructure, and commands that use
kmem_cache-related data will not work.</p>

<p>--no_elf_notes Do not use the registers from the ELF
NT_PRSTATUS notes saved in a compressed kdump header for
backtraces.</p>

<p>--kmem_cache_delay Delay the initialization of the
kernels slab cache infrastruc- ture until it is required by
a run-time command.</p>

<p>--readnow Pass this flag to the embedded gdb module,
which will override its two-stage strategy that it uses for
reading symbol tables from the NAMELIST.</p>

<p>--smp Specify that the system being analyzed is an SMP
kernel.</p>

<p>-v --version Display the version of the crash utility,
the version of the embedded gdb module, GPL information, and
copyright notices.</p>

<p>--cpus number Specify the number of cpus in the SMP
system being analyzed.</p>

<p>--osrelease dumpfile Display the OSRELEASE vmcoreinfo
string from a kdump dumpfile header.</p>

<p>--hyper Force the session to be that of a Xen
hypervisor.</p>

<p>--p2m_mfn pfn When a Xen Hypervisor or its dom0 kernel
crashes, the dumpfile is typically analyzed with either the
Xen hypervisor or the dom0 kernel. It is also possible to
analyze any of the guest domU kernels if the
pfn_to_mfn_list_list pfn value of the guest ker- nel is
passed on the command line along with its NAMELIST and the
dumpfile.</p>

<p>--xen_phys_start physical-address Supply the base
physical address of the Xen hypervisors text and static data
for older xendump dumpfiles that did not pass that
information in the dumpfile header.</p>

<p>--zero_excluded If a kdump dumpfile has been filtered to
exclude various types of non-essential pages, any attempt to
read them will fail. With this flag, reads from any of those
pages will return zero- filled memory.</p>

<p>--no_panic Do not attempt to find the task that was
running when the kernel crashed. Set the initial context to
that of the &quot;swapper&quot; task on cpu 0.</p>

<p>--more Use /bin/more as the command output scroller,
overriding the default of /usr/bin/less and any settings in
either ./.crashrc or $HOME/.crashrc.</p>

<p>--less Use /usr/bin/less as the command output scroller,
overriding any settings in either ./.crashrc or
$HOME/.crashrc.</p>

<p>--CRASHPAGER Use the output paging command defined in
the CRASHPAGER shell environment variable, overriding any
settings in either ./.crashrc or $HOME/.crashrc.</p>

<p>--no_scroll Do not pass run-time command output to any
scrolling command.</p>

<p>--no_crashrc Do not execute the commands in either
$HOME/.crashrc or ./.crashrc.</p>

<p>--mod directory When loading the debuginfo data of
kernel modules with the mod -S command, search for their
object files in directory instead of in the standard
location.</p>

<p>--reloc size When analyzing live x86 kernels that were
configured with a CON- FIG_PHYSICAL_START value that is
larger than its CONFIG_PHYSI- CAL_ALIGN value, then it will
be necessary to enter a relocation size equal to the
difference between the two values.</p>

<p>--minimal Bring up a session that is restricted to the
log, dis, rd, sym, eval, set and exit commands. This option
may provide a way to extract some minimal/quick information
from a corrupted or trun- cated dumpfile, or in situations
where one of the several kernel subsystem initialization
routines would abort the crash session.</p>

<p>--kvmhost [32|64] When examining an x86 KVM guest
dumpfile, this option specifies that the KVM host that
created the dumpfile was an x86 (32-bit) or an x86_64
(64-bit) machine, overriding the automatically determined
value.</p>

<p>--kvmio &lt;size&gt; override the
automatically-calculated KVM guest I/O hole size.</p>

<p>COMMANDS Each crash command generally falls into one of
the following cate- gories:</p>

<p>Symbolic display Displays of kernel text/data, which
take full advantage of the power of gdb to format and
display data structures symbolically.</p>

<p>System state The majority of crash commands consist of a
set of &quot;kernel- aware&quot; commands, which delve into
various kernel subsystems on a system-wide or per-task
basis.</p>

<p>Utility functions A set of useful helper commands
serving various purposes, some simple, others quite
powerful.</p>

<p>Session control Commands that control the crash session
itself.</p>

<p>The following alphabetical list consists of a very
simple overview of each crash command. However, since
individual commands often have sev- eral options resulting
in significantly different output, it is sug- gested that
the full description of each command be viewed by executing
crash -h &lt;command&gt;, or during a crash session by
simply entering help command.</p>

<p>* &quot;pointer to&quot; is shorthand for either the
struct or union com- mands. It displays the contents of a
kernel structure or union.</p>

<p>alias creates a single-word alias for a command.</p>

<p>ascii displays an ascii chart or translates a numeric
value into its ascii components.</p>

<p>bt displays a tasks kernel-stack backtrace. If it is
given the -a option, it displays the stack traces of the
active tasks on all CPUs. It is often used with the foreach
command to display the backtraces of all tasks with one
command.</p>

<p>btop translates a byte value (physical offset) to its
page number.</p>

<p>dev displays data concerning the character and block
device assign- ments, I/O port usage, I/O memory usage, and
PCI device data.</p>

<p>dis disassembles memory, either entire kernel functions,
from a location for a specified number of instructions, or
from the start of a function up to a specified memory
location.</p>

<p>eval evaluates an expression or numeric type and
displays the result in hexadecimal, decimal, octal and
binary.</p>

<p>exit causes crash to exit.</p>

<p>extend dynamically loads or unloads crash shared object
extension mod- ules.</p>

<p>files displays information about open files in a
context.</p>

<p>foreach repeats a specified command for the specified
(or all) tasks in the system.</p>

<p>fuser displays the tasks using the specified file or
socket.</p>

<p>gdb passes its argument to the embedded gdb module. It
is useful for executing gdb commands that have the same name
as crash com- mands.</p>

<p>help alone displays the command menu; if followed by a
command name, a full description of a command, its options,
and examples are displayed. Its output is far more complete
and useful than this man page.</p>

<p>irq displays data concerning interrupt request numbers
and bottom- half interrupt handling.</p>

<p>kmem displays information about the use of kernel
memory.</p>

<p>list displays the contents of a linked list.</p>

<p>log displays the kernel log_buf contents in
chronological order.</p>

<p>mach displays data specific to the machine type.</p>

<p>mod displays information about the currently installed
kernel mod- ules, or adds or deletes symbolic or debugging
information about specified kernel modules.</p>

<p>mount displays information about the currently-mounted
filesystems.</p>

<p>net display various network related data.</p>

<p>p passes its arguments to the gdb &quot;print&quot;
command for evaluation and display.</p>

<p>ps displays process status for specified, or all,
processes in the system.</p>

<p>pte translates the hexadecimal contents of a PTE into
its physical page address and page bit settings.</p>

<p>ptob translates a page frame number to its byte
value.</p>

<p>ptov translates a hexadecimal physical address into a
kernel virtual address.</p>

<p>q is an alias for the &quot;exit&quot; command.</p>

<p>rd displays the contents of memory, with the output
formatted in several different manners.</p>

<p>repeat repeats a command indefinitely, optionally
delaying a given num- ber of seconds between each command
execution.</p>

<p>runq displays the tasks on the run queue.</p>

<p>search searches a range of user or kernel memory space
for given value.</p>

<p>set either sets a new context, or gets the current
context for dis- play.</p>

<p>sig displays signal-handling data of one or more
tasks.</p>

<p>struct displays either a structure definition or the
contents of a ker- nel structure at a specified address.</p>

<p>swap displays information about each configured swap
device.</p>

<p>sym translates a symbol to its virtual address, or a
static kernel virtual address to its symbol -- or to a
symbol-plus-offset value, if appropriate.</p>

<p>sys displays system-specific data.</p>

<p>task displays the contents of a task_struct.</p>

<p>timer displays the timer queue entries, both old- and
new-style, in chronological order.</p>

<p>union is similar to the struct command, except that it
works on kernel unions.</p>

<p>vm displays basic virtual memory information of a
context.</p>

<p>vtop translates a user or kernel virtual address to its
physical address.</p>

<p>waitq walks the wait queue list displaying the tasks
which are blocked on the specified wait queue.</p>

<p>whatis displays the definition of structures, unions,
typedefs or text/data symbols.</p>

<p>wr modifies the contents of memory on a live system. It
can only be used if /dev/mem is the device file being used
to access sys- tem RAM, and should obviously be used with
great care.</p>

<p>When crash is invoked with a Xen hypervisor binary as
the NAMELIST, the command set is slightly modified. The *,
alias, ascii, bt, dis, eval, exit, extend, gdb, help, list,
log, p, pte, rd, repeat, search, set, struct, sym, sys,
union, whatis, wr and q commands are the same as above. The
following commands are specific to the Xen hypervisor:</p>

<p>domain displays the contents of the domain structure for
selected, or all, domains.</p>

<p>doms displays domain status for selected, or all,
domains.</p>

<p>dumpinfo displays Xen dump information for selected, or
all, cpus.</p>

<p>pcpus displays physical cpu information for selected, or
all, cpus.</p>

<p>vcpus displays vcpu status for selected, or all,
vcpus.</p>

<p>FILES .crashrc Initialization commands. The file can be
located in the users HOME directory and/or the current
directory. Commands found in the .crashrc file in the HOME
directory are executed before those in the current
directorys .crashrc file.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT EDITOR Command input is read using
readline(3). If EDITOR is set to emacs or vi then suitable
keybindings are used. If EDITOR is not set, then vi is used.
This can be overridden by set vi or set emacs commands
located in a .crashrc file, or by entering -e emacs on the
crash command line.</p>

<p>CRASHPAGER If CRASHPAGER is set, its value is used as
the name of the pro- gram to which command output will be
sent. If not, then command output is sent to /usr/bin/less
-E -X by default.</p>

<p>CRASH_MODULE_PATH Specifies an alternative directory
tree to search for kernel module object files.</p>

<p>CRASH_EXTENSIONS Specifies a directory containing
extension modules that will be loaded automatically if the
-x command line option is used.</p>

<p>NOTES If crash does not work, look for a newer version:
kernel evolution fre- quently makes crash updates
necessary.</p>

<p>The command set scroll off will cause output to be sent
directly to the terminal rather than through a paging
program. This is useful, for example, if you are running
crash in a window of emacs.</p>
