<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>NAME cpp - The C Preprocessor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cpp [-Dmacro[=defn]...] [-Umacro] [-Idir...]
[-iquotedir...] [-Wwarn...] [-M-MM] [-MG] [-MF filename]
[-MP] [-MQ target...] [-MT target...] [-P]
[-fno-working-directory] [-x language] [-std=standard]
infile outfile</p>

<p>Only the most useful options are listed here; see below
for the remain- der.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The C preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a
macro processor that is used automatically by the C compiler
to transform your program before compilation. It is called a
macro processor because it allows you to define macros,
which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.</p>

<p>The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C,
C++, and Objec- tive-C source code. In the past, it has been
abused as a general text processor. It will choke on input
which does not obey Cs lexical rules. For example,
apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning of
character constants, and cause errors. Also, you cannot rely
on it preserving characteristics of the input which are not
significant to C-family languages. If a Makefile is
preprocessed, all the hard tabs will be removed, and the
Makefile will not work.</p>

<p>Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp
on things which are not C. Other Algol-ish programming
languages are often safe (Pas- cal, Ada, etc.) So is
assembly, with caution. -traditional-cpp mode preserves more
white space, and is otherwise more permissive. Many of the
problems can be avoided by writing C or C++ style comments
instead of native language comments, and keeping macros
simple.</p>

<p>Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared
to the language you are writing in. Modern versions of the
GNU assembler have macro facilities. Most high level
programming languages have their own con- ditional
compilation and inclusion mechanism. If all else fails, try
a true general text processor, such as GNU M4.</p>

<p>C preprocessors vary in some details. This manual
discusses the GNU C preprocessor, which provides a small
superset of the features of ISO Standard C. In its default
mode, the GNU C preprocessor does not do a few things
required by the standard. These are features which are
rarely, if ever, used, and may cause surprising changes to
the meaning of a program which does not expect them. To get
strict ISO Standard C, you should use the -std=c89 or
-std=c99 options, depending on which version of the standard
you want. To get all the mandatory diagnos- tics, you must
also use -pedantic.</p>

<p>This manual describes the behavior of the ISO
preprocessor. To mini- mize gratuitous differences, where
the ISO preprocessor s behavior does not conflict with
traditional semantics, the traditional preprocessor should
behave the same way. The various differences that do exist
are detailed in the section Traditional Mode.</p>

<p>For clarity, unless noted otherwise, references to CPP
in this manual refer to GNU CPP.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The C preprocessor expects two file names as
arguments, infile and out- file. The preprocessor reads
infile together with any other files it specifies with
#include. All the output generated by the combined input
files is written in outfile.</p>

<p>Either infile or outfile may be -, which as infile means
to read from standard input and as outfile means to write to
standard output. Also, if either file is omitted, it means
the same as if - had been specified for that file.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise noted, or the option ends in =, all
options which take an argument may have that argument appear
either immediately after the option, or with a space between
option and argument: -Ifoo and -I foo have the same
effect.</p>

<p>Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple
single-letter options may not be grouped: -dM is very
different from -d -M.</p>

<p>-D name Predefine name as a macro, with definition
1.</p>

<p>-D name=definition The contents of definition are
tokenized and processed as if they appeared during
translation phase three in a #define directive. In
particular, the definition will be truncated by embedded
newline characters.</p>

<p>If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or
shell-like program you may need to use the shells quoting
syntax to protect characters such as spaces that have a
meaning in the shell syntax.</p>

<p>If you wish to define a function-like macro on the
command line, write its argument list with surrounding
parentheses before the equals sign (if any). Parentheses are
meaningful to most shells, so you will need to quote the
option. With sh and csh, -name(args...)=definitionworks.</p>

<p>-D and -U options are processed in the order they are
given on the command line. All -imacros file and -include
file options are pro- cessed after all -D and -U
options.</p>

<p>-U name Cancel any previous definition of name, either
built in or provided with a -D option.</p>

<p>-undef Do not predefine any system-specific or
GCC-specific macros. The standard predefined macros remain
defined.</p>

<p>-I dir Add the directory dir to the list of directories
to be searched for header files.</p>

<p>Directories named by -I are searched before the standard
system include directories. If the directory dir is a
standard system include directory, the option is ignored to
ensure that the default search order for system directories
and the special treatment of system headers are not defeated
.</p>

<p>-o file Write output to file. This is the same as
specifying file as the second non-option argument to cpp.
gcc has a different interpreta- tion of a second non-option
argument, so you must use -o to specify the output file.</p>

<p>-Wall Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable
for normal code. At present this is -Wcomment, -Wtrigraphs,
-Wmultichar and a warn- ing about integer promotion causing
a change of sign in &quot;#if&quot; expressions. Note that
many of the preprocessor s warnings are on by default and
have no options to control them.</p>

<p>-Wcomment -Wcomments Warn whenever a comment-start
sequence /* appears in a /* comment, or whenever a
backslash-newline appears in a // comment. (Both forms have
the same effect.)</p>

<p>-Wtrigraphs Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the
meaning of the pro- gram. However, a trigraph that would
form an escaped newline (??/ at the end of a line) can, by
changing where the comment begins or ends. Therefore, only
trigraphs that would form escaped newlines produce warnings
inside a comment.</p>

<p>This option is implied by -Wall. If -Wall is not given,
this option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.
To get tri- graph conversion without warnings, but get the
other -Wall warn- ings, use -trigraphs -Wall
-Wno-trigraphs.</p>

<p>-Wtraditional Warn about certain constructs that behave
differently in tradi- tional and ISO C. Also warn about ISO
C constructs that have no traditional C equivalent, and
problematic constructs which should be avoided.</p>

<p>-Wimport Warn the first time #import is used.</p>

<p>-Wundef Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro
is encountered in an #if directive, outside of defined. Such
identifiers are replaced with zero.</p>

<p>-Wunused-macros Warn about macros defined in the main
file that are unused. A macro is used if it is expanded or
tested for existence at least once. The preprocessor will
also warn if the macro has not been used at the time it is
redefined or undefined.</p>

<p>Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and
macros defined in include files are not warned about.</p>

<p>Note: If a macro is actually used, but only used in
skipped condi- tional blocks, then CPP will report it as
unused. To avoid the warning in such a case, you might
improve the scope of the macros definition by, for example,
moving it into the first skipped block. Alternatively, you
could provide a dummy use with something like:</p>

<p>#if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning #endif</p>

<p>-Wendif-labels Warn whenever an #else or an #endif are
followed by text. This usually happens in code of the
form</p>

<p>#if FOO ... #else FOO ... #endif FOO</p>

<p>The second and third &quot;FOO&quot; should be in
comments, but often are not in older programs. This warning
is on by default.</p>

<p>-Werror Make all warnings into hard errors. Source code
which triggers warnings will be rejected.</p>

<p>-Wsystem-headers Issue warnings for code in system
headers. These are normally unhelpful in finding bugs in
your own code, therefore suppressed. If you are responsible
for the system library, you may want to see them.</p>

<p>-w Suppress all warnings, including those which GNU CPP
issues by default.</p>

<p>-pedantic Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in
the C standard. Some of them are left out by default, since
they trigger frequently on harmless code.</p>

<p>-pedantic-errors Issue all the mandatory diagnostics,
and make all mandatory diag- nostics into errors. This
includes mandatory diagnostics that GCC issues without
-pedantic but treats as warnings.</p>

<p>-M Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing,
output a rule suitable for make describing the dependencies
of the main source file. The preprocessor outputs one make
rule containing the object file name for that source file, a
colon, and the names of all the included files, including
those coming from -include or -imacros command line
options.</p>

<p>Unless specified explicitly (with -MT or -MQ), the
object file name consists of the basename of the source file
with any suffix replaced with object file suffix. If there
are many included files then the rule is split into several
lines using &minus;newline. The rule has no commands.</p>

<p>This option does not suppress the preprocessors debug
output, such as -dM. To avoid mixing such debug output with
the dependency rules you should explicitly specify the
dependency output file with -MF, or use an environment
variable like DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT. Debug output will still
be sent to the regular output stream as normal.</p>

<p>Passing -M to the driver implies -E, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit -w.</p>

<p>-MM Like -M but do not mention header files that are
found in system header directories, nor header files that
are included, directly or indirectly, from such a
header.</p>

<p>This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double
quotes in an #include directive does not in itself determine
whether that header will appear in -MM dependency output.
This is a slight change in semantics from GCC versions 3.0
and earlier.</p>

<p>-MF file When used with -M or -MM, specifies a file to
write the dependen- cies to. If no -MF switch is given the
preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have
sent preprocessed output.</p>

<p>When used with the driver options -MD or -MMD, -MF
overrides the default dependency output file.</p>

<p>-MG In conjunction with an option such as -M requesting
dependency gen- eration, -MG assumes missing header files
are generated files and adds them to the dependency list
without raising an error. The dependency filename is taken
directly from the &quot;#include&quot; directive without
prepending any path. -MG also suppresses preprocessed out-
put, as a missing header file renders this useless.</p>

<p>This feature is used in automatic updating of
makefiles.</p>

<p>-MP This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for
each dependency other than the main file, causing each to
depend on nothing. These dummy rules work around errors make
gives if you remove header files without updating the
Makefile to match.</p>

<p>This is typical output:</p>

<p>test.o: test.c test.h</p>

<p>test.h:</p>

<p>-MT target Change the target of the rule emitted by
dependency generation. By default CPP takes the name of the
main input file, including any path, deletes any file suffix
such as .c, and appends the plat- forms usual object suffix.
The result is the target.</p>

<p>An -MT option will set the target to be exactly the
string you specify. If you want multiple targets, you can
specify them as a single argument to -MT, or use multiple
-MT options.</p>

<p>For example, -MT$(objpfx)foo.omight give</p>

<p>$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</p>

<p>-MQ target Same as -MT, but it quotes any characters
which are special to Make. -MQ$(objpfx)foo.ogives</p>

<p>$$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</p>

<p>The default target is automatically quoted, as if it
were given with -MQ.</p>

<p>-MD -MD is equivalent to -M -MF file, except that -E is
not implied. The driver determines file based on whether an
-o option is given. If it is, the driver uses its argument
but with a suffix of .d, otherwise it take the basename of
the input file and applies a .d suffix.</p>

<p>If -MD is used in conjunction with -E, any -o switch is
understood to specify the dependency output file (but
@pxref{dashMF,,-MF}), but if used without -E, each -o is
understood to specify a target object file.</p>

<p>Since -E is not implied, -MD can be used to generate a
dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation
process.</p>

<p>-MMD Like -MD except mention only user header files, not
system header files.</p>

<p>-x c -x c++ -x objective-c -x assembler-with-cpp Specify
the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, or assembly. This
has nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions;
it merely selects which base syntax to expect. If you give
none of these options, cpp will deduce the language from the
extension of the source file: .c, .cc, .m, or .S. Some other
common extensions for C++ and assembly are also recognized.
If cpp does not recog- nize the extension, it will treat the
file as C; this is the most generic mode.</p>

<p>Note: Previous versions of cpp accepted a -lang option
which selected both the language and the standards
conformance level. This option has been removed, because it
conflicts with the -l option.</p>

<p>-std=standard -ansi Specify the standard to which the
code should conform. Currently CPP knows about C and C++
standards; others may be added in the future.</p>

<p>standard may be one of:</p>

<p>&quot;iso9899:1990&quot; &quot;c89&quot; The ISO C
standard from 1990. c89 is the customary shorthand for this
version of the standard.</p>

<p>The -ansi option is equivalent to -std=c89.</p>

<p>&quot;iso9899:199409&quot; The 1990 C standard, as
amended in 1994.</p>

<p>&quot;iso9899:1999&quot; &quot;c99&quot;
&quot;iso9899:199x&quot; &quot;c9x&quot; The revised ISO C
standard, published in December 1999. Before publication,
this was known as C9X.</p>

<p>&quot;gnu89&quot; The 1990 C standard plus GNU
extensions. This is the default.</p>

<p>&quot;gnu99&quot; &quot;gnu9x&quot; The 1999 C standard
plus GNU extensions.</p>

<p>&quot;c++98&quot; The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus
amendments.</p>

<p>&quot;gnu++98&quot; The same as -std=c++98 plus GNU
extensions. This is the default for C++ code.</p>

<p>-I- Split the include path. Any directories specified
with -I options before -I- are searched only for headers
requested with &quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;; they
are not searched for &quot;#include &lt;file&gt;&quot;. If
additional directories are specified with -I options after
the -I-, those directories are searched for all #include
directives.</p>

<p>In addition, -I- inhibits the use of the directory of
the current file directory as the first search directory for
&quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>This option has been deprecated.</p>

<p>-nostdinc Do not search the standard system directories
for header files. Only the directories you have specified
with -I options (and the directory of the current file, if
appropriate) are searched.</p>

<p>-nostdinc++ Do not search for header files in the
C++-specific standard direc- tories, but do still search the
other standard directories. (This option is used when
building the C++ library.)</p>

<p>-include file Process file as if &quot;#include
&quot;file&quot;&quot; appeared as the first line of the
primary source file. However, the first directory searched
for file is the preprocessors working directory instead of
the direc- tory containing the main source file. If not
found there, it is searched for in the remainder of the
&quot;#include &quot;...&quot;&quot; search chain as
normal.</p>

<p>If multiple -include options are given, the files are
included in the order they appear on the command line.</p>

<p>-imacros file Exactly like -include, except that any
output produced by scanning file is thrown away. Macros it
defines remain defined. This allows you to acquire all the
macros from a header without also processing its
declarations.</p>

<p>All files specified by -imacros are processed before all
files specified by -include.</p>

<p>-idirafter dir Search dir for header files, but do it
after all directories speci- fied with -I and the standard
system directories have been exhausted. dir is treated as a
system include directory.</p>

<p>-iprefix prefix Specify prefix as the prefix for
subsequent -iwithprefix options. If the prefix represents a
directory, you should include the final /.</p>

<p>-iwithprefix dir -iwithprefixbefore dir Append dir to
the prefix specified previously with -iprefix, and add the
resulting directory to the include search path. -iwithpre-
fixbefore puts it in the same place -I would; -iwithprefix
puts it where -idirafter would.</p>

<p>-isysroot dir This option is like the --sysroot option,
but applies only to header files. See the --sysroot option
for more information.</p>

<p>-isystem dir Search dir for header files, after all
directories specified by -I but before the standard system
directories. Mark it as a system directory, so that it gets
the same special treatment as is applied to the standard
system directories.</p>

<p>-iquote dir Search dir only for header files requested
with &quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;; they are not
searched for &quot;#include &lt;file&gt;&quot;, before all
directories specified by -I and before the standard system
directories.</p>

<p>-fdollars-in-identifiers Accept $ in identifiers.</p>

<p>-fextended-identifiers Accept universal character names
in identifiers. This option is experimental; in a future
version of GCC, it will be enabled by default for C99 and
C++.</p>

<p>-fpreprocessed Indicate to the preprocessor that the
input file has already been preprocessed. This suppresses
things like macro expansion, tri- graph conversion, escaped
newline splicing, and processing of most directives. The
preprocessor still recognizes and removes com- ments, so
that you can pass a file preprocessed with -C to the com-
piler without problems. In this mode the integrated
preprocessor is little more than a tokenizer for the front
ends.</p>

<p>-fpreprocessed is implicit if the input file has one of
the exten- sions .i, .ii or .mi. These are the extensions
that GCC uses for preprocessed files created by
-save-temps.</p>

<p>-ftabstop=width Set the distance between tab stops. This
helps the preprocessor report correct column numbers in
warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the line. If the
value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is
ignored. The default is 8.</p>

<p>-fexec-charset=charset Set the execution character set,
used for string and character con- stants. The default is
UTF-8. charset can be any encoding sup- ported by the
systems &quot;iconv&quot; library routine.</p>

<p>-fwide-exec-charset=charset Set the wide execution
character set, used for wide string and character constants.
The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16, whichever corresponds to
the width of &quot;wchar_t&quot;. As with -fexec-charset,
charset can be any encoding supported by the systems
&quot;iconv&quot; library routine; however, you will have
problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in
&quot;wchar_t&quot;.</p>

<p>-finput-charset=charset Set the input character set,
used for translation from the charac- ter set of the input
file to the source character set used by GCC. If the locale
does not specify, or GCC cannot get this information from
the locale, the default is UTF-8. This can be overridden by
either the locale or this command line option. Currently the
com- mand line option takes precedence if there s a
conflict. charset can be any encoding supported by the
systems &quot;iconv&quot; library rou- tine.</p>

<p>-fworking-directory Enable generation of linemarkers in
the preprocessor output that will let the compiler know the
current working directory at the time of preprocessing. When
this option is enabled, the preproces- sor will emit, after
the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the current
working directory followed by two slashes. GCC will use this
directory, when it s present in the preprocessed input, as
the directory emitted as the current working directory in
some debugging information formats. This option is
implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but
this can be inhib- ited with the negated form
-fno-working-directory. If the -P flag is present in the
command line, this option has no effect, since no
&quot;#line&quot; directives are emitted whatsoever.</p>

<p>-fno-show-column Do not print column numbers in
diagnostics. This may be necessary if diagnostics are being
scanned by a program that does not under- stand the column
numbers, such as dejagnu.</p>

<p>-A predicate=answer Make an assertion with the predicate
predicate and answer answer. This form is preferred to the
older form -A predicate(answer), which is still supported,
because it does not use shell special characters.</p>

<p>-A -predicate=answer Cancel an assertion with the
predicate predicate and answer answer.</p>

<p>-dCHARS CHARS is a sequence of one or more of the
following characters, and must not be preceded by a space.
Other characters are interpreted by the compiler proper, or
reserved for future versions of GCC, and so are silently
ignored. If you specify characters whose behavior conflicts,
the result is undefined.</p>

<p>M Instead of the normal output, generate a list of
#define direc- tives for all the macros defined during the
execution of the preprocessor, including predefined macros.
This gives you a way of finding out what is predefined in
your version of the preprocessor. Assuming you have no file
foo.h, the command</p>

<p>touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h</p>

<p>will show all the predefined macros.</p>

<p>D Like M except in two respects: it does not include the
prede- fined macros, and it outputs both the #define
directives and the result of preprocessing. Both kinds of
output go to the standard output file.</p>

<p>N Like D, but emit only the macro names, not their
expansions.</p>

<p>I Output #include directives in addition to the result
of prepro- cessing.</p>

<p>-P Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from
the preproces- sor. This might be useful when running the
preprocessor on some- thing that is not C code, and will be
sent to a program which might be confused by the
linemarkers.</p>

<p>-C Do not discard comments. All comments are passed
through to the output file, except for comments in processed
directives, which are deleted along with the directive.</p>

<p>You should be prepared for side effects when using -C;
it causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in
their own right. For example, comments appearing at the
start of what would be a directive line have the effect of
turning that line into an ordi- nary source line, since the
first token on the line is no longer a #.</p>

<p>-CC Do not discard comments, including during macro
expansion. This is like -C, except that comments contained
within macros are also passed through to the output file
where the macro is expanded.</p>

<p>In addition to the side-effects of the -C option, the
-CC option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to
be converted to C-style comments. This is to prevent later
use of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the
remainder of the source line.</p>

<p>The -CC option is generally used to support lint
comments.</p>

<p>-traditional-cpp Try to imitate the behavior of
old-fashioned C preprocessors, as opposed to ISO C
preprocessors.</p>

<p>-trigraphs Process trigraph sequences.</p>

<p>-remap Enable special code to work around file systems
which only permit very short file names, such as MS-DOS.</p>

<p>--help --target-help Print text describing all the
command line options instead of pre- processing
anything.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode. Print out GNU CPPs version number at
the beginning of execution, and report the final form of the
include path.</p>

<p>-H Print the name of each header file used, in addition
to other nor- mal activities. Each name is indented to show
how deep in the #include stack it is. Precompiled header
files are also printed, even if they are found to be
invalid; an invalid precompiled header file is printed with
...x and a valid one with ...! .</p>

<p>-version --version Print out GNU CPP s version number.
With one dash, proceed to pre- process as normal. With two
dashes, exit immediately.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT This section describes the environment
variables that affect how CPP operates. You can use them to
specify directories or prefixes to use when searching for
include files, or to control dependency output.</p>

<p>Note that you can also specify places to search using
options such as -I, and control dependency output with
options like -M. These take precedence over environment
variables, which in turn take precedence over the
configuration of GCC.</p>

<p>CPATH C_INCLUDE_PATH CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH Each variable s value is a list of
directories separated by a spe- cial character, much like
PATH, in which to look for header files. The special
character, &quot;PATH_SEPARATOR&quot;, is target-dependent
and determined at GCC build time. For Microsoft
Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for almost all
other targets it is a colon.</p>

<p>CPATH specifies a list of directories to be searched as
if speci- fied with -I, but after any paths given with -I
options on the com- mand line. This environment variable is
used regardless of which language is being preprocessed.</p>

<p>The remaining environment variables apply only when
preprocessing the particular language indicated. Each
specifies a list of direc- tories to be searched as if
specified with -isystem, but after any paths given with
-isystem options on the command line.</p>

<p>In all these variables, an empty element instructs the
compiler to search its current working directory. Empty
elements can appear at the beginning or end of a path. For
instance, if the value of CPATH is
&quot;:/special/include&quot;, that has the same effect as
-I. -I/special/include.</p>

<p>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT If this variable is set, its value
specifies how to output depen- dencies for Make based on the
non-system header files processed by the compiler. System
header files are ignored in the dependency output.</p>

<p>The value of DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT can be just a file
name, in which case the Make rules are written to that file,
guessing the target name from the source file name. Or the
value can have the form file target, in which case the rules
are written to file file using target as the target
name.</p>

<p>In other words, this environment variable is equivalent
to combin- ing the options -MM and -MF, with an optional -MT
switch too.</p>

<p>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES This variable is the same as
DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT (see above), except that system header
files are not ignored, so it implies -M rather than -MM.
However, the dependence on the main input file is
omitted.</p>
