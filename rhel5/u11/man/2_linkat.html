<p>LINKAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual LINKAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME linkat - create a file link relative to directory
file descriptors</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int linkat(int olddirfd, const char *oldpath, int
newdirfd, const char *newpath, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The linkat() system call operates in exactly
the same way as link(2), except for the differences
described in this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in oldpath is relative, then it is
interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor olddirfd (rather than relative to the
current working directory of the calling process, as is done
by link(2) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in oldpath is relative and
olddirfd is the spe- cial value AT_FDCWD, then oldpath is
interpreted relative to the cur- rent working directory of
the calling process (like link(2)).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in oldpath is absolute, then
olddirfd is ignored.</p>

<p>The interpretation of newpath is as for oldpath, except
that a relative pathname is interpreted relative to the
directory referred to by the file descriptor newdirfd.</p>

<p>The flags argument is currently unused, and must be
specified as 0.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, linkat() returns 0. On error,
-1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for link(2) can also
occur for linkat(). The following additional errors can
occur for linkat():</p>

<p>EBADF olddirfd or newdirfd is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR oldpath is a relative path and olddirfd is a
file descriptor referring to a file other than a directory;
or similar for new- path and newdirfd</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
linkat().</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is non-standard but is
proposed for inclusion in a future revision of POSIX.1.</p>

<p>VERSIONS linkat() was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16.</p>
