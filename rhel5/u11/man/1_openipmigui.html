<p>openipmigui(1) GUI interface to an IPMI system
openipmigui(1)</p>

<p>NAME openipmigui - GUI interface to an IPMI system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS openipmigui [--dmsg] [--drawmsg] [--glib12]
[--trace] [--logstderr] [-n] [-p preffile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION openipmigui is a GUI interface using the
OpenIPMI library. It provides a tree-structured view of the
IPMI domains it connected to.</p>

<p>By default openipmigui starts up with no connections or
anything of that nature. You must open connection to domains
yourself. However, you may save your current configuration
and the current domains and some GUI settings; these will be
automatically restored at startup.</p>

<p>The main window has a tree on the left and a log window
on the right. The log window captures informational and
error logs from OpenIPMI. Note that events are not reported
in the log window, you must open an SEL window for a domain
to view the events.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --dmsg Turn on message debugging, this will dump
all messages to debug log output.</p>

<p>--drawmsg Turn on raw message debugging, this will dump
all low-level mes- sages to debug log output. This differes
from normal message debugging in that all protocol messages
are also dumped, not just IPMI messages.</p>

<p>--dmem Turn on memory debugging, this will cause memory
allocation and deallocations to be checked. When the program
terminates, it will dump all memory that was not properly
freed (leaked), and overruns, writing of freed memory, or
other types of memory errors.</p>

<p>--logstderr Send all logs to standard error output as
well as the GUI con- sole.</p>

<p>--trace Turn on python tracing so that all python
procedure calls entered and exited will be printed out.</p>

<p>-n Turn off reading of the preferences file at
startup.</p>

<p>-p preffile Use preffile as the name of the preferences
file instead of $HOME/.openipmigui.startup.</p>

<p>MENU BAR The main menu bar contains two pull-down menus:
File and View.</p>

<p>The File menu contains Exit, Open Domain, and Save Prefs
commands. The Exit command does as described, and it does
not prompt to be sure you want to exit. The Open Domain
command is how you establish a connec- tion to an IPMI
system. The Save Prefs command will store the current
domains and the configuration of the main GUI window. These
settings will be restored at startup. The settings are
stored in $HOME/.openip- migui.startup; this file may be
removed to clear all the settings.</p>

<p>The View menu contains commands to expand and contract
the entire tree.</p>

<p>TREE VIEW The tree window has a top-level list of all
the domains for which OpenIPMI has connections (or pending
connection). Each domain exapands into domain-specific
information and a list of entities and Management
Controllers (MCs) for that domain.</p>

<p>Right click drives most of the operations in the tree
window. Many tree elements have pull-down menus driven by a
right mouse button click. When in doubt, click.</p>

<p>Color is used in the GUI to denote error status, and
shading is used to denote availability. If a sensor has an
error, the tree entry for that sensor will change colors.
Black means no error, yellow means warning, red means
critical, and blue means non-recoverable. These errors
propigate up, so the entity containing that sensor will be
the same color as the most critical error for the sensors
underneath it. The same goes for domain, it will be the same
color as the most critical error for the entities underneath
it. This way, if you watch the domain, you can determine if
a system is in trouble with just the top- level view, and
you can drill down to find the problem.</p>

<p>If a tree entry is shaded, it means that the entry has
information identifying it but does not exist. For instance,
a domain with no con- nection, an entity that is not
present, or an MC that is not present.</p>

<p>Note that all information visible in the tree is polled.
Only visible information is polled, so if you expose
something via expanding a tree element or scrolling, it may
be a few seconds before the data is updated.</p>

<p>DOMAINS The domains contain various high-level
information and an aggregation of all the System Event Logs
(SELs) contained within it. The SEL Res- can Time and IPMB
Rescan Time are settable via right-click; these val- ues are
remembered when saved and restored. (Note that these values
in the MC-specific entries are not saved and restore, only
the domain level ones). Right clicking on the domain gives a
set of operations, including the ability to view the
SEL.</p>

<p>ENTITIES The Entities element under the domain element
contains a list of the entities discovered for that domain.
This is only the top-level enti- ties (ones not contained in
other entities); entities contained in other entities are
listed under their parent entity. This keeps the clutter
down for very complicated systems, like ATCA.</p>

<p>If the entity is hot-swappable, hot-swap activation and
deactivation commands are available via right-click on the
entity. If the entity has FRU information, you can view that
via a right-click command, too.</p>

<p>The information under an entity also contains a sensors
and controls list for the entity.</p>

<p>SENSORS Sensors are available under the entity they
belong to. Sensor informa- tion is beyond the scope of this
document, as IPMI sensors are very complex. See the IPMI
document from OpenIPMI for information about sensors.</p>

<p>As expected, right-clicking on a sensor gives operations
available on that sensor.</p>

<p>CONTROLS Controls are available under the entity they
belong to. control infor- mation is beyond the scope of this
document, as IPMI controls are very complex. See the IPMI
document from OpenIPMI for information about controls.</p>

<p>As expected, right-clicking on a control gives
operations available on that control.</p>

<p>MANAGEMENT CONTROLLERS (MCs) An MC is the intelligent
node in an IPMI system. It is not generally required to know
about MCs for normal IPMI sensor and control opera- tions.
You do need access to MCs, though, for system
configuration.</p>

<p>An MC contains a lot of information about itself and its
capabilities; this is generally automatically interpreted by
OpenIPMI, but the infor- mation is available for view. For
instance, if an MC contains an SEL device, OpenIPMI will
automatically handle getting events from it, but you can
also view this setting under the MC information.</p>

<p>A number of operations are available under the
right-click menu on the MC; most of these are
self-explanatory. The MC is generally configured via the
Channel Info command under this.</p>

<p>CONNECTIONS A set of connections for the domain is
listed under the domain. Each connection has one or more
ports. The state of these ports may be viewed by color; if a
port is yellow (warning), it is down. If a con- nection is
red (severe), then all its ports are down. If all connec-
tions are down, the &quot;Connections&quot; tree item turns
blue (critical).</p>

<p>CHANNEL INFO If you right click on an MC, it will show a
Channel Info entry. This is used to configure the LAN and
channel information for the MC. If you select this, it will
pull up a list of channels in a tree view. Note that unlike
the main tree, this information is not dynamically updated;
it will not change if the underlying data changes.</p>

<p>To configure individual channels, expand them. The Info
settings are read only and cannot be changed. The User
Access settings can be changed by right-clicking on them.
Note that the change is not immedi- ate, you must use the
Save button at the bottom of the window to save the changes
you have made. Also, there are two versions of the User
Access settings. One is volatile, and will update the
current settings for the MC, but if the MC restart the
non-volatile settings will be restored. Setting the
non-volatile settings will not cause an immedi- ate change,
but those changes will be restored on the next MC
restart.</p>

<p>Some channels have user information; you can configure
these by select- ing that command in the right-click menu of
a channel.</p>

<p>LAN channels also have LAN configuration; you can
configure these by selecting that command in the right-click
menu of a channel.</p>

<p>USER INFO IPMI systems with remote access have users
that can be used to log in. These users are configured by
the User Info command in the channel listing. Note that some
user setting (the name and password) are global to all
channels on the MC.</p>

<p>Due to the IPMI spec and some unfortunate implementation
bugs, some wierd issues exist with this information. The
user has an Enabled value that tells whether the user is
enabled or not. When initially displayed, this field shows
as a &quot;?&quot; because this field is not read- able. It
will displayed as the actual value when it is modified, but
will not be changed otherwise.</p>

<p>There is also a session limit field that gives the
maximum number of sessions a user is allowed to make. This
field is also not readable and displays as a &quot;?&quot;
when first displayed. This field is marked as optional in
the IPMI spec, which means the field does not have to be
supplied. Some implementations, however, require this field
to be set. If you get a DataLenInv error back from your
system when setting some- thing, you must set the field to
something for any value to be set. Generally, setting it to
zero disables the field and is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>LANPARMS In the channel display on a 8023_LAN channel, a
LANPARM configuration command is available. This pulls up
all the parameters for the LAN and allows them to be set.
Right-clicking on an item allows it to be changed.</p>

<p>PEFPARMS If an MC support PEF, it will have a &quot;PEF
Parms&quot; menu item in the pull- down menu for the MC.
This pulls up all the parameters for the PEF and allows them
to be set. Right-clicking on an item allows it to be
changed.</p>

<p>SOLPARMS In the channel display on a 8023_LAN channel, a
LANPARM configuration command is available if the MC
supporte SOL (Serial Over LAN). This pulls up all the
parameters for the LAN and allows them to be set.
Right-clicking on an item allows it to be changed.</p>

<p>SOL On a connection, an &quot;Open SOL&quot; menu item
is present. If the BMC on the far end of the connection has
SOL (Serial Over LAN) support, then you can establish a
serial connection with the BMC, assuming it is config- ured
properly and you have the proper rights.</p>

<p>When you choose this, you will get a new connection with
a VT100/ANSI terminal emulator. The connection will not yet
be opened, you must open it (under the &quot;File&quot;) to
establish the connection. When the sta- tus at the bottom
right says &quot;connected&quot;, you are ready to type. If
something goes wrong, the connection may drop and you will
have to reopen it. You can also close the connection from
the file menu, or quit the emulator.</p>

<p>The &quot;Controls&quot; menu for the SOL connection
contains a large number of settings for SOL. These allow you
to manipulate various value on the remote side of the
connection. These are:</p>

<p>Accept Input If disabled, this will cause data from the
BMC to be refused, effectively flow-controlling the data
(assuming that the BMC actually supports this properly, some
dont)</p>

<p>Use Encryption Encrypt the data on the LAN using RMCP+
encryption negotiated for the connection. Only available
when the connection is closed, this cannot be changed
dynamically.</p>

<p>Use Authentication Authenticate the data on the LAN
using RMCP+ authentication negotiated for the connection.
Only available when the connec- tion is closed, this cannot
be changed dynamically.</p>

<p>Deassert CTS/DCD/DSR on connect Don t raise the lines
when a connection is made; this allows things like baud rate
to be set before the device on the far end of the serial
port knows there is a connection.</p>

<p>CTS Assertable If set, the BMC has control over the CTS
line. Otherwise, the CTS line is deasserted.</p>

<p>DCD/DSR Asserted Set the DCD and DSR lines.</p>

<p>RI Asserted Assert the Ring Indicator line, can be used
for remote wakeup on some systems (though, with IPMI, you
have to wonder why you wouldnt use IPMI for this).</p>

<p>Set Ack Timeout Sets the timeout waiting for an ACK from
the BMC.</p>

<p>Set Ack Retries Sets the number of times a packet is
retried before the connec- tion is closed.</p>

<p>Send Break Send a 300ms break signal to the remote
serial port.</p>

<p>Serial Rate Sets the bitrate on the serial port. Not all
systems support this. Some, in fact, completely ignore this
setting and use 19.2K. Note that this is only the volatile
rate. The non- volatile rate setting is done with
SOLPARM.</p>

<p>Serial Alert Behavior This sets what to do when an IPMI
alert occurs and is going out the serial port somehow. If
set to &quot;succeed&quot;, the SoL session will be
disconnected when an alert comes out.</p>

<p>Queue Flush Allows various queues to be flushed.</p>

<p>KNOWN PROBLEMS Some of missing functionality. See the
list in the swig/python/openip- migui/TODO if you want to
work on something.</p>
