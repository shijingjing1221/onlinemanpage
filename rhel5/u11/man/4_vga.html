<p>NAME vga - Generic VGA video driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;vga&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vga is an Xorg driver for generic VGA video
cards. It can drive most VGA-compatible video cards, but
only makes use of the basic standard VGA core that is common
to these cards. The driver supports depths 1, 4 and 8. All
relevant visual types are supported at each depth.
Multi-head configurations are supported in combination with
some other drivers, but only when the vga driver is driving
the primary head.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE The vga driver supports most
VGA-compatible video cards. There are some known exceptions,
and those should be listed here.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5x) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The driver auto-detects the presence of VGA-compatible
hardware. The ChipSet name may optionally be specified in
the config file &quot;Device&quot; section, and will
override the auto-detection:</p>

<p>&quot;generic&quot;</p>

<p>The driver will only use 64k of video memory for depth 1
and depth 8 operation, and 256k of video memory for depth 4
(this is the standard VGA limit).</p>

<p>When operating at depth 8, only a single built-in
320x200 video mode is available. At other depths there is
more flexibility regarding mode choice.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer. Default:
off.</p>

<p>This option is recommended for performance reasons when
running at depths 1 and 4, especially when using modern
PCI-based hard- ware. It is required when using those depths
in a multi-head configuration where one or more of the other
screens is operat- ing at a different depth.</p>
