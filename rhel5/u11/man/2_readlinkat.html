<p>READLINKAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
READLINKAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME readlinkat - read value of a symbolic link relative
to a directory file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int readlinkat(int dirfd, const char *path, char *buf,
size_t bufsiz);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The readlinkat() system call operates in
exactly the same way as read- link(2), except for the
differences described in this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in path is relative, then it is
interpreted rela- tive to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor dirfd (rather than relative to the current
working directory of the calling process, as is done by
readlink(2) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in path is relative and dirfd is
the special value AT_FDCWD, then path is interpreted
relative to the current work- ing directory of the calling
process (like readlink(2)).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in path is absolute, then dirfd is
ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, readlinkat() returns 0. On
error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for readlink(2) can
also occur for read- linkat(). The following additional
errors can occur for readlinkat():</p>

<p>EBADF dirfd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR path is a relative path and dirfd is a file
descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
readlinkat().</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is non-standard but is
proposed for inclusion in a future revision of POSIX.1.</p>

<p>VERSIONS readlinkat() was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16.</p>
