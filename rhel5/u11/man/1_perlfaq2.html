<p>PERLFAQ2(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLFAQ2(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlfaq2 - Obtaining and Learning about Perl
($Revision: 1.39 $, $Date: 2006/01/08 14:27:07 $)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This section of the FAQ answers questions
about where to find source and documentation for Perl,
support, and related matters.</p>

<p>What machines support perl? Where do I get it?</p>

<p>The standard release of perl (the one maintained by the
perl develop- ment team) is distributed only in source code
form. You can find this at
http://www.cpan.org/src/latest.tar.gz , which is in a
standard Internet format (a gzipped archive in POSIX tar
format).</p>

<p>Perl builds and runs on a bewildering number of
platforms. Virtually all known and current Unix derivatives
are supported (perl s native platform), as are other systems
like VMS, DOS, OS/2, Windows, QNX, BeOS, OS X, MPE/iX and
the Amiga.</p>

<p>Binary distributions for some proprietary platforms,
including Apple systems, can be found
http://www.cpan.org/ports/ directory. Because these are not
part of the standard distribution, they may and in fact do
differ from the base perl port in a variety of ways. Youll
have to check their respective release notes to see just
what the differences are. These differences can be either
positive (e.g. extensions for the features of the particular
platform that are not supported in the source release of
perl) or negative (e.g. might be based upon a less current
source release of perl).</p>

<p>How can I get a binary version of perl?</p>

<p>If you don t have a C compiler because your vendor for
whatever reasons did not include one with your system, the
best thing to do is grab a binary version of gcc from the
net and use that to compile perl with. CPAN only has
binaries for systems that are terribly hard to get free
compilers for, not for Unix systems.</p>

<p>Some URLs that might help you are:</p>

<p>http://www.cpan.org/ports/
http://www.perl.com/pub/language/info/software.html</p>

<p>Someone looking for a perl for Win16 might look to
Laszlo Molnars djgpp port in
http://www.cpan.org/ports/#msdos , which comes with clear
installation instructions. A simple installation guide for
MS-DOS using Ilya Zakharevichs OS/2 port is available at
http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perl5dos.html and similarly for
Windows 3.1 at http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perlwin3.html
.</p>

<p>I don t have a C compiler. How can I build my own Perl
interpreter?</p>

<p>Since you dont have a C compiler, youre doomed and your
vendor should be sacrificed to the Sun gods. But that doesnt
help you.</p>

<p>What you need to do is get a binary version of gcc for
your system first. Consult the Usenet FAQs for your
operating system for informa- tion on where to get such a
binary version.</p>

<p>I copied the perl binary from one machine to another,
but scripts dot work.</p>

<p>That s probably because you forgot libraries, or library
paths differ. You really should build the whole distribution
on the machine it will eventually live on, and then type
&quot;make install&quot;. Most other approaches are doomed
to failure.</p>

<p>One simple way to check that things are in the right
place is to print out the hard-coded @INC that perl looks
through for libraries:</p>

<p>% perl -le print for @INC</p>

<p>If this command lists any paths that dont exist on your
system, then you may need to move the appropriate libraries
to these locations, or create symbolic links, aliases, or
shortcuts appropriately. @INC is also printed as part of the
output of</p>

<p>% perl -V</p>

<p>You might also want to check out &quot;How do I keep my
own module/library directory?&quot; in perlfaq8.</p>

<p>I grabbed the sources and tried to compile but
gdbm/dynamic load- ing/malloc/linking/... failed. How do I
make it work?</p>

<p>Read the INSTALL file, which is part of the source
distribution. It describes in detail how to cope with most
idiosyncrasies that the Con- figure script can t work around
for any given system or architecture.</p>

<p>What modules and extensions are available for Perl? What
is CPAN? What does CPAN/src/... mean?</p>

<p>CPAN stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a
~1.2Gb archive replicated on nearly 200 machines all over
the world. CPAN contains source code, non-native ports,
documentation, scripts, and many third- party modules and
extensions, designed for everything from commercial database
interfaces to keyboard/screen control to web walking and CGI
scripts. The master web site for CPAN is
http://www.cpan.org/ and there is the CPAN Multiplexer at
http://www.cpan.org/CPAN.html which will choose a mirror
near you via DNS. See http://www.perl.com/CPAN (without a
slash at the end) for how this process works. Also,
http://mirror.cpan.org/ has a nice interface to the
http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY mirror directory.</p>

<p>See the CPAN FAQ at
http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html for answers to the
most frequently asked questions about CPAN including how to
become a mirror.</p>

<p>CPAN/path/... is a naming convention for files available
on CPAN sites. CPAN indicates the base directory of a CPAN
mirror, and the rest of the path is the path from that
directory to the file. For instance, if you re using
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN as your CPAN
site, the file CPAN/misc/japh is downloadable as
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/misc/japh .</p>

<p>Considering that there are close to two thousand
existing modules in the archive, one probably exists to do
nearly anything you can think of. Current categories under
CPAN/modules/by-category/ include Perl core modules;
development support; operating system interfaces; net-
working, devices, and interprocess communication; data type
utilities; database interfaces; user interfaces; interfaces
to other languages; filenames, file systems, and file
locking; internationalization and locale; world wide web
support; server and daemon utilities; archiving and
compression; image manipulation; mail and news; control flow
utili- ties; filehandle and I/O; Microsoft Windows modules;
and miscellaneous modules.</p>

<p>See http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html or
http://search.cpan.org/ for a more complete list of modules
by cate- gory.</p>

<p>CPAN is not affiliated with OReilly Media.</p>

<p>Is there an ISO or ANSI certified version of Perl?</p>

<p>Certainly not. Larry expects that he ll be certified
before Perl is.</p>

<p>Where can I get information on Perl?</p>

<p>The complete Perl documentation is available with the
Perl distribu- tion. If you have Perl installed locally, you
probably have the docu- mentation installed as well: type
&quot;man perl&quot; if youre on a system resembling Unix.
This will lead you to other important man pages, including
how to set your $MANPATH. If you re not on a Unix system,
access to the documentation will be different; for example,
documenta- tion might only be in HTML format. All proper
perl installations have fully-accessible documentation.</p>

<p>You might also try &quot;perldoc perl&quot; in case your
system doesnt have a proper man command, or its been
misinstalled. If that doesnt work, try looking in
/usr/local/lib/perl5/pod for documentation.</p>

<p>If all else fails, consult http://perldoc.perl.org/
which has the com- plete documentation in HTML and PDF
format.</p>

<p>Many good books have been written about Perl--see the
section below for more details.</p>

<p>Tutorial documents are included in current or upcoming
Perl releases include perltoot for objects or perlboot for a
beginners approach to objects, perlopentut for file opening
semantics, perlreftut for manag- ing references, perlretut
for regular expressions, perlthrtut for threads, perldebtut
for debugging, and perlxstut for linking C and Perl
together. There may be more by the time you read this. These
URLs might also be useful:</p>

<p>http://perldoc.perl.org/
http://bookmarks.cpan.org/search.cgi?cat=Training%2FTutorials</p>

<p>What are the Perl newsgroups on Usenet? Where do I post
questions?</p>

<p>Several groups devoted to the Perl language are on
Usenet:</p>

<p>comp.lang.perl.announce Moderated announcement group
comp.lang.perl.misc High traffic general Perl discussion
comp.lang.perl.moderated Moderated discussion group
comp.lang.perl.modules Use and development of Perl modules
comp.lang.perl.tk Using Tk (and X) from Perl</p>

<p>comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi Writing CGI scripts
for the Web.</p>

<p>Some years ago, comp.lang.perl was divided into those
groups, and comp.lang.perl itself officially removed. While
that group may still be found on some news servers, it is
unwise to use it, because postings there will not appear on
news servers which honour the official list of group names.
Use comp.lang.perl.misc for topics which do not have a
more-appropriate specific group.</p>

<p>There is also a Usenet gateway to Perl mailing lists
sponsored by perl.org at nntp://nntp.perl.org , a web
interface to the same lists at http://nntp.perl.org/group/
and these lists are also available under the
&quot;perl.*&quot; hierarchy at http://groups.google.com .
Other groups are listed at http://lists.perl.org/ ( also
known as http://lists.cpan.org/ ).</p>

<p>A nice place to ask questions is the PerlMonks site,
http://www.perl- monks.org/ , or the Perl Beginners mailing
list http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=beginners .</p>

<p>Note that none of the above are supposed to write your
code for you: asking questions about particular problems or
general advice is fine, but asking someone to write your
code for free is not very cool.</p>

<p>Where should I post source code?</p>

<p>You should post source code to whichever group is most
appropriate, but feel free to cross-post to
comp.lang.perl.misc. If you want to cross- post to
alt.sources, please make sure it follows their posting stan-
dards, including setting the Followup-To header line to NOT
include alt.sources; see their FAQ (
http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-sources-intro/ ) for
details.</p>

<p>If youre just looking for software, first use Google (
http://www.google.com ), Googles usenet search interface (
http://groups.google.com ), and CPAN Search (
http://search.cpan.org ). This is faster and more productive
than just posting a request.</p>

<p>Perl Books</p>

<p>A number of books on Perl and/or CGI programming are
available. A few of these are good, some are OK, but many
arent worth your money. There is a list of these books, some
with extensive reviews, at http://books.perl.org/ . If you
dont see your book listed here, you can write to
perlfaq-workers@perl.org .</p>

<p>The incontestably definitive reference book on Perl,
written by the creator of Perl, is Programming Perl:</p>

<p>Programming Perl (the &quot;Camel Book&quot;): by Larry
Wall, Tom Christiansen, and Jon Orwant ISBN 0-596-00027-8
[3rd edition July 2000]
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pperl3/ (English,
translations to several languages are also available)</p>

<p>The companion volume to the Camel containing thousands
of real-world examples, mini-tutorials, and complete
programs is:</p>

Christiansen and Nathan Torkington, with Foreword by Larry
Wall ISBN 0-596-00313-7 [2nd Edition August 2003]
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlckbk2/</p>

<p>If youre already a seasoned programmer, then the Camel
Book might suf- fice for you to learn Perl. If youre not,
check out the Llama book:</p>

http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lrnperlorm/</p>

<p>If youre not an accidental programmer, but a more
serious and possibly even degreed computer scientist who
doesnt need as much hand-holding as we try to provide in the
Llama, please check out the delightful book</p>

<p>Addison-Wesley ( http://www.awlonline.com/ ) and Manning
( http://www.manning.com/ ) are also publishers of some fine
Perl books such as Object Oriented Programming with Perl by
Damian Conway and Net- work Programming with Perl by Lincoln
Stein.</p>

<p>An excellent technical book discounter is Bookpool at
http://www.bookpool.com/ where a 30% discount or more is not
unusual.</p>

<p>What follows is a list of the books that the FAQ authors
found person- ally useful. Your mileage may (but, we hope,
probably won t) vary.</p>

<p>Which magazines have Perl content?</p>

<p>The first (and for a long time, only) periodical devoted
to All Things Perl, The Perl Journal contains tutorials,
demonstrations, case stud- ies, announcements, contests, and
much more. TPJ has columns on web development, databases,
Win32 Perl, graphical programming, regular expressions, and
networking, and sponsors the Obfuscated Perl Contest and the
Perl Poetry Contests. Beginning in November 2002, TPJ moved
to a reader-supported monthly e-zine format in which
subscribers can down- load issues as PDF documents. For more
details on TPJ, see http://www.tpj.com/</p>

<p>Beyond this, magazines that frequently carry quality
articles on Perl are The Perl Review (
http://www.theperlreview.com ), Unix Review (
http://www.unixreview.com/ ), Linux Magazine (
http://www.linux- magazine.com/ ), and Usenixs
newsletter/magazine to its members, login: (
http://www.usenix.org/ )</p>

<p>The Perl columns of Randal L. Schwartz are available on
the web at http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/WebTechniques/ ,
http://www.stone- henge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/ , and
http://www.stonehenge.com/mer- lyn/LinuxMag/ .</p>

<p>What mailing lists are there for Perl?</p>

<p>Most of the major modules (Tk, CGI, libwww-perl) have
their own mailing lists. Consult the documentation that came
with the module for sub- scription information.</p>

<p>A comprehensive list of Perl related mailing lists can
be found at:</p>

<p>http://lists.perl.org/</p>

<p>Where are the archives for comp.lang.perl.misc?</p>

<p>The Google search engine now carries archived and
searchable newsgroup content.</p>


<p>http://groups.google.com/groups?group=comp.lang.perl.misc</p>

<p>If you have a question, you can be sure someone has
already asked the same question at some point on c.l.p.m. It
requires some time and patience to sift through all the
content but often you will find the answer you seek.</p>

<p>Where can I buy a commercial version of perl?</p>

<p>In a real sense, perl already is commercial software: it
has a license that you can grab and carefully read to your
manager. It is distributed in releases and comes in
well-defined packages. There is a very large user community
and an extensive literature. The comp.lang.perl.* newsgroups
and several of the mailing lists provide free answers to
your questions in near real-time. Perl has traditionally
been sup- ported by Larry, scores of software designers and
developers, and myr- iad programmers, all working for free
to create a useful thing to make life better for
everyone.</p>

<p>However, these answers may not suffice for managers who
require a pur- chase order from a company whom they can sue
should anything go awry. Or maybe they need very serious
hand-holding and contractual obliga- tions. Shrink-wrapped
CDs with perl on them are available from several sources if
that will help. For example, many Perl books include a dis-
tribution of perl, as do the OReilly Perl Resource Kits (in
both the Unix flavor and in the proprietary Microsoft
flavor); the free Unix distributions also all come with
perl.</p>

<p>Where do I send bug reports?</p>

<p>If you are reporting a bug in the perl interpreter or
the modules shipped with Perl, use the perlbug program in
the Perl distribution or mail your report to
perlbug@perl.org or at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .</p>

<p>For Perl modules, you can submit bug reports to the
Request Tracker set up at http://rt.cpan.org .</p>

<p>If you are posting a bug with a non-standard port (see
the answer to &quot;What platforms is perl available
for?&quot;), a binary distribution, or a non-standard module
(such as Tk, CGI, etc), then please see the docu- mentation
that came with it to determine the correct place to post
bugs.</p>

<p>Read the perlbug(1) man page (perl5.004 or later) for
more information.</p>

<p>What is perl.com? Perl Mongers? pm.org? perl.org?
cpan.org?</p>

<p>Perl.com at http://www.perl.com/ is part of the OReilly
Network, a subsidiary of OReilly Media.</p>

<p>The Perl Foundation is an advocacy organization for the
Perl language which maintains the web site
http://www.perl.org/ as a general advocacy site for the Perl
language. It uses the domain to provide general sup- port
services to the Perl community, including the hosting of
mailing lists, web sites, and other services. The web site
http://www.perl.org/ is a general advocacy site for the Perl
language, and there are many other sub-domains for special
topics, such as</p>

<p>http://learn.perl.org/ http://use.perl.org/
http://jobs.perl.org/ http://lists.perl.org/</p>

<p>Perl Mongers uses the pm.org domain for services related
to Perl user groups, including the hosting of mailing lists
and web sites. See the Perl user group web site at
http://www.pm.org/ for more information about joining,
starting, or requesting services for a Perl user group.</p>

<p>http://www.cpan.org/ is the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network, a replicated worldwide repository of Perl software,
see the What is CPAN? question earlier in this document.</p>
