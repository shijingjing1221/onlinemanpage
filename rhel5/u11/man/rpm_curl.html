<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) curl(1) Curl Manual
curl(1)</p>

<p>NAME curl - transfer a URL</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS curl [options] [URL...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a
server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS,
FTP, FTPS, TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). The command is
designed to work without user interaction.</p>

<p>curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy
support, user authen- tication, ftp upload, HTTP post, SSL
(https:) connections, cookies, file transfer resume and
more. As you will see below, the amount of features will
make your head spin!</p>

<p>curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related
features. See libcurl(3) for details.</p>

<p>URL The URL syntax is protocol dependent. Youll find a
detailed descrip- tion in RFC 3986.</p>

<p>You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by
writing part sets within braces as in:</p>

<p>http://site.{one,two,three}.com</p>

<p>or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using
[] as in:</p>

<p>ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt
ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt (with leading
zeros) ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt</p>

<p>No nesting of the sequences is supported at the moment,
but you can use several ones next to each other:</p>


<p>http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html</p>

<p>You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line.
They will be fetched in a sequential manner in the specified
order.</p>

<p>Since curl 7.15.1 you can also specify step counter for
the ranges, so that you can get every Nth number or
letter:</p>

<p>http://www.numericals.com/file[1-100:10].txt
http://www.letters.com/file[a-z:2].txt</p>

<p>If you specify URL without protocol:// prefix, curl will
attempt to guess what protocol you might want. It will then
default to HTTP but try other protocols based on often-used
host name prefixes. For exam- ple, for host names starting
with &quot;ftp.&quot; curl will assume you want to speak
FTP.</p>

<p>Curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple
file transfers, so that getting many files from the same
server will not do multiple con- nects / handshakes. This
improves speed. Of course this is only done on files
specified on a single command line and cannot be used
between separate curl invokes.</p>

<p>PROGRESS METER curl normally displays a progress meter
during operations, indicating amount of transfered data,
transfer speeds and estimated time left etc.</p>

<p>However, since curl displays data to the terminal by
default, if you invoke curl to do an operation and it is
about to write data to the terminal, it disables the
progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the output
mixing progress meter and response data.</p>

<p>If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT
requests, you need to redirect the response output to a
file, using shell redirect (&gt;), -o [file] or similar.</p>

<p>It is not the same case for FTP upload as that operation
is not spit- ting out any response data to the terminal.</p>

<p>If you prefer a progress &quot;bar&quot; instead of the
regular meter, -# is your friend.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a/--append (FTP) When used in an FTP upload,
this will tell curl to append to the target file instead of
overwriting it. If the file doesnt exist, it will be
created.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second one will
disable append mode again.</p>

<p>-A/--user-agent &lt;agent string&gt; (HTTP) Specify the
User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server. Some badly
done CGIs fail if its not set to &quot;Mozilla/4.0&quot;. To
encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single
quote marks. This can also be set with the -H/--header
option of course.</p>

<p>If this option is set more than once, the last one will
be the one thats used.</p>

<p>--anyauth (HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication
method by itself, and use the most secure one the remote
site claims it supports. This is done by first doing a
request and checking the response- headers, thus inducing an
extra network round-trip. This is used instead of setting a
specific authentication method, which you can do with
--basic, --digest, --ntlm, and --negotiate.</p>

<p>Note that using --anyauth is not recommended if you do
uploads from stdin, since it may require data to be sent
twice and then the client must be able to rewind. If the
need should arise when uploading from stdin, the upload
operation will fail.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the following
occurrences make no difference.</p>

<p>-b/--cookie &lt;name=data&gt; (HTTP) Pass the data to
the HTTP server as a cookie. It is sup- posedly the data
previously received from the server in a &quot;Set-
Cookie:&quot; line. The data should be in the format
&quot;NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2&quot;.</p>

<p>If no = letter is used in the line, it is treated as a
file- name to use to read previously stored cookie lines
from, which should be used in this session if they match.
Using this method also activates the &quot;cookie
parser&quot; which will make curl record incoming cookies
too, which may be handy if you re using this in combination
with the -L/--location option. The file format of the file
to read cookies from should be plain HTTP headers or the
Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format.</p>

<p>NOTE that the file specified with -b/--cookie is only
used as input. No cookies will be stored in the file. To
store cookies, use the -c/--cookie-jar option or you could
even save the HTTP headers to a file using
-D/--dump-header!</p>

<p>If this option is set more than once, the last one will
be the one thats used.</p>

<p>-B/--use-ascii Enable ASCII transfer when using FTP or
LDAP. For FTP, this can also be enforced by using an URL
that ends with &quot;;type=A&quot;. This option causes data
sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second one will
disable ASCII usage.</p>

<p>--basic (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic
authentication. This is the default and this option is
usually pointless, unless you use it to override a
previously set option that sets a different authentication
method (such as --ntlm, --digest and --negoti- ate).</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the following
occurrences make no difference.</p>

<p>--ciphers &lt;list of ciphers&gt; (SSL) Specifies which
ciphers to use in the connection. The list of ciphers must
be using valid ciphers. Read up on SSL cipher list details
on this URL:
http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
override the others.</p>

<p>--compressed (HTTP) Request a compressed response using
one of the algorithms libcurl supports, and return the
uncompressed document. If this option is used and the server
sends an unsupported encoding, Curl will report an
error.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, each occurrence
will tog- gle it on/off.</p>

<p>--connect-timeout &lt;seconds&gt; Maximum time in
seconds that you allow the connection to the server to take.
This only limits the connection phase, once curl has
connected this option is of no more use. See also the
-m/--max-time option.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-c/--cookie-jar &lt;file name&gt; Specify to which file
you want curl to write all cookies after a completed
operation. Curl writes all cookies previously read from a
specified file as well as all cookies received from remote
server(s). If no cookies are known, no file will be writ-
ten. The file will be written using the Netscape cookie file
format. If you set the file name to a single dash,
&quot;-&quot;, the cookies will be written to stdout.</p>

<p>NOTE If the cookie jar cant be created or written to,
the whole curl operation won t fail or even report an error
clearly. Using -v will get a warning displayed, but that is
the only visible feedback you get about this possibly lethal
situation.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last specified
file name will be used.</p>

<p>-C/--continue-at &lt;offset&gt; Continue/Resume a
previous file transfer at the given offset. The given offset
is the exact number of bytes that will be skipped counted
from the beginning of the source file before it is
transferred to the destination. If used with uploads, the
ftp server command SIZE will not be used by curl.</p>

<p>Use &quot;-C -&quot; to tell curl to automatically find
out where/how to resume the transfer. It then uses the given
output/input files to figure that out.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--create-dirs When used in conjunction with the -o
option, curl will create the necessary local directory
hierarchy as needed. This option creates the dirs mentioned
with the -o option, nothing else. If the -o file name uses
no dir or if the dirs it mentions already exist, no dir will
be created.</p>

<p>To create remote directories when using FTP, try
--ftp-create- dirs.</p>

<p>--crlf (FTP) Convert LF to CRLF in upload. Useful for
MVS (OS/390).</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the following
occurrences make no difference.</p>

<p>-d/--data &lt;data&gt; (HTTP) Sends the specified data
in a POST request to the HTTP server, in a way that can
emulate as if a user has filled in a HTML form and pressed
the submit button. Note that the data is sent exactly as
specified with no extra processing (with all newlines cut
off). The data is expected to be &quot;url-encoded&quot;.
This will cause curl to pass the data to the server using
the content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Compare
to -F/--form. If this option is used more than once on the
same command line, the data pieces specified will be merged
together with a separating &amp;-letter. Thus, using -d
name=daniel -d skill=lousy would generate a post chunk that
looks like name=daniel&amp;skill=lousy.</p>

<p>If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should
be a file name to read the data from, or - if you want curl
to read the data from stdin. The contents of the file must
already be url-encoded. Multiple files can also be
specified. Posting data from a file named foobar would thus
be done with --data @foo- bar&quot;.</p>

<p>To post data purely binary, you should instead use the
--data- binary option.</p>

<p>-d/--data is the same as --data-ascii.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the ones following
the first will append data.</p>

<p>--data-ascii &lt;data&gt; (HTTP) This is an alias for
the -d/--data option.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the ones following
the first will append data.</p>

<p>--data-binary &lt;data&gt; (HTTP) This posts data in a
similar manner as --data-ascii does, although when using
this option the entire context of the posted data is kept
as-is. If you want to post a binary file without the
strip-newlines feature of the --data-ascii option, this is
for you.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the ones following
the first will append data.</p>

<p>--delegation LEVEL Set LEVEL to tell the server what it
is allowed to delegate when it comes to user credentials.
Used with GSS/kerberos.</p>

<p>none Dont allow any delegation.</p>

<p>policy Delegates if and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag
is set in the Kerberos service ticket, which is a matter of
realm policy.</p>

<p>always Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.</p>

<p>--digest (HTTP) Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This
is a authentica- tion that prevents the password from being
sent over the wire in clear text. Use this in combination
with the normal -u/--user option to set user name and
password. See also --ntlm, --negoti- ate and --anyauth for
related options.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the following
occurrences make no difference.</p>

<p>--disable-eprt (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the
EPRT and LPRT commands when doing active FTP transfers. Curl
will normally always first attempt to use EPRT, then LPRT
before using PORT, but with this option, it will use PORT
right away. EPRT and LPRT are exten- sions to the original
FTP protocol, may not work on all servers but enable more
functionality in a better way than the tradi- tional PORT
command.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, each occurrence
will tog- gle this on/off.</p>

<p>--disable-epsv (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the
EPSV command when doing passive FTP transfers. Curl will
normally always first attempt to use EPSV before PASV, but
with this option, it will not try using EPSV.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, each occurrence
will tog- gle this on/off.</p>

<p>-D/--dump-header &lt;file&gt; Write the protocol headers
to the specified file.</p>

<p>This option is handy to use when you want to store the
headers that a HTTP site sends to you. Cookies from the
headers could then be read in a second curl invoke by using
the -b/--cookie option! The -c/--cookie-jar option is
however a better way to store cookies.</p>

<p>When used on FTP, the ftp server response lines are
considered being &quot;headers&quot; and thus are saved
there.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-e/--referer &lt;URL&gt; (HTTP) Sends the &quot;Referer
Page&quot; information to the HTTP server. This can also be
set with the -H/--header flag of course. When used with
-L/--location you can append &quot;;auto&quot; to the
--referer URL to make curl automatically set the previous
URL when it fol- lows a Location: header. The
&quot;;auto&quot; string can be used alone, even if you dont
set an initial --referer.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--engine &lt;name&gt; Select the OpenSSL crypto engine
to use for cipher operations. Use --engine list to print a
list of build-time supported engines. Note that not all (or
none) of the engines may be available at run-time.</p>

<p>--environment (RISC OS ONLY) Sets a range of environment
variables, using the names the -w option supports, to easier
allow extraction of use- ful information after having run
curl.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, each occurrence
will tog- gle this on/off.</p>

<p>--egd-file &lt;file&gt; (HTTPS) Specify the path name to
the Entropy Gathering Daemon socket. The socket is used to
seed the random engine for SSL connections. See also the
--random-file option.</p>

<p>-E/--cert &lt;certificate[:password]&gt; (HTTPS) Tells
curl to use the specified certificate file when getting a
file with HTTPS. The certificate must be in PEM for- mat. If
the optional password isn t specified, it will be queried
for on the terminal. Note that this certificate is the
private key and the private certificate concatenated!</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--cert-type &lt;type&gt; (SSL) Tells curl what
certificate type the provided certificate is in. PEM, DER
and ENG are recognized types.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--cacert &lt;CA certificate&gt; (HTTPS) Tells curl to
use the specified certificate file to ver- ify the peer. The
file may contain multiple CA certificates. The
certificate(s) must be in PEM format.</p>

<p>curl recognizes the environment variable named
CURL_CA_BUNDLE if that is set, and uses the given path as a
path to a CA cert bundle. This option overrides that
variable.</p>

<p>The windows version of curl will automatically look for
a CA certs file named &acute;curl-ca-bundle.crt&acute;,
either in the same direc- tory as curl.exe, or in the
Current Working Directory, or in any folder along your
PATH.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--capath &lt;CA certificate directory&gt; (HTTPS) Tells
curl to use the specified certificate directory to verify
the peer. The certificates must be in PEM format, and the
directory must have been processed using the c_rehash
utility supplied with openssl. Using --capath can allow curl
to make https connections much more efficiently than using
--cacert if the --cacert file contains many CA
certificates.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-f/--fail (HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on
server errors. This is mostly done like this to better
enable scripts etc to better deal with failed attempts. In
normal cases when a HTTP server fails to deliver a document,
it returns an HTML document stating so (which often also
describes why and more). This flag will prevent curl from
outputting that and return error 22.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable silent failure.</p>

<p>--ftp-account [data] (FTP) When an FTP server asks for
&quot;account data&quot; after user name and password has
been provided, this data is sent off using the ACCT command.
(Added in 7.13.0)</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will override
the pre- vious use.</p>

<p>--ftp-create-dirs (FTP) When an FTP URL/operation uses a
path that doesnt cur- rently exist on the server, the
standard behavior of curl is to fail. Using this option,
curl will instead attempt to create missing directories.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable directory creation.</p>

<p>--ftp-method [method] (FTP) Control what method curl
should use to reach a file on a FTP(S) server. The method
argument should be one of the follow- ing alternatives:</p>

<p>multicwd curl does a single CWD operation for each path
part in the given URL. For deep hierarchies this means very
many commands. This is how RFC1738 says it should be done.
This is the default but the slowest behavior.</p>

<p>nocwd curl does no CWD at all. curl will do SIZE, RETR,
STOR etc and give a full path to the server for all these
com- mands. This is the fastest behavior.</p>

<p>singlecwd curl does one CWD with the full target
directory and then operates on the file &quot;normally&quot;
(like in the multicwd case). This is somewhat more standards
compliant than nocwd but without the full penalty of
multicwd.</p>

<p>--ftp-pasv (FTP) Use PASV when transferring. PASV is the
internal default behavior, but using this option can be used
to override a previ- ous --ftp-port option. (Added in
7.11.0)</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the following
occurrences make no difference.</p>

<p>--ftp-alternative-to-user &lt;command&gt; (FTP) If
authenticating with the USER and PASS commands fails, send
this command. When connecting to Tumbleweeds Secure
Transport server over FTPS using a client certificate, using
&quot;SITE AUTH&quot; will tell the server to retrieve the
username from the certificate. (Added in 7.15.5)</p>

<p>--ftp-skip-pasv-ip (FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP
address the server suggests in its response to curl s PASV
command when curl connects the data connection. Instead curl
will re-use the same IP address it already uses for the
control connection. (Added in 7.14.2)</p>

<p>This option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used
instead of PASV.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again use
the servers suggested address.</p>

<p>--ftp-ssl (FTP) Try to use SSL/TLS for the FTP
connection. Reverts to a non-secure connection if the server
doesn t support SSL/TLS. (Added in 7.11.0)</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable this.</p>

<p>--ftp-ssl-reqd (FTP) Require SSL/TLS for the FTP
connection. Terminates the connection if the server doesn t
support SSL/TLS. (Added in 7.15.5)</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable this.</p>

<p>-F/--form &lt;name=content&gt; (HTTP) This lets curl
emulate a filled in form in which a user has pressed the
submit button. This causes curl to POST data using the
Content-Type multipart/form-data according to RFC1867. This
enables uploading of binary files etc. To force the con-
tent part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign.
To just get the content part from a file, prefix the file
name with the letter &lt;. The difference between @ and &lt;
is then that @ makes a file get attached in the post as a
file upload, while the &lt; makes a text field and just get
the contents for that text field from a file.</p>

<p>Example, to send your password file to the server, where
pass- word is the name of the form-field to which
/etc/passwd will be the input:</p>

<p>curl -F password=@/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.com</p>

<p>To read the files content from stdin instead of a file,
use - where the file name shouldve been. This goes for both
@ and &lt; constructs.</p>

<p>You can also tell curl what Content-Type to use by using
type=, in a manner similar to:</p>

<p>curl -F &quot;web=@index.html;type=text/html&quot;
url.com</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>curl -F &quot;name=daniel;type=text/foo&quot;
url.com</p>

<p>You can also explicitly change the name field of an file
upload part by setting filename=, like this:</p>

<p>curl -F &quot;file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost&quot;
url.com</p>

<p>See further examples and details in the MANUAL.</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times.</p>

<p>--form-string &lt;name=string&gt; (HTTP) Similar to
--form except that the value string for the named parameter
is used literally. Leading @ and &lt; charac- ters, and the
;type= string in the value have no special mean- ing. Use
this in preference to --form if theres any possibility that
the string value may accidentally trigger the @ or &lt;
features of --form.</p>

<p>-g/--globoff This option switches off the &quot;URL
globbing parser&quot;. When you set this option, you can
specify URLs that contain the letters {}[] without having
them being interpreted by curl itself. Note that these
letters are not normal legal URL contents but they should be
encoded according to the URI standard.</p>

<p>-G/--get When used, this option will make all data
specified with -d/--data or --data-binary to be used in a
HTTP GET request instead of the POST request that otherwise
would be used. The data will be appended to the URL with a ?
separator.</p>

<p>If used in combination with -I, the POST data will
instead be appended to the URL with a HEAD request.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the following
occurrences make no difference.</p>

<p>-h/--help Usage help.</p>

<p>-H/--header &lt;header&gt; (HTTP) Extra header to use
when getting a web page. You may specify any number of extra
headers. Note that if you should add a custom header that
has the same name as one of the internal ones curl would
use, your externally set header will be used instead of the
internal one. This allows you to make even trick- ier stuff
than curl would normally do. You should not replace
internally set headers without knowing perfectly well what
you re doing. Replacing an internal header with one without
con- tent on the right side of the colon will prevent that
header from appearing.</p>

<p>curl will make sure that each header you add/replace get
sent with the proper end of line marker, you should thus not
add that as a part of the header content: do not add
newlines or carriage returns they will only mess things up
for you.</p>

<p>See also the -A/--user-agent and -e/--referer
options.</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times to
add/replace/remove multiple headers.</p>

<p>--ignore-content-length (HTTP) Ignore the Content-Length
header. This is particularly useful for servers running
Apache 1.x, which will report incor- rect Content-Length for
files larger than 2 gigabytes.</p>

<p>-i/--include (HTTP) Include the HTTP-header in the
output. The HTTP-header includes things like server-name,
date of the document, HTTP- version and more...</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable header include.</p>

<p>--interface &lt;name&gt; Perform an operation using a
specified interface. You can enter interface name, IP
address or host name. An example could look like:</p>

<p>curl --interface eth0:1 http://www.netscape.com/</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-I/--head (HTTP/FTP/FILE) Fetch the HTTP-header only!
HTTP-servers feature the command HEAD which this uses to get
nothing but the header of a document. When used on a FTP or
FILE file, curl displays the file size and last modification
time only.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable header only.</p>

<p>-j/--junk-session-cookies (HTTP) When curl is told to
read cookies from a given file, this option will make it
discard all &quot;session cookies&quot;. This will basically
have the same effect as if a new session is started. Typical
browsers always discard session cookies when theyre closed
down.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, each occurrence
will tog- gle this on/off.</p>

<p>-k/--insecure (SSL) This option explicitly allows curl
to perform &quot;insecure&quot; SSL connections and
transfers. All SSL connections are attempted to be made
secure by using the CA certificate bundle installed by
default. This makes all connections considered
&quot;insecure&quot; to fail unless -k/--insecure is
used.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second time will again
disable it.</p>

<p>--key &lt;key&gt; (SSL) Private key file name. Allows
you to provide your private key in this separate file.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--key-type &lt;type&gt; (SSL) Private key file type.
Specify which type your --key pro- vided private key is.
DER, PEM and ENG are supported.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--krb4 &lt;level&gt; (FTP) Enable kerberos4
authentication and use. The level must be entered and should
be one of clear , safe, confidential or private. Should you
use a level that is not one of these, private will instead
be used.</p>

<p>This option requires that the library was built with
kerberos4 support. This is not very common. Use -V/--version
to see if your curl supports it.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-K/--config &lt;config file&gt; Specify which config
file to read curl arguments from. The con- fig file is a
text file in which command line arguments can be written
which then will be used as if they were written on the
actual command line. Options and their parameters must be
speci- fied on the same config file line. If the parameter
is to con- tain white spaces, the parameter must be enclosed
within quotes. If the first column of a config line is a #
character, the rest of the line will be treated as a
comment.</p>

<p>Specify the filename as - to make curl read the file
from stdin.</p>

<p>Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config
file, you need to specify it using the --url option, and not
by simply writing the URL on its own line. So, it could look
similar to this:</p>

<p>url = &quot;http://curl.haxx.se/docs/&quot;</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times.</p>

<p>When curl is invoked, it always (unless -q is used)
checks for a default config file and uses it if found. The
default config file is checked for in the following places
in this order:</p>

<p>1) curl tries to find the &quot;home dir&quot;: It first
checks for the CURL_HOME and then the HOME environment
variables. Failing that, it uses getpwuid() on unix-like
systems (which returns the home dir given the current user
in your system). On Windows, it then checks for the APPDATA
variable, or as a last resort the %USER- PROFILE%0lication
Data.</p>

<p>2) On windows, if there is no _curlrc file in the home
dir, it checks for one in the same dir the executable curl
is placed. On unix-like systems, it will simply try to load
.curlrc from the determined home dir.</p>

<p>--limit-rate &lt;speed&gt; Specify the maximum transfer
rate you want curl to use. This feature is useful if you
have a limited pipe and youd like your transfer not use your
entire bandwidth.</p>

<p>The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a
suffix is appended. Appending k or K will count the number
as kilo- bytes, m or M makes it megabytes while g or G makes
it gigabytes. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.</p>

<p>If you are also using the -Y/--speed-limit option, that
option will take precedence and might cripple the
rate-limiting slightly, to help keeping the speed-limit
logic working.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-l/--list-only (FTP) When listing an FTP directory, this
switch forces a name- only view. Especially useful if you
want to machine-parse the contents of an FTP directory since
the normal directory view doesnt use a standard look or
format.</p>

<p>This option causes an FTP NLST command to be sent. Some
FTP servers list only files in their response to NLST; they
do not include subdirectories and symbolic links.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable list only.</p>

<p>--local-port &lt;num&gt;[-num] Set a prefered number or
range of local port numbers to use for the connection(s).
Note that port numbers by nature is a scarce resource that
will be busy at times so setting this range to something too
narrow might cause unnecessary connection setup failures.
(Added in 7.15.2)</p>

<p>-L/--location (HTTP/HTTPS) If the server reports that
the requested page has moved to a different location
(indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX response code)
this option will make curl redo the request on the new
place. If used together with -i/--include or -I/--head,
headers from all requested pages will be shown. When
authentication is used, curl only sends its credentials to
the initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different
host, it wont be able to intercept the user+password. See
also --loca- tion-trusted on how to change this. You can
limit the amount of redirects to follow by using the
--max-redirs option.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable location following.</p>

<p>--location-trusted (HTTP/HTTPS) Like -L/--location, but
will allow sending the name + password to all hosts that the
site may redirect to. This may or may not introduce a
security breach if the site redirects you do a site to which
youll send your authentication info (which is plaintext in
the case of HTTP Basic authentication).</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable location following.</p>

<p>--max-filesize &lt;bytes&gt; Specify the maximum size
(in bytes) of a file to download. If the file requested is
larger than this value, the transfer will not start and curl
will return with exit code 63.</p>

<p>NOTE: The file size is not always known prior to
download, and for such files this option has no effect even
if the file trans- fer ends up being larger than this given
limit. This concerns both FTP and HTTP transfers.</p>

<p>-m/--max-time &lt;seconds&gt; Maximum time in seconds
that you allow the whole operation to take. This is useful
for preventing your batch jobs from hang- ing for hours due
to slow networks or links going down. See also the
--connect-timeout option.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-M/--manual Manual. Display the huge help text.</p>

<p>-n/--netrc Makes curl scan the .netrc file in the users
home directory for login name and password. This is
typically used for ftp on unix. If used with http, curl will
enable user authentication. See netrc(4) or ftp(1) for
details on the file format. Curl will not complain if that
file hasnt the right permissions (it should not be world nor
group readable). The environment variable &quot;HOME&quot;
is used to find the home directory.</p>

<p>A quick and very simple example of how to setup a .netrc
to allow curl to ftp to the machine host.domain.com with
user name myself and password secret should look similar
to:</p>

<p>machine host.domain.com login myself password secret</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable netrc usage.</p>

<p>--netrc-optional Very similar to --netrc, but this
option makes the .netrc usage optional and not mandatory as
the --netrc does.</p>

<p>--negotiate (HTTP) Enables GSS-Negotiate authentication.
The GSS-Negotiate method was designed by Microsoft and is
used in their web appli- cations. It is primarily meant as a
support for Kerberos5 authentication but may be also used
along with another authenti- cation methods. For more
information see IETF draft draft-
brezak-spnego-http-04.txt.</p>

<p>If you want to enable Negotiate for your proxy
authentication, then use --proxy-negotiate.</p>

<p>This option requires that the library was built with
GSSAPI sup- port. This is not very common. Use -V/--version
to see if your version supports GSS-Negotiate.</p>

<p>When using this option, you must also provide a fake
-u/--user option to activate the authentication code
properly. Sending a -u : is enough as the user name and
password from the -u option arent actually used.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the following
occurrences make no difference.</p>

<p>-N/--no-buffer Disables the buffering of the output
stream. In normal work sit- uations, curl will use a
standard buffered output stream that will have the effect
that it will output the data in chunks, not necessarily
exactly when the data arrives. Using this option will
disable that buffering.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
switch on buffering.</p>

<p>--ntlm (HTTP) Enables NTLM authentication. The NTLM
authentication method was designed by Microsoft and is used
by IIS web servers. It is a proprietary protocol, reversed
engineered by clever peo- ple and implemented in curl based
on their efforts. This kind of behavior should not be
endorsed, you should encourage everyone who uses NTLM to
switch to a public and documented authentica- tion method
instead. Such as Digest.</p>

<p>If you want to enable NTLM for your proxy
authentication, then use --proxy-ntlm.</p>

<p>This option requires that the library was built with SSL
sup- port. Use -V/--version to see if your curl supports
NTLM.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the following
occurrences make no difference.</p>

<p>-o/--output &lt;file&gt; Write output to &lt;file&gt;
instead of stdout. If you are using {} or [] to fetch
multiple documents, you can use # followed by a number in
the &lt;file&gt; specifier. That variable will be replaced
with the current string for the URL being fetched. Like
in:</p>

<p>curl http://{one,two}.site.com -o
&quot;file_#1.txt&quot;</p>

<p>or use several variables like:</p>

<p>curl http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o
&quot;#1_#2&quot;</p>

<p>You may use this option as many times as you have number
of URLs.</p>

<p>See also the --create-dirs option to create the local
directo- ries dynamically.</p>

<p>-O/--remote-name Write output to a local file named like
the remote file we get. (Only the file part of the remote
file is used, the path is cut off.)</p>

<p>The remote file name to use for saving is extracted from
the given URL, nothing else.</p>

<p>You may use this option as many times as you have number
of URLs.</p>

<p>--pass &lt;phrase&gt; (SSL) Pass phrase for the private
key</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--proxy-anyauth Tells curl to pick a suitable
authentication method when commu- nicating with the given
proxy. This will cause an extra request/response round-trip.
(Added in 7.13.2)</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable the proxy use-any authentication.</p>

<p>--proxy-basic Tells curl to use HTTP Basic
authentication when communicating with the given proxy. Use
--basic for enabling HTTP Basic with a remote host. Basic is
the default authentication method curl uses with
proxies.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable proxy HTTP Basic authentication.</p>

<p>--proxy-digest Tells curl to use HTTP Digest
authentication when communicating with the given proxy. Use
--digest for enabling HTTP Digest with a remote host.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable proxy HTTP Digest.</p>

<p>--proxy-negotiate Tells curl to use HTTP Negotiate
authentication when communicat- ing with the given proxy.
Use --negotiate for enabling HTTP Negotiate with a remote
host.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable proxy HTTP Negotiate.</p>

<p>--proxy-ntlm Tells curl to use HTTP NTLM authentication
when communicating with the given proxy. Use --ntlm for
enabling NTLM with a remote host.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable proxy HTTP NTLM.</p>

<p>-p/--proxytunnel When an HTTP proxy is used
(-x/--proxy), this option will cause non-HTTP protocols to
attempt to tunnel through the proxy instead of merely using
it to do HTTP-like operations. The tun- nel approach is made
with the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and requires that the
proxy allows direct connect to the remote port number curl
wants to tunnel through to.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable proxy tunnel.</p>

<p>-P/--ftp-port &lt;address&gt; (FTP) Reverses the
initiator/listener roles when connecting with ftp. This
switch makes Curl use the PORT command instead of PASV. In
practice, PORT tells the server to connect to the client s
specified address and port, while PASV asks the server for
an ip address and port to connect to. &lt;address&gt; should
be one of:</p>

<p>interface i.e &quot;eth0&quot; to specify which
interfaces IP address you want to use (Unix only)</p>

<p>IP address i.e &quot;192.168.10.1&quot; to specify exact
IP number</p>

<p>host name i.e &quot;my.host.domain&quot; to specify
machine</p>

<p>- make curl pick the same IP address that is already
used for the control connection</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used. Dis- able the use of PORT with --ftp-pasv. Disable
the attempt to use the EPRT command instead of PORT by using
--disable-eprt. EPRT is really PORT++.</p>

<p>-q If used as the first parameter on the command line,
the curlrc config file will not be read and used. See the
-K/--config for details on the default config file search
path.</p>

<p>-Q/--quote &lt;command&gt; (FTP) Send an arbitrary
command to the remote FTP server. Quote commands are sent
BEFORE the transfer is taking place (just after the initial
PWD command to be exact). To make commands take place after
a successful transfer, prefix them with a dash - . To make
commands get sent after libcurl has changed working
directory, just before the transfer command(s), prefix the
com- mand with + . You may specify any amount of commands.
If the server returns failure for one of the commands, the
entire oper- ation will be aborted. You must send
syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC959 defines.</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times.</p>

<p>--random-file &lt;file&gt; (HTTPS) Specify the path name
to file containing what will be considered as random data.
The data is used to seed the random engine for SSL
connections. See also the --egd-file option.</p>

<p>-r/--range &lt;range&gt; (HTTP/FTP) Retrieve a byte
range (i.e a partial document) from a HTTP/1.1 or FTP
server. Ranges can be specified in a number of ways.</p>

<p>0-499 specifies the first 500 bytes</p>

<p>500-999 specifies the second 500 bytes</p>

<p>-500 specifies the last 500 bytes</p>

<p>9500- specifies the bytes from offset 9500 and
forward</p>

<p>0-0,-1 specifies the first and last byte only(*)(H)</p>

<p>500-700,600-799 specifies 300 bytes from offset
500(H)</p>

<p>100-199,500-599 specifies two separate 100 bytes
ranges(*)(H)</p>

<p>(*) = NOTE that this will cause the server to reply with
a multipart response!</p>

<p>You should also be aware that many HTTP/1.1 servers do
not have this feature enabled, so that when you attempt to
get a range, youll instead get the whole document.</p>

<p>FTP range downloads only support the simple syntax
start-stop (optionally with one of the numbers omitted). It
depends on the non-RFC command SIZE.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-R/--remote-time When used, this will make libcurl
attempt to figure out the timestamp of the remote file, and
if that is available make the local file get that same
timestamp.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second time disables
this again.</p>

<p>--retry &lt;num&gt; If a transient error is returned
when curl tries to perform a transfer, it will retry this
number of times before giving up. Setting the number to 0
makes curl do no retries (which is the default). Transient
error means either: a timeout, an FTP 5xx response code or
an HTTP 5xx response code.</p>

<p>When curl is about to retry a transfer, it will first
wait one second and then for all forthcoming retries it will
double the waiting time until it reaches 10 minutes which
then will be the delay between the rest of the retries. By
using --retry-delay you disable this exponential backoff
algorithm. See also --retry-max-time to limit the total time
allowed for retries. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>

<p>If this option is used multiple times, the last
occurrence decide the amount.</p>

<p>--retry-delay &lt;seconds&gt; Make curl sleep this
amount of time between each retry when a transfer has failed
with a transient error (it changes the default backoff time
algorithm between retries). This option is only interesting
if --retry is also used. Setting this delay to zero will
make curl use the default backoff time. (Added in
7.12.3)</p>

<p>If this option is used multiple times, the last
occurrence decide the amount.</p>

<p>--retry-max-time &lt;seconds&gt; The retry timer is
reset before the first transfer attempt. Retries will be
done as usual (see --retry) as long as the timer hasnt
reached this given limit. Notice that if the timer hasnt
reached the limit, the request will be made and while
perform- ing, it may take longer than this given time
period. To limit a single request&acute;s maximum time, use
-m/--max-time. Set this option to zero to not timeout
retries. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>

<p>If this option is used multiple times, the last
occurrence decide the amount.</p>

<p>-s/--silent Silent mode. Dont show progress meter or
error messages. Makes Curl mute.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable silent mode.</p>

<p>-S/--show-error When used with -s it makes curl show
error message if it fails.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable show error.</p>

<p>--socks4 &lt;host[:port]&gt; Use the specified SOCKS4
proxy. If the port number is not speci- fied, it is assumed
at port 1080. (Added in 7.15.2)</p>

<p>This option overrides any previous use of -x/--proxy, as
they are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--socks5 &lt;host[:port]&gt; Use the specified SOCKS5
proxy. If the port number is not speci- fied, it is assumed
at port 1080. (Added in 7.11.1)</p>

<p>This option overrides any previous use of -x/--proxy, as
they are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used. (This option was previously wrongly documented and
used as --socks without the number appended.)</p>

<p>This option (as well as --socks4) does not work with
IPv6, FTPS or LDAP.</p>

<p>--stderr &lt;file&gt; Redirect all writes to stderr to
the specified file instead. If the file name is a plain -,
it is instead written to stdout. This option has no point
when youre using a shell with decent redirecting
capabilities.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--tcp-nodelay Turn on the TCP_NODELAY option. See the
curl_easy_setopt(3) man page for details about this option.
(Added in 7.11.2)</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, each occurrence
toggles this on/off.</p>

<p>-t/--telnet-option &lt;OPT=val&gt; Pass options to the
telnet protocol. Supported options are:</p>

<p>TTYPE=&lt;term&gt; Sets the terminal type.</p>

<p>XDISPLOC=&lt;X display&gt; Sets the X display
location.</p>

<p>NEW_ENV=&lt;var,val&gt; Sets an environment
variable.</p>

<p>-T/--upload-file &lt;file&gt; This transfers the
specified local file to the remote URL. If there is no file
part in the specified URL, Curl will append the local file
name. NOTE that you must use a trailing / on the last
directory to really prove to Curl that there is no file name
or curl will think that your last directory name is the
remote file name to use. That will most likely cause the
upload operation to fail. If this is used on a http(s)
server, the PUT command will be used.</p>

<p>Use the file name &quot;-&quot; (a single dash) to use
stdin instead of a given file.</p>

<p>You can specify one -T for each URL on the command line.
Each -T + URL pair specifies what to upload and to where.
curl also sup- ports &quot;globbing&quot; of the -T
argument, meaning that you can upload multiple files to a
single URL by using the same URL globbing style supported in
the URL, like this:</p>

<p>curl -T &quot;{file1,file2}&quot;
http://www.uploadtothissite.com</p>

<p>or even</p>

<p>curl -T &quot;img[1-1000].png&quot;
ftp://ftp.picturemania.com/upload/</p>

<p>--trace &lt;file&gt; Enables a full trace dump of all
incoming and outgoing data, including descriptive
information, to the given output file. Use &quot;-&quot; as
filename to have the output sent to stdout.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--trace-ascii &lt;file&gt; Enables a full trace dump of
all incoming and outgoing data, including descriptive
information, to the given output file. Use &quot;-&quot; as
filename to have the output sent to stdout.</p>

<p>This is very similar to --trace, but leaves out the hex
part and only shows the ASCII part of the dump. It makes
smaller output that might be easier to read for untrained
humans.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--trace-time Prepends a time stamp to each trace or
verbose line that curl displays. (Added in 7.14.0)</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, each occurrence
will tog- gle it on/off.</p>

<p>-u/--user &lt;user:password&gt; Specify user and
password to use for server authentication. Overrides
-n/--netrc and --netrc-optional.</p>

<p>If you use an SSPI-enabled curl binary and do NTLM
autentica- tion, you can force curl to pick up the user name
and password from your environment by simply specifying a
single colon with this option: &quot;-u :&quot;.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-U/--proxy-user &lt;user:password&gt; Specify user and
password to use for proxy authentication.</p>

<p>If you use an SSPI-enabled curl binary and do NTLM
autentica- tion, you can force curl to pick up the user name
and password from your environment by simply specifying a
single colon with this option: &quot;-U :&quot;.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--url &lt;URL&gt; Specify a URL to fetch. This option is
mostly handy when you want to specify URL(s) in a config
file.</p>

<p>This option may be used any number of times. To control
where this URL is written, use the -o/--output or the
-O/--remote-name options.</p>

<p>-v/--verbose Makes the fetching more verbose/talkative.
Mostly usable for debugging. Lines starting with &gt; means
&quot;header data&quot; sent by curl, &lt; means
&quot;header data&quot; received by curl that is hidden in
normal cases and lines starting with * means additional info
provided by curl.</p>

<p>Note that if you only want HTTP headers in the output,
-i/--include might be option youre looking for.</p>

<p>If you think this option still doesnt give you enough
details, consider using --trace or --trace-ascii
instead.</p>

<p>If this option is used twice, the second will again
disable ver- bose.</p>

<p>-V/--version Displays information about curl and the
libcurl version it uses.</p>

<p>The first line includes the full version of curl,
libcurl and other 3rd party libraries linked with the
executable.</p>

<p>The second line (starts with &quot;Protocols:&quot;)
shows all protocols that libcurl reports to support.</p>

<p>The third line (starts with &quot;Features:&quot;) shows
specific features libcurl reports to offer. Available
features include:</p>

<p>IPv6 You can use IPv6 with this.</p>

<p>krb4 Krb4 for ftp is supported.</p>

<p>SSL HTTPS and FTPS are supported.</p>

<p>libz Automatic decompression of compressed files over
HTTP is supported.</p>

<p>NTLM NTLM authentication is supported.</p>

<p>GSS-Negotiate Negotiate authentication is supported.</p>

<p>Debug This curl uses a libcurl built with Debug. This
enables more error-tracking and memory debugging etc. For
curl- developers only!</p>

<p>AsynchDNS This curl uses asynchronous name resolves.</p>

<p>SPNEGO SPNEGO Negotiate authentication is supported.</p>

<p>Largefile This curl supports transfers of large files,
files larger than 2GB.</p>

<p>IDN This curl supports IDN - international domain
names.</p>

<p>SSPI SSPI is supported. If you use NTLM and set a blank
user name, curl will authenticate with your current user and
password.</p>

<p>-w/--write-out &lt;format&gt; Defines what to display on
stdout after a completed and success- ful operation. The
format is a string that may contain plain text mixed with
any number of variables. The string can be spec- ified as
&quot;string&quot;, to get read from a particular file you
spec- ify it &quot;@filename&quot; and to tell curl to read
the format from stdin you write &quot;@-&quot;.</p>

<p>The variables present in the output format will be
substituted by the value or text that curl thinks fit, as
described below. All variables are specified like
%{variable_name} and to output a normal % you just write
them like %%. You can output a newline and a tab space by
using 0 a carriage return with with .</p>

<p>NOTE: The %-letter is a special letter in the
win32-environment, where all occurrences of % must be
doubled when using this option.</p>

<p>Available variables are at this point:</p>

<p>url_effective The URL that was fetched last. This is
mostly meaningful if youve told curl to follow loca- tion:
headers.</p>

<p>http_code The numerical code that was found in the last
retrieved HTTP(S) page.</p>

<p>http_connect The numerical code that was found in the
last response (from a proxy) to a curl CONNECT request.
(Added in 7.12.4)</p>

<p>time_total The total time, in seconds, that the full
opera- tion lasted. The time will be displayed with mil-
lisecond resolution.</p>

<p>time_namelookup The time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the name resolving was completed.</p>

<p>time_connect The time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the connect to the remote host (or proxy) was
completed.</p>

<p>time_pretransfer The time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the file transfer is just about to begin. This
includes all pre-transfer commands and nego- tiations that
are specific to the particular pro- tocol(s) involved.</p>

<p>time_redirect The time, in seconds, it took for all
redirection steps include name lookup, connect, pretransfer
and transfer before final transaction was started.
time_redirect shows the complete execu- tion time for
multiple redirections. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>

<p>time_starttransfer The time, in seconds, it took from
the start until the first byte is just about to be trans-
ferred. This includes time_pretransfer and also the time the
server needs to calculate the result.</p>

<p>size_download The total amount of bytes that were
downloaded.</p>

<p>size_upload The total amount of bytes that were
uploaded.</p>

<p>size_header The total amount of bytes of the downloaded
head- ers.</p>

<p>size_request The total amount of bytes that were sent in
the HTTP request.</p>

<p>speed_download The average download speed that curl
measured for the complete download.</p>

<p>speed_upload The average upload speed that curl measured
for the complete upload.</p>

<p>content_type The Content-Type of the requested document,
if there was any.</p>

<p>num_connects Number of new connects made in the recent
trans- fer. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>

<p>num_redirects Number of redirects that were followed in
the request. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>

<p>ftp_entry_path The initial path libcurl ended up in when
logging on to the remote FTP server. (Added in 7.15.4)</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-x/--proxy &lt;proxyhost[:port]&gt; Use specified HTTP
proxy. If the port number is not specified, it is assumed at
port 1080.</p>

<p>This option overrides existing environment variables
that sets proxy to use. If there s an environment variable
setting a proxy, you can set proxy to &quot;&quot; to
override it.</p>

<p>Note that all operations that are performed over a HTTP
proxy will transparently be converted to HTTP. It means that
certain protocol specific operations might not be available.
This is not the case if you can tunnel through the proxy, as
done with the -p/--proxytunnel option.</p>

<p>Starting with 7.14.1, the proxy host can be specified
the exact same way as the proxy environment variables,
include protocol prefix (http://) and embedded user +
password.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-X/--request &lt;command&gt; (HTTP) Specifies a custom
request method to use when communicat- ing with the HTTP
server. The specified request will be used instead of the
method otherwise used (which defaults to GET). Read the HTTP
1.1 specification for details and explanations.</p>

<p>(FTP) Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of
LIST when doing file lists with ftp.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-y/--speed-time &lt;time&gt; If a download is slower
than speed-limit bytes per second during a speed-time
period, the download gets aborted. If speed-time is used,
the default speed-limit will be 1 unless set with -y.</p>

<p>This option controls transfers and thus will not affect
slow connects etc. If this is a concern for you, try the
--connect- timeout option.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-Y/--speed-limit &lt;speed&gt; If a download is slower
than this given speed, in bytes per sec- ond, for speed-time
seconds it gets aborted. speed-time is set with -Y and is 30
if not set.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>-z/--time-cond &lt;date expression&gt; (HTTP) Request a
file that has been modified later than the given time and
date, or one that has been modified before that time. The
date expression can be all sorts of date strings or if it
doesnt match any internal ones, it tries to get the time
from a given file name instead! See the curl_getdate(3) man
pages for date expression details.</p>

<p>Start the date expression with a dash (-) to make it
request for a document that is older than the given
date/time, default is a document that is newer than the
specified date/time.</p>

<p>If this option is used several times, the last one will
be used.</p>

<p>--max-redirs &lt;num&gt; Set maximum number of
redirection-followings allowed. If -L/--location is used,
this option can be used to prevent curl from following
redirections &quot;in absurdum&quot;. By default, the limit
is set to 50 redirections. Set this option to -1 to make it
lim- itless.</p>

this option tells libcurl to resolve names to IPv4 addresses
only.</p>

to multiple IP versions (which it is if it is ipv6-capable),
this option tells libcurl to resolve names to IPv6 addresses
