<p>NAME auth_krb5 - nnrpd Kerberos v5 authenticator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS auth_krb5 [-i instance]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program does authentication for nnrpd
against a Kerberos v5 KDC. This is NOT real Kerberos
authentication using service tickets; instead, a username
and password is used to attempt to obtain a Ker- beros v5
TGT to confirm that they are valid. As such, this
authentica- tor assumes that nnrpd has been given the user s
username and password, and therefore is not as secure as
real Kerberos authentication. It generally should only be
used with NNTP over SSL to protect the pass- word from
sniffing.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -i instance If this option is given, instance
will be used as the instance of the principal received from
nnrpd and authentication will be done against that principal
instead of the base principal. In other words, a principal
like &quot;user&quot;, when passed to auth_krb5 invoked with
&quot;-i nntp&quot;, will be transformed into
&quot;user/nntp&quot; before attempting Kerberos
authentication.</p>

<p>Since giving ones password to nnrpd is not as secure as
normal Kerberos authentication, this option supports a
configuration where all users are given a separate instance
just for news authentica- tion with its own password, so
their regular account password isnt exposed via NNTP.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following readers.conf(5) fragment tells
nnrpd to authenticate users by attempting to obtain Kerberos
v5 TGTs for them, appending an instance of &quot;nntp&quot;
to usernames before doing so:</p>

<p>auth kerberos { auth: &quot;auth_krb5 -i nntp&quot;
}</p>

<p>access kerberos { users: &quot;*/nntp&quot; newsgroups:
example.* }</p>

<p>Access is granted to the example.* groups for all users
who success- fully authenticate.</p>

<p>BUGS Currently, any username containing realm
information (containing &quot;@&quot;) is rejected. This is
to prevent someone from passing in a username corresponding
to a principal in another realm that they have access to and
gaining access to the news server via it. However, this is
also something that people may wish to do under some
circumstances, so there should be a better way of handling
it (such as, perhaps, a list of acceptable realms or a -r
flag specifying the realm in which to attempt
authentication).</p>

<p>Its not clear the right thing to do when the username
passed in con- tains a &quot;/&quot; and -i was also given.
Right now, auth_krb5 will create a malformed Kerberos
principal with multiple instances and attempt to
authenticate against it, which will fail but perhaps not
with the best error message.</p>
