<p>TIME(2) Linux Programmer s Manual TIME(2)</p>

<p>NAME time - get time in seconds</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>time_t time(time_t *t);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION time() returns the time since the Epoch
(00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970), measured in seconds.</p>

<p>If t is non-NULL, the return value is also stored in the
memory pointed to by t.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, the value of time in seconds
since the Epoch is returned. On error, ((time_t)-1) is
returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT t points outside your accessible address
space.</p>

<p>NOTES POSIX.1 defines seconds since the Epoch as a value
to be interpreted as the number of seconds between a
specified time and the Epoch, according to a formula for
conversion from UTC equivalent to conversion on the naive
basis that leap seconds are ignored and all years divisible
by 4 are leap years. This value is not the same as the
actual number of seconds between the time and the Epoch,
because of leap seconds and because clocks are not required
to be synchronised to a standard refer- ence. The intention
is that the interpretation of seconds since the Epoch values
be consistent; see POSIX.1 Annex B 2.2.2 for further
rationale.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001. Under 4.3BSD,
this call is obsoleted by gettimeofday(2). POSIX does not
specify any error conditions.</p>
