<p>NAME perlreref - Perl Regular Expressions Reference</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is a quick reference to Perl s regular
expressions. For full information see perlre and perlop, as
well as the &quot;SEE ALSO&quot; section in this
document.</p>

<p>OPERATORS</p>

<p>=~ determines to which variable the regex is applied. In
its absence, $_ is used.</p>

<p>$var =~ /foo/;</p>

<p>!~ determines to which variable the regex is applied,
and negates the result of the match; it returns false if the
match succeeds, and true if it fails.</p>

<p>$var !~ /foo/;</p>

<p>m/pattern/igmsoxc searches a string for a pattern match,
applying the given options.</p>

<p>i case-Insensitive g Global - all occurrences m
Multiline mode - ^ and $ match internal lines s match as a
Single line - . matches o compile pattern Once x eXtended
legibility - free whitespace and comments c dont reset pos
on failed matches when using /g</p>

<p>If pattern is an empty string, the last
I&lt;successfully&gt; matched regex is used. Delimiters
other than / may be used for both this operator and the
following ones.</p>

<p>qr/pattern/imsox lets you store a regex in a variable,
or pass one around. Modifiers as for m// and are stored
within the regex.</p>

<p>s/pattern/replacement/igmsoxe substitutes matches of
pattern with replacement. Modifiers as for m// with one
addition:</p>

<p>e Evaluate replacement as an expression</p>

<p>e may be specified multiple times. replacement is
interpreted as a double quoted string unless a single-quote
() is the delimiter.</p>

<p>?pattern? is like m/pattern/ but matches only once. No
alternate delimiters can be used. Must be reset with
L&lt;reset perlfunc/reset&gt;.</p>

<p>SYNTAX</p>

<p>Escapes the character immediately following it . Matches
any single character except a newline (unless /s is used) ^
Matches at the beginning of the string (or line, if /m is
used) $ Matches at the end of the string (or line, if /m is
used) * Matches the preceding element 0 or more times +
Matches the preceding element 1 or more times ? Matches the
preceding element 0 or 1 times {...} Specifies a range of
occurrences for the element preceding it [...] Matches any
one of the characters contained within the brackets (...)
Groups subexpressions for capturing to $1, $2... (?:...)
Groups subexpressions without capturing (cluster) Matches
either the subexpression preceding or following it 1, 2 ...
The text from the Nth group</p>

<p>ESCAPE SEQUENCES</p>

<p>These work as in normal strings.</p>

<p>Alarm (beep) \ Escape Formfeed NewlineCarriage return
Tab 37 Any octal ASCII value f Any hexadecimal ASCII value }
A wide hexadecimal value ame} A named character</p>

<p>Lowercase next character Titlecase next character
Lowercase until U Uppercase until Q Disable pattern
metacharacters until End case modification</p>

<p>For Titlecase, see &quot;Titlecase&quot;.</p>

<p>This one works differently from normal strings:</p>

<p>An assertion, not backspace, except in a character
class</p>

<p>CHARACTER CLASSES</p>

<p>[amy] Match a, m or y [f-j] Dash specifies
&quot;range&quot; [f-j-] Dash escaped or at start or end
means dash [^f-j] Caret indicates &quot;match any character
_except_ these&quot;</p>

<p>The following sequences work within or without a
character class. The first six are locale aware, all are
Unicode aware. The default charac- ter class equivalent are
given. See perllocale and perlunicode for details.</p>

<p>A digit [0-9] A nondigit [^0-9] 0 A word character
[a-zA-Z0-9_] W A non-word character [^a-zA-Z0-9_] A
whitespace character [ 0r A non-whitespace character [^
0r</p>

<p>Match a byte (with Unicode, . matches a character) P
Match P-named (Unicode) property {...} Match Unicode
property with long name PP Match non-P P{...} Match lack of
Unicode property with long name Match extended unicode
sequence</p>

<p>POSIX character classes and their Unicode and Perl
equivalents:</p>

<p>alnum IsAlnum Alphanumeric alpha IsAlpha Alphabetic
ascii IsASCII Any ASCII char blank IsSpace [ ] Horizontal
whitespace (GNU extension) cntrl IsCntrl Control characters
digit IsDigit Digits graph IsGraph Alphanumeric and
punctuation lower IsLower Lowercase chars (locale and
Unicode aware) print IsPrint Alphanumeric, punct, and space
punct IsPunct Punctuation space IsSpace [] Whitespace
IsSpacePerl Perls whitespace definition upper IsUpper
Uppercase chars (locale and Unicode aware) word IsWord 0
Alphanumeric plus _ (Perl extension) xdigit IsXDigit
[0-9A-Fa-f] Hexadecimal digit</p>

<p>Within a character class:</p>

<p>POSIX traditional Unicode [:digit:] {IsDigit} [:^digit:]
P{IsDigit}</p>

<p>ANCHORS</p>

<p>All are zero-width assertions.</p>

<p>^ Match string start (or line, if /m is used) $ Match
string end (or line, if /m is used) or before newline M a
tword boundary (between 72W) c h 0Match except at word
boundary (between 7248W and W) 1string start (regardless of
/m) Matcstring end (before optional newline) Match absolute
string end G Match where previous m//g left off</p>

<p>QUANTIFIERS</p>

<p>Quantifiers are greedy by default -- match the longest
leftmost.</p>

<p>Maximal Minimal Allowed range ------- -------
------------- {n,m} {n,m}? Must occur at least n times but
no more than m times {n,} {n,}? Must occur at least n times
{n} {n}? Must occur exactly n times * *? 0 or more times
(same as {0,}) + +? 1 or more times (same as {1,}) ? ?? 0 or
1 time (same as {0,1})</p>

<p>There is no quantifier {,n} -- that gets understood as a
literal string.</p>

<p>EXTENDED CONSTRUCTS</p>

<p>(?#text) A comment (?imxs-imsx:...) Enable/disable
option (as per m// modifiers) (?=...) Zero-width positive
lookahead assertion (?!...) Zero-width negative lookahead
assertion (?&lt;=...) Zero-width positive lookbehind
assertion (?&lt;!...) Zero-width negative lookbehind
assertion (?&gt;...) Grab what we can, prohibit backtracking
(?{ code }) Embedded code, return value becomes $^R (??{
code }) Dynamic regex, return value used as regex
(?(cond)yesno) cond being integer corresponding to capturing
parens (?(cond)yes) or a lookaround/eval zero-width
assertion</p>

<p>VARIABLES</p>

<p>$_ Default variable for operators to use $* Enable
multiline matching (deprecated; not in 5.9.0 or later)</p>

<p>$&amp; Entire matched string $ Everything prior to
matched string $ Everything after to matched string</p>

<p>The use of those last three will slow down all regex use
within your program. Consult perlvar for @LAST_MATCH_START
to see equivalent expressions that won t cause slow down.
See also Devel::SawAmpersand.</p>

<p>$1, $2 ... hold the Xth captured expr $+ Last
parenthesized pattern match $^N Holds the most recently
closed capture $^R Holds the result of the last (?{...})
expr @- Offsets of starts of groups. $-[0] holds start of
whole match @+ Offsets of ends of groups. $+[0] holds end of
whole match</p>

<p>Captured groups are numbered according to their opening
paren.</p>

<p>FUNCTIONS</p>

<p>lc Lowercase a string lcfirst Lowercase first char of a
string uc Uppercase a string ucfirst Titlecase first char of
a string</p>

<p>pos Return or set current match position quotemeta Quote
metacharacters reset Reset ?pattern? status study Analyze
string for optimizing matching</p>

<p>split Use regex to split a string into parts</p>

<p>The first four of these are like the escape sequences
&quot; &quot; &quot;U&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. For
Titlecase, see &quot;Titlecase&quot;.</p>

<p>TERMINOLOGY</p>

<p>Titlecase</p>

<p>Unicode concept which most often is equal to uppercase,
but for certain characters like the German &quot;sharp
s&quot; there is a difference.</p>
