<p>ACCEPT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual ACCEPT(2)</p>

<p>NAME accept - accept a connection on a socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t
*addrlen);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The accept() system call is used with
connection-based socket types (SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_SEQPACKET).
It extracts the first connection request on the queue of
pending connections, creates a new connected socket, and
returns a new file descriptor referring to that socket. The
newly created socket is not in the listening state. The
original socket sockfd is unaffected by this call.</p>

<p>The argument sockfd is a socket that has been created
with socket(2), bound to a local address with bind(2), and
is listening for connections after a listen(2).</p>

<p>The argument addr is a pointer to a sockaddr structure.
This structure is filled in with the address of the peer
socket, as known to the com- munications layer. The exact
format of the address returned addr is determined by the
socket s address family (see socket(2) and the respective
protocol man pages). The addrlen argument is a value-result
argument: it should initially contain the size of the
structure pointed to by addr; on return it will contain the
actual length (in bytes) of the address returned. When addr
is NULL nothing is filled in.</p>

<p>If no pending connections are present on the queue, and
the socket is not marked as non-blocking, accept() blocks
the caller until a connec- tion is present. If the socket is
marked non-blocking and no pending connections are present
on the queue, accept() fails with the error EAGAIN.</p>

<p>In order to be notified of incoming connections on a
socket, you can use select(2) or poll(2). A readable event
will be delivered when a new connection is attempted and you
may then call accept() to get a socket for that connection.
Alternatively, you can set the socket to deliver SIGIO when
activity occurs on a socket; see socket(7) for details.</p>

<p>For certain protocols which require an explicit
confirmation, such as DECNet, accept() can be thought of as
merely dequeuing the next connec- tion request and not
implying confirmation. Confirmation can be implied by a
normal read or write on the new file descriptor, and
rejection can be implied by closing the new socket.
Currently only DEC- Net has these semantics on Linux.</p>

<p>NOTES There may not always be a connection waiting after
a SIGIO is delivered or select(2) or poll(2) return a
readability event because the connec- tion might have been
removed by an asynchronous network error or another thread
before accept() is called. If this happens then the call
will block waiting for the next connection to arrive. To
ensure that accept() never blocks, the passed socket sockfd
needs to have the O_NONBLOCK flag set (see socket(7)).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, accept() returns a non-negative
integer that is a descrip- tor for the accepted socket. On
error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERROR HANDLING Linux accept() passes already-pending
network errors on the new socket as an error code from
accept(). This behaviour differs from other BSD socket
implementations. For reliable operation the application
should detect the network errors defined for the protocol
after accept() and treat them like EAGAIN by retrying. In
case of TCP/IP these are ENET- DOWN, EPROTO, ENOPROTOOPT,
EHOSTDOWN, ENONET, EHOSTUNREACH, EOPNOTSUPP, and
ENETUNREACH.</p>

<p>ERRORS accept() shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK The socket is marked non-blocking
and no connections are present to be accepted.</p>

<p>EBADF The descriptor is invalid.</p>

<p>ECONNABORTED A connection has been aborted.</p>

<p>EINTR The system call was interrupted by a signal that
was caught before a valid connection arrived.</p>

<p>EINVAL Socket is not listening for connections, or
addrlen is invalid (e.g., is negative).</p>

<p>EMFILE The per-process limit of open file descriptors
has been reached.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The descriptor references a file, not a
socket.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The referenced socket is not of type
SOCK_STREAM.</p>

<p>accept() may fail if:</p>

<p>EFAULT The addr argument is not in a writable part of
the user address space.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS, ENOMEM Not enough free memory. This often means
that the memory allo- cation is limited by the socket buffer
limits, not by the system memory.</p>

<p>EPROTO Protocol error.</p>

<p>Linux accept() may fail if:</p>

<p>EPERM Firewall rules forbid connection.</p>

<p>In addition, network errors for the new socket and as
defined for the protocol may be returned. Various Linux
kernels can return other errors such as ENOSR,
ESOCKTNOSUPPORT, EPROTONOSUPPORT, ETIMEDOUT. The value
ERESTARTSYS may be seen during a trace.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.4BSD (accept() first appeared in
4.2BSD).</p>

<p>On Linux, the new socket returned by accept() does not
inherit file status flags such as O_NONBLOCK and O_ASYNC
from the listening socket. This behaviour differs from the
canonical BSD sockets implementation. Portable programs
should not rely on inheritance or non-inheritance of file
status flags and always explicitly set all required flags on
the socket returned from accept().</p>

<p>NOTE The third argument of accept() was originally
declared as an int * (and is that under libc4 and libc5 and
on many other systems like 4.x BSD, SunOS 4, SGI); a
POSIX.1g draft standard wanted to change it into a size_t *
, and that is what it is for SunOS 5. Later POSIX drafts
have socklen_t *, and so do the Single Unix Specification
and glibc2. Quoting Linus Torvalds:</p>

<p>&quot;_Any_ sane library _must_ have
&quot;socklen_t&quot; be the same size as int. Anything else
breaks any BSD socket layer stuff. POSIX initially did make
it a size_t, and I (and hopefully others, but obviously not
too many) complained to them very loudly indeed. Making it a
size_t is completely broken, exactly because size_t very
seldom is the same size as &quot;int&quot; on 64-bit
architectures, for example. And it has to be the same size
as &quot;int&quot; because thats what the BSD socket
interface is. Anyway, the POSIX people eventually got a
clue, and created &quot;socklen_t&quot;. They shouldnt have
touched it in the first place, but once they did they felt
it had to have a named type for some unfath- omable reason
(probably somebody didnt like losing face over having done
the original stupid thing, so they silently just renamed
their blunder).&quot;</p>
