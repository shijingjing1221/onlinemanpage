<p>NAME tcpslice - extract pieces of and/or glue together
tcpdump files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tcpslice [ -dRrt ] [ -w file ] [ start-time [
end-time ] ] file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcpslice is a program for extracting
portions of packet-trace files generated using tcpdump(1)s
-w flag. It can also be used to glue together several such
files, as discussed below.</p>

<p>The basic operation of tcpslice is to copy to stdout all
packets from its input file(s) whose timestamps fall within
a given range. The starting and ending times of the range
may be specified on the command line. All ranges are
inclusive. The starting time defaults to the time of the
first packet in the first input file; we call this the first
time. The ending time defaults to ten years after the
starting time. Thus, the command tcpslice trace-file simply
copies trace-file to stdout (assuming the file does not
include more than ten years worth of data).</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to specify times. The first
is using Unix timestamps of the form sssssssss.uuuuuu (this
is the format specified by tcpdump s -tt flag). For example,
654321098.7654 specifies 38 sec- onds and 765,400
microseconds after 8:51PM PDT, Sept. 25, 1990.</p>

<p>All examples in this manual are given for PDT times, but
when display- ing times and interpreting times symbolically
as discussed below, tcp- slice uses the local timezone,
regardless of the timezone in which the tcpdump file was
generated. The daylight-savings setting used is that which
is appropriate for the local timezone at the date in
question. For example, times associated with summer months
will usually include daylight-savings effects, and those
with winter months will not.</p>

<p>Times may also be specified relative to either the first
time (when specifying a starting time) or the starting time
(when specifying an ending time) by preceding a numeric
value in seconds with a +. For example, a starting time of
+200 indicates 200 seconds after the first time, and the two
arguments +200 +300 indicate from 200 seconds after the
first time through 500 seconds after the first time.</p>

<p>Times may also be specified in terms of years (y),
months (m), days (d), hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s),
and microseconds(u). For example, the Unix timestamp
654321098.7654 discussed above could also be expressed as
90y9m25d20h51m38s765400u.</p>

<p>When specifying times using this style, fields that are
omitted default as follows. If the omitted field is a unit
greater than that of the first specified field, then its
value defaults to the corresponding value taken from either
first time (if the starting time is being spec- ified) or
the starting time (if the ending time is being specified).
If the omitted field is a unit less than that of the first
specified field, then it defaults to zero. For example,
suppose that the input file has a first time of the Unix
timestamp mentioned above, i.e., 38 seconds and 765,400
microseconds after 8:51PM PDT, Sept. 25, 1990. To specify
9:36PM PDT (exactly) on the same date we could use 21h36m.
To specify a range from 9:36PM PDT through 1:54AM PDT the
next day we could use 21h36m 26d1h54m.</p>

<p>Relative times can also be specified when using the
ymdhmsu format. Omitted fields then default to 0 if the unit
of the field is greater than that of the first specified
field, and to the corresponding value taken from either the
first time or the starting time if the omitted field s unit
is less than that of the first specified field. Given a
first time of the Unix timestamp mentioned above, 22h +1h10m
specifies a range from 10:00PM PDT on that date through
11:10PM PDT, and +1h +1h10m specifies a range from 38.7654
seconds after 9:51PM PDT through 38.7654 seconds after
11:01PM PDT. The first hour of the file could be extracted
using +0 +1h.</p>

<p>Note that with the ymdhmsu format there is an ambiguity
between using m for month or for minute. The ambiguity is
resolved as follows: if an m field is followed by a d field
then it is interpreted as specify- ing months; otherwise it
specifies minutes.</p>

<p>If more than one input file is specified then tcpslice
first copies packets lying in the given range from the first
file; it then increases the starting time of the range to
lie just beyond the timestamp of the last packet in the
first file, repeats the process with the second file, and so
on. Thus files with interleaved packets are not merged. For
a given file, only packets that are newer than any in the
preceding files will be considered. This mechanism avoids
any possibility of a packet occurring more than once in the
output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS If any of -R, -r or -t are specified then
tcpslice reports the times- tamps of the first and last
packets in each input file and exits. Only one of these
three options may be specified.</p>

<p>-d Dump the start and end times specified by the given
range and exit. This option is useful for checking that the
given range actually specifies the times you think it does.
If one of -R, -r or -t has been specified then the times are
dumped in the corresponding format; otherwise, raw format (
-R) is used.</p>

<p>-R Dump the timestamps of the first and last packets in
each input file as raw timestamps (i.e., in the form
sssssssss.uuuuuu).</p>

<p>-r Same as -R except the timestamps are dumped in
human-readable format, similar to that used by date(1).</p>

<p>-t Same as -R except the timestamps are dumped in
tcpslice format, i.e., in the ymdhmsu format discussed
above.</p>

<p>-w Direct the output to file rather than stdout.</p>

<p>An input filename that beings with a digit or a + can be
confused with a start/end time. Such filenames can be
specified with a leading ./ ; for example, specify the file
04Jul76.trace as ./04Jul76.trace.</p>

<p>tcpslice cannot read its input from stdin, since it uses
random-access to rummage through its input files.</p>

<p>tcpslice refuses to write to its output if it is a
terminal (as indi- cated by isatty(3)). This is not a bug
but a feature, to prevent it from spraying binary data to
the user s terminal. Note that this means you must either
redirect stdout or specify an output file via -w.</p>

<p>tcpslice will not work properly on tcpdump files
spanning more than one year; with files containing portions
of packets whose original length was more than 65,535 bytes;
nor with files containing fewer than three packets. Such
files result in the error message: couldnt find final packet
in file . These problems are due to the interpolation scheme
used by tcpslice to greatly speed up its processing when
dealing with large trace files. Note that tcpslice can
efficiently extract slices from the middle of trace files of
any size, and can also work with truncated trace files
(i.e., the final packet in the file is only par- tially
present, typically due to tcpdump being ungracefully
killed).</p>
