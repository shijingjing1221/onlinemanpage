<p>SYSLOG.CONF(5) Linux System Administration
SYSLOG.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME syslog.conf - syslogd(8) configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The syslog.conf file is the main
configuration file for the syslogd(8) which logs system
messages on *nix systems. This file specifies rules for
logging. For special features see the sysklogd(8)
manpage.</p>

<p>Every rule consists of two fields, a selector field and
an action field. These two fields are separated by one or
more spaces or tabs. The selector field specifies a pattern
of facilities and priorities belonging to the specified
action.</p>

<p>Lines starting with a hash mark (#) and empty lines are
ignored.</p>

<p>This release of syslogd is able to understand an
extended syntax. One rule can be divided into several lines
if the leading line is termi- nated with an backslash
().</p>

<p>SELECTORS The selector field itself again consists of
two parts, a facility and a priority, separated by a period
(.). Both parts are case insensi- tive and can also be
specified as decimal numbers, but don t do that, you have
been warned. Both facilities and priorities are described in
syslog(3). The names mentioned below correspond to the
similar LOG_-values in /usr/include/syslog.h.</p>

<p>The facility is one of the following keywords: auth,
authpriv, cron, daemon, kern, lpr, mail, mark, news,
security (same as auth), syslog, user, uucp and local0
through local7. The keyword security should not be used
anymore and mark is only for internal use and therefore
should not be used in applications. Anyway, you may want to
specify and redi- rect these messages here. The facility
specifies the subsystem that produced the message, i.e. all
mail programs log with the mail facility (LOG_MAIL) if they
log using syslog.</p>

<p>The priority is one of the following keywords, in
ascending order: debug, info, notice, warning, warn (same as
warning), err, error (same as err), crit, alert, emerg,
panic (same as emerg). The keywords error, warn and panic
are deprecated and should not be used anymore. The priority
defines the severity of the message</p>

<p>The behavior of the original BSD syslogd is that all
messages of the specified priority and higher are logged
according to the given action. This syslogd(8) behaves the
same, but has some extensions.</p>

<p>In addition to the above mentioned names the syslogd(8)
understands the following extensions: An asterisk ( *)
stands for all facilities or all priorities, depending on
where it is used (before or after the period). The keyword
none stands for no priority of the given facil- ity.</p>

<p>You can specify multiple facilities with the same
priority pattern in one statement using the comma (,)
operator. You may specify as much facilities as you want.
Remember that only the facility part from such a statement
is taken, a priority part would be skipped.</p>

<p>Multiple selectors may be specified for a single action
using the semi- colon (;) separator. Remember that each
selector in the selector field is capable to overwrite the
preceding ones. Using this behavior you can exclude some
priorities from the pattern.</p>

<p>This syslogd(8) has a syntax extension to the original
BSD source, that makes its use more intuitively. You may
precede every priority with an equation sign (=) to specify
only this single priority and not any of the above. You may
also (both is valid, too) precede the priority with an
exclamation mark ( ! ) to ignore all that priorities, either
exact this one or this and any higher priority. If you use
both exten- sions than the exclamation mark must occur
before the equation sign, just use it intuitively.</p>

<p>ACTIONS The action field of a rule describes the
abstract term logfile. A logfile need not to be a real file,
btw. The syslogd(8) provides the following actions.</p>

<p>Regular File Typically messages are logged to real
files. The file has to be speci- fied with full pathname,
beginning with a slash /.</p>

<p>You may prefix each entry with the minus - sign to omit
syncing the file after every logging. Note that you might
lose information if the system crashes right behind a write
attempt. Nevertheless this might give you back some
performance, especially if you run programs that use logging
in a very verbose manner.</p>

<p>Named Pipes This version of syslogd(8) has support for
logging output to named pipes (fifos). A fifo or named pipe
can be used as a destination for log messages by prepending
a pipe symbol (|) to the name of the file. This is handy for
debugging. Note that the fifo must be created with the
mkfifo(1) command before syslogd(8) is started.</p>

<p>Terminal and Console If the file you specified is a tty,
special tty-handling is done, same with /dev/console.</p>

<p>Remote Machine This syslogd(8) provides full remote
logging, i.e. is able to send mes- sages to a remote host
running syslogd(8) and to receive messages from remote
hosts. The remote host wont forward the message again, it
will just log them locally. To forward messages to another
host, prepend the hostname with the at sign (@).</p>

<p>Using this feature you re able to control all syslog
messages on one host, if all other machines will log
remotely to that. This tears down administration needs.</p>

<p>List of Users Usually critical messages are also
directed to root on that machine. You can specify a list of
users that shall get the message by simply writing the
login. You may specify more than one user by sepa- rating
them with commas (,). If theyre logged in they get the
message. Don t think a mail would be sent, that might be too
late.</p>

<p>Everyone logged on Emergency messages often go to all
users currently online to notify them that something strange
is happening with the system. To specify this
wall(1)-feature use an asterisk (*).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Here are some example, partially taken from a
real existing site and configuration. Hopefully they rub out
all questions to the configura- tion, if not, drop me (Joey)
a line.</p>

<p># Store critical stuff in critical # *.=crit;kern.none
/var/adm/critical</p>

<p>This will store all messages with the priority crit in
the file /var/adm/critical, except for any kernel
message.</p>

<p># Kernel messages are first, stored in the kernel #
file, critical messages and higher ones also go # to another
host and to the console # kern.* /var/adm/kernel kern.crit
@finlandia kern.crit /dev/console kern.info;kern.!err
/var/adm/kernel-info</p>

<p>The first rule direct any message that has the kernel
facility to the file /var/adm/kernel.</p>

<p>The second statement directs all kernel messages of the
priority crit and higher to the remote host finlandia. This
is useful, because if the host crashes and the disks get
irreparable errors you might not be able to read the stored
messages. If theyre on a remote host, too, you still can try
to find out the reason for the crash.</p>

<p>The third rule directs these messages to the actual
console, so the person who works on the machine will get
them, too.</p>

<p>The fourth line tells the syslogd to save all kernel
messages that come with priorities from info up to warning
in the file /var/adm/kernel- info. Everything from err and
higher is excluded.</p>

<p># The tcp wrapper loggs with mail.info, we display # all
the connections on tty12 # mail.=info /dev/tty12</p>

<p>This directs all messages that uses mail.info (in source
LOG_MAIL | LOG_INFO) to /dev/tty12, the 12th console. For
example the tcpwrapper tcpd(8) uses this as its default.</p>

<p># Store all mail concerning stuff in a file #
mail.*;mail.!=info /var/adm/mail</p>

<p>This pattern matches all messages that come with the
mail facility, except for the info priority. These will be
stored in the file /var/adm/mail.</p>

<p># Log all mail.info and news.info messages to info #
mail,news.=info /var/adm/info</p>

<p>This will extract all messages that come either with
mail.info or with news.info and store them in the file
/var/adm/info.</p>

<p># Log info and notice messages to messages file #
*.=info;*.=notice; mail.none /var/log/messages</p>

<p>This lets the syslogd log all messages that come with
either the info or the notice facility into the file
/var/log/messages, except for all messages that use the mail
facility.</p>

<p># Log info messages to messages file # *.=info;
mail,news.none /var/log/messages</p>

<p>This statement causes the syslogd to log all messages
that come with the info priority to the file
/var/log/messages. But any message com- ing either with the
mail or the news facility will not be stored.</p>

<p># Emergency messages will be displayed using wall #
*.=emerg *</p>

<p>This rule tells the syslogd to write all emergency
messages to all cur- rently logged in users. This is the
wall action.</p>

<p># Messages of the priority alert will be directed # to
the operator # *.alert root,joey</p>

<p>This rule directs all messages with a priority of alert
or higher to the terminals of the operator, i.e. of the
users root and joey if theyre logged in.</p>

<p>*.* @finlandia</p>

<p>This rule would redirect all messages to a remote host
called finlan- dia. This is useful especially in a cluster
of machines where all sys- log messages will be stored on
only one machine.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX DIFFERENCES Syslogd uses a
slightly different syntax for its configuration file than
the original BSD sources. Originally all messages of a
specific priority and above were forwarded to the log file.
The modifiers = , ! and - were added to make the syslogd
more flexible and to use it in a more intuitive manner.</p>

<p>The original BSD syslogd doesnt understand spaces as
separators between the selector and the action field.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/syslog.conf Configuration file for
syslogd</p>

<p>BUGS The effects of multiple selectors are sometimes not
intuitive. For example mail.crit,*.err will select mail
facility messages at the level of err or higher, not at the
level of crit or higher.</p>

<p>AUTHORS The syslogd is taken from BSD sources, Greg
Wettstein (greg@wind.enjel- lic.com) performed the port to
Linux, Martin Schulze (joey@linux.de) made some bugfixes and
added some new features.</p>
