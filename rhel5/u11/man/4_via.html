<p>NAME via - VIA unichrome graphics driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;via&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION via is an Xorg driver for VIA chipsets with
onboard unichrome graphics.</p>

<p>The via driver supports the VIA CLE266, KM400/KN400,
K8M/N800, PM/N800 and CN400 chipsets, including 2D
acceleration and the Xv video overlay extensions. Flat
panel, TV and VGA outputs are supported, depending on the
hardware configuration.</p>

<p>Direct rendering 3D is available using experimental
drivers in Mesa, www.mesa3d.org. Also there is an XvMC
client library for hardware MPEG1 / MPEG2 decoding
acceleration available on the CLE266, CN400, PM/N800 and
K8M/N800 chipsets that uses the Direct Rendering Infras-
tructure, DRI. The XvMC client library implements a
nonstandard &quot;VLD&quot; extension to the XvMC standard.
The current Direct Rendering Manager Linux kernel module is
available at dri.sourceforge.net.</p>

<p>The driver supports free modes for Unichome Pro
chipsets. (K8M/N800, PM/N800 and CN400). Currently for
Unichrome chipsets, it only supports a limited number of
dotclocks, so if you are using X modelines, you must make
sure that the dotclock is one of those supported. Supported
dotclocks on Unichromes are currently (MHz): 25.2, 25.312,
26.591, 31.5, 31.704, 32.663, 33.750, 35.5, 36.0, 39.822,
40.0, 41.164, 46.981, 49.5, 50.0, 56.3, 57.284, 64.995,
65.0, 65.028, 74.480, 75.0, 78.8, 81.613, 94.5, 108.0,
108.28, 122.0, 122.726, 135.0, 148.5, 155.8, 157.5, 161.793,
162.0, 175.5, 189.0, 202.5, 204.8, 218.3, 229.5. On top of
this, bandwidth restrictions apply both for Unichromes and
Unichrome Pros.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5x) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The following driver options are supported</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable acceleration. Default: acceleration is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable use of hardware cursors. The default is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable the use of a software cursor. The default is
disabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Use a
shadow frame buffer. This is required when rotating the
display, but otherwise defaults to disabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;VideoRAM&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Override
the VideoRAM auto detection. This should never be
needed.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;string&quot; Rotate the
display either clockwise (&quot;CW&quot;) or counter
clockwise (&quot;CCW&quot;). Rotation is only supported
unaccelerated.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ActiveDevice&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Specify the active device combination. Any string containing
&quot;CRT&quot;, &quot;LCD&quot;, &quot;TV&quot; should be
possible. The default is to use what is detected. The driver
is currently unable to use LCD and TV simultaneously, and
will favour the LCD.</p>

<p>Option &quot;LCDDualEdge&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Use
dual edge mode to set the LCD.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Center&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable or
enable image centering on DVI displays.</p>

<p>Option &quot;PanelSize&quot; &quot;string&quot; Specify
the size (width x height) of the LCD panel attached to the
system. Sizes 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024, and
1400x1050 are supported.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVDotCrawl&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Disable or enable dotcrawl.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVDeflicker&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Specify deflicker setting for TV output. Valid values are
0,1,2 0) No deflicker, 1) 1:1:1 deflicker, 2) 1:2:1
deflicker.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVType&quot; &quot;string&quot; Specify TV
output format. The driver currently supports
&quot;NTSC&quot; and &quot;PAL&quot; timings only.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVOutput&quot; &quot;string&quot; Specify
which TV output to use. The driver supports
&quot;S-Video&quot;, &quot;Composite&quot;, &quot;SC&quot;,
&quot;RGB&quot; and &quot;YCbCr&quot; outputs. Note that on
some EPIA boards the composite video port is shared with
audio out and jumper selected.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DisableVQ&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable the use of VQ. VQ is enabled by default.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DRIXINERAMA&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Set
DRI Xinerama mode. Currently unsupported.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DisableIRQ&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Disables Vblank IRQ. A workaround for some mainboards that
have problems with IRQs from the unichrome chip. With IRQ
disabled, DRI clients have no way to sync drawing to
Vblank.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EnableAGPDMA&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable the AGP DMA functionality in DRM. This requires that
DRI is enabled and will force 2D, and 3D acceleration to use
AGP DMA. The XvMC DRI client will also make use of this on
the CLE266 to consume much less CPU.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAGPFor2D&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; With
this option on, 2D acceleration will not use AGP DMA even if
it is enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoXVDMA&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; If DRI is
enabled, Xv normally uses PCI DMA to transfer video images
from system to frame-buffer memory. This is somewhat slower
than direct copies due to the limitations of the PCI bus,
but on the other hand it decreases CPU usage significantly.
Par- ticularly on computers with fast processors. Some video
players are buggy and will display rendering artifacts when
PCI DMA is used. If you experience this, or dont want your
PCI bus to be stressed with Xv images, set this option to
&quot;true&quot;. This option has no effect if DRI is not
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;string&quot; The
driver supports &quot;XAA&quot; and &quot;EXA&quot;
acceleration methods. The default method is XAA, since EXA
is still experimental. Contrary to XAA. EXA implements
acceleration for screen uploads and down- lads (if DRI is
enabled) and the Render / Composite extension.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EXANoComposite&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; If
Exa is enabled using the above option, Dont accelerate com-
posite. Since EXA, and in particular, it s composite
accelera- tion is still experimental, This is a way to
disable exa compos- ite acceleration.</p>

<p>Supported TV Encoders Unichromes tend to be paired with
several different TV Encoders.</p>

<p>VIA Technologies VT1621 Untested as no combination with
Unichrome is known or available. Supports the following
normal modes: &quot;640x480&quot; and &quot;800x600&quot;.
Use &quot;640x480Over&quot; and &quot;800x600Over&quot; for
vertical overscan. These modes are made available by the
driver and modelines provided in xorg.conf will be
ignored.</p>

<p>VIA Technologies VT1622, VT1622A, VT1623 Supports the
following modes: &quot;640x480&quot;, &quot;800x600&quot;,
&quot;1024x768&quot;, &quot;848x480&quot;,
&quot;720x480&quot; (NTSC only) and &quot;720x576&quot; (PAL
only). Use &quot;640x480Over&quot;, &quot;800x600Over&quot;,
&quot;1024x768Over&quot;, &quot;848x480Over&quot;,
&quot;720x480Over&quot; (NTSC) and &quot;720x576Over&quot;
(PAL) for vertical over- scan. The modes
&quot;720x480Noscale&quot; (NTSC) and
&quot;720x576Noscale&quot; (PAL) (VT1622 only) provide
cleaner TV output (unscaled with only minimal overscan).
These modes are made available by the driver and modelines
provided in xorg.conf will be ignored.</p>
