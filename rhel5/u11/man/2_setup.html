<p>SETUP(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SETUP(2)</p>

<p>NAME setup - setup devices and file systems, mount root
file system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>_syscall0(int, setup)</p>

<p>int setup(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION setup() is called once from within
linux/init/main.c. It calls ini- tialization functions for
devices and file systems configured into the kernel and then
mounts the root file system.</p>

<p>No user process may call setup(). Any user process, even
a process with superuser permission, will receive EPERM.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE setup() always returns -1 for a user
process.</p>

<p>ERRORS EPERM Always, for a user process.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function is Linux specific, and
should not be used in programs intended to be portable, or
indeed in any programs at all. Since Linux 2.1.121, no such
function exists anymore. The calling sequence varied: it has
had a single parameter void * BIOS and at other times a
single parameter int magic.</p>

<p>Linux 1.2.9 1996-05-03 SETUP(2)</p>
