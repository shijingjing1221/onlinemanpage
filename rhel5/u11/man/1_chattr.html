<p>NAME chattr - change file attributes on a Linux second
extended file system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS chattr [ -RVf ] [ -v version ] [ mode ]
files...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION chattr changes the file attributes on a
Linux second extended file sys- tem.</p>

<p>The format of a symbolic mode is +-=[ASacDdIijsTtu].</p>

<p>The operator + causes the selected attributes to be
added to the existing attributes of the files; - causes them
to be removed; and = causes them to be the only attributes
that the files have.</p>

<p>The letters acdijsuADST select the new attributes for
the files: append only (a), compressed (c), no dump (d),
immutable (i), data jour- nalling (j), secure deletion (s),
no tail-merging (t), undeletable (u), no atime updates (A),
synchronous directory updates (D), synchronous updates (S),
and top of directory hierarchy (T).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -R Recursively change attributes of directories
and their contents.</p>

<p>-V Be verbose with chattr s output and print the program
version.</p>

<p>-f Suppress most error messages.</p>

<p>-v version Set the files version/generation number.</p>

<p>ATTRIBUTES When a file with the A attribute set is
accessed, its atime record is not modified. This avoids a
certain amount of disk I/O for laptop sys- tems.</p>

<p>A file with the a attribute set can only be open in
append mode for writing. Only the superuser or a process
possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or
clear this attribute.</p>

<p>A file with the c attribute set is automatically
compressed on the disk by the kernel. A read from this file
returns uncompressed data. A write to this file compresses
data before storing them on the disk. Note: please make sure
to read the bugs and limitations section at the end of this
document.</p>

<p>When a directory with the D attribute set is modified,
the changes are written synchronously on the disk; this is
equivalent to the dirsync mount option applied to a subset
of the files.</p>

<p>A file with the d attribute set is not candidate for
backup when the dump(8) program is run.</p>

<p>The E attribute is used by the experimental compression
patches to indicate that a compressed file has a compression
error. It may not be set or reset using chattr(1), although
it can be displayed by lsattr(1).</p>

<p>The I attribute is used by the htree code to indicate
that a direc- tory is behind indexed using hashed trees. It
may not be set or reset using chattr(1), although it can be
displayed by lsattr(1).</p>

<p>A file with the i attribute cannot be modified: it
cannot be deleted or renamed, no link can be created to this
file and no data can be written to the file. Only the
superuser or a process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE
capability can set or clear this attribute.</p>

<p>A file with the j attribute has all of its data written
to the ext3 journal before being written to the file itself,
if the filesystem is mounted with the
&quot;data=ordered&quot; or &quot;data=writeback&quot;
options. When the filesystem is mounted with the
&quot;data=journal&quot; option all file data is already
journalled and this attribute has no effect. Only the supe-
ruser or a process possessing the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE
capability can set or clear this attribute.</p>

<p>When a file with the s attribute set is deleted, its
blocks are zeroed and written back to the disk. Note: please
make sure to read the bugs and limitations section at the
end of this document.</p>

<p>When a file with the S attribute set is modified, the
changes are written synchronously on the disk; this is
equivalent to the sync mount option applied to a subset of
the files.</p>

<p>A directory with the T attribute will be deemed to be
the top of directory hierarchies for the purposes of the
Orlov block allocator (which is used in on systems with
Linux 2.5.46 or later).</p>

<p>A file with the t attribute will not have a partial
block fragment at the end of the file merged with other
files (for those filesystems which support tail-merging).
This is necessary for applications such as LILO which read
the filesystem directly, and which don t understand
tail-merged files. Note: As of this writing, the ext2 or
ext3 filesys- tems do not (yet, except in very experimental
patches) support tail- merging.</p>

<p>When a file with the u attribute set is deleted, its
contents are saved. This allows the user to ask for its
undeletion. Note: please make sure to read the bugs and
limitations section at the end of this document.</p>

<p>The X attribute is used by the experimental compression
patches to indicate that a raw contents of a compressed file
can be accessed directly. It currently may not be set or
reset using chattr(1), although it can be displayed by
lsattr(1).</p>

<p>The Z attribute is used by the experimental compression
patches to indicate a compressed file is dirty. It may not
be set or reset using chattr(1), although it can be
displayed by lsattr(1).</p>

<p>AUTHOR chattr was written by Remy Card
&lt;Remy.Card@linux.org&gt;. It is currently being
maintained by Theodore Tso &lt;tytso@alum.mit.edu&gt;.</p>

<p>BUGS AND LIMITATIONS The c, s, and u attributes are not
honored by the ext2 and ext3 filesystems as implemented in
the current mainline Linux kernels. These attributes may be
implemented in future versions of the ext2 and ext3
filesystems.</p>

<p>The j option is only useful if the filesystem is mounted
as ext3.</p>

<p>The D option is only useful on Linux kernel 2.5.19 and
later.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY chattr is part of the e2fsprogs package and
is available from http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net.</p>
