<p>MMAP(2) Linux Programmer s Manual MMAP(2)</p>

<p>NAME mmap, munmap - map or unmap files or devices into
memory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *mmap(void *start, size_t length, int prot, int
flags, int fd, off_t offset);</p>

<p>int munmap(void *start, size_t length);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mmap() function asks to map length bytes
starting at offset offset from the file (or other object)
specified by the file descriptor fd into memory, preferably
at address start. This latter address is a hint only, and is
usually specified as 0. The actual place where the object is
mapped is returned by mmap().</p>

<p>The prot argument describes the desired memory
protection (and must not conflict with the open mode of the
file). It is either PROT_NONE or is the bitwise OR of one or
more of the other PROT_* flags.</p>

<p>PROT_EXEC Pages may be executed.</p>

<p>PROT_READ Pages may be read.</p>

<p>PROT_WRITE Pages may be written.</p>

<p>PROT_NONE Pages may not be accessed.</p>

<p>The flags parameter specifies the type of the mapped
object, mapping options and whether modifications made to
the mapped copy of the page are private to the process or
are to be shared with other references. It has bits</p>

<p>MAP_FIXED Do not select a different address than the one
specified. If the memory region specified by start and len
overlaps pages of any existing mapping(s), then the
overlapped part of the existing mapping(s) will be
discarded. If the speci- fied address cannot be used, mmap()
will fail. If MAP_FIXED is specified, start must be a
multiple of the page size. Use of this option is
discouraged.</p>

<p>MAP_SHARED Share this mapping with all other processes
that map this object. Storing to the region is equivalent to
writing to the file. The file may not actually be updated
until msync(2) or munmap(2) are called.</p>

<p>MAP_PRIVATE Create a private copy-on-write mapping.
Stores to the region do not affect the original file. It is
unspecified whether changes made to the file after the
mmap() call are visible in the mapped region.</p>

<p>You must specify exactly one of MAP_SHARED and
MAP_PRIVATE.</p>

<p>The above three flags are described in POSIX.1-2001.
Linux also knows about the following non-standard flags:</p>

<p>MAP_DENYWRITE This flag is ignored. (Long ago, it
signalled that attempts to write to the underlying file
should fail with ETXTBUSY. But this was a source of
denial-of-service attacks.)</p>

<p>MAP_EXECUTABLE This flag is ignored.</p>

<p>MAP_NORESERVE Do not reserve swap space for this
mapping. When swap space is reserved, one has the guarantee
that it is possible to modify the mapping. When swap space
is not reserved one might get SIGSEGV upon a write if no
physical memory is available. See also the discussion of the
file /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory in proc(5). In kernels
before 2.6, this flag only had effect for private writable
mappings.</p>

<p>MAP_LOCKED (since Linux 2.5.37) Lock the pages of the
mapped region into memory in the manner of mlock(). This
flag is ignored in older kernels.</p>

<p>MAP_GROWSDOWN Used for stacks. Indicates to the kernel
VM system that the map- ping should extend downwards in
memory.</p>

<p>MAP_ANONYMOUS The mapping is not backed by any file; the
fd and offset argu- ments are ignored. The use of this flag
in conjunction with MAP_SHARED is only supported on Linux
since kernel 2.4.</p>

<p>MAP_ANON Alias for MAP_ANONYMOUS. Deprecated.</p>

<p>MAP_FILE Compatibility flag. Ignored.</p>

<p>MAP_32BIT Put the mapping into the first 2GB of the
process address space. Ignored when MAP_FIXED is set. This
flag is currently only sup- ported on x86-64 for 64bit
programs.</p>

<p>MAP_POPULATE (since Linux 2.5.46) Populate (prefault)
page tables for a file mapping, by perform- ing read-ahead
on the file. Later accesses to the mapping will not be
bocked by page faults.</p>

<p>MAP_NONBLOCK (since Linux 2.5.46) Only meaningful in
conjunction with MAP_POPULATE. Dont perform read-ahead: only
create page tables entries for pages that are already
present in RAM.</p>

<p>Some systems document the additional flags MAP_AUTOGROW,
MAP_AUTORESRV, MAP_COPY, and MAP_LOCAL.</p>

<p>fd should be a valid file descriptor, unless
MAP_ANONYMOUS is set. If MAP_ANONYMOUS is set, then fd is
ignored on Linux. However, some implementations require fd
to be -1 if MAP_ANONYMOUS (or MAP_ANON) is specified, and
portable applications should ensure this.</p>

<p>offset should be a multiple of the page size as returned
by getpage- size(2).</p>

<p>Memory mapped by mmap() is preserved across fork(2),
with the same attributes.</p>

<p>A file is mapped in multiples of the page size. For a
file that is not a multiple of the page size, the remaining
memory is zeroed when mapped, and writes to that region are
not written out to the file. The effect of changing the size
of the underlying file of a mapping on the pages that
correspond to added or removed regions of the file is
unspecified.</p>

<p>The munmap() system call deletes the mappings for the
specified address range, and causes further references to
addresses within the range to generate invalid memory
references. The region is also automatically unmapped when
the process is terminated. On the other hand, closing the
file descriptor does not unmap the region.</p>

<p>The address start must be a multiple of the page size.
All pages con- taining a part of the indicated range are
unmapped, and subsequent ref- erences to these pages will
generate SIGSEGV. It is not an error if the indicated range
does not contain any mapped pages.</p>

<p>For file-backed mappings, the st_atime field for the
mapped file may be updated at any time between the mmap()
and the corresponding unmapping; the first reference to a
mapped page will update the field if it has not been
already.</p>

<p>The st_ctime and st_mtime field for a file mapped with
PROT_WRITE and MAP_SHARED will be updated after a write to
the mapped region, and before a subsequent msync() with the
MS_SYNC or MS_ASYNC flag, if one occurs.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, mmap() returns a pointer to the
mapped area. On error, the value MAP_FAILED (that is, (void
*) -1) is returned, and errno is set appropriately. On
success, munmap() returns 0, on failure -1, and errno is set
(probably to EINVAL).</p>

<p>NOTES It is architecture dependent whether PROT_READ
includes PROT_EXEC or not. Portable programs should always
set PROT_EXEC if they intend to execute code in the new
mapping.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES A file descriptor refers to a non-regular
file. Or MAP_PRIVATE was requested, but fd is not open for
reading. Or MAP_SHARED was requested and PROT_WRITE is set,
but fd is not open in read/write (O_RDWR) mode. Or
PROT_WRITE is set, but the file is append-only.</p>

<p>EAGAIN The file has been locked, or too much memory has
been locked (see setrlimit(2)).</p>

<p>EBADF fd is not a valid file descriptor (and
MAP_ANONYMOUS was not set).</p>

<p>EINVAL We dont like start or length or offset. (E.g.,
they are too large, or not aligned on a page boundary.)</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>ENODEV The underlying filesystem of the specified file
does not support memory mapping.</p>

<p>ENOMEM No memory is available, or the processs maximum
number of map- pings would have been exceeded.</p>

<p>EPERM The prot argument asks for PROT_EXEC but the
mapped area belongs to a file on a filesystem that was
mounted no-exec.</p>

<p>ETXTBSY MAP_DENYWRITE was set but the object specified
by fd is open for writing.</p>

<p>Use of a mapped region can result in these signals:</p>

<p>SIGSEGV Attempted write into a region mapped as
read-only.</p>

<p>SIGBUS Attempted access to a portion of the buffer that
does not corre- spond to the file (for example, beyond the
end of the file, including the case where another process
has truncated the file).</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY On POSIX systems on which mmap(), msync()
and munmap() are available, _POSIX_MAPPED_FILES is defined
in &lt;unistd.h&gt; to a value greater than 0. (See also
sysconf(3).)</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.4BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>BUGS On Linux there are no guarantees like those
suggested above under MAP_NORESERVE. By default, any process
can be killed at any moment when the system runs out of
memory.</p>

<p>In kernels before 2.6.7, the MAP_POPULATE flag only has
effect if prot is specified as PROT_NONE.</p>
