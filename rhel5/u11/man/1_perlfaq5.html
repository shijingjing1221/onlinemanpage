<p>PERLFAQ5(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLFAQ5(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlfaq5 - Files and Formats ($Revision: 1.42 $,
$Date: 2005/12/31 00:54:37 $)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This section deals with I/O and the
&quot;f&quot; issues: filehandles, flushing, formats, and
footers.</p>

<p>How do I flush/unbuffer an output filehandle? Why must I
do this?</p>

<p>Perl does not support truly unbuffered output (except
insofar as you can &quot;syswrite(OUT, $char, 1)&quot;),
although it does support is &quot;command buffering&quot;,
in which a physical write is performed after every output
command.</p>

<p>The C standard I/O library (stdio) normally buffers
characters sent to devices so that there isnt a system call
for each byte. In most stdio implementations, the type of
output buffering and the size of the buffer varies according
to the type of device. Perls print() and write() functions
normally buffer output, while syswrite() bypasses buffering
all together.</p>

<p>If you want your output to be sent immediately when you
execute print() or write() (for instance, for some network
protocols), you must set the handle s autoflush flag. This
flag is the Perl variable $ and when it is set to a true
value, Perl will flush the handles buffer after each print()
or write(). Setting $ affects buffering only for the
currently selected default file handle. You choose this
handle with the one argu- ment select() call (see
&quot;$&quot; in perlvar and &quot;select&quot; in
perlfunc).</p>

<p>Use select() to choose the desired handle, then set its
per-filehandle variables.</p>

<p>$old_fh = select(OUTPUT_HANDLE); $ = 1;
select($old_fh);</p>

<p>Some idioms can handle this in a single statement:</p>

<p>select((select(OUTPUT_HANDLE), $ = 1)[0]);</p>

<p>$ = 1, select $_ for select OUTPUT_HANDLE;</p>

<p>Some modules offer object-oriented access to handles and
their vari- ables, although they may be overkill if this is
the only thing you do with them. You can use IO::Handle:</p>

<p>use IO::Handle; open(DEV, &quot;&gt;/dev/printer&quot;);
# but is this? DEV-&gt;autoflush(1);</p>

<p>or IO::Socket:</p>

<p>use IO::Socket; # this one is kinda a pipe? my $sock =
IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new( www.example.com:80 );</p>

<p>$sock-&gt;autoflush();</p>

<p>How do I change one line in a file/delete a line in a
file/insert a line in the middle of a file/append to the
beginning of a file?</p>

<p>Use the Tie::File module, which is included in the
standard distribution since Perl 5.8.0.</p>

<p>How do I count the number of lines in a file?</p>

<p>One fairly efficient way is to count newlines in the
file. The follow- ing program uses a feature of tr///, as
documented in perlop. If your text file doesnt end with a
newline, then its not really a proper text file, so this may
report one fewer line than you expect.</p>

<p>$lines = 0; open(FILE, $filename) or die &quot;Cant open
$filename : $!&quot;; while (sysread FILE, $buffer, 4096) {
$lines += ($buffer =~ tr/0/); } close FILE;</p>

<p>This assumes no funny games with newline
translations.</p>

<p>How can I use Pers &quot;-i&quot; option from within a
program?</p>

<p>&quot;-i&quot; sets the value of Perls $^I variable,
which in turn affects the behavior of &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;;
see perlrun for more details. By modifying the appropriate
variables directly, you can get the same behavior within a
larger program. For example:</p>

<p># ... { local($^I, @ARGV) = (.orig,
glob(&quot;*.c&quot;)); while (&lt;&gt;) { if ($. == 1) {
print &quot;This line should appear at the top of each
file0; } p ) e a r l i ; # C o r r e c t t y s/p o s , p r e
s e r v i n g c a s e print; close ARGV if eof; # Reset $. }
} # $^I and @ARGV return to their old values here</p>

<p>This block modifies all the &quot;.c&quot; files in the
current directory, leav- ing a backup of the original data
from each file in a new &quot;.c.orig&quot; file.</p>

<p>How can I copy a file?</p>

<p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p>Use the File::Copy module. It comes with Perl and can do
a true copy across file systems, and it does its magic in a
portable fashion.</p>

<p>use File::Copy;</p>

<p>copy( $original, $new_copy ) or die &quot;Copy failed:
$!&quot;;</p>

<p>If you cant use File::Copy, youll have to do the work
yourself: open the original file, open the destination file,
then print to the desti- nation file as you read the
original.</p>

<p>How do I make a temporary file name?</p>

<p>If you dont need to know the name of the file, you can
use &quot;open()&quot; with &quot;undef&quot; in place of
the file name. The &quot;open()&quot; function creates an
anonymous temporary file.</p>

<p>open my $tmp, +&gt;, undef or die $!;</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can use the File::Temp module.</p>

<p>use File::Temp qw/ tempfile tempdir /;</p>

<p>$dir = tempdir( CLEANUP =&gt; 1 ); ($fh, $filename) =
tempfile( DIR =&gt; $dir );</p>

<p># or if you dont need to know the filename</p>

<p>$fh = tempfile( DIR =&gt; $dir );</p>

<p>The File::Temp has been a standard module since Perl
5.6.1. If you don t have a modern enough Perl installed, use
the &quot;new_tmpfile&quot; class method from the IO::File
module to get a filehandle opened for reading and writing.
Use it if you dont need to know the files name:</p>

<p>use IO::File; $fh = IO::File-&gt;new_tmpfile() or die
&quot;Unable to make new temporary file: $!&quot;;</p>

<p>If youre committed to creating a temporary file by hand,
use the pro- cess ID and/or the current time-value. If you
need to have many tempo- rary files in one process, use a
counter:</p>

<p>BEGIN { use Fcntl; my $temp_dir = -d /tmp ? /tmp :
$ENV{TMPDIR} $ENV{TEMP}; my $base_name =
sprintf(&quot;%s/%d-%d-0000&quot;, $temp_dir, $$, time());
sub temp_file { local *FH; my $count = 0; until
(defined(fileno(FH)) $count++ &gt; 100) { $base_name =~
s/-(+)$/&quot;-&quot; . (1 + $1)/e; # O_EXCL is required for
security reasons. sysopen(FH, $base_name, O_WRONLY O_EXCL
O_CREAT); } if (defined(fileno(FH)) return (*FH,
$base_name); } else { return (); } } }</p>

<p>How can I manipulate fixed-record-length files?</p>

<p>The most efficient way is using pack() and unpack().
This is faster than using substr() when taking many, many
strings. It is slower for just a few.</p>

<p>Here is a sample chunk of code to break up and put back
together again some fixed-format input lines, in this case
from the output of a nor- mal, Berkeley-style ps:</p>

<p># sample input line: # 15158 p5 T 0:00 perl
/home/tchrist/scripts/now-what my $PS_T = A6 A4 A7 A5 A*;
open my $ps, -, ps; print scalar &lt;$ps&gt;; my @fields =
qw( pid tt stat time command ); while (&lt;$ps&gt;) { my
%process; @process{@fields} = unpack($PS_T, $_); for my
$field ( @fields ) { print &quot;$field:
&lt;$process{$field}&gt;0; } print line=, pack($PS_T,
@process{@fields} ), &quot;0; }</p>

<p>We ve used a hash slice in order to easily handle the
fields of each row. Storing the keys in an array means it s
easy to operate on them as a group or loop over them with
for. It also avoids polluting the program with global
variables and using symbolic references.</p>

<p>How can I make a filehandle local to a subroutine? How
do I pass file- handles between subroutines? How do I make
an array of filehandles?</p>

<p>As of perl5.6, open() autovivifies file and directory
handles as refer- ences if you pass it an uninitialized
scalar variable. You can then pass these references just
like any other scalar, and use them in the place of named
handles.</p>

<p>open my $fh, $file_name;</p>

<p>open local $fh, $file_name;</p>

<p>print $fh &quot;Hello World!0;</p>

<p>process_file( $fh );</p>

<p>Before perl5.6, you had to deal with various typeglob
idioms which you may see in older code.</p>

<p>open FILE, &quot;&gt; $filename&quot;; process_typeglob(
*FILE ); process_reference( ILE );</p>

<p>sub process_typeglob { local *FH = shift; print FH
&quot;Typeglob!&quot; } sub process_reference { local $fh =
shift; print $fh &quot;Reference!&quot; }</p>

<p>If you want to create many anonymous handles, you should
check out the Symbol or IO::Handle modules.</p>

<p>How can I use a filehandle indirectly?</p>

<p>An indirect filehandle is using something other than a
symbol in a place that a filehandle is expected. Here are
ways to get indirect filehandles:</p>

<p>$fh = SOME_FH; # bareword is strict-subs hostile $fh =
&quot;SOME_FH&quot;; # strict-refs hostile; same package
only $fh = *SOME_FH; # typeglob $fh = OME_FH; # ref to
typeglob (bless-able) $fh = *SOME_FH{IO}; # blessed
IO::Handle from *SOME_FH typeglob</p>

<p>Or, you can use the &quot;new&quot; method from one of
the IO::* modules to cre- ate an anonymous filehandle, store
that in a scalar variable, and use it as though it were a
normal filehandle.</p>

<p>use IO::Handle; # 5.004 or higher $fh =
IO::Handle-&gt;new();</p>

<p>Then use any of those as you would a normal filehandle.
Anywhere that Perl is expecting a filehandle, an indirect
filehandle may be used instead. An indirect filehandle is
just a scalar variable that contains a filehandle. Functions
like &quot;print&quot;, &quot;open&quot;, &quot;seek&quot;,
or the &quot;&lt;FH&gt;&quot; diamond operator will accept
either a named filehandle or a scalar variable containing
one:</p>

<p>($ifh, $ofh, $efh) = (*STDIN, *STDOUT, *STDERR); print
$ofh &quot;Type it: &quot;; $got = &lt;$ifh&gt; print $efh
&quot;What was that: $got&quot;;</p>

<p>If youre passing a filehandle to a function, you can
write the func- tion in two ways:</p>

<p>sub accept_fh { my $fh = shift; print $fh &quot;Sending
to indirect filehandle0; }</p>

<p>Or it can localize a typeglob and use the filehandle
directly:</p>

<p>sub accept_fh { local *FH = shift; print FH
&quot;Sending to localized filehandle0; }</p>

<p>Both styles work with either objects or typeglobs of
real filehandles. (They might also work with strings under
some circumstances, but this is risky.)</p>

<p>accept_fh(*STDOUT); accept_fh($handle);</p>

<p>In the examples above, we assigned the filehandle to a
scalar variable before using it. That is because only simple
scalar variables, not expressions or subscripts of hashes or
arrays, can be used with built- ins like &quot;print&quot;,
&quot;printf&quot;, or the diamond operator. Using something
other than a simple scalar variable as a filehandle is
illegal and wont even compile:</p>

<p>@fd = (*STDIN, *STDOUT, *STDERR); print $fd[1]
&quot;Type it: &quot;; # WRONG $got = &lt;$fd[0]&gt; # WRONG
print $fd[2] &quot;What was that: $got&quot;; # WRONG</p>

<p>With &quot;print&quot; and &quot;printf&quot;, you get
around this by using a block and an expression where you
would place the filehandle:</p>

<p>print { $fd[1] } &quot;funny stuff0; printf { $fd[1] }
&quot;Pity the poor %x.0, 3_735_928_559; # Pity the poor
deadbeef.</p>

<p>That block is a proper block like any other, so you can
put more com- plicated code there. This sends the message
out to one of two places:</p>

<p>$ok = -x &quot;/bin/cat&quot;; print { $ok ? $fd[1] :
$fd[2] } &quot;cat stat $ok0; print { $fd[ 1+ ($ok 0) ] }
&quot;cat stat $ok0;</p>

<p>This approach of treating &quot;print&quot; and
&quot;printf&quot; like object methods calls doesnt work for
the diamond operator. Thats because its a real operator, not
just a function with a comma-less argument. Assum- ing youve
been storing typeglobs in your structure as we did above,
you can use the built-in function named &quot;readline&quot;
to read a record just as &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; does. Given
the initialization shown above for @fd, this would work, but
only because readline() requires a typeglob. It doesnt work
with objects or strings, which might be a bug we havent
fixed yet.</p>

<p>$got = readline($fd[0]);</p>

<p>Let it be noted that the flakiness of indirect
filehandles is not related to whether theyre strings,
typeglobs, objects, or anything else. It s the syntax of the
fundamental operators. Playing the object game doesnt help
you at all here.</p>

<p>How can I set up a footer format to be used with
write()?</p>

<p>There s no builtin way to do this, but perlform has a
couple of tech- niques to make it possible for the intrepid
hacker.</p>

<p>How can I write() into a string?</p>

<p>See &quot;Accessing Formatting Internals&quot; in
perlform for an swrite() func- tion.</p>

<p>How can I output my numbers with commas added?</p>

<p>(contributed by brian d foy and Benjamin Goldberg)</p>

<p>You can use Number::Format to separate places in a
number. It handles locale information for those of you who
want to insert full stops instead (or anything else that
they want to use, really).</p>

<p>This subroutine will add commas to your number:</p>

<p>sub commify { local $_ = shift; 1 while
s/^([-+]?+)({3})/$1,$2/; return $_; }</p>

<p>This regex from Benjamin Goldberg will add commas to
numbers:</p>

<p>s/(^[-+]?+?(?=(?&gt;(?:{3})+)(?!))G{3}(?=))/$1,/g;</p>

<p>It is easier to see with comments:</p>

<p>s/( ^[-+]? # beginning of number. +? # first digits
before first comma (?= # followed by, (but not included in
the match) : (?&gt;(?:{3})+) # some positive multiple of
three digits. (?!) # an *exact* multiple, not x * 3 + 1 or
whatever. ) # or: G{3} # after the last group, get three
digits (?=) # but they have to have more digits after them.
)/$1,/xg;</p>

<p>How can I translate tildes (~) in a filename?</p>

<p>Use the &lt;&gt; (glob()) operator, documented in
perlfunc. Older versions of Perl require that you have a
shell installed that groks tildes. Recent perl versions have
this feature built in. The File::KGlob module (available
from CPAN) gives more portable glob functionality.</p>

<p>Within Perl, you may use this directly:</p>

<p>$filename =~ s{ ^ ~ # find a leading tilde ( # save this
in $1 [^/] # a non-slash character * # repeated 0 or more
times (0 means me) ) }{ $1 ? (getpwnam($1))[7] : (
$ENV{HOME} $ENV{LOGDIR} ) }ex;</p>

<p>How come when I open a file read-write it wipes it
out?</p>

<p>Because you re using something like this, which
truncates the file and then gives you read-write access:</p>

<p>open(FH, &quot;+&gt; /path/name&quot;); # WRONG (almost
always)</p>

<p>Whoops. You should instead use this, which will fail if
the file doesnt exist.</p>

<p>open(FH, &quot;+&lt; /path/name&quot;); # open for
update</p>

<p>Using &quot;&gt;&quot; always clobbers or creates. Using
&quot;&lt;&quot; never does either. The &quot;+&quot; doesnt
change this.</p>

<p>Here are examples of many kinds of file opens. Those
using sysopen() all assume</p>

<p>use Fcntl;</p>

<p>To open file for reading:</p>

<p>open(FH, &quot;&lt; $path&quot;) die $!; sysopen(FH,
$path, O_RDONLY) die $!;</p>

<p>To open file for writing, create new file if needed or
else truncate old file:</p>

<p>open(FH, &quot;&gt; $path&quot;) die $!; sysopen(FH,
$path, O_WRONLYO_TRUNCO_CREAT) die $!; sysopen(FH, $path,
O_WRONLYO_TRUNCO_CREAT, 0666) die $!;</p>

<p>To open file for writing, create new file, file must not
exist:</p>

<p>sysopen(FH, $path, O_WRONLYO_EXCLO_CREAT) die $!;
sysopen(FH, $path, O_WRONLYO_EXCLO_CREAT, 0666) die $!;</p>

<p>To open file for appending, create if necessary:</p>

<p>open(FH, &quot;&gt;&gt; $path&quot;) die $!; sysopen(FH,
$path, O_WRONLYO_APPENDO_CREAT) die $!; sysopen(FH, $path,
O_WRONLYO_APPENDO_CREAT, 0666) die $!;</p>

<p>To open file for appending, file must exist:</p>

<p>sysopen(FH, $path, O_WRONLY O_APPEND) die $!;</p>

<p>To open file for update, file must exist:</p>

<p>open(FH, &quot;+&lt; $path&quot;) die $!; sysopen(FH,
$path, O_RDWR) die $!;</p>

<p>To open file for update, create file if necessary:</p>

<p>sysopen(FH, $path, O_RDWR O_CREAT) die $!; sysopen(FH,
$path, O_RDWR O_CREAT, 0666) die $!;</p>

<p>To open file for update, file must not exist:</p>

<p>sysopen(FH, $path, O_RDWRO_EXCLO_CREAT) die $!;
sysopen(FH, $path, O_RDWRO_EXCLO_CREAT, 0666) die $!;</p>

<p>To open a file without blocking, creating if
necessary:</p>

<p>sysopen(FH, &quot;/foo/somefile&quot;,
O_WRONLYO_NDELAYO_CREAT) or die &quot;cant open
/foo/somefile: $!&quot;:</p>

<p>Be warned that neither creation nor deletion of files is
guaranteed to be an atomic operation over NFS. That is, two
processes might both successfully create or unlink the same
file! Therefore O_EXCL isnt as exclusive as you might
wish.</p>

<p>See also the new perlopentut if you have it (new for
5.6).</p>

<p>Why do I sometimes get an &quot;Argument list too
long&quot; when I use &lt;*&gt;?</p>

<p>The &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; operator performs a globbing
operation (see above). In Perl versions earlier than v5.6.0,
the internal glob() operator forks csh(1) to do the actual
glob expansion, but csh cant handle more than 127 items and
so gives the error message &quot;Argument list too
long&quot;. People who installed tcsh as csh won t have this
problem, but their users may be surprised by it.</p>

<p>To get around this, either upgrade to Perl v5.6.0 or
later, do the glob yourself with readdir() and patterns, or
use a module like File::KGlob, one that doesnt use the shell
to do globbing.</p>

<p>Is there a leak/bug in glob()?</p>

<p>Due to the current implementation on some operating
systems, when you use the glob() function or its
angle-bracket alias in a scalar context, you may cause a
memory leak and/or unpredictable behavior. Its best
therefore to use glob() only in list context.</p>

<p>How can I open a file with a leading &quot;&gt;&quot; or
trailing blanks?</p>

<p>(contributed by Brian McCauley)</p>

<p>The special two argument form of Perls open() function
ignores trail- ing blanks in filenames and infers the mode
from certain leading char- acters (or a trailing
&quot;&quot;). In older versions of Perl this was the only
version of open() and so it is prevalent in old code and
books.</p>

<p>Unless you have a particular reason to use the two
argument form you should use the three argument form of
open() which does not treat any charcters in the filename as
special.</p>

<p>open FILE, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot; file &quot;; #
filename is &quot; file &quot; open FILE, &quot;&gt;&quot;,
&quot;&gt;file&quot;; # filename is &quot;&gt;file&quot;</p>

<p>How can I reliably rename a file?</p>

<p>If your operating system supports a proper mv(1) utility
or its func- tional equivalent, this works:</p>

<p>rename($old, $new) or system(&quot;mv&quot;, $old,
$new);</p>

<p>It may be more portable to use the File::Copy module
instead. You just copy to the new file to the new name
(checking return values), then delete the old one. This isn
t really the same semantically as a rename(), which
preserves meta-information like permissions, times- tamps,
inode info, etc.</p>

<p>Newer versions of File::Copy export a move()
function.</p>

<p>How can I lock a file?</p>

<p>Perls builtin flock() function (see perlfunc for
details) will call flock(2) if that exists, fcntl(2) if it
doesnt (on perl version 5.004 and later), and lockf(3) if
neither of the two previous system calls exists. On some
systems, it may even use a different form of native locking.
Here are some gotchas with Perls flock():</p>

<p>1 Produces a fatal error if none of the three system
calls (or their close equivalent) exists.</p>

<p>2 lockf(3) does not provide shared locking, and requires
that the filehandle be open for writing (or appending, or
read/writing).</p>

<p>3 Some versions of flock() can t lock files over a
network (e.g. on NFS file systems), so youd need to force
the use of fcntl(2) when you build Perl. But even this is
dubious at best. See the flock entry of perlfunc and the
INSTALL file in the source distribution for information on
building Perl to do this.</p>

<p>Two potentially non-obvious but traditional flock
semantics are that it waits indefinitely until the lock is
granted, and that its locks are merely advisory. Such
discretionary locks are more flex- ible, but offer fewer
guarantees. This means that files locked with flock() may be
modified by programs that do not also use flock(). Cars that
stop for red lights get on well with each other, but not
with cars that don t stop for red lights. See the perlport
manpage, your ports specific documentation, or your sys-
tem-specific local manpages for details. Its best to assume
tra- ditional behavior if youre writing portable programs.
(If youre not, you should as always feel perfectly free to
write for your own systems idiosyncrasies (sometimes called
&quot;features&quot;). Slavish adherence to portability
concerns shouldnt get in the way of your getting your job
done.)</p>

<p>For more information on file locking, see also
&quot;File Locking&quot; in perlopentut if you have it (new
for 5.6).</p>

<p>Why cat I just open(FH, &quot;&gt;file.lock&quot;)?</p>

<p>A common bit of code NOT TO USE is this:</p>

<p>sleep(3) while -e &quot;file.lock&quot;; # PLEASE DO NOT
USE open(LCK, &quot;&gt; file.lock&quot;); # THIS BROKEN
CODE</p>

<p>This is a classic race condition: you take two steps to
do something which must be done in one. Thats why computer
hardware provides an atomic test-and-set instruction. In
theory, this &quot;ought&quot; to work:</p>

<p>sysopen(FH, &quot;file.lock&quot;,
O_WRONLYO_EXCLO_CREAT) or die &quot;cant open file.lock:
$!&quot;;</p>

<p>except that lamentably, file creation (and deletion) is
not atomic over NFS, so this wont work (at least, not every
time) over the net. Vari- ous schemes involving link() have
been suggested, but these tend to involve busy-wait, which
is also subdesirable.</p>

<p>I still don t get locking. I just want to increment the
number in the file. How can I do this?</p>

<p>Didnt anyone ever tell you web-page hit counters were
useless? They don t count number of hits, theyre a waste of
time, and they serve only to stroke the writers vanity. Its
better to pick a random num- ber; theyre more realistic.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is what you can do if you cant help
yourself.</p>

<p>use Fcntl qw(:DEFAULT :flock); sysopen(FH,
&quot;numfile&quot;, O_RDWR O_CREAT) or die &quot;cant open
numfile: $!&quot;; flock(FH, LOCK_EX) or die &quot;cant
flock numfile: $!&quot;; $num = &lt;FH&gt; 0; seek(FH, 0, 0)
or die &quot;cant rewind numfile: $!&quot;; truncate(FH, 0)
or die &quot;cant truncate numfile: $!&quot;; (print FH
$num+1, &quot;0) or die &quot;can t write numfile: $!&quot;;
close FH or die &quot;cant close numfile: $!&quot;;</p>

<p>Heres a much better web-page hit counter:</p>

<p>$hits = int( (time() - 850_000_000) / rand(1_000) );</p>

<p>If the count doesnt impress your friends, then the code
might. :-)</p>

<p>All I want to do is append a small amount of text to the
end of a file. Do I still have to use locking?</p>

<p>If you are on a system that correctly implements flock()
and you use the example appending code from &quot;perldoc -f
flock&quot; everything will be OK even if the OS you are on
doesnt implement append mode correctly (if such a system
exists.) So if you are happy to restrict yourself to OSs
that implement flock() (and thats not really much of a
restric- tion) then that is what you should do.</p>

<p>If you know you are only going to use a system that does
correctly implement appending (i.e. not Win32) then you can
omit the seek() from the above code.</p>

<p>If you know you are only writing code to run on an OS
and filesystem that does implement append mode correctly (a
local filesystem on a mod- ern Unix for example), and you
keep the file in block-buffered mode and you write less than
one buffer-full of output between each manual flushing of
the buffer then each bufferload is almost guaranteed to be
written to the end of the file in one chunk without getting
intermin- gled with anyone else s output. You can also use
the syswrite() func- tion which is simply a wrapper around
your systems write(2) system call.</p>

<p>There is still a small theoretical chance that a signal
will interrupt the system level write() operation before
completion. There is also a possibility that some STDIO
implementations may call multiple system level write()s even
if the buffer was empty to start. There may be some systems
where this probability is reduced to zero.</p>

<p>How do I randomly update a binary file?</p>

<p>If you re just trying to patch a binary, in many cases
something as simple as this works:</p>

<p>perl -i -pe s{window manager}{window mangler}g
/usr/bin/emacs</p>

<p>However, if you have fixed sized records, then you might
do something more like this:</p>

<p>$RECSIZE = 220; # size of record, in bytes $recno = 37;
# which record to update open(FH,
&quot;+&lt;somewhere&quot;) die &quot;cant update somewhere:
$!&quot;; seek(FH, $recno * $RECSIZE, 0); read(FH, $record,
$RECSIZE) == $RECSIZE die &quot;cant read record $recno:
$!&quot;; # munge the record seek(FH, -$RECSIZE, 1); print
FH $record; close FH;</p>

<p>Locking and error checking are left as an exercise for
the reader. Dont forget them or youll be quite sorry.</p>

<p>How do I get a fils timestamp in perl?</p>

<p>If you want to retrieve the time at which the file was
last read, writ- ten, or had its meta-data (owner, etc)
changed, you use the -A, -M, or -C file test operations as
documented in perlfunc. These retrieve the age of the file
(measured against the start-time of your program) in days as
a floating point number. Some platforms may not have all of
these times. See perlport for details. To retrieve the
&quot;raw&quot; time in seconds since the epoch, you would
call the stat function, then use localtime(), gmtime(), or
POSIX::strftime() to convert this into human- readable
form.</p>

<p>Heres an example:</p>

<p>$write_secs = (stat($file))[9]; printf &quot;file %s
updated at %s0, $file, scalar localtime($write_secs);</p>

<p>If you prefer something more legible, use the File::stat
module (part of the standard distribution in version 5.004
and later):</p>

<p># error checking left as an exercise for reader. use
File::stat; use Time::localtime; $date_string =
ctime(stat($file)-&gt;mtime); print &quot;file $file updated
at $date_string0;</p>

<p>The POSIX::strftime() approach has the benefit of being,
in theory, independent of the current locale. See perllocale
for details.</p>

<p>How do I set a fils timestamp in perl?</p>

<p>You use the utime() function documented in
&quot;utime&quot; in perlfunc. By way of example, here s a
little program that copies the read and write times from its
first argument to all the rest of them.</p>

<p>if (@ARGV &lt; 2) { die &quot;usage: cptimes
timestamp_file other_files ...0; } $timestamp = shift;
($atime, $mtime) = (stat($timestamp))[8,9]; utime $atime,
$mtime, @ARGV;</p>

<p>Error checking is, as usual, left as an exercise for the
reader.</p>

<p>The perldoc for utime also has an example that has the
same effect as touch(1) on files that already exist.</p>

<p>Certain file systems have a limited ability to store the
times on a file at the expected level of precision. For
example, the FAT and HPFS filesystem are unable to create
dates on files with a finer granularity than two seconds.
This is a limitation of the filesystems, not of utime().</p>

<p>How do I print to more than one file at once?</p>

<p>To connect one filehandle to several output filehandles,
you can use the IO::Tee or Tie::FileHandle::Multiplex
modules.</p>

<p>If you only have to do this once, you can print
individually to each filehandle.</p>

<p>for $fh (FH1, FH2, FH3) { print $fh &quot;whatever0
}</p>

<p>How can I read in an entire file all at once?</p>

<p>You can use the File::Slurp module to do it in one
step.</p>

<p>use File::Slurp;</p>

<p>$all_of_it = read_file($filename); # entire file in
scalar @all_lines = read_file($filename); # one line perl
element</p>

<p>The customary Perl approach for processing all the lines
in a file is to do so one line at a time:</p>

<p>open (INPUT, $file) die &quot;can t open $file:
$!&quot;; while (&lt;INPUT&gt;) { chomp; # do something with
$_ } close(INPUT) die &quot;cant close $file: $!&quot;;</p>

<p>This is tremendously more efficient than reading the
entire file into memory as an array of lines and then
processing it one element at a time, which is often--if not
almost always--the wrong approach. When- ever you see
someone do this:</p>

<p>@lines = &lt;INPUT&gt;;</p>

<p>you should think long and hard about why you need
everything loaded at once. Its just not a scalable solution.
You might also find it more fun to use the standard
Tie::File module, or the DB_File modules $DB_RECNO bindings,
which allow you to tie an array to a file so that accessing
an element the array actually accesses the corresponding
line in the file.</p>

<p>You can read the entire filehandle contents into a
scalar.</p>

<p>{ local(*INPUT, $/); open (INPUT, $file) die &quot;cant
open $file: $!&quot;; $var = &lt;INPUT&gt;; }</p>

<p>That temporarily undefs your record separator, and will
automatically close the file at block exit. If the file is
already open, just use this:</p>

<p>$var = do { local $/; &lt;INPUT&gt; };</p>

<p>For ordinary files you can also use the read
function.</p>

<p>read( INPUT, $var, -s INPUT );</p>

<p>The third argument tests the byte size of the data on
the INPUT file- handle and reads that many bytes into the
buffer $var.</p>

<p>How can I read in a file by paragraphs?</p>

<p>Use the $/ variable (see perlvar for details). You can
either set it to &quot;&quot; to eliminate empty paragraphs
(&quot;abc0ef&quot;, for instance, gets treated as two
paragraphs and not three), or &quot;0 to accept empty
paragraphs.</p>

<p>Note that a blank line must have no blanks in it. Thus
&quot;fred0tuff0 is one paragraph, but &quot;fred0tuff0 is
two.</p>

<p>How can I read a single character from a file? From the
keyboard?</p>

<p>You can use the builtin &quot;getc()&quot; function for
most filehandles, but it wont (easily) work on a terminal
device. For STDIN, either use the Term::ReadKey module from
CPAN or use the sample code in &quot;getc&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>If your system supports the portable operating system
programming interface (POSIX), you can use the following
code, which youll note turns off echo processing as
well.</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/perl -w use strict; $ = 1; for (1..4) { my
$got; print &quot;gimme: &quot;; $got = getone(); print
&quot;--&gt; $got0; } exit;</p>

<p>BEGIN { use POSIX qw(:termios_h);</p>

<p>my ($term, $oterm, $echo, $noecho, $fd_stdin);</p>

<p>$fd_stdin = fileno(STDIN);</p>

<p>$term = POSIX::Termios-&gt;new();
$term-&gt;getattr($fd_stdin); $oterm =
$term-&gt;getlflag();</p>

<p>$echo = ECHO ECHOK ICANON; $noecho = $oterm &amp;
~$echo;</p>

<p>sub cbreak { $term-&gt;setlflag($noecho);
$term-&gt;setcc(VTIME, 1); $term-&gt;setattr($fd_stdin,
TCSANOW); }</p>

<p>sub cooked { $term-&gt;setlflag($oterm);
$term-&gt;setcc(VTIME, 0); $term-&gt;setattr($fd_stdin,
TCSANOW); }</p>

<p>sub getone { my $key = ; cbreak(); sysread(STDIN, $key,
1); cooked(); return $key; }</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>END { cooked() }</p>

<p>The Term::ReadKey module from CPAN may be easier to use.
Recent ver- sions include also support for non-portable
systems as well.</p>

<p>use Term::ReadKey; open(TTY, &quot;&lt;/dev/tty&quot;);
print &quot;Gimme a char: &quot;; ReadMode &quot;raw&quot;;
$key = ReadKey 0, *TTY; ReadMode &quot;normal&quot;; printf
&quot;0ou said %s, char number %03d0, $key, ord $key;</p>

<p>How can I tell whether thers a character waiting on a
filehandle?</p>

<p>The very first thing you should do is look into getting
the Term::Read- Key extension from CPAN. As we mentioned
earlier, it now even has lim- ited support for non-portable
(read: not open systems, closed, propri- etary, not POSIX,
not Unix, etc) systems.</p>

<p>You should also check out the Frequently Asked Questions
list in comp.unix.* for things like this: the answer is
essentially the same. Its very system dependent. Heres one
solution that works on BSD sys- tems:</p>

<p>sub key_ready { my($rin, $nfd); vec($rin, fileno(STDIN),
1) = 1; return $nfd = select($rin,undef,undef,0); }</p>

<p>If you want to find out how many characters are waiting,
theres also the FIONREAD ioctl call to be looked at. The
h2ph tool that comes with Perl tries to convert C include
files to Perl code, which can be &quot;require&quot;d.
FIONREAD ends up defined as a function in the sys/ioctl.ph
file:</p>

<p>require sys/ioctl.ph;</p>

<p>$size = pack(&quot;L&quot;, 0); ioctl(FH, FIONREAD(),
$size) or die &quot;Couldnt call ioctl: $!0; $size =
unpack(&quot;L&quot;, $size);</p>

<p>If h2ph wasnt installed or doesnt work for you, you can
grep the include files by hand:</p>

<p>% grep FIONREAD /usr/include/*/*
/usr/include/asm/ioctls.h:#define FIONREAD 0x541B</p>

<p>Or write a small C program using the editor of
champions:</p>

<p>% cat &gt; fionread.c #include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;
main() { printf(&quot;%#08x0, FIONREAD); } ^D % cc -o
fionread fionread.c % ./fionread 0x4004667f</p>

<p>And then hard code it, leaving porting as an exercise to
your succes- sor.</p>

<p>$FIONREAD = 0x4004667f; # XXX: opsys dependent</p>

<p>$size = pack(&quot;L&quot;, 0); ioctl(FH, $FIONREAD,
$size) or die &quot;Couldn t call ioctl: $!0; $size =
unpack(&quot;L&quot;, $size);</p>

<p>FIONREAD requires a filehandle connected to a stream,
meaning that sockets, pipes, and tty devices work, but not
files.</p>

<p>How do I do a &quot;tail -f&quot; in perl?</p>

<p>First try</p>

<p>seek(GWFILE, 0, 1);</p>

<p>The statement &quot;seek(GWFILE, 0, 1)&quot; doesn t
change the current position, but it does clear the
end-of-file condition on the handle, so that the next
&lt;GWFILE&gt; makes Perl try again to read something.</p>

<p>If that doesnt work (it relies on features of your stdio
implementa- tion), then you need something more like
this:</p>

<p>for (;;) { for ($curpos = tell(GWFILE); &lt;GWFILE&gt;;
$curpos = tell(GWFILE)) { # search for some stuff and put it
into files } # sleep for a while seek(GWFILE, $curpos, 0); #
seek to where we had been }</p>

<p>If this still doesn t work, look into the POSIX module.
POSIX defines the clearerr() method, which can remove the
end of file condition on a filehandle. The method: read
until end of file, clearerr(), read some more. Lather,
rinse, repeat.</p>

<p>Theres also a File::Tail module from CPAN.</p>

<p>How do I dup() a filehandle in Perl?</p>

<p>If you check &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc, youll see
that several of the ways to call open() should do the trick.
For example:</p>

<p>open(LOG, &quot;&gt;&gt;/foo/logfile&quot;);
open(STDERR, &quot;&gt;&amp;LOG&quot;);</p>

<p>Or even with a literal numeric descriptor:</p>

<p>$fd = $ENV{MHCONTEXTFD}; open(MHCONTEXT,
&quot;&lt;&amp;=$fd&quot;); # like fdopen(3S)</p>

<p>Note that &quot;&lt;&amp;STDIN&quot; makes a copy, but
&quot;&lt;&amp;=STDIN&quot; make an alias. That means if you
close an aliased handle, all aliases become inaccessible.
This is not true with a copied one.</p>

<p>Error checking, as always, has been left as an exercise
for the reader.</p>

<p>How do I close a file descriptor by number?</p>

<p>This should rarely be necessary, as the Perl close()
function is to be used for things that Perl opened itself,
even if it was a dup of a numeric descriptor as with
MHCONTEXT above. But if you really have to, you may be able
to do this:</p>

<p>require sys/syscall.ph; $rc = syscall(&amp;SYS_close,
$fd + 0); # must force numeric die &quot;cant sysclose $fd:
$!&quot; unless $rc == -1;</p>

<p>Or, just use the fdopen(3S) feature of open():</p>

<p>{ local *F; open F, &quot;&lt;&amp;=$fd&quot; or die
&quot;Cannot reopen fd=$fd: $!&quot;; close F; }</p>

<p>Why cat I use &quot;Ctemfoo&quot; in DOS paths? Why
doest Ctemfoo.exework?</p>

<p>Whoops! You just put a tab and a formfeed into that
filename! Remem- ber that within double quoted strings
(&quot;likehis&quot;), the backslash is an escape character.
The full list of these is in &quot;Quote and Quote- like
Operators&quot; in perlop. Unsurprisingly, you dont have a
file called &quot;c:(tab)emp(formfeed)oo&quot; or
&quot;c:(tab)emp(formfeed)oo.exe&quot; on your legacy DOS
filesystem.</p>

<p>Either single-quote your strings, or (preferably) use
forward slashes. Since all DOS and Windows versions since
something like MS-DOS 2.0 or so have treated &quot;/&quot;
and &quot; the one that doesnt clash with Perl--or the POSIX
shell, ANSI C and C++, awk, Tcl, Java, or Python, just to
mention a few. POSIX paths are more portable, too.</p>

<p>Why doest glob(&quot;*.*&quot;) get all the files?</p>

<p>Because even on non-Unix ports, Perl s glob function
follows standard Unix globbing semantics. Youll need
&quot;glob(&quot;*&quot;)&quot; to get all (non-hid- den)
files. This makes glob() portable even to legacy systems.
Your port may include proprietary globbing functions as
well. Check its documentation for details.</p>

<p>Why does Perl let me delete read-only files? Why does
&quot;-i&quot; clobber protected files? Ist this a bug in
Perl?</p>

<p>This is elaborately and painstakingly described in the
file-dir-perms article in the &quot;Far More Than You Ever
Wanted To Know&quot; collection in
http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz .</p>

<p>The executive summary: learn how your filesystem works.
The permis- sions on a file say what can happen to the data
in that file. The per- missions on a directory say what can
happen to the list of files in that directory. If you delete
a file, youre removing its name from the directory (so the
operation depends on the permissions of the directory, not
of the file). If you try to write to the file, the per-
missions of the file govern whether youre allowed to.</p>

<p>How do I select a random line from a file?</p>

<p>Heres an algorithm from the Camel Book:</p>

<p>srand; rand($.) &lt; 1 &amp;&amp; ($line = $_) while
&lt;&gt;;</p>

<p>This has a significant advantage in space over reading
the whole file in. You can find a proof of this method in
The Art of Computer Pro- gramming, Volume 2, Section 3.4.2,
by Donald E. Knuth.</p>

<p>You can use the File::Random module which provides a
function for that algorithm:</p>

<p>use File::Random qw/random_line/; my $line =
random_line($filename);</p>

<p>Another way is to use the Tie::File module, which treats
the entire file as an array. Simply access a random array
element.</p>

<p>Why do I get weird spaces when I print an array of
lines?</p>

<p>Saying</p>

<p>print &quot;@lines0;</p>

<p>joins together the elements of @lines with a space
between them. If @lines were &quot;(&quot;little&quot;,
&quot;fluffy&quot;, &quot;clouds&quot;)&quot; then the above
statement would print</p>

<p>little fluffy clouds</p>

<p>but if each element of @lines was a line of text, ending
a newline character &quot;(&quot;little0, &quot;fluffy0,
&quot;clouds0)&quot; then it would print:</p>

<p>little fluffy clouds</p>

<p>If your array contains lines, just print them:</p>

<p>print @lines;</p>
