<p>getaddrinfo(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
getaddrinfo(3)</p>

<p>NAME getaddrinfo, freeaddrinfo, gai_strerror - network
address and service translation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/socket.h&gt; #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getaddrinfo(const char *node, const char *service,
const struct addrinfo *hints, struct addrinfo **res);</p>

<p>void freeaddrinfo(struct addrinfo *res);</p>

<p>const char *gai_strerror(int errcode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getaddrinfo(3) function combines the
functionality provided by the getipnodebyname(3),
getipnodebyaddr(3), getservbyname(3), and get- servbyport(3)
functions into a single interface. The thread-safe
getaddrinfo(3) function creates one or more socket address
structures that can be used by the bind(2) and connect(2)
system calls to create a client or a server socket.</p>

<p>The getaddrinfo(3) function is not limited to creating
IPv4 socket address structures; IPv6 socket address
structures can be created if IPv6 support is available.
These socket address structures can be used directly by
bind(2) or connect(2), to prepare a client or a server
socket.</p>

<p>The addrinfo structure used by this function contains
the following members:</p>

<p>struct addrinfo { int ai_flags; int ai_family; int
ai_socktype; int ai_protocol; size_t ai_addrlen; struct
sockaddr *ai_addr; char *ai_canonname; struct addrinfo
*ai_next; };</p>

<p>getaddrinfo(3) sets res to point to a
dynamically-allocated linked list of addrinfo structures,
linked by the ai_next member. There are sev- eral reasons
why the linked list may have more than one addrinfo struc-
ture, including: if the network host is multi-homed; or if
the same service is available from multiple socket protocols
(one SOCK_STREAM address and another SOCK_DGRAM address, for
example).</p>

<p>The members ai_family, ai_socktype, and ai_protocol have
the same mean- ing as the corresponding parameters in the
socket(2) system call. The getaddrinfo(3) function returns
socket addresses in either IPv4 or IPv6 address family,
(ai_family will be set to either AF_INET or AF_INET6).</p>

<p>The hints parameter specifies the preferred socket type,
or protocol. A NULL hints specifies that any network address
or protocol is accept- able. If this parameter is not NULL
it points to an addrinfo structure whose ai_family,
ai_socktype, and ai_protocol members specify the pre- ferred
socket type. AF_UNSPEC in ai_family specifies any protocol
family (either IPv4 or IPv6, for example). 0 in ai_socktype
or ai_pro- tocol specifies that any socket type or protocol
is acceptable as well. The ai_flags member specifies
additional options, defined below. Mul- tiple flags are
specified by logically OR-ing them together. All the other
members in the hints parameter must contain either 0, or a
null pointer.</p>

<p>The node or service parameter, but not both, may be
NULL. node speci- fies either a numerical network address
(dotted-decimal format for IPv4, hexadecimal format for
IPv6) or a network hostname, whose network addresses are
looked up and resolved. If hints.ai_flags contains the
AI_NUMERICHOST flag then the node parameter must be a
numerical network address. The AI_NUMERICHOST flag
suppresses any potentially lengthy network host address
lookups.</p>

<p>The getaddrinfo(3) function creates a linked list of
addrinfo struc- tures, one for each network address subject
to any restrictions imposed by the hints parameter. The
ai_canonname field of the first of these addrinfo structures
is set to point to the official name of the host, if
hints.ai_flags includes the AI_CANONNAME flag. ai_family,
ai_sock- type, and ai_protocol specify the socket creation
parameters. A pointer to the socket address is placed in the
ai_addr member, and the length of the socket address, in
bytes, is placed in the ai_addrlen member.</p>

<p>If node is NULL, the network address in each socket
structure is ini- tialized according to the AI_PASSIVE flag,
which is set in hints.ai_flags. The network address in each
socket structure will be left unspecified if AI_PASSIVE flag
is set. This is used by server applications, which intend to
accept client connections on any network address. The
network address will be set to the loopback interface
address if the AI_PASSIVE flag is not set. This is used by
client applications, which intend to connect to a server
running on the same network host.</p>

<p>If hints.ai_flags includes the AI_ADDRCONFIG flag, then
IPv4 addresses are returned in the list pointed to by result
only if the local system has at least one IPv4 address
configured, and IPv6 addresses are only returned if the
local system has at least one IPv6 address configured.</p>

<p>If hint.ai_flags specifies the AI_V4MAPPED flag, and
hints.ai_family was specified as AF_INET6, and no matching
IPv6 addresses could be found, then return IPv4-mapped IPv6
addresses in the list pointed to by result. If both
AI_V4MAPPED and AI_ALL are specified in hints.ai_fam- ily,
then return both IPv6 and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses in the
list pointed to by result. AI_ALL is ignored if AI_V4MAPPED
is not also specified.</p>

<p>service sets the port number in the network address of
each socket structure. If service is NULL the port number
will be left uninitial- ized. If AI_NUMERICSERV is specified
in hints.ai_flags and service is not NULL, then service must
point to a string containing a numeric port number. This
flag is used to inhibit the invocation of a name resolu-
tion service in cases where it is known not to be
required.</p>

<p>The freeaddrinfo(3) function frees the memory that was
allocated for the dynamically allocated linked list res.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE getaddrinfo(3) returns 0 if it succeeds, or
one of the following non- zero error codes:</p>

<p>EAI_ADDRFAMILY The specified network host does not have
any network addresses in the requested address family.</p>

<p>EAI_AGAIN The name server returned a temporary failure
indication. Try again later.</p>

<p>EAI_BADFLAGS ai_flags contains invalid flags.</p>

<p>EAI_FAIL The name server returned a permanent failure
indication.</p>

<p>EAI_FAMILY The requested address family is not supported
at all.</p>

<p>EAI_MEMORY Out of memory.</p>

<p>EAI_NODATA The specified network host exists, but does
not have any network addresses defined.</p>

<p>EAI_NONAME The node or service is not known; or both
node and service are NULL; or AI_NUMERICSERV was specified
in hints.ai_flags and ser- vice was not a numeric
port-number string.</p>

<p>EAI_SERVICE The requested service is not available for
the requested socket type. It may be available through
another socket type.</p>

<p>EAI_SOCKTYPE The requested socket type is not supported
at all.</p>

<p>EAI_SYSTEM Other system error, check errno for
details.</p>

<p>The gai_strerror(3) function translates these error
codes to a human readable string, suitable for error
reporting.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001. The getaddrinfo() function
is documented in RFC 2553.</p>

<p>NOTES AI_ADDRCONFIG, AI_ALL, and AI_V4MAPPED are
available since glibc 2.3.3. AI_NUMERICSERV is available
since glibc 2.3.4.</p>
