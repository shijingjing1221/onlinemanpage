<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

prelink(8)</p>

<p>NAME prelink - prelink ELF shared libraries and binaries
to speed up startup time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS prelink [OPTION...] [FILES]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION prelink is a program that modifies ELF
shared libraries and ELF dynami- cally linked binaries in
such a way that the time needed for the dynamic linker to
perform relocations at startup significantly decreases. Due
to fewer relocations, the run-time memory consumption
decreases as well (especially the number of unshareable
pages). The prelinking information is only used at startup
time if none of the dependent libraries have changed since
prelinking; otherwise programs are relocated normally.</p>

<p>prelink first collects ELF binaries to be prelinked and
all the ELF shared libraries they depend on. Then it assigns
a unique virtual address space slot to each library and
relinks the shared library to that base address. When the
dynamic linker attempts to load such a library, unless that
virtual address space slot is already occupied, it maps the
library into the given slot. After this is done, prelink,
with the help of dynamic linker, resolves all relocations in
the binary or library against its dependent libraries and
stores the relocations into the ELF object. It also stores a
list of all dependent libraries together with their
checksums into the binary or library. For bina- ries, it
also computes a list of conflicts (relocations that resolve
differently in the binarys symbol search scope than in the
smaller search scope in which the dependent library was
resolved) and stores it into a special ELF section.</p>

<p>At runtime, the dynamic linker first checks whether all
dependent libraries were successfully mapped into their
designated address space slots, and whether they have not
changed since the prelinking was done. If all checks are
successful, the dynamic linker just replays the list of
conflicts (which is usually significantly shorter than total
number of relocations) instead of relocating each
library.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v --verbose Verbose mode. Print the virtual
address slots assigned to libraries and what binary or
library is currently being pre- linked.</p>

<p>-n --dry-run Dont actually prelink anything; just
collect the bina- ries/libraries, assign them addresses, and
with -v print what would be prelinked.</p>

<p>-a --all Prelink all binaries and dependent libraries
found in directory hierarchies specified in
/etc/prelink.conf. Normally, only binaries specified on the
command line and their dependent libraries are
prelinked.</p>

<p>-m --conserve-memory When assigning addresses to
libraries, allow overlap of address space slots provided
that the two libraries are not present together in any of
the binaries or libraries. This results in a smaller virtual
address space range used for libraries. On the other hand,
if prelink sees a binary during incremental prelinking which
puts together two libraries which were not present together
in any other binary and were given the same virtual address
space slots, then the binary cannot be pre- linked. Without
this option, each library is assigned a unique virtual
address space slot.</p>

<p>-R --random When assigning addresses to libraries, start
with a random address within the architecture-dependent
virtual address space range. This can make some buffer
overflow attacks slightly harder to exploit, because
libraries are not present on the same addresses across
different machines. Normally, assigning vir- tual addresses
starts at the bottom of the architecture-depen- dent
range.</p>

<p>-r --reloc-only=ADDRESS Instead of prelinking, just
relink given shared libraries to the specified base
address.</p>

<p>-N --no-update-cache Don t save the cache file after
prelinking. Normally, the list of libraries (and with -m
binaries also) is stored into the /etc/prelink.cache file
together with their given address space slots and
dependencies, so the cache can be used during incre- mental
prelinking (prelinking without -a option).</p>

<p>-c --config-file=CONFIG Specify an alternate config file
instead of default /etc/pre- link.conf.</p>

<p>-C --cache-file=CACHE Specify an alternate cache file
instead of default /etc/pre- link.cache.</p>

<p>-f --force Force re-prelinking even for already
prelinked objects whose dependencies are unchanged. This
option causes new virtual address space slots to be assigned
to all libraries. Normally, only binaries or libraries which
are either not prelinked yet, or whose dependencies have
changed, are prelinked.</p>

<p>-q --quick Run prelink in quick mode. This mode checks
just mtime and ctime timestamps of libraries and binaries
stored in the cache file. If they are unchanged from the
last prelink run, it is assumed that the library in question
did not change, without parsing or verifying its ELF
headers.</p>

<p>-p --print-cache Print the contents of the cache file
(normally /etc/pre- link.cache) and exit.</p>

<p>--dynamic-linker=LDSO Specify an alternate dynamic
linker instead of the default.</p>

<p>--ld-library-path=PATH Specify a special LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to be used when prelink queries the dynamic linker about
symbol resolution details.</p>

<p>--libs-only Only prelink ELF shared libraries, dont
prelink any binaries.</p>

<p>-h --dereference When processing command line directory
arguments, follow sym- bolic links when walking directory
hierarchies.</p>

<p>-l --one-file-system When processing command line
directory arguments, limit direc- tory tree walk to a single
file system.</p>

<p>-u --undo Revert binaries and libraries to their
original content before they were prelinked. Without the -a
option, this causes only the binaries and libraries
specified on the command line to be reverted to their
original state (and e.g. not their dependen- cies). If used
together with the -a option, all binaries and libraries from
command line, all their dependencies, all bina- ries found
in directories specified on command line and in the config
file, and all their dependencies are undone.</p>

<p>-y --verify Verifies a prelinked binary or library. This
option can be used only on a single binary or library. It
first applies an --undo operation on the file, then prelinks
just that file again and compares this with the original
file. If both are identical, it prints the file after --undo
operation on standard output and exits with zero status.
Otherwise it exits with error status. Thus if --verify
operation returns zero exit status and its standard output
is equal to the content of the binary or library before
prelinking, you can be sure that nobody modified the
binaries or libraries after prelinking. Similarly with
message digests and checksums (unless you trigger the
improbable case of modified file and original file having
the same digest or check- sum).</p>

<p>--md5 This is similar to --verify option, except instead
of outputting the content of the binary or library before
prelinking to stan- dard output, MD5 digest is printed. See
md5sum(1).</p>

<p>--sha This is similar to --verify option, except instead
of outputting the content of the binary or library before
prelinking to stan- dard output, SHA1 digest is printed. See
sha1sum(1).</p>

<p>--exec-shield --no-exec-shield On IA-32, if the kernel
supports Exec-Shield, prelink attempts to lay libraries out
similarly to how the kernel places them (i.e. if possible
below the binary, most widely used into the ASCII armor
zone). These switches allow overriding prelink detection of
whether Exec-Shield is supported or not.</p>

<p>-b --black-list=PATH This option allows blacklisting
certain paths, libraries or binaries. Prelink will not touch
them during prelinking.</p>

<p>-o --undo-output=FILE When performing an --undo
operation, don t overwrite the pre- linked binary or library
with its original content (before it was prelinked), but
save that into the specified file.</p>

<p>-V --version Print version and exit.</p>

<p>-? --help Print short help and exit.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Command-line arguments should be either
directory hierarchies (in which case -l and -h options
apply), or particular ELF binaries or shared libraries.
Specifying a shared library explicitly on the command line
causes it to be prelinked even if no binary is linked
against it. Oth- erwise, binaries are collected together and
only the libraries they depend on are prelinked with
them.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES # /usr/sbin/prelink -avmR prelinks all binaries
found in directories specified in /etc/pre- link.conf and
all their dependent libraries, assigning libraries unique
virtual address space slots only if they ever appear
together, and starts assigning libraries at a random
address. # /usr/sbin/prelink -vm ~/bin/progx prelinks
~/bin/progx program and all its dependent libraries (unless
they were prelinked already e.g. during prelink -a
invocation). # /usr/sbin/prelink -au reverts all binaries
and libraries to their original content. # /usr/sbin/prelink
-y /bin/prelinked_prog &gt; /tmp/original_prog; echo $?
verifies whether /bin/prelinked_prog is unchanged.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/prelink.cache Binary file containing a list
of prelinked libraries and/or binaries together with their
assigned virtual address space slots and dependen- cies. You
can run /usr/sbin/prelink -p to see what is stored in there.
/etc/prelink.conf Configuration file containing a list of
directory hierarchies that contain ELF shared libraries or
binaries which should be prelinked. This configu- ration
file is used in -a mode to find binaries which should be
prelinked and also, no matter whether -a is given or not, to
limit which depen- dent shared libraries should be
prelinked. If pre- link finds a dependent library of some
binary or other library which is not present in any of the
directories specified either in /etc/prelink.conf or on the
command line, then it cannot be pre- linked. Each line of
the config file should be either a comment starting with #,
or a directory name, or a blacklist specification. Directory
names can be prefixed by the -l switch, meaning the tree
walk of the given directory is only limited to one file
system; or the -h switch, meaning the tree walk of the given
directory follows symbolic links. A blacklist specification
should be prefixed by -b and optionally also -l or -h if
needed. A black- list entry can be either an absolute
directory name (in that case all files in that directory
hierarchy are ignored by the prelinker); an absolute
filename (then that particular library or binary is
skipped); or a glob pattern without a / character in it
(then all files matching that glob in any directory are
ignored). SEE ALSO ldd(1), ld.so(8). BUGS prelink Some
architectures, including IA-64 and HPPA, are not yet sup-
ported. AUTHORS Jakub Jelinek &lt;jakub@redhat.com&gt;.</p>
