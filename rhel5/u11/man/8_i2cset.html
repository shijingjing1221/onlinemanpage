<p>NAME i2cset - set I2C registers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS i2cset [-f] [-y] i2cbus chip-address
data-address value [mode] [mask] i2cset -V</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION i2cset is a small helper program to set
registers visible through the I2C bus.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V Display the version and exit.</p>

<p>-f Force access to the device even if it is already
busy. By default, i2cset will refuse to access a device
which is already under the control of a kernel driver. Using
this flag is danger- ous, it can seriously confuse the
kernel driver in question. It can also cause i2cset to
silently write to the wrong register. So use at your own
risk and only if you know what youre doing.</p>

<p>-y Disable interactive mode. By default, i2cset will
wait for a confirmation from the user before messing with
the I2C bus. When this flag is used, it will perform the
operation directly. This is mainly meant to be used in
scripts.</p>

<p>There are four required options to i2cset. i2cbus
indicates the number of the I2C bus to be scanned. This
number should correspond to one of the busses listed by
i2cdetect -l. chip-address specifies the address of the chip
on that bus, and is an integer between 0x00 and 0x7F.
data-address specifies the address on that chip to write to,
and is an integer between 0x00 and 0xFF. value is the value
to write to that location on the chip.</p>

<p>The mode parameter, if specified, is one of the letters
b or w, corre- sponding to a write size of a single byte or
a 16-bit word, respec- tively. A p can also be appended to
the mode parameter to enable PEC. If the mode parameter is
omitted, i2cset defaults to byte mode without PEC. The value
provided must be within range for the specified data type
(0x00-0xFF for bytes, 0x0000-0xFFFF for words).</p>

<p>The mask parameter, if specified, describes which bits
of value will be actually written to data-address. Bits set
to 1 in the mask are taken from value, while bits set to 0
will be read from data-address and thus preserved by the
operation.</p>

<p>WARNING i2cset can be extremely dangerous if used
improperly. It can confuse your I2C bus, cause data loss, or
have more serious side effects. Writ- ing to a serial EEPROM
on a memory DIMM (chip addresses between 0x50 and 0x57) may
DESTROY your memory, leaving your system unbootable! Be
extremely careful using this program.</p>
