<p>NAME ipcclean - remove shared memory and semaphores from
a failed PostgreSQL server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipcclean</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ipcclean removes all shared memory segments
and semaphore sets owned by the current user. It is intended
to be used for cleaning up after a crashed PostgreSQL server
(postmaster(1)). Note that immediately restarting the server
will also clean up shared memory and semaphores, so this
command is of little real utility.</p>

<p>Only the database administrator should execute this
program as it can cause bizarre behavior (i.e., crashes) if
run during multiuser execu- tion. If this command is
executed while a server is running, the shared memory and
semaphores allocated by that server will be deleted, which
would have rather severe consequences for that server.</p>

<p>NOTES This script is a hack, but in the many years since
it was written, no one has come up with an equally effective
and portable solution. Since the postmaster can now clean up
by itself, it is unlikely that ipcclean will be improved
upon in the future.</p>

<p>The script makes assumptions about the output format of
the ipcs util- ity which may not be true across different
operating systems. There- fore, it may not work on your
particular OS. Its wise to look at the script before trying
it.</p>
