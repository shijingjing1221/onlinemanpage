<p>NAME innxmit - send Usenet articles to a remote NNTP
server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS innxmit [ -a ] [ -c ] [ -d ] [ -H ] [ -l ] [ -P
portnum ] [ -p ] [ -r ] [ -s ] [ -T timeout ] [ -t timeout ]
host file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Innxmit connects to the NNTP server at the
specified host (validating itself via passwd.nntp if
possible) and sends it the articles specified in the
batchfile named file. It is normally invoked by a script run
out of cron(8) that uses shlock(1) to lock the host name,
followed by a ctlinnd(8) command to flush the batchfile.</p>

<p>If the file is not an absolute pathname, it is taken
relative to the &lt;pathoutgoing in inn.conf&gt; directory.
It is normally written by speci- fying the Wnm flags in the
newsfeeds file. Each line in the batch- file should be in
one of the following formats:</p>

<p>token Message-ID token</p>

<p>The token field names the article to be sent. If the
Message-ID field is not specified, it will be obtained by
scanning the article. The token and Message-Id fields are
separated by a space.</p>

<p>If a communication error such as a write(2) failure
occurs, innxmit will stop sending and rewrite the batchfile
to contain the current article and any other unsent
articles.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a If all articles were sent successfully,
innxmit will remove the batchfile; otherwise it will rewrite
it to contain the list of unsent articles. If no articles
were sent or rejected, the file is left untouched. This can
cause the batchfile to grow exces- sively large if many
articles have been expired and there are communication
problems. To always rewrite the batchfile, use the -a
flag.</p>

<p>-c In streaming mode, a check of each message ID is
still made to avoid sending articles already on the server.
The -c flag will, if streaming mode is supported, result in
sending articles without checking. This results in slightly
greater throughput and may be appropriate when it is known
that the site could not already have the articles such as in
the case of a &quot;leaf&quot; site.</p>

<p>-d Use the -d flag to print debugging information on
standard error. This will show the protocol transactions
between innxmit and the NNTP server on the remote host.</p>

<p>-H If the -H flag is given, then only headers are sent
to host for all articles except control messages. And Bytes:
header is also included even if it does not exist in the
original article. -H flag is useful for diablo reader.</p>

<p>-l The -l flag is used to turn on logging of reasons the
remote gives for rejecting an article.</p>

<p>-P portnum To specify a port number other than the
default, use the -P flag.</p>

<p>-p If the -p flag is given, then no connection is made
and the batchfile is purged of entries that refer to files
that no longer exist. This implies the -a flag.</p>

<p>-r If the remote server sends an unexpected reply code,
innxmit will requeue the article and proceed. Use the -r
flag if the article should not be requeued.</p>

<p>-s Innxmit will attempt to negotiate a streaming mode
extension of the NNTP protocol with the server at connect
time. If success- ful it will use a slightly different
protocol that enhances throughput. If the server does not
recognize the streaming mode negotiation innxmit will revert
to normal NNTP transfer mode. Use the -s flag to disable the
attempt to negotiate the streaming mode extension.</p>

<p>-T seconds To specify the total amount of time that
should be allowed for article transfers, use the -T flag.
The default is to wait until an I/O error occurs, or all the
articles have been trans- ferred. If the -T flag is used,
the time is checked just before each article is started; it
will not abort a transfer that is in progress.</p>

<p>-t seconds Innxmit normally blocks until the connection
is made. To spec- ify a timeout on how long to try to make
the connection, use the -t flag.</p>

<p>-v Upon exit, innxmit reports transfer and CPU usage
statistics via syslog(3). If the -v flag is used, they will
also be printed on the standard output.</p>
