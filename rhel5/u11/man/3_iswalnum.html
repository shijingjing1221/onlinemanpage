<p>NAME iswalnum - test for alphanumeric wide character</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;</p>

<p>int iswalnum(wint_t wc);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The iswalnum() function is the
wide-character equivalent of the isal- num() function. It
tests whether wc is a wide character belonging to the wide
character class &quot;alnum&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide character class &quot;alnum&quot; is a subclass
of the wide character class &quot;graph&quot;, and therefore
also a subclass of the wide character class
&quot;print&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a subclass of the wide character class
&quot;print&quot;, the wide charac- ter class
&quot;alnum&quot; is disjoint from the wide character class
&quot;cntrl&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a subclass of the wide character class
&quot;graph&quot;, the wide charac- ter class
&quot;alnum&quot; is disjoint from the wide character class
&quot;space&quot; and its subclass &quot;blank&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide character class &quot;alnum&quot; is disjoint
from the wide character class &quot;punct&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide character class &quot;alnum&quot; is the union
of the wide character classes &quot;alpha&quot; and
&quot;digit&quot;. As such, it also contains the wide
charac- ter class &quot;xdigit&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide character class &quot;alnum&quot; always
contains at least the letters A to Z, a to z and the digits
0 to 9.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The iswalnum() function returns non-zero if
wc is a wide character belonging to the wide character class
&quot;alnum&quot;. Otherwise it returns zero.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO isalnum(3), iswctype(3)</p>

<p>NOTES The behaviour of iswalnum() depends on the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.</p>
