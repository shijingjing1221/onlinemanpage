<p>MKSWAP(8) Linux Programmer s Manual MKSWAP(8)</p>

<p>NAME mkswap - set up a Linux swap area</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mkswap [-c] [-vN] [-f] [-p PSZ] [-L label]
device [size]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mkswap sets up a Linux swap area on a device
or in a file.</p>

<p>(After creating the swap area, you need the swapon
command to start using it. Usually swap areas are listed in
/etc/fstab so that they can be taken into use at boot time
by a swapon -a command in some boot script.)</p>

<p>The device argument will usually be a disk partition
(something like /dev/hda4 or /dev/sdb7) but can also be a
file. The Linux kernel does not look at partition Ids, but
many installation scripts will assume that partitions of hex
type 82 (LINUX_SWAP) are meant to be swap parti- tions.
(Warning: Solaris also uses this type. Be careful not to
kill your Solaris partitions.)</p>

<p>The size parameter is superfluous but retained for
backwards compati- bility. (It specifies the desired size of
the swap area in 1024-byte blocks. mkswap will use the
entire partition or file if it is omitted. Specifying it is
unwise - a typo may destroy your disk.)</p>

<p>The PSZ parameter specifies the page size to use. It is
almost always unnecessary (even unwise) to specify it, but
certain old libc versions lie about the page size, so it is
possible that mkswap gets it wrong. The symptom is that a
subsequent swapon fails because no swap signature is found.
Typical values for PSZ are 4096 or 8192.</p>

<p>Linux knows about two styles of swap areas, old style
and new style. The last 10 bytes of the first page of the
swap area distinguishes them: old style has SWAP_SPACE, new
style has SWAPSPACE2 as signa- ture.</p>

<p>In the old style, the rest of this first page was a bit
map, with a 1 bit for each usable page of the swap area.
Since the first page holds this bit map, the first bit is 0.
Also, the last 10 bytes hold the signature. So, if the page
size is S, an old style swap area can describe at most
8*(S-10)-1 pages used for swapping. With S=4096 (as on
i386), the useful area is at most 133890048 bytes (almost
128 MiB), and the rest is wasted. On an alpha and sparc64,
with S=8192, the use- ful area is at most 535560992 bytes
(almost 512 MiB).</p>

<p>The old setup wastes most of this bitmap page, because
zero bits denote bad blocks or blocks past the end of the
swap space, and a simple inte- ger suffices to indicate the
size of the swap space, while the bad blocks, if any, can
simply be listed. Nobody wants to use a swap space with
hundreds of bad blocks. (I would not even use a swap space
with 1 bad block.) In the new style swap area this is
precisely what is done.</p>

<p>The maximum useful size of a swap area depends on the
architecture and the kernel version. It is roughly 2GiB on
i386, PPC, m68k, ARM, 1GiB on sparc, 512MiB on mips, 128GiB
on alpha and 3TiB on sparc64. For ker- nels after 2.3.3
there is no such limitation.</p>

<p>Note that before 2.1.117 the kernel allocated one byte
for each page, while it now allocates two bytes, so that
taking a swap area of 2 GiB in use might require 2 MiB of
kernel memory.</p>

<p>Presently, Linux allows 32 swap areas (this was 8 before
Linux 2.4.10). The areas in use can be seen in the file
/proc/swaps (since 2.1.25).</p>

<p>mkswap refuses areas smaller than 10 pages.</p>

<p>If you dont know the page size that your machine uses,
you may be able to look it up with &quot;cat
/proc/cpuinfo&quot; (or you may not - the contents of this
file depend on architecture and kernel version).</p>

<p>To setup a swap file, it is necessary to create that
file before ini- tializing it with mkswap , e.g. using a
command like</p>

<p># dd if=/dev/zero of=swapfile bs=1024 count=65536</p>

<p>Note that a swap file must not contain any holes (so,
using cp(1) to create the file is not acceptable).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Check the device (if it is a block device)
for bad blocks before creating the swap area. If any are
found, the count is printed.</p>

<p>-f Force - go ahead even if the command is stupid. This
allows the creation of a swap area larger than the file or
partition it resides on. On SPARC, force creation of the
swap area. Without this option mkswap will refuse to create
a v0 swap on a device with a valid SPARC superblock, as that
probably means one is going to erase the partition
table.</p>

<p>-p PSZ Specify the page size to use.</p>

<p>-L label Specify a label, to allow swapon by label.
(Only for new style swap areas.)</p>

<p>-v0 Create an old style swap area.</p>

<p>-v1 Create a new style swap area.</p>

<p>If no -v option is given, mkswap will default to new
style, but use old style if the current kernel is older than
2.1.117 (and also if PAGE_SIZE is less than 2048). The new
style header does not touch the first block, so may be
preferable, in case you have a boot loader or disk label
there. If you need to use both 2.0 and 2.2 kernels, use the
-v0 option when creating the swapspace.</p>

<p>Version 0 (-v0) swap space format is no longer supported
in 2.5+ ker- nels.</p>
