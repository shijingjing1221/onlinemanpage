<p>LOCKDEV(3) Linux Programmer s Manual LOCKDEV(3)</p>

<p>NAME lockdev, liblockdev, dev_testlock, dev_lock,
dev_relock, dev_unlock - manage device lockfiles</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;lockdev.h&gt;</p>

<p>pid_t dev_testlock( const char * devname); pid_t
dev_lock( const char * devname); pid_t dev_relock( const
char * devname, pid_t pid); pid_t dev_unlock( const char *
devname, pid_t pid);</p>

<p>cc [ flag ... ] file ... -llockdev [ library ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The lockdev functions act on device locks
normally located in /var/lock . The lock is acquired
creating a pair of files hardlinked between them and named
after the device name (as mandated by FSSTND) and the
devices major and minor numbers (as in SVr4 locks). This
permits to circumvent a problem using only the FSSTND lock
method when the same device exists under different names
(for convenience or when a device must be accessable by more
than one group of users). The lock file names are typically
in the form LCK..ttyS1 and LCK.004.065 , but is provided a
way to easily modify them to use the library on different
architectures. The content of those files is the pid of the
process who owns the lock.</p>

<p>The dev_testlock() function simply checks if the device
is in some way locked and if the owner of the lock is still
active (otherwise it removes the lock). It recognise a valid
lock even if only one of the two lock files exists (and is
owned by an existing process), thus per- mitting a safe use
of this library together with programs using only FSSTND or
SVr4 lock style.</p>

<p>The dev_lock() function first checks if the device is
already locked and then tries to acquire the lock building
the two lock files. First it creates the file which name
contains the major and minor numbers (in SVr4 style), then
it creates the file with the device name in its name. This
order reduces the clashes with other processes trying to
lock the same device (even with a different name) and using
this library. It has no problem with processes that uses
only the FSSTND algorithm.</p>

<p>The dev_relock() function changes the owner of an
existing lock; if the pid of the old owner is provided, then
it checks if the lock was cor- rectly assigned (otherwise
there is the possibility of a process acquiring a lock which
was owned by another unrelated process). If the device was
not locked, locks it.</p>

<p>The dev_unlock() function removes the existing locks on
the device. If the pid of the owner of the lock is provided,
then it checks if the lock is assigned to that process,
avoiding to remove locks assigned to other existing
processes.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES All the functions in lockdev library
return ZERO on successfull comple- tion of the function
(dev_testlock returns zero if there is no lock on the
device), otherwise, if the device is currently locked by an
exist- ing process, they return the pid of the process owner
of the lock. They return a negative number when some kind of
error happens. Actually they all return only (-1).</p>

<p>DEBUGGING The API has symbols used only for debugging
purposis</p>

<p>int liblockdev_debug void liblockdev_incr_debug( void );
void liblockdev_reset_debug( void );</p>

<p>which can be used when the liblockdev library is
compiled with -DDEBUG flag as when using make install-dbg ,
which compiles a debug shared library and installs it under
/usr/local/lib/debug (or /usr/lib/debug). The value of the
global integer is set to 1 by the DEBUG define, and can be
set to a different value passing a flag like -DDEBUG=3
during compilation of the library, or setting the
environment variable LIBLOCKDEV_DEBUG to the wanted value
before executing your program. During execution of your
program, the flags value can be changed from your program or
from another terminal, respectively using the function
liblockdev_incr_debug() , or sending SIGUSR1 to the running
process, to increment the value of the integer by one, or
using the function liblockdev_reset_debug() , or sending
SIGUSR2 to the running process, to set to zero the value of
the global integer. Direct manipulation of the global
integer is strongly deprecated, because the data structure
of the symbol (actually an integer) could be changed later
in some way, or even become a macro.</p>

<p>The library prints on stdout some informations like
error conditions (level of 1), normal termination conditions
(2) or function calling (3).</p>

<p>To use the debug shared library, simply define in your
environment the variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/debug (or
/usr/local/lib/debug if built using make install-dbg) and
call gdb or directly your program without any need to
recompile it. As you can check with ldd, your pro- gram will
load the debug library instead of the normal one. Beware
that if your program is setuid or setgid, you must become
root to let this work, because ld.so ignores the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable for security reasons.</p>

<p>On Debian GNU/Linux systems exists a debug binary
package named liblockdev1-dbg which installs a shared
library built with all debug- ging options (and the -DDEBUG
flag) into /usr/lib/debug .</p>
