<p>NAME ln - make links between files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ln [OPTION]... [-T] TARGET LINK_NAME (1st form)
ln [OPTION]... TARGET (2nd form) ln [OPTION]... TARGET...
DIRECTORY (3rd form) ln [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY TARGET...
(4th form)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In the 1st form, create a link to TARGET
with the name LINK_NAME. In the 2nd form, create a link to
TARGET in the current directory. In the 3rd and 4th forms,
create links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY. Create hard links
by default, symbolic links with --symbolic. When creating
hard links, each TARGET must exist.</p>

<p>Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options too.</p>

<p>--backup[=CONTROL] make a backup of each existing
destination file</p>

<p>-b like --backup but does not accept an argument</p>

<p>-d, -F, --directory allow the superuser to attempt to
hard link directories (note: will probably fail due to
system restrictions, even for the superuser)</p>

<p>-f, --force remove existing destination files</p>

<p>-n, --no-dereference treat destination that is a symlink
to a directory as if it were a normal file</p>

<p>-i, --interactive prompt whether to remove
destinations</p>

<p>-s, --symbolic make symbolic links instead of hard
links</p>

<p>-S, --suffix=SUFFIX override the usual backup suffix</p>

<p>-t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY specify the DIRECTORY
in which to create the links</p>

<p>-T, --no-target-directory treat LINK_NAME as a normal
file</p>

<p>-v, --verbose print name of each file before linking</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>The backup suffix is ~ , unless set with --suffix or
SIM- PLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX. The version control method may be
selected via the --backup option or through the
VERSION_CONTROL environment variable. Here are the
values:</p>

<p>none, off never make backups (even if --backup is
given)</p>

<p>numbered, t make numbered backups</p>

<p>existing, nil numbered if numbered backups exist, simple
otherwise</p>

<p>simple, never always make simple backups</p>
