<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) GS(1) Ghostscript
GS(1)</p>

<p>NAME gs - Ghostscript (PostScript and PDF language
interpreter and pre- viewer)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gs [ options ] [ files ] ... (Unix, VMS)
gswin32c [ options ] [ files ] ... (MS Windows) gswin32 [
options ] [ files ] ... (MS Windows 3.1) gsos2 [ options ] [
files ] ... (OS/2)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gs (gswin32c, gswin32, gsos2) command
invokes Ghostscript, an interpreter of Adobe Systems
PostScript(tm) and Portable Document For- mat (PDF)
languages. gs reads &quot;files&quot; in sequence and
executes them as Ghostscript programs. After doing this, it
reads further input from the standard input stream (normally
the keyboard), interpreting each line separately. The
interpreter exits gracefully when it encounters the
&quot;quit&quot; command (either in a file or from the
keyboard), at end-of-file, or at an interrupt signal (such
as Control-C at the keyboard).</p>

<p>The interpreter recognizes many option switches, some of
which are described below. Please see the usage
documentation for complete infor- mation. Switches may
appear anywhere in the command line and apply to all files
thereafter. Invoking Ghostscript with the -h or -? switch
produces a message which shows several useful switches, all
the devices known to that executable, and the search path
for fonts; on Unix it also shows the location of detailed
documentation.</p>

<p>Ghostscript may be built to use many different output
devices. To see which devices your executable includes, run
&quot;gs -h&quot;. Unless you spec- ify a particular device,
Ghostscript normally opens the first one of those and
directs output to it, so if the first one in the list is the
one you want to use, just issue the command</p>

<p>gs myfile.ps</p>

<p>You can also check the set of available devices from
within Ghostscript: invoke Ghostscript and type</p>

<p>devicenames ==</p>

<p>but the first device on the resulting list may not be
the default device you determine with &quot;gs -h&quot;. To
specify &quot;AbcXyz&quot; as the initial output device,
include the switch</p>

<p>-sDEVICE=AbcXyz</p>

<p>For example, for output to an Epson printer you might
use the command</p>

<p>gs -sDEVICE=epson myfile.ps</p>

<p>The &quot;-sDEVICE=&quot; switch must precede the first
mention of a file to print, and only the switchs first use
has any effect.</p>

<p>Finally, you can specify a default device in the
environment variable GS_DEVICE. The order of precedence for
these alternatives from highest to lowest (Ghostscript uses
the device defined highest in the list) is:</p>

<p>Some devices can support different resolutions
(densities). To specify the resolution on such a printer,
use the &quot;-r&quot; switch:</p>

<p>gs -sDEVICE=&lt;device&gt;
-r&lt;xres&gt;x&lt;yres&gt;</p>

<p>For example, on a 9-pin Epson-compatible printer, you
get the lowest- density (fastest) mode with</p>

<p>gs -sDEVICE=epson -r60x72</p>

<p>and the highest-density (best output quality) mode
with</p>

<p>gs -sDEVICE=epson -r240x72.</p>

<p>If you select a printer as the output device,
Ghostscript also allows you to choose where Ghostscript
sends the output -- on Unix systems, usually to a temporary
file. To send the output to a file &quot;foo.xyz&quot;, use
the switch</p>

<p>-sOutputFile=foo.xyz</p>

<p>You might want to print each page separately. To do
this, send the output to a series of files &quot;foo1.xyz,
foo2.xyz, ...&quot; using the &quot;-sOut- putFile=&quot;
switch with &quot;%d&quot; in a filename template:</p>

<p>-sOutputFile=foo%d.xyz</p>

<p>Each resulting file receives one page of output, and the
files are num- bered in sequence. &quot;%d&quot; is a printf
format specification; you can also use a variant like
&quot;%02d&quot;.</p>

<p>On Unix and MS Windows systems you can also send output
to a pipe. For example, to pipe output to the
&quot;lpr&quot; command (which, on many Unix sys- tems,
directs it to a printer), use the option</p>

<p>-sOutputFile=%pipe%lpr</p>

<p>Note that the % characters need to be doubled on MS
Windows to avoid mangling by the command interpreter.</p>

<p>You can also send output to standard output:</p>

<p>-sOutputFile=- or -sOutputFile=%stdout%</p>

<p>In this case you must also use the -q switch, to prevent
Ghostscript from writing messages to standard output.</p>

<p>To select a specific paper size, use the command line
switch</p>

<p>-sPAPERSIZE=&lt;paper_size&gt;</p>

<p>for instance</p>

<p>-sPAPERSIZE=a4 or -sPAPERSIZE=legal</p>

<p>Most ISO and US paper sizes are recognized. See the
usage documentation for a full list, or the definitions in
the initialization file &quot;gs_statd.ps&quot;.</p>

<p>Ghostscript can do many things other than print or view
PostScript and PDF files. For example, if you want to know
the bounding box of a PostScript (or EPS) file, Ghostscript
provides a special &quot;device&quot; that just prints out
this information.</p>

<p>For example, using one of the example files distributed
with Ghostscript,</p>

<p>gs -sDEVICE=bbox golfer.ps</p>

<p>prints out</p>

<p>%%BoundingBox: 0 25 583 732 %%HiResBoundingBox: 0.808497
25.009496 582.994503 731.809445</p>

<p>OPTIONS -- filename arg1 ... Takes the next argument as
a file name as usual, but takes all remaining arguments
(even if they have the syntactic form of switches) and
defines the name &quot;ARGUMENTS&quot; in
&quot;userdict&quot; (not &quot;systemdict&quot;) as an
array of those strings, before running the file. When
Ghostscript finishes executing the file, it exits back to
the shell.</p>

<p>-Dname=token -dname=token Define a name in
&quot;systemdict&quot; with the given definition. The token
must be exactly one token (as defined by the
&quot;token&quot; oper- ator) and may contain no
whitespace.</p>

<p>-Dname -dname Define a name in &quot;systemdict&quot;
with value=null.</p>

<p>-Sname=string -sname=string Define a name in
&quot;systemdict&quot; with a given string as value. This is
different from -d. For example, -dname=35 is equivalent to
the program fragment /name 35 def whereas -sname=35 is
equivalent to /name (35) def</p>

<p>-P Makes Ghostscript to look first in the current
directory for library files. By default, Ghostscript no
longer looks in the current directory, unless, of course,
the first explicitly sup- plied directory is &quot;.&quot;
in -I. See also the INITIALIZATION FILES section below, and
bundled Use.htm for detailed discussion on search paths and
how Ghostcript finds files. -q Quiet startup: suppress
normal startup messages, and also do the equivalent of
-dQUIET.</p>

<p>-gnumber1xnumber2 Equivalent to -dDEVICEWIDTH=number1
and -dDEVICEHEIGHT=number2. This is for the benefit of
devices (such as X11 windows) that require (or allow) width
and height to be specified.</p>

<p>-rnumber -rnumber1xnumber2 Equivalent to
-dDEVICEXRESOLUTION=number1 and -dDEVICEYRESOLU-
TION=number2. This is for the benefit of devices such as
print- ers that support multiple X and Y resolutions. If
only one num- ber is given, it is used for both X and Y
resolutions.</p>

<p>-Idirectories Adds the designated list of directories at
the head of the search path for library files.</p>

<p>- This is not really a switch, but indicates to
Ghostscript that standard input is coming from a file or a
pipe and not interac- tively from the command line.
Ghostscript reads from standard input until it reaches
end-of-file, executing it like any other file, and then
continues with processing the command line. When the command
line has been entirely processed, Ghostscript exits rather
than going into its interactive mode.</p>

<p>Note that the normal initialization file
&quot;gs_init.ps&quot; makes &quot;system- dict&quot;
read-only, so the values of names defined with -D, -d, -S,
or -s cannot be changed (although, of course, they can be
superseded by defi- nitions in &quot;userdict&quot; or other
dictionaries.)</p>

<p>SPECIAL NAMES -dDISKFONTS Causes individual character
outlines to be loaded from the disk the first time they are
encountered. (Normally Ghostscript loads all the character
outlines when it loads a font.) This may allow loading more
fonts into RAM, at the expense of slower rendering.</p>

<p>-dNOCACHE Disables character caching. Useful only for
debugging.</p>

<p>-dNOBIND Disables the &quot;bind&quot; operator. Useful
only for debugging.</p>

<p>-dNODISPLAY Suppresses the normal initialization of the
output device. This may be useful when debugging.</p>

<p>-dNOPAUSE Disables the prompt and pause at the end of
each page. This may be desirable for applications where
another program is driving Ghostscript.</p>

<p>-dNOPLATFONTS Disables the use of fonts supplied by the
underlying platform (for instance X Windows). This may be
needed if the platform fonts look undesirably different from
the scalable fonts.</p>

<p>-dSAFER Disables the &quot;deletefile&quot; and
&quot;renamefile&quot; operators and the ability to open
files in any mode other than read-only. This strongly
recommended for spoolers, conversion scripts or other
sensitive environments where a badly written or malicious
PostScript program code must be prevented from changing
impor- tant files.</p>

<p>-dWRITESYSTEMDICT Leaves &quot;systemdict&quot;
writable. This is necessary when running special utility
programs such as font2c and pcharstr, which must bypass
normal PostScript access protection.</p>

<p>-sDEVICE=device Selects an alternate initial output
device, as described above.</p>

<p>-sOutputFile=filename Selects an alternate output file
(or pipe) for the initial out- put device, as described
above.</p>

<p>FILES The locations of many Ghostscript run-time files
are compiled into the executable when it is built. On Unix
these are typically based in /usr/local, but this may be
different on your system. Under DOS they are typically based
in CGS, but may be elsewhere, especially if you install
Ghostscript with GSview. Run &quot;gs -h&quot; to find the
location of Ghostscript documentation on your system, from
which you can get more details.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/ghostscript/#.##/* Startup files,
utilities, and basic font definitions</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts/* More font
definitions</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/ghostscript/#.##/examples/* Ghostscript
demonstration files</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/ghostscript/#.##/doc/* Diverse document
files</p>

<p>INITIALIZATION FILES When looking for the initialization
files &quot;gs_*.ps&quot;, the files related to fonts, or
the file for the &quot;run&quot; operator, Ghostscript first
tries to open the file with the name as given, using the
current working directory if no directory is specified. If
this fails, and the file name doesn t specify an explicit
directory or drive (for instance, doesnt contain
&quot;/&quot; on Unix systems or &quot; Ghostscript tries
directories in this order:</p>

<p>1. the directories specified by the -I switches in the
command line (see below), if any;</p>

<p>2. the directories specified by the GS_LIB environment
variable, if any;</p>

<p>3. the directories specified by the GS_LIB_DEFAULT macro
in the Ghostscript makefile when the executable was built.
When gs is built on Unix, GS_LIB_DEFAULT is usually
&quot;/usr/local/share/ghostscript/#.##:/usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts&quot;
where &quot;#.##&quot; represents the Ghostscript version
number.</p>

<p>Each of these (GS_LIB_DEFAULT, GS_LIB, and -I parameter)
may be either a single directory or a list of directories
separated by &quot;:&quot;.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT GS_OPTIONS String of options to be processed
before the command line options</p>

<p>GS_DEVICE Used to specify an output device</p>

<p>GS_FONTPATH Path names used to search for fonts</p>

<p>GS_LIB Path names for initialization files and fonts</p>

<p>TEMP Where temporary files are made</p>

<p>X RESOURCES Ghostscript, or more properly the X11
display device, looks for the following resources under the
program name &quot;Ghostscript&quot;:</p>

<p>borderWidth The border width in pixels (default =
1).</p>

<p>borderColor The name of the border color (default =
black).</p>

<p>geometry The window size and placement, WxH+X+Y (default
is NULL).</p>

<p>xResolution The number of x pixels per inch (default is
computed from WidthOfScreen and WidthMMOfScreen).</p>

<p>yResolution The number of y pixels per inch (default is
computed from HeightOfScreen and HeightMMOfScreen).</p>

<p>useBackingPixmap Determines whether backing store is to
be used for saving dis- play window (default = true).</p>

<p>See the usage document for a more complete list of
resources. To set these resources on Unix, put them in a
file such as &quot;~/.Xresources&quot; in the following
form:</p>

<p>Ghostscript*geometry: 612x792-0+0
Ghostscript*xResolution: 72 Ghostscript*yResolution: 72</p>

<p>Then merge these resources into the X servers resource
database:</p>

<p>% xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources</p>
