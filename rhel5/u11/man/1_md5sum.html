<p>NAME md5sum - compute and check MD5 message digest</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS md5sum [OPTION] [FILE]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Print or check MD5 (128-bit) checksums. With
no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.</p>

<p>-b, --binary read in binary mode</p>

<p>-c, --check read MD5 sums from the FILEs and check
them</p>

<p>-t, --text read in text mode (default)</p>

<p>The following two options are useful only when verifying
checksums: --status dont output anything, status code shows
success</p>

<p>-w, --warn warn about improperly formatted checksum

<p>The sums are computed as described in RFC 1321. When
checking, the input should be a former output of this
program. The default mode is to print a line with checksum,
a character indicating type (* for binary, for text), and
name for each FILE.</p>
