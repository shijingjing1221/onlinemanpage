<p>NAME ionice - get/set program io scheduling class and
priority</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ionice [-c] [-n] [-p] [COMMAND [ARG...]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program sets the io scheduling class
and priority for a program. As of this writing, Linux
supports 3 scheduling classes:</p>

<p>Idle. A program running with idle io priority will only
get disk time when no other program has asked for disk io
for a defined grace period. The impact of idle io processes
on normal system activity should be zero. This scheduling
class does not take a priority argument.</p>

<p>Best effort. This is the default scheduling class for
any process that hasnt asked for a specific io priority.
Programs inherit the CPU nice setting for io priorities.
This class takes a priority argument from 0-7, with lower
number being higher priority. Programs running at the same
best effort priority are served in a round-robin
fashion.</p>

<p>Real time. The RT scheduling class is given first access
to the disk, regardless of what else is going on in the
system. Thus the RT class needs to be used with some care,
as it can starve other processes. As with the best effort
class, 8 priority levels are defined denoting how big a time
slice a given process will receive on each scheduling win-
dow.</p>

<p>If no arguments or just -p is given, ionice will query
the current io scheduling class and priority for that
process.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c The scheduling class. 1 for real time, 2 for
best-effort, 3 for idle.</p>

<p>-n The scheduling class data. This defines the class
data, if the class accepts an argument. For real time and
best-effort, 0-7 is valid data.</p>

<p>-p Pass in a process pid to change an already running
process. If this argument is not given, ionice will run the
listed program with the given parameters.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES # ionice -c3 -p89</p>

<p>Sets process with PID 89 as an idle io process.</p>

<p># ionice -c2 -n0 bash</p>

<p>Runs bash as a best-effort program with highest
priority.</p>

<p># ionice -p89</p>

<p>Returns the class and priority of the process with PID
89.</p>

<p>NOTES Linux supports io scheduling priorities and
classes since 2.6.13 with the CFQ io scheduler.</p>
