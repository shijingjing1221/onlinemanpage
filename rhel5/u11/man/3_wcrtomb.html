<p>NAME wcrtomb - convert a wide character to a multibyte
sequence</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t wcrtomb(char *s, wchar_t wc, mbstate_t *ps);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The main case for this function is when s is
not NULL and wc is not L . In this case, the wcrtomb()
function converts the wide charac- ter wc to its multibyte
representation and stores it at the beginning of the
character array pointed to by s. It updates the shift state
*ps, and returns the length of said multibyte
representation, i.e. the num- ber of bytes written at s.</p>

<p>A different case is when s is not NULL but wc is L . In
this case the wcrtomb() function stores at the character
array pointed to by s the shift sequence needed to bring *ps
back to the initial state, fol- lowed by a byte. It updates
the shift state *ps (i.e. brings it into the initial state),
and returns the length of the shift sequence plus one, i.e.
the number of bytes written at s.</p>

<p>A third case is when s is NULL. In this case wc is
ignored, and the function effectively returns wcrtomb(buf,L
,ps) where buf is an internal anonymous buffer.</p>

<p>In all of the above cases, if ps is a NULL pointer, a
static anonymous state only known to the wcrtomb() function
is used instead.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wcrtomb() function returns the number
of bytes that have been or would have been written to the
byte array at s. If wc can not be repre- sented as a
multibyte sequence (according to the current locale),
(size_t)(-1) is returned, and errno set to EILSEQ.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO wcsrtombs(3)</p>

<p>NOTES The behaviour of wcrtomb() depends on the LC_CTYPE
category of the cur- rent locale.</p>

<p>Passing NULL as ps is not multi-thread safe.</p>
