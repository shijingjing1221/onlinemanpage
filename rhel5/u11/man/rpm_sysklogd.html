<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) SYSKLOGD(8) Linux
System Administration SYSKLOGD(8)</p>

<p>NAME sysklogd - Linux system logging utilities.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS syslogd [ -a socket ] [ -d ] [ -f config file ]
[ -h ] [ -l hostlist ] [ -m interval ] [ -n ] [ -p socket ]
[ -r ] [ -s domainlist ] [ -S ] [ -v ] [ -x ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sysklogd provides two system utilities which
provide support for system logging and kernel message
trapping. Support of both internet and unix domain sockets
enables this utility package to support both local and
remote logging.</p>

<p>System logging is provided by a version of syslogd(8)
derived from the stock BSD sources. Support for kernel
logging is provided by the klogd(8) utility which allows
kernel logging to be conducted in either a standalone
fashion or as a client of syslogd.</p>

<p>Syslogd provides a kind of logging that many modern
programs use. Every logged message contains at least a time
and a hostname field, normally a program name field, too,
but that depends on how trusty the logging program is.</p>

<p>While the syslogd sources have been heavily modified a
couple of notes are in order. First of all there has been a
systematic attempt to insure that syslogd follows its
default, standard BSD behavior. The second important concept
to note is that this version of syslogd inter- acts
transparently with the version of syslog found in the
standard libraries. If a binary linked to the standard
shared libraries fails to function correctly we would like
an example of the anomalous behav- ior.</p>

<p>The main configuration file /etc/syslog.conf or an
alternative file, given with the -f option, is read at
startup. Any lines that begin with the hash mark (#) and
empty lines are ignored. If an error occurs during parsing
the whole line is ignored.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a socket Using this argument you can specify
additional sockets from that syslogd has to listen to. This
is needed if you re going to let some daemon run within a
chroot() environment. You can use up to 19 additional
sockets. If your environment needs even more, you have to
increase the symbol MAXFUNIX within the syslogd.c source
file. An example for a chroot() daemon is described by the
people from OpenBSD at
http://www.psionic.com/papers/dns.html.</p>

<p>-d Turns on debug mode. Using this the daemon will not
proceed a fork(2) to set itself in the background, but
opposite to that stay in the foreground and write much debug
information on the current tty. See the DEBUGGING section
for more information.</p>

<p>-f config file Specify an alternative configuration file
instead of /etc/sys- log.conf, which is the default.</p>

<p>-h By default syslogd will not forward messages it
receives from remote hosts. Specifying this switch on the
command line will cause the log daemon to forward any remote
messages it receives to forwarding hosts which have been
defined.</p>

<p>-l hostlist Specify a hostname that should be logged
only with its simple hostname and not the fqdn. Multiple
hosts may be specified using the colon (:) separator.</p>

<p>-m interval The syslogd logs a mark timestamp regularly.
The default inter- val between two -- MARK -- lines is 20
minutes. This can be changed with this option. Setting the
interval to zero turns it off entirely.</p>

<p>-n Avoid auto-backgrounding. This is needed especially
if the sys- logd is started and controlled by init(8).</p>

<p>-p socket You can specify an alternative unix domain
socket instead of /dev/log.</p>

<p>-r This option will enable the facility to receive
message from the network using an internet domain socket
with the syslog service (see services(5)). The default is to
not receive any messages from the network.</p>

<p>This option is introduced in version 1.3 of the sysklogd
pack- age. Please note that the default behavior is the
opposite of how older versions behave, so you might have to
turn this on.</p>

<p>-s domainlist Specify a domainname that should be
stripped off before logging. Multiple domains may be
specified using the colon (:) sepa- rator. Please be advised
that no sub-domains may be specified but only entire
domains. For example if -s north.de is speci- fied and the
host logging resolves to satu.infodrom.north.de no domain
would be cut, you will have to specify two domains like: -s
north.de:infodrom.north.de.</p>

<p>-S Verbose logging. If specified once, the numeric
facility and priority are logged with each locally-written
message. If speci- fied more than once, the names of the
facility and priority are logged with each locally-written
message.</p>

<p>-v Print version and exit.</p>

<p>-x Disable name lookups when receiving remote messages.
This avoids deadlocks when the nameserver is running on the
same machine that runs the syslog daemon.</p>

<p>SIGNALS Syslogd reacts to a set of signals. You may
easily send a signal to syslogd using the following:</p>

<p>kill -SIGNAL cat /var/run/syslogd.pid</p>

<p>SIGHUP This lets syslogd perform a re-initialization.
All open files are closed, the configuration file (default
is /etc/syslog.conf) will be reread and the syslog(3)
facility is started again.</p>

<p>SIGTERM The syslogd will die.</p>

<p>SIGINT, SIGQUIT If debugging is enabled these are
ignored, otherwise syslogd will die.</p>

<p>SIGUSR1 Switch debugging on/off. This option can only be
used if sys- logd is started with the -d debug option.</p>

<p>SIGCHLD Wait for childs if some were born, because of
wall ing messages.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX DIFFERENCES Syslogd uses a
slightly different syntax for its configuration file than
the original BSD sources. Originally all messages of a
specific priority and above were forwarded to the log
file.</p>

<p>For example the following line caused ALL output from
daemons using the daemon facilities (debug is the lowest
priority, so every higher will also match) to go into
/usr/adm/daemons:</p>

<p># Sample syslog.conf daemon.debug /usr/adm/daemons</p>

<p>Under the new scheme this behavior remains the same. The
difference is the addition of four new specifiers, the
asterisk (*) wildcard, the equation sign (=), the
exclamation mark (!), and the minus sign (-).</p>

<p>The * specifies that all messages for the specified
facility are to be directed to the destination. Note that
this behavior is degenerate with specifying a priority level
of debug. Users have indicated that the asterisk notation is
more intuitive.</p>

<p>The = wildcard is used to restrict logging to the
specified priority class. This allows, for example, routing
only debug messages to a par- ticular logging source.</p>

<p>For example the following line in syslog.conf would
direct debug messages from all sources to the /usr/adm/debug
file.</p>

<p># Sample syslog.conf *.=debug /usr/adm/debug</p>

<p>The ! is used to exclude logging of the specified
priorities. This affects all (!) possibilities of specifying
priorities.</p>

<p>For example the following lines would log all messages
of the facility mail except those with the priority info to
the /usr/adm/mail file. And all messages from news.info
(including) to news.crit (excluding) would be logged to the
/usr/adm/news file.</p>

<p># Sample syslog.conf mail.*;mail.!=info /usr/adm/mail
news.info;news.!crit /usr/adm/news</p>

<p>You may use it intuitively as an exception specifier.
The above men- tioned interpretation is simply inverted.
Doing that you may use</p>

<p>mail.none or mail.!* or mail.!debug</p>

<p>to skip every message that comes with a mail facility.
There is much room to play with it. :-)</p>

<p>The - may only be used to prefix a filename if you want
to omit syncing the file after every write to it.</p>

<p>This may take some acclimatization for those individuals
used to the pure BSD behavior but testers have indicated
that this syntax is some- what more flexible than the BSD
behavior. Note that these changes should not affect standard
syslog.conf(5) files. You must specifically modify the
configuration files to obtain the enhanced behavior.</p>

<p>SUPPORT FOR REMOTE LOGGING These modifications provide
network support to the syslogd facility. Network support
means that messages can be forwarded from one node run- ning
syslogd to another node running syslogd where they will be
actu- ally logged to a disk file.</p>

<p>To enable this you have to specify the -r option on the
command line. The default behavior is that syslogd wont
listen to the network.</p>

<p>The strategy is to have syslogd listen on a unix domain
socket for locally generated log messages. This behavior
will allow syslogd to inter-operate with the syslog found in
the standard C library. At the same time syslogd listens on
the standard syslog port for messages for- warded from other
hosts. To have this work correctly the services(5) files
(typically found in /etc) must have the following entry:</p>

<p>syslog 514/udp</p>

<p>If this entry is missing syslogd neither can receive
remote messages nor send them, because the UDP port cant be
opened. Instead syslogd will die immediately, blowing out an
error message.</p>

<p>To cause messages to be forwarded to another host
replace the normal file line in the syslog.conf file with
the name of the host to which the messages is to be sent
prepended with an @.</p>

<p>For example, to forward ALL messages to a remote host
use the following syslog.conf entry:</p>

<p># Sample syslogd configuration file to # messages to a
remote host forward all. *.* @hostname</p>

<p>To forward all kernel messages to a remote host the
configura- tion file would be as follows:</p>

<p># Sample configuration file to forward all kernel #
messages to a remote host. kern.* @hostname</p>

<p>If the remote hostname cannot be resolved at startup,
because the name- server might not be accessible (it may be
started after syslogd) you dont have to worry. Syslogd will
retry to resolve the name ten times and then complain.
Another possibility to avoid this is to place the hostname
in /etc/hosts.</p>

<p>With normal syslogds you would get syslog-loops if you
send out mes- sages that were received from a remote host to
the same host (or more complicated to a third host that
sends it back to the first one, and so on). In my domain
(Infodrom Oldenburg) we accidently got one and our disks
filled up with the same single message. :-(</p>

<p>To avoid this in further times no messages that were
received from a remote host are sent out to another (or the
same) remote host anymore. If there are scenarios where this
doesn t make sense, please drop me (Joey) a line.</p>

<p>If the remote host is located in the same domain as the
host, syslogd is running on, only the simple hostname will
be logged instead of the whole fqdn.</p>

<p>In a local network you may provide a central log server
to have all the important information kept on one machine.
If the network consists of different domains you dont have
to complain about logging fully quali- fied names instead of
simple hostnames. You may want to use the strip- domain
feature -s of this server. You can tell the syslogd to strip
off several domains other than the one the server is located
in and only log simple hostnames.</p>

<p>Using the -l option theres also a possibility to define
single hosts as local machines. This, too, results in
logging only their simple hostnames and not the fqdns.</p>

<p>The UDP socket used to forward messages to remote hosts
or to receive messages from them is only opened when it is
needed. In releases prior to 1.3-23 it was opened every time
but not opened for reading or for- warding respectively.</p>

<p>OUTPUT TO NAMED PIPES (FIFOs) This version of syslogd
has support for logging output to named pipes (fifos). A
fifo or named pipe can be used as a destination for log
messages by prepending a pipy symbol (|) to the name of the
file. This is handy for debugging. Note that the fifo must
be created with the mkfifo command before syslogd is
started.</p>

<p>The following configuration file routes debug messages
from the kernel to a fifo:</p>

<p># Sample configuration to route kernel debugging #
messages ONLY to /usr/adm/debug which is a # named pipe.
kern.=debug |/usr/adm/debug</p>

<p>INSTALLATION CONCERNS There is probably one important
consideration when installing this ver- sion of syslogd.
This version of syslogd is dependent on proper for- matting
of messages by the syslog function. The functioning of the
syslog function in the shared libraries changed somewhere in
the region of libc.so.4.[2-4].n. The specific change was to
null-terminate the message before transmitting it to the
/dev/log socket. Proper func- tioning of this version of
syslogd is dependent on null-termination of the message.</p>

<p>This problem will typically manifest itself if old
statically linked binaries are being used on the system.
Binaries using old versions of the syslog function will
cause empty lines to be logged followed by the message with
the first character in the message removed. Relinking these
binaries to newer versions of the shared libraries will
correct this problem.</p>

<p>Both the syslogd(8) and the klogd(8) can either be run
from init(8) or started as part of the rc.* sequence. If it
is started from init the option -n must be set, otherwise
youll get tons of syslog daemons started. This is because
init(8) depends on the process ID.</p>

<p>SECURITY THREATS There is the potential for the syslogd
daemon to be used as a conduit for a denial of service
attack. Thanks go to John Morrison (jmor-
riso@rflab.ee.ubc.ca) for alerting me to this potential. A
rogue pro- gram(mer) could very easily flood the syslogd
daemon with syslog mes- sages resulting in the log files
consuming all the remaining space on the filesystem.
Activating logging over the inet domain sockets will of
course expose a system to risks outside of programs or
individuals on the local machine.</p>

<p>There are a number of methods of protecting a
machine:</p>

<p>1. Implement kernel firewalling to limit which hosts or
networks have access to the 514/UDP socket.</p>

<p>2. Logging can be directed to an isolated or non-root
filesystem which, if filled, will not impair the
machine.</p>

<p>3. The ext2 filesystem can be used which can be
configured to limit a certain percentage of a filesystem to
usage by root only. NOTE that this will require syslogd to
be run as a non-root pro- cess. ALSO NOTE that this will
prevent usage of remote logging since syslogd will be unable
to bind to the 514/UDP socket.</p>

<p>4. Disabling inet domain sockets will limit risk to the
local machine.</p>

<p>DEBUGGING When debugging is turned on using -d option
then syslogd will be very verbose by writing much of what it
does on stdout. Whenever the con- figuration file is reread
and re-parsed youll see a tabular, corre- sponding to the
internal data structure. This tabular consists of four
fields:</p>

<p>number This field contains a serial number starting by
zero. This num- ber represents the position in the internal
data structure (i.e. the array). If one number is left out
then there might be an error in the corresponding line in
/etc/syslog.conf.</p>

<p>pattern This field is tricky and represents the internal
structure exactly. Every column stands for a facility (refer
to sys- log(3)). As you can see, there are still some
facilities left free for former use, only the left most are
used. Every field in a column represents the priorities
(refer to syslog(3)).</p>

<p>action This field describes the particular action that
takes place whenever a message is received that matches the
pattern. Refer to the syslog.conf(5) manpage for all
possible actions.</p>

<p>arguments This field shows additional arguments to the
actions in the last field. For file-logging this is the
filename for the logfile; for user-logging this is a list of
users; for remote logging this is the hostname of the
machine to log to; for console-log- ging this is the used
console; for tty-logging this is the spec- ified tty; wall
has no additional arguments.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/syslog.conf Configuration file for syslogd.
See syslog.conf(5) for exact information. /dev/log The Unix
domain socket to from where local syslog messages are read.
/var/run/syslogd.pid The file containing the process id of
syslogd.</p>

<p>BUGS If an error occurs in one line the whole rule is
ignored.</p>

<p>Syslogd Syslogd doesn t change the filemode of opened
logfiles at any stage of process. If a file is created it is
world readable, however, the syslog init script in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux sets umask to 077 so only root has read
permissions. You can also change the permissions on your
own. This could be done in combination with rotating
logfiles using the savelog(8) program that is shipped in the
smail 3.x distribution. Remember that it might be a security
hole if everybody is able to read auth.* messages as these
might contain passwords.</p>
