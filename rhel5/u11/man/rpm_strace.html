<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) STRACE(1)
STRACE(1)</p>

<p>NAME strace - trace system calls and signals</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS strace [ -dffhiqrtttTvxx ] [ -acolumn ] [
-eexpr ] ... [ -ofile ] [ -ppid ] ... [ -sstrsize ] [
-uusername ] [ -Evar=val ] ... [ -Evar ] ... [ command [ arg
... ] ]</p>

<p>strace -c [ -eexpr ] ... [ -Ooverhead ] [ -Ssortby ] [
command [ arg ... ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In the simplest case strace runs the
specified command until it exits. It intercepts and records
the system calls which are called by a pro- cess and the
signals which are received by a process. The name of each
system call, its arguments and its return value are printed
on standard error or to the file specified with the -o
option.</p>

<p>strace is a useful diagnostic, instructional, and
debugging tool. Sys- tem administrators, diagnosticians and
trouble-shooters will find it invaluable for solving
problems with programs for which the source is not readily
available since they do not need to be recompiled in order
to trace them. Students, hackers and the overly-curious will
find that a great deal can be learned about a system and its
system calls by tracing even ordinary programs. And
programmers will find that since system calls and signals
are events that happen at the user/kernel interface, a close
examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race
conditions.</p>

<p>Each line in the trace contains the system call name,
followed by its arguments in parentheses and its return
value. An example from strac- ing the command cat /dev/null
is:</p>

<p>open(&quot;/dev/null&quot;, O_RDONLY) = 3</p>

<p>Errors (typically a return value of -1) have the errno
symbol and error string appended.</p>

<p>open(&quot;/foo/bar&quot;, O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No
such file or directory)</p>

<p>Signals are printed as a signal symbol and a signal
string. An excerpt from stracing and interrupting the
command sleep 666 is:</p>

<p>sigsuspend([] &lt;unfinished ...&gt; --- SIGINT
(Interrupt) --- +++ killed by SIGINT +++</p>

<p>Arguments are printed in symbolic form with a passion.
This example shows the shell performing &gt;&gt;xyzzy output
redirection:</p>

<p>open(&quot;xyzzy&quot;, O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0666)
= 3</p>

<p>Here the three argument form of open is decoded by
breaking down the flag argument into its three bitwise-OR
constituents and printing the mode value in octal by
tradition. Where traditional or native usage differs from
ANSI or POSIX, the latter forms are preferred. In some
cases, strace output has proven to be more readable than the
source.</p>

<p>Structure pointers are dereferenced and the members are
displayed as appropriate. In all cases arguments are
formatted in the most C-like fashion possible. For example,
the essence of the command ls -l /dev/null is captured
as:</p>

<p>lstat(&quot;/dev/null&quot;, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0666,
st_rdev=makedev(1, 3), ...}) = 0</p>

<p>Notice how the struct stat argument is dereferenced and
how each mem- ber is displayed symbolically. In particular,
observe how the st_mode member is carefully decoded into a
bitwise-OR of symbolic and numeric values. Also notice in
this example that the first argument to lstat is an input to
the system call and the second argument is an output. Since
output arguments are not modified if the system call fails,
argu- ments may not always be dereferenced. For example,
retrying the ls -l example with a non-existent file produces
the following line:</p>

<p>lstat(&quot;/foo/bar&quot;, 0xb004) = -1 ENOENT (No such
file or directory)</p>

<p>In this case the porch light is on but nobody is
home.</p>

<p>Character pointers are dereferenced and printed as C
strings. Non- printing characters in strings are normally
represented by ordinary C escape codes. Only the first
strsize (32 by default) bytes of strings are printed; longer
strings have an ellipsis appended following the closing
quote. Here is a line from ls -l where the getpwuid library
routine is reading the password file:</p>

<p>read(3, &quot;root::0:0:System Administrator:/&quot;...,
1024) = 422</p>

<p>While structures are annotated using curly braces,
simple pointers and arrays are printed using square brackets
with commas separating ele- ments. Here is an example from
the command id on a system with supplementary group ids:</p>

<p>getgroups(32, [100, 0]) = 2</p>

<p>On the other hand, bit-sets are also shown using square
brackets but set elements are separated only by a space.
Here is the shell prepar- ing to execute an external
command:</p>

<p>sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD TTOU], []) = 0</p>

<p>Here the second argument is a bit-set of two signals,
SIGCHLD and SIGT- TOU. In some cases the bit-set is so full
that printing out the unset elements is more valuable. In
that case, the bit-set is prefixed by a tilde like this:</p>

<p>sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, ~[], NULL) = 0</p>

<p>Here the second argument represents the full set of all
signals.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Count time, calls, and errors for each system
call and report a summary on program exit. On Linux, this
attempts to show system time (CPU time spent running in the
kernel) independent of wall clock time. If -c is used with
-f or -F (below), only aggregate totals for all traced
processes are kept.</p>

<p>-d Show some debugging output of strace itself on the
standard error.</p>

<p>-f Trace child processes as they are created by cur-
rently traced processes as a result of the fork(2) system
call.</p>

<p>On non-Linux platforms the new process is attached to as
soon as its pid is known (through the return value of
fork(2) in the parent process). This means that such
children may run uncontrolled for a while (especially in the
case of a vfork(2)), until the parent is scheduled again to
complete its (v)fork(2) call. On Linux the child is traced
from its first instruction with no delay. If the parent
process decides to wait(2) for a child that is currently
being traced, it is suspended until an appropriate child
process either terminates or incurs a signal that would
cause it to terminate (as determined from the childs current
signal disposition).</p>

<p>On SunOS 4.x the tracing of vforks is accomplished with
some dynamic linking trickery.</p>

<p>-ff If the -o filename option is in effect, each pro-
cesses trace is written to filename.pid where pid is the
numeric process id of each process. This is incompatible
with -c, since no per-process counts are kept.</p>

<p>-F This option is now obsolete and it has the same
functionality as -f.</p>

<p>-h Print the help summary.</p>

<p>-i Print the instruction pointer at the time of the
system call.</p>

<p>-q Suppress messages about attaching, detaching etc.
This happens automatically when output is redirected to a
file and the command is run directly instead of
attaching.</p>

<p>-r Print a relative timestamp upon entry to each system
call. This records the time difference between the beginning
of successive system calls.</p>

<p>-t Prefix each line of the trace with the time of
day.</p>

<p>-tt If given twice, the time printed will include the
microseconds.</p>

<p>-ttt If given thrice, the time printed will include the
microseconds and the leading portion will be printed as the
number of seconds since the epoch.</p>

<p>-T Show the time spent in system calls. This records the
time difference between the beginning and the end of each
system call.</p>

<p>-v Print unabbreviated versions of environment, stat,
termios, etc. calls. These structures are very common in
calls and so the default behavior displays a reasonable
subset of structure members. Use this option to get all of
the gory details.</p>

<p>-V Print the version number of strace.</p>

<p>-x Print all non-ASCII strings in hexadecimal string
format.</p>

<p>-xx Print all strings in hexadecimal string format.</p>

<p>-a column Align return values in a specific column
(default column 40).</p>

<p>-e expr A qualifying expression which modifies which
events to trace or how to trace them. The format of the
expression is:</p>

<p>[qualifier=][!]value1[,value2]...</p>

<p>where qualifier is one of trace, abbrev, verbose, raw,
signal, read, or write and value is a quali- fier-dependent
symbol or number. The default quali- fier is trace. Using an
exclamation mark negates the set of values. For example,
-eopen means liter- ally -e trace=open which in turn means
trace only the open system call. By contrast, -etrace=!open
means to trace every system call except open. In addition,
the special values all and none have the obvious
meanings.</p>

<p>Note that some shells use the exclamation point for
history expansion even inside quoted arguments. If so, you
must escape the exclamation point with a backslash.</p>

<p>-e trace=set Trace only the specified set of system
calls. The -c option is useful for determining which system
calls might be useful to trace. For example,
trace=open,close,read,write means to only trace those four
system calls. Be careful when making inferences about the
user/kernel boundary if only a subset of system calls are
being monitored. The default is trace=all.</p>

<p>-e trace=file Trace all system calls which take a file
name as an argument. You can think of this as an
abbreviation for -e trace=open,stat,chmod,unlink,... which
is useful to seeing what files the process is referenc- ing.
Furthermore, using the abbreviation will ensure that you
dont accidentally forget to include a call like lstat in the
list. Betchya woulda for- got that one.</p>

<p>-e trace=process Trace all system calls which involve
process manage- ment. This is useful for watching the fork,
wait, and exec steps of a process.</p>

<p>-e trace=network Trace all the network related system
calls.</p>

<p>-e trace=signal Trace all signal related system
calls.</p>

<p>-e trace=ipc Trace all IPC related system calls.</p>

<p>-e trace=desc Trace all file descriptor related system
calls.</p>

<p>-e abbrev=set Abbreviate the output from printing each
member of large structures. The default is abbrev=all. The
-v option has the effect of abbrev=none.</p>

<p>-e verbose=set Dereference structures for the specified
set of sys- tem calls. The default is verbose=all.</p>

<p>-e raw=set Print raw, undecoded arguments for the
specified set of system calls. This option has the effect of
causing all arguments to be printed in hexadecimal. This is
mostly useful if you dont trust the decod- ing or you need
to know the actual numeric value of an argument.</p>

<p>-e signal=set Trace only the specified subset of
signals. The default is signal=all. For example,
signal=!SIGIO (or signal=!io) causes SIGIO signals not to be
traced.</p>

<p>-e read=set Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump of
all the data read from file descriptors listed in the speci-
fied set. For example, to see all input activity on file
descriptors 3 and 5 use -e read=3,5. Note that this is
independent from the normal tracing of the read(2) system
call which is controlled by the option -e trace=read.</p>

<p>-e write=set Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump
of all the data written to file descriptors listed in the
spec- ified set. For example, to see all output activity on
file descriptors 3 and 5 use -e write=3,5. Note that this is
independent from the normal tracing of the write(2) system
call which is controlled by the option -e trace=write.</p>

<p>-o filename Write the trace output to the file filename
rather than to stderr. Use filename.pid if -ff is used. If
the argument begins with | or with ! then the rest of the
argument is treated as a command and all output is piped to
it. This is convenient for pip- ing the debugging output to
a program without affecting the redirections of executed
programs.</p>

<p>-O overhead Set the overhead for tracing system calls to
over- head microseconds. This is useful for overriding the
default heuristic for guessing how much time is spent in
mere measuring when timing system calls using the -c option.
The accuracy of the heuristic can be gauged by timing a
given program run without tracing (using time(1)) and
comparing the accumu- lated system call time to the total
produced using -c.</p>

<p>-p pid Attach to the process with the process ID pid and
begin tracing. The trace may be terminated at any time by a
keyboard interrupt signal (CTRL-C). strace will respond by
detaching itself from the traced process(es) leaving it
(them) to continue running. Multiple -p options can be used
to attach to up to 32 processes in addition to command
(which is optional if at least one -p option is given).</p>

<p>-s strsize Specify the maximum string size to print (the
default is 32). Note that filenames are not consid- ered
strings and are always printed in full.</p>

<p>-S sortby Sort the output of the histogram printed by
the -c option by the specified criterion. Legal values are
time, calls, name, and nothing (default time).</p>

<p>-u username Run command with the user ID, group ID, and
supple- mentary groups of username. This option is only
useful when running as root and enables the correct
execution of setuid and/or setgid binaries. Unless this
option is used setuid and setgid programs are executed
without effective privileges.</p>

<p>-E var=val Run command with var=val in its list of
environment variables.</p>

<p>-E var Remove var from the inherited list of environment
variables before passing it on to the command.</p>

<p>SETUID INSTALLATION If strace is installed setuid to
root then the invoking user will be able to attach to and
trace processes owned by any user. In addition setuid and
setgid programs will be executed and traced with the correct
effective privileges. Since only users trusted with full
root privileges should be allowed to do these things, it
only makes sense to install strace as setuid to root when
the users who can execute it are restricted to those users
who have this trust. For example, it makes sense to install
a special version of strace with mode rwsr-xr--, user root
and group trace, where members of the trace group are
trusted users. If you do use this feature, please remember
to install a non- setuid version of strace for ordinary
lusers to use.</p>

<p>NOTES It is a pity that so much tracing clutter is
produced by systems employing shared libraries.</p>

<p>It is instructive to think about system call inputs and
outputs as data-flow across the user/kernel boundary.
Because user- space and kernel-space are separate and
address-protected, it is sometimes possible to make
deductive inferences about process behavior using inputs and
outputs as propositions.</p>

<p>In some cases, a system call will differ from the
documented behavior or have a different name. For example,
on System V- derived systems the true time(2) system call
does not take an argument and the stat function is called
xstat and takes an extra leading argument. These
discrepancies are normal but idiosyncratic characteristics
of the system call interface and are accounted for by C
library wrapper functions.</p>

<p>On some platforms a process that has a system call trace
applied to it with the -p option will receive a SIGSTOP.
This signal may interrupt a system call that is not
restartable. This may have an unpredictable effect on the
process if the process takes no action to restart the system
call.</p>

<p>BUGS Programs that use the setuid bit do not have
effective user ID privileges while being traced.</p>

<p>A traced process ignores SIGSTOP except on SVR4
platforms.</p>

<p>A traced process which tries to block SIGTRAP will be
sent a SIGSTOP in an attempt to force continuation of
tracing.</p>

<p>A traced process runs slowly.</p>

<p>Traced processes which are descended from command may be
left running after an interrupt signal (CTRL-C).</p>

<p>On Linux, exciting as it would be, tracing the init
process is forbidden.</p>

<p>The -i option is weakly supported.</p>

<p>HISTORY strace The original strace was written by Paul
Kranenburg for SunOS and was inspired by its trace utility.
The SunOS version of strace was ported to Linux and enhanced
by Branko Lankester, who also wrote the Linux kernel
support. Even though Paul released strace 2.5 in 1992,
Brankos work was based on Pauls strace 1.5 release from
1991. In 1993, Rick Sladkey merged strace 2.5 for SunOS and
the second release of strace for Linux, added many of the
features of truss(1) from SVR4, and produced an strace that
worked on both platforms. In 1994 Rick ported strace to SVR4
and Solaris and wrote the automatic configuration support.
In 1995 he ported strace to Irix and tired of writing about
himself in the third person.</p>

<p>BUGS The SIGTRAP signal is used internally by the kernel
implementa- tion of system call tracing. When a traced
process receives a SIGTRAP signal not associated with
tracing, strace will not report that signal correctly. This
signal is not normally used by programs, but could be via a
hard-coded break instruction or via kill(2).</p>

<p>PROBLEMS Problems with strace should be reported via the
Debian Bug Tracking System, or to the strace mailing list at
&lt;strace- devel@lists.sourceforge.net&gt;.</p>
