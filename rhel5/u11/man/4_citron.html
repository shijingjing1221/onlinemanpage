<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5x) for
general configuration details and for options that can be
used with all input drivers. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver. For better
understanding please read also the CTS manual and various
IRT manuals which are available in &quot;pdf&quot; format
from Citron web page www.citron.de or directly from
Citron.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;Device&quot; &quot;devpath&quot; Specify
the device path for the citron touch. Valid devices are:</p>

<p>/dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, ....</p>

<p>This option is mandatory. It s important to specify the
right device Note: com1 -&gt; /dev/ttyS0, com2 -&gt;
/dev/ttyS1 ....</p>

<p>Option &quot;ScreenNumber&quot; &quot;screennumber&quot;
sets the screennumber for the citron InputDevice.</p>

<p>Default: ScreenNumber: &quot;0&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;MinX, MinY&quot; &quot;value&quot; These
are the minimum X and Y values for the citron input
device.</p>

<p>Note: MinX, MinY must be less than MaxX, MaxY.</p>

<p>Range: &quot;0&quot; - &quot;65535&quot;</p>

<p>Default: MinX: &quot;0&quot; MinY: &quot;0&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;MaxX, MaxY&quot; &quot;value&quot; These
are the maximum X and Y values for the citron input
device.</p>

<p>Note: MaxX, MaxY must be greater than MinX, MinY.</p>

<p>Range: &quot;0&quot; - &quot;65535&quot;</p>

<p>Default: MaxX: &quot;65535&quot; MaxY:
&quot;65535&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;ButtonNumber&quot; &quot;value&quot; This
value is responsible for the button number that is returned
within the xf86PostButton event message</p>

<p>Range: &quot;0&quot; - &quot;255&quot;</p>

<p>Default: &quot;1&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;ButtonThreshold&quot; &quot;value&quot;
This value is responsible for the button threshold. It
changes the pressure sensitivity of the touch. A higher
number corre- sponds to a higher pressure.</p>

<p>Note: This feature is only available with pressure
sensitive hardware.</p>

<p>Range: &quot;0&quot; - &quot;255&quot;</p>

<p>Default: &quot;20&quot;</p>

<p>Sleep-Mode If the IRT is in Doze-Mode and Touch Zone is
not interrupted for another certain span of time, the
so-called Slee-Mode is activated. The Sleep-Mode decreases
the scan rate of the beams even further than the Doze-Mode
does (see below). This way the life expectancy of the beams
is prolonged and the power con- sumption of the IRT is
reduced. As soon as an interruption of the Touch Zone is
detected, the Sleep-Mode is deactivated and the Touch Zone
will again be scanned with the maximum speed. With the
Sleep-Mode activated, depending on the set scan rate the
IRTs response time can be considerably longer as in normal
operation. If, for example, a scan rate of 500 ms / scan is
set, it may last up to a half of a second until the IRT
detects the interruption and deactivates the Sleep-Mode.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SleepMode&quot; &quot;mode&quot; This value
is responsible for the sleep-mode of the touch. Determines
the behaviour of the Sleep-Mode.</p>

<p>0x00 No message at either activation or deactivation</p>

<p>0x01 Message at activation</p>

<p>0x02 Message at deactivation</p>

<p>0x03 Message at activation and deactivation</p>

<p>0x10 GP_OUT output set according to the Sleep-Mode
status</p>

<p>Values: &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot;
&quot;3&quot; &quot;16&quot;</p>

<p>Default: &quot;0&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;SleepTime&quot; &quot;time&quot; This value
is responsible for the sleep-time of the touch. It is the
activation time in seconds (&quot;0&quot; = immediately
activated, &quot;65535&quot; = always deactivated).</p>

<p>Range: &quot;0&quot; - &quot;65535&quot; [s]</p>

<p>Default: &quot;65535&quot; =&gt; deactivated</p>

<p>Option &quot;SleepScan&quot; &quot;scan&quot; This value
is responsible for the scan-time of the touch. This is the
time interval between two scan operations while in
Sleep-Mode. The time interval is set in steps of
milliseconds.</p>

<p>Range: &quot;0&quot; - &quot;65535&quot; [ms]</p>

<p>Default: &quot;500&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;PWMAdjSrc&quot; &quot;value&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;PWMAdjDst&quot; &quot;value&quot; These
parameters are used to adjust the brightness of different
backlight inverters. At the moment 2 backlight inverters are
used: 0=TDK 1=AC. If you want a AC backlight inverter to
behave like an AC type you have to set PWMAdjSrc to 0 (TDK)
and PWMAd- jDst to 1 (AC).</p>

<p>Range: &quot;0&quot; - &quot;1&quot;</p>

<p>Default: &quot;-1&quot; (no adjustment)</p>

<p>Option &quot;PWMActive&quot; &quot;value&quot; This
value determines the mark-to-space ratio of the PWM output
while in normal operation (sleep-mode not active). Higher
val- ues result in longer pulse widths. This output signal
can be used in conjunction with the Citron AWBI to do
backlight-dimming via the touch.</p>

<p>Range: &quot;0&quot; - &quot;255&quot;</p>

<p>Default: &quot;255&quot; (max. brightness)</p>

<p>Option &quot;PWMSleep&quot; &quot;value&quot; This value
determines the mark-to-space ratio of the PWM output while
in sleep-mode (-&gt; SleepMode, SleepScan, SleepTime )
opera- tion (sleep-mode active). Higher values result in
longer pulse widths.</p>

<p>Range: &quot;0&quot; - &quot;255&quot;</p>

<p>Default: &quot;255&quot; (max. brightness)</p>

<p>Option &quot;PWMFreq&quot; &quot;value&quot; This value
determines the PWM frequency in Hertz</p>

<p>Range: &quot;39&quot; - &quot;9803&quot;</p>

<p>Default: &quot;9803&quot; (max. frequency)</p>

<p>Option &quot;ClickMode&quot; &quot;mode&quot; With mode
one can select between 5 ClickModes</p>

<p>&quot;1&quot; = ClickMode Enter</p>

<p>With this mode every interruption of the infrared beams
will activate a ButtonPress event and after the interruption
a But- tonRelease event will be sent.</p>

<p>&quot;2&quot; = ClickMode Dual</p>

<p>With this mode every interruption will sent a Proximity
event and every second interruption a ButtonPress event.
With the release of the interruption (while one interruption
is still active) a ButtonRelease event will be sent.</p>

<p>&quot;3&quot; = ClickMode Dual Exit</p>

<p>With this mode every interruption will sent a
ProximityIn event and every second interruption a
ButtonPress event. With the release of the interruption
(while one interruption is still active) no ButtonRelease
event will be sent. Only if all inter- ruptions are released
a ButtonRelease followed by a ProximityOut event will be
sent.</p>

<p>&quot;4&quot; = ClickMode ZPress</p>

<p>With this mode every interruption will sent a
ProximityIn event. Only if a certain pressure is exceeded a
ButtonPress event will occur. If the pressure falls below a
certain limit a ButtonRe- lease event will be sent. After
also the interruption is released a ProximityOut event is
generated.</p>

<p>&quot;5&quot; = ClickMode ZPress Exit</p>

<p>This mode is similar to &quot;Clickmode Dual Exit&quot;.
The first inter- ruption of the beams will sent a
ProximityIn event. Only if a certain pressure is exceeded a
ButtonPress event will occur. If the pressure falls below a
certain limit no ButtonRelease event will be sent. After the
interruption is also released a Button- Release followed by
a ProximityOut event is generated.</p>

<p>Range: &quot;1&quot; - &quot;5&quot;</p>

<p>Default: &quot;1&quot; (ClickMode Enter)</p>

<p>Option &quot;Origin&quot; &quot;value&quot; This value
sets the coordinates origin to one of the four cor- ners of
the screen. The following values are accepted: &quot;0&quot;
TOPLEFT: Origin set to the left-hand side top corner.
&quot;1&quot; TOPRIGHT: Origin set to the right-hand side
top corner. &quot;2&quot; BOTTOMRIGHT: Origin set to the
right-hand side bottom corner. &quot;3&quot; BOTTOMLEFT:
Origin set to the left-hand side bottom corner.</p>

<p>Range: &quot;0&quot; - &quot;3&quot;</p>

<p>Default: &quot;0&quot; (TOPLEFT)</p>

<p>Doze-Mode If for a certain span of time the Touch Zone
is not interrupted, the so-called Doze-Mode is automatically
activated. The acti- vated Doze-Mode slightly decreases the
scan rate of the beams. This way the power consumption of
the IRT is reduced. As soon as an interruption of the Touch
Zone is detected, the Doze-Mode is deactivated and the Touch
Zone will again be scanned with the maximum speed.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DozeMode&quot; &quot;mode&quot; This value
is responsible for the doze-mode of the touch.</p>

<p>Determines the behaviour of the Doze-Mode.</p>

<p>0x00 No message at either activation or deactivation</p>

<p>0x01 Message at activation</p>

<p>0x02 Message at deactivation</p>

<p>0x03 Message at activation and deactivation</p>

status</p>

<p>If the GP_OUT output is already controlled by the
Sleep-Mode it is no longer available as an output port
anymore.</p>
