<p>NEWSLOG(5) NEWSLOG(5)</p>

<p>NAME newslog - description of Usenet log files</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Most log files created by Usenet programs
reside in the &lt;pathlog in inn.conf&gt; directory and have
a .log extension. Several versions are usually kept with an
additional extension such as .1 , .2, etc. the higher the
number, the older the log. The older versions may be
compressed and thus may have a .1.gz, .2.gz , etc. exten-
sion.</p>

<p>The scanlogs script and related utilities (see
scanlogs(8)) are respon- sible for rotating and compressing
these files.</p>

<p>Some log files always have data, others only have data
if there is a problem, and others are only created if a
particular program is used or configuration parameter is
set. The innstat script (see innstat(8)) monitors the size
of all log files.</p>

<p>The following files will only accumulate data under the
direction of control.ctl(5):</p>

<p>control.log miscctl.log newgroup.log rmgroup.log
unwanted.log</p>

<p>In order to create these files, the message and action
fields of control.ctl should be chosen from the following
table:</p>

<p>Message Action Meaning all log=miscctl Log all messages
by default default log=miscctl Log unknown messages newgroup
doit=newgroup Create group and log message newgroup
log=newgroup Log message rmgroup doit=rmgroup Remove group
and log message rmgroup log=rmgroup Log message other
doit=miscctl log and process the message other log=miscctl
Log message</p>

<p>Here, other refers to any other control message such
as:</p>

<p>checkgroups ihave sendme sendsys senduuname version</p>

<p>The following is a list of log files:</p>

<p>control.log This file maintains a count of the number of
newgroup and rmgroup control messages seen for each
newsgroup. The count is of the number of control messages
with the indicated arguments, regardless if they were
actually processed. All control argu- ments, including
invalid ones, are counted. This file is updated by
tally.control, which is invoked by scanlogs if either the
newgroup or rmgroup logs exist. This file is not
rotated.</p>

<p>errlog This file contains the standard output and
standard error of any program spawned by innd(8), such as
channel feeds configured in newsfeeds. This file should
normally be empty. Scanlogs will print the entire contents
of this log file if it is non-empty.</p>

<p>expire.log By default, when news.daily is going to
expire old news arti- cles, it writes the date to this file,
followed by any output from expire(8) and the ending date.
All lines but the first are indented four spaces.</p>

<p>miscctl.log When control.ctl is configured as described
above, all control messages except newgroup and rmgroup are
appended to this file by writelog. There will be a summary
line describing the mes- sage and the action taken, followed
by the article indented by four spaces, and a blank
line.</p>

<p>newgroup.log When control.ctl is configured as described
above, all newgroup messages are appended to this file using
the same format as for miscctl.log.</p>

<p>news This file logs articles received by innd. Scanlogs
summarizes the rejected articles reported in this file.</p>

<p>news.crit All critical error messages issued by innd are
appended to this file via syslog(3). This log file should be
empty. Scanlogs will print the entire contents of this log
file if it is non- empty. You should have the following line
in your system sys- log.conf file, using a tab character for
the delimiter:</p>

<p>news.crit &lt;pathlog in inn.conf&gt;/news.crit</p>

<p>(A typical entry is shown; it should agree with
&lt;pathlog in inn.conf&gt;.)</p>

<p>news.err All major error messages issued by innd are
appended to this file via syslog(3). This log file should be
empty. Scanlogs will print the entire contents of this log
file if it is non- empty. You should have the following line
in your system sys- log.conf file, using a tab character for
the delimiter:</p>

<p>news.err &lt;pathlog in inn.conf&gt;/news.err</p>

<p>(A typical entry is shown; it should agree with
&lt;pathlog in inn.conf&gt;.)</p>

<p>news.notice All standard error messages and status
messages issued by innd are appended to this file via
syslog(3). Scanlogs uses the perl(1) script innreport(8) to
summarize this file. You should have the following line in
your system syslog.conf file, using a tab character for the
delimiter:</p>

<p>news.notice &lt;pathlog in inn.conf&gt;/news.notice (A
typical entry is shown; it should agree with &lt;pathlog in
inn.conf&gt;.)</p>

<p>nntpsend.log The nntpsend(8) programs appends all status
messages to this file.</p>

<p>rmgroup.log When control.ctl is configured as described
above, all rmgroup messages are appended to this file using
the same format as for miscctl.log.</p>

<p>unwanted.log This log maintains a count of the number of
articles that were rejected because they were posted to
newsgroups that do not exist at the local site. This file is
updated by tally.unwanted and maintained in reverse numeric
order (the most popular rejected group first). This file is
not rotated.</p>
