SUBSCRIPTIONS(5)</p>

<p>NAME subscriptions - Default recommended
subscriptions</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pathetc/subscriptions file contains a
list of newsgroups that is returned by the NNTP command LIST
SUBSCRIPTIONS.</p>

<p>Clients that support this command and send it the first
time they con- nect to a new news server use the returned
list to initialize the list of subscribed newsgroups. The
subscriptions file therefore should con- tain groups
intented for new users, for testing, or that contain FAQs
and other useful information for first-time Usenet
users.</p>

<p>The syntax of the subscriptions file is trivial; it is a
simple list of newsgroup names, one per line. The order of
newsgroups may be signifi- cant; the news reading client may
present the groups in that order to the user.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE A typical subscriptions file may look like:</p>

<p>news.announce.newusers news.newusers.questions
local.test local.general local.talk misc.test
misc.test.moderated news.answers news.announce.newgroups</p>

<p>This gives the client the FAQs and question newsgroup
for new users first, then a local newsgroup for testing and
various commonly-read local discussion groups, followed by
the world-wide test groups, all the FAQs, and announcements
of new world-wide newsgroups. If there is a local new users
group, one might want to list it first.</p>
