<p>PWCONV(8) System Management Commands PWCONV(8)</p>

<p>NAME pwconv, pwunconv, grpconv, grpunconv - convert to
and from shadow passwords and groups</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pwconv</p>

<p>pwunconv</p>

<p>grpconv</p>

<p>grpunconv</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pwconv creates shadow from passwd and an
optionally existing shadow.</p>

<p>pwunconv creates passwd from passwd and shadow and then
removes shadow.</p>

<p>grpconv creates gshadow from group and an optionally
existing gshadow.</p>

<p>grpunconv creates group from group and gshadow and then
removes gshadow.</p>

<p>These four programs all operate on the normal and shadow
password and group files: /etc/passwd, /etc/group,
/etc/shadow, and /etc/gshadow.</p>

<p>Each program acquires the necessary locks before
conversion. pwconv and grpconv are similar. First, entries
in the shadowed file which don t exist in the main file are
removed. Then, shadowed entries which dont have x as the
password in the main file are updated. Any missing shadowed
entries are added. Finally, passwords in the main file are
replaced with x . These programs can be used for initial
conversion as well to update the shadowed file if the main
file is edited by hand.</p>

<p>pwconv will use the values of PASS_MIN_DAYS,
PASS_MAX_DAYS, and PASS_WARN_AGE from /etc/login.defs when
adding new entries to /etc/shadow.</p>

<p>Likewise pwunconv and grpunconv are similar. Passwords
in the main file are updated from the shadowed file. Entries
which exist in the main file but not in the shadowed file
are left alone. Finally, the shadowed file is removed. Some
password aging information is lost by pwunconv. It will
convert what it can.</p>

<p>BUGS Errors in the password or group files (such as
invalid or duplicate entries) may cause these programs to
loop forever or fail in other strange ways. Please run pwck
and grpck to correct any such errors before converting to or
from shadow passwords or groups.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/login.defs Shadow password suite
configuration.</p>
