<p>PERLTHRTUT(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide

<p>NAME perlthrtut - tutorial on threads in Perl</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION NOTE: this tutorial describes the new Perl
threading flavour introduced in Perl 5.6.0 called
interpreter threads, or ithreads for short. In this model
each thread runs in its own Perl interpreter, and any data
sharing between threads must be explicit.</p>

<p>There is another older Perl threading flavour called the
5.005 model, unsurprisingly for 5.005 versions of Perl. The
old model is known to have problems, deprecated, and will
probably be removed around release 5.10. You are strongly
encouraged to migrate any existing 5.005 threads code to the
new model as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You can see which (or neither) threading flavour you
have by running &quot;perl -V&quot; and looking at the
&quot;Platform&quot; section. If you have &quot;usei-
threads=define&quot; you have ithreads, if you have
&quot;use5005threads=define&quot; you have 5.005 threads. If
you have neither, you don t have any thread support built
in. If you have both, you are in trouble.</p>

<p>The user-level interface to the 5.005 threads was via
the Threads class, while ithreads uses the threads class.
Note the change in case.</p>

<p>Status The ithreads code has been available since Perl
5.6.0, and is consid- ered stable. The user-level interface
to ithreads (the threads classes) appeared in the 5.8.0
release, and as of this time is considered stable although
it should be treated with caution as with all new
features.</p>

<p>What Is A Thread Anyway? A thread is a flow of control
through a program with a single execution point.</p>

<p>Sounds an awful lot like a process, doesnt it? Well, it
should. Threads are one of the pieces of a process. Every
process has at least one thread and, up until now, every
process running Perl had only one thread. With 5.8, though,
you can create extra threads. Were going to show you how,
when, and why.</p>

<p>Threaded Program Models There are three basic ways that
you can structure a threaded program. Which model you choose
depends on what you need your program to do. For many
non-trivial threaded programs you ll need to choose
different models for different pieces of your program.</p>

<p>Boss/Worker</p>

<p>The boss/worker model usually has one &quot;boss&quot;
thread and one or more &quot;worker&quot; threads. The boss
thread gathers or generates tasks that need to be done, then
parcels those tasks out to the appropriate worker
thread.</p>

<p>This model is common in GUI and server programs, where a
main thread waits for some event and then passes that event
to the appropriate worker threads for processing. Once the
event has been passed on, the boss thread goes back to
waiting for another event.</p>

<p>The boss thread does relatively little work. While tasks
arent neces- sarily performed faster than with any other
method, it tends to have the best user-response times.</p>

<p>Work Crew</p>

<p>In the work crew model, several threads are created that
do essentially the same thing to different pieces of data.
It closely mirrors classi- cal parallel processing and
vector processors, where a large array of processors do the
exact same thing to many pieces of data.</p>

<p>This model is particularly useful if the system running
the program will distribute multiple threads across
different processors. It can also be useful in ray tracing
or rendering engines, where the individ- ual threads can
pass on interim results to give the user visual feed-
back.</p>

<p>Pipeline</p>

<p>The pipeline model divides up a task into a series of
steps, and passes the results of one step on to the thread
processing the next. Each thread does one thing to each
piece of data and passes the results to the next thread in
line.</p>

<p>This model makes the most sense if you have multiple
processors so two or more threads will be executing in
parallel, though it can often make sense in other contexts
as well. It tends to keep the individual tasks small and
simple, as well as allowing some parts of the pipeline to
block (on I/O or system calls, for example) while other
parts keep going. If youre running different parts of the
pipeline on different processors you may also take advantage
of the caches on each processor.</p>

<p>This model is also handy for a form of recursive
programming where, rather than having a subroutine call
itself, it instead creates another thread. Prime and
Fibonacci generators both map well to this form of the
pipeline model. (A version of a prime number generator is
presented later on.)</p>

<p>What kind of threads are Perl threads? If you have
experience with other thread implementations, you might find
that things arent quite what you expect. It s very important
to remember when dealing with Perl threads that Perl Threads
Are Not X Threads, for all values of X. They arent POSIX
threads, or Dec- Threads, or Javas Green threads, or Win32
threads. There are similar- ities, and the broad concepts
are the same, but if you start looking for implementation
details you re going to be either disappointed or confused.
Possibly both.</p>

<p>This is not to say that Perl threads are completely
different from everything that s ever come before--theyre
not. Perls threading model owes a lot to other thread
models, especially POSIX. Just as Perl is not C, though,
Perl threads are not POSIX threads. So if you find yourself
looking for mutexes, or thread priorities, its time to step
back a bit and think about what you want to do and how Perl
can do it.</p>

<p>However it is important to remember that Perl threads
cannot magically do things unless your operating systems
threads allows it. So if your system blocks the entire
process on sleep(), Perl usually will as well.</p>

<p>Perl Threads Are Different.</p>

<p>Thread-Safe Modules The addition of threads has changed
Perl s internals substantially. There are implications for
people who write modules with XS code or external libraries.
However, since perl data is not shared among threads by
default, Perl modules stand a high chance of being thread-
safe or can be made thread-safe easily. Modules that are not
tagged as thread-safe should be tested or code reviewed
before being used in pro- duction code.</p>

<p>Not all modules that you might use are thread-safe, and
you should always assume a module is unsafe unless the
documentation says other- wise. This includes modules that
are distributed as part of the core. Threads are a new
feature, and even some of the standard modules arent
thread-safe.</p>

<p>Even if a module is thread-safe, it doesnt mean that the
module is optimized to work well with threads. A module
could possibly be rewrit- ten to utilize the new features in
threaded Perl to increase perfor- mance in a threaded
environment.</p>

<p>If youre using a module thats not thread-safe for some
reason, you can protect yourself by using it from one, and
only one thread at all. If you need multiple threads to
access such a module, you can use semaphores and lots of
programming discipline to control access to it. Semaphores
are covered in &quot;Basic semaphores&quot;.</p>

<p>See also &quot;Thread-Safety of System
Libraries&quot;.</p>

<p>Thread Basics The core threads module provides the basic
functions you need to write threaded programs. In the
following sections well cover the basics, showing you what
you need to do to create a threaded program. After that, we
ll go over some of the features of the threads module that
make threaded programming easier.</p>

<p>Basic Thread Support</p>

<p>Thread support is a Perl compile-time option - it s
something thats turned on or off when Perl is built at your
site, rather than when your programs are compiled. If your
Perl wasn t compiled with thread support enabled, then any
attempt to use threads will fail.</p>

<p>Your programs can use the Config module to check whether
threads are enabled. If your program cant run without them,
you can say something like:</p>

<p>$Config{useithreads} or die &quot;Recompile Perl with
threads to run this program.&quot;;</p>

<p>A possibly-threaded program using a possibly-threaded
module might have code like this:</p>

<p>use Config; use MyMod;</p>

<p>BEGIN { if ($Config{useithreads}) { # We have threads
require MyMod_threaded; import MyMod_threaded; } else {
require MyMod_unthreaded; import MyMod_unthreaded; } }</p>

<p>Since code that runs both with and without threads is
usually pretty messy, its best to isolate the
thread-specific code in its own module. In our example
above, thats what MyMod_threaded is, and it s only imported
if were running on a threaded Perl.</p>

<p>A Note about the Examples</p>

<p>Although thread support is considered to be stable,
there are still a number of quirks that may startle you when
you try out any of the examples below. In a real situation,
care should be taken that all threads are finished executing
before the program exits. That care has not been taken in
these examples in the interest of simplicity. Run- ning
these examples &quot;as is&quot; will produce error
messages, usually caused by the fact that there are still
threads running when the program exits. You should not be
alarmed by this. Future versions of Perl may fix this
problem.</p>

<p>Creating Threads</p>

<p>The threads package provides the tools you need to
create new threads. Like any other module, you need to tell
Perl that you want to use it; &quot;use threads&quot;
imports all the pieces you need to create basic threads.</p>

<p>The simplest, most straightforward way to create a
thread is with new():</p>

<p>use threads;</p>

<p>$thr = threads-&gt;new(sub1);</p>

<p>sub sub1 { print &quot;In the thread0; }</p>

<p>The new() method takes a reference to a subroutine and
creates a new thread, which starts executing in the
referenced subroutine. Control then passes both to the
subroutine and the caller.</p>

<p>If you need to, your program can pass parameters to the
subroutine as part of the thread startup. Just include the
list of parameters as part of the &quot;threads::new&quot;
call, like this:</p>

<p>use threads;</p>

<p>$Param3 = &quot;foo&quot;; $thr = threads-&gt;new(sub1,
&quot;Param 1&quot;, &quot;Param 2&quot;, $Param3); $thr =
threads-&gt;new(sub1, @ParamList); $thr =
threads-&gt;new(sub1, qw(Param1 Param2 Param3));</p>

<p>sub sub1 { my @InboundParameters = @_; print &quot;In
the thread0; print &quot;got parameters &gt;&quot;,
join(&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;, @InboundParameters), &quot;&lt;0;
}</p>

<p>The last example illustrates another feature of threads.
You can spawn off several threads using the same subroutine.
Each thread executes the same subroutine, but in a separate
thread with a separate environ- ment and potentially
separate arguments.</p>

<p>&quot;create()&quot; is a synonym for
&quot;new()&quot;.</p>

<p>Waiting For A Thread To Exit</p>

<p>Since threads are also subroutines, they can return
values. To wait for a thread to exit and extract any values
it might return, you can use the join() method:</p>

<p>use threads;</p>

<p>$thr = threads-&gt;new(sub1);</p>

<p>@ReturnData = $thr-&gt;join; print &quot;Thread returned
@ReturnData&quot;;</p>

<p>sub sub1 { return &quot;Fifty-six&quot;,
&quot;foo&quot;, 2; }</p>

<p>In the example above, the join() method returns as soon
as the thread ends. In addition to waiting for a thread to
finish and gathering up any values that the thread might
have returned, join() also performs any OS cleanup necessary
for the thread. That cleanup might be impor- tant,
especially for long-running programs that spawn lots of
threads. If you dont want the return values and dont want to
wait for the thread to finish, you should call the detach()
method instead, as described next.</p>

<p>Ignoring A Thread</p>

<p>join() does three things: it waits for a thread to exit,
cleans up after it, and returns any data the thread may have
produced. But what if youre not interested in the threads
return values, and you dont really care when the thread
finishes? All you want is for the thread to get cleaned up
after when its done.</p>

<p>In this case, you use the detach() method. Once a thread
is detached, itll run until its finished, then Perl will
clean up after it auto- matically.</p>

<p>use threads;</p>

<p>$thr = threads-&gt;new(sub1); # Spawn the thread</p>

<p>$thr-&gt;detach; # Now we officially dont care any
more</p>

<p>sub sub1 { $a = 0; while (1) { $a++; print &quot; is
$a0; sleep 1; } }</p>

<p>Once a thread is detached, it may not be joined, and any
return data that it might have produced (if it was done and
waiting for a join) is lost.</p>

<p>Threads And Data Now that weve covered the basics of
threads, its time for our next topic: data. Threading
introduces a couple of complications to data access that
non-threaded programs never need to worry about.</p>

<p>Shared And Unshared Data</p>

<p>The biggest difference between Perl ithreads and the old
5.005 style threading, or for that matter, to most other
threading systems out there, is that by default, no data is
shared. When a new perl thread is created, all the data
associated with the current thread is copied to the new
thread, and is subsequently private to that new thread! This
is similar in feel to what happens when a UNIX process
forks, except that in this case, the data is just copied to
a different part of mem- ory within the same process rather
than a real fork taking place.</p>

<p>To make use of threading however, one usually wants the
threads to share at least some data between themselves. This
is done with the threads::shared module and the &quot; :
shared&quot; attribute:</p>

<p>use threads; use threads::shared;</p>

<p>my $foo : shared = 1; my $bar = 1; threads-&gt;new(sub {
$foo++; $bar++ })-&gt;join;</p>

<p>print &quot;$foo0; #prints 2 since $foo is shared print
&quot;$bar0; #prints 1 since $bar is not shared</p>

<p>In the case of a shared array, all the arrays elements
are shared, and for a shared hash, all the keys and values
are shared. This places restrictions on what may be assigned
to shared array and hash elements: only simple values or
references to shared variables are allowed - this is so that
a private variable cant accidentally become shared. A bad
assignment will cause the thread to die. For example:</p>

<p>use threads; use threads::shared;</p>

<p>my $var = 1; my $svar : shared = 2; my %hash :
shared;</p>

<p>... create some threads ...</p>

<p>$hash{a} = 1; # all threads see exists($hash{a}) and
$hash{a} == 1 $hash{a} = $var # okay - copy-by-value: same
effect as previous $hash{a} = $svar # okay - copy-by-value:
same effect as previous $hash{a} = var # okay - a reference
to a shared variable $hash{a} = ar # This will die delete
$hash{a} # okay - all threads will see !exists($hash{a})</p>

<p>Note that a shared variable guarantees that if two or
more threads try to modify it at the same time, the internal
state of the variable will not become corrupted. However,
there are no guarantees beyond this, as explained in the
next section.</p>

<p>Thread Pitfalls: Races</p>

<p>While threads bring a new set of useful tools, they also
bring a number of pitfalls. One pitfall is the race
condition:</p>

<p>use threads; use threads::shared;</p>

<p>my $a : shared = 1; $thr1 = threads-&gt;new(sub1); $thr2
= threads-&gt;new(sub2);</p>

<p>$thr1-&gt;join; $thr2-&gt;join; print &quot;$a0;</p>

<p>sub sub1 { my $foo = $a; $a = $foo + 1; } sub sub2 { my
$bar = $a; $a = $bar + 1; }</p>

<p>What do you think $a will be? The answer, unfortunately,
is &quot;it depends.&quot; Both sub1() and sub2() access the
global variable $a, once to read and once to write.
Depending on factors ranging from your thread
implementations scheduling algorithm to the phase of the
moon, $a can be 2 or 3.</p>

<p>Race conditions are caused by unsynchronized access to
shared data. Without explicit synchronization, theres no way
to be sure that noth- ing has happened to the shared data
between the time you access it and the time you update it.
Even this simple code fragment has the possi- bility of
error:</p>

<p>use threads; my $a : shared = 2; my $b : shared; my $c :
shared; my $thr1 = threads-&gt;create(sub { $b = $a; $a = $b
+ 1; }); my $thr2 = threads-&gt;create(sub { $c = $a; $a =
$c + 1; }); $thr1-&gt;join; $thr2-&gt;join;</p>

<p>Two threads both access $a. Each thread can potentially
be interrupted at any point, or be executed in any order. At
the end, $a could be 3 or 4, and both $b and $c could be 2
or 3.</p>

<p>Even &quot;$a += 5&quot; or &quot;$a++&quot; are not
guaranteed to be atomic.</p>

<p>Whenever your program accesses data or resources that
can be accessed by other threads, you must take steps to
coordinate access or risk data inconsistency and race
conditions. Note that Perl will protect its internals from
your race conditions, but it wont protect you from you.</p>

<p>Synchronization and control Perl provides a number of
mechanisms to coordinate the interactions between themselves
and their data, to avoid race conditions and the like. Some
of these are designed to resemble the common techniques used
in thread libraries such as &quot;pthreads&quot;; others are
Perl-specific. Often, the standard techniques are clumsy and
difficult to get right (such as condition waits). Where
possible, it is usually easier to use Perlish techniques
such as queues, which remove some of the hard work
involved.</p>

<p>Controlling access: lock()</p>

<p>The lock() function takes a shared variable and puts a
lock on it. No other thread may lock the variable until the
variable is unlocked by the thread holding the lock.
Unlocking happens automatically when the locking thread
exits the outermost block that contains &quot;lock()&quot;
func- tion. Using lock() is straightforward: this example
has several threads doing some calculations in parallel, and
occasionally updating a running total:</p>

<p>use threads; use threads::shared;</p>

<p>my $total : shared = 0;</p>

<p>sub calc { for (;;) { my $result; # (... do some
calculations and set $result ...) { lock($total); # block
until we obtain the lock $total += $result; } # lock
implicitly released at end of scope last if $result == 0; }
}</p>

<p>my $thr1 = threads-&gt;new(calc); my $thr2 =
threads-&gt;new(calc); my $thr3 = threads-&gt;new(calc);
$thr1-&gt;join; $thr2-&gt;join; $thr3-&gt;join; print
&quot;total=$total0;</p>

<p>lock() blocks the thread until the variable being locked
is available. When lock() returns, your thread can be sure
that no other thread can lock that variable until the
outermost block containing the lock exits.</p>

<p>Its important to note that locks dont prevent access to
the variable in question, only lock attempts. This is in
keeping with Perls long- standing tradition of courteous
programming, and the advisory file locking that flock()
gives you.</p>

<p>You may lock arrays and hashes as well as scalars.
Locking an array, though, will not block subsequent locks on
array elements, just lock attempts on the array itself.</p>

<p>Locks are recursive, which means its okay for a thread
to lock a vari- able more than once. The lock will last
until the outermost lock() on the variable goes out of
scope. For example:</p>

<p>my $x : shared; doit();</p>

<p>sub doit { { { lock($x); # wait for lock lock($x); #
NOOP - we already have the lock { lock($x); # NOOP {
lock($x); # NOOP lockit_some_more(); } } } # *** implicit
unlock here *** } }</p>

<p>sub lockit_some_more { lock($x); # NOOP } # nothing
happens here</p>

<p>Note that there is no unlock() function - the only way
to unlock a variable is to allow it to go out of scope.</p>

<p>A lock can either be used to guard the data contained
within the vari- able being locked, or it can be used to
guard something else, like a section of code. In this latter
case, the variable in question does not hold any useful
data, and exists only for the purpose of being locked. In
this respect, the variable behaves like the mutexes and
basic semaphores of traditional thread libraries.</p>

<p>A Thread Pitfall: Deadlocks</p>

<p>Locks are a handy tool to synchronize access to data,
and using them properly is the key to safe shared data.
Unfortunately, locks arent without their dangers, especially
when multiple locks are involved. Consider the following
code:</p>

<p>use threads;</p>

<p>my $a : shared = 4; my $b : shared = &quot;foo&quot;; my
$thr1 = threads-&gt;new(sub { lock($a); sleep 20; lock($b);
}); my $thr2 = threads-&gt;new(sub { lock($b); sleep 20;
lock($a); });</p>

<p>This program will probably hang until you kill it. The
only way it wont hang is if one of the two threads acquires
both locks first. A guaranteed-to-hang version is more
complicated, but the principle is the same.</p>

<p>The first thread will grab a lock on $a, then, after a
pause during which the second thread has probably had time
to do some work, try to grab a lock on $b. Meanwhile, the
second thread grabs a lock on $b, then later tries to grab a
lock on $a. The second lock attempt for both threads will
block, each waiting for the other to release its lock.</p>

<p>This condition is called a deadlock, and it occurs
whenever two or more threads are trying to get locks on
resources that the others own. Each thread will block,
waiting for the other to release a lock on a resource. That
never happens, though, since the thread with the resource is
itself waiting for a lock to be released.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to handle this sort of
problem. The best way is to always have all threads acquire
locks in the exact same order. If, for example, you lock
variables $a, $b, and $c, always lock $a before $b, and $b
before $c. Its also best to hold on to locks for as short a
period of time to minimize the risks of deadlock.</p>

<p>The other synchronization primitives described below can
suffer from similar problems.</p>

<p>Queues: Passing Data Around</p>

<p>A queue is a special thread-safe object that lets you
put data in one end and take it out the other without having
to worry about synchro- nization issues. Theyre pretty
straightforward, and look like this:</p>

<p>use threads; use Thread::Queue;</p>

<p>my $DataQueue = Thread::Queue-&gt;new; $thr =
threads-&gt;new(sub { while ($DataElement =
$DataQueue-&gt;dequeue) { print &quot;Popped $DataElement
off the queue0; } });</p>

<p>$DataQueue-&gt;enqueue(12);
$DataQueue-&gt;enqueue(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;,
&quot;C&quot;); $DataQueue-&gt;enqueue(hr); sleep 10;
$DataQueue-&gt;enqueue(undef); $thr-&gt;join;</p>

<p>You create the queue with &quot;new Thread::Queue&quot;.
Then you can add lists of scalars onto the end with
enqueue(), and pop scalars off the front of it with
dequeue(). A queue has no fixed size, and can grow as needed
to hold everything pushed on to it.</p>

<p>If a queue is empty, dequeue() blocks until another
thread enqueues something. This makes queues ideal for event
loops and other communi- cations between threads.</p>

<p>Semaphores: Synchronizing Data Access</p>

<p>Semaphores are a kind of generic locking mechanism. In
their most basic form, they behave very much like lockable
scalars, except that they cant hold data, and that they must
be explicitly unlocked. In their advanced form, they act
like a kind of counter, and can allow multiple threads to
have the lock at any one time.</p>

<p>Basic semaphores</p>

<p>Semaphores have two methods, down() and up(): down()
decrements the resource count, while up increments it. Calls
to down() will block if the semaphore s current count would
decrement below zero. This program gives a quick
demonstration:</p>

<p>use threads; use Thread::Semaphore;</p>

<p>my $semaphore = new Thread::Semaphore; my
$GlobalVariable : shared = 0;</p>

<p>$thr1 = new threads sample_sub, 1; $thr2 = new threads
sample_sub, 2; $thr3 = new threads sample_sub, 3;</p>

<p>sub sample_sub { my $SubNumber = shift @_; my $TryCount
= 10; my $LocalCopy; sleep 1; while ($TryCount--) {
$semaphore-&gt;down; $LocalCopy = $GlobalVariable; print
&quot;$TryCount tries left for sub $SubNumber (lobalVariable
is $GlobalVariable)0; sleep 2; $LocalCopy++; $GlobalVariable
= $LocalCopy; $semaphore-&gt;up; } }</p>

<p>$thr1-&gt;join; $thr2-&gt;join; $thr3-&gt;join;</p>

<p>The three invocations of the subroutine all operate in
sync. The semaphore, though, makes sure that only one thread
is accessing the global variable at once.</p>

<p>Advanced Semaphores</p>

<p>By default, semaphores behave like locks, letting only
one thread down() them at a time. However, there are other
uses for semaphores.</p>

<p>Each semaphore has a counter attached to it. By default,
semaphores are created with the counter set to one, down()
decrements the counter by one, and up() increments by one.
However, we can override any or all of these defaults simply
by passing in different values:</p>

<p>use threads; use Thread::Semaphore; my $semaphore =
Thread::Semaphore-&gt;new(5); # Creates a semaphore with the
counter set to five</p>

<p>$thr1 = threads-&gt;new(sub1); $thr2 =
threads-&gt;new(sub1);</p>

<p>sub sub1 { $semaphore-&gt;down(5); # Decrements the
counter by five # Do stuff here $semaphore-&gt;up(5); #
Increment the counter by five }</p>

<p>$thr1-&gt;detach; $thr2-&gt;detach;</p>

<p>If down() attempts to decrement the counter below zero,
it blocks until the counter is large enough. Note that while
a semaphore can be cre- ated with a starting count of zero,
any up() or down() always changes the counter by at least
one, and so $semaphore-&gt;down(0) is the same as
$semaphore-&gt;down(1).</p>

<p>The question, of course, is why would you do something
like this? Why create a semaphore with a starting count
thats not one, or why decre- ment/increment it by more than
one? The answer is resource availabil- ity. Many resources
that you want to manage access for can be safely used by
more than one thread at once.</p>

<p>For example, let s take a GUI driven program. It has a
semaphore that it uses to synchronize access to the display,
so only one thread is ever drawing at once. Handy, but of
course you dont want any thread to start drawing until
things are properly set up. In this case, you can create a
semaphore with a counter set to zero, and up it when things
are ready for drawing.</p>

<p>Semaphores with counters greater than one are also
useful for estab- lishing quotas. Say, for example, that you
have a number of threads that can do I/O at once. You dont
want all the threads reading or writing at once though,
since that can potentially swamp your I/O chan- nels, or
deplete your process quota of filehandles. You can use a
semaphore initialized to the number of concurrent I/O
requests (or open files) that you want at any one time, and
have your threads quietly block and unblock themselves.</p>

<p>Larger increments or decrements are handy in those cases
where a thread needs to check out or return a number of
resources at once.</p>

<p>cond_wait() and cond_signal()</p>

<p>These two functions can be used in conjunction with
locks to notify co- operating threads that a resource has
become available. They are very similar in use to the
functions found in &quot;pthreads&quot;. However for most
purposes, queues are simpler to use and more intuitive. See
threads::shared for more details.</p>

<p>Giving up control</p>

<p>There are times when you may find it useful to have a
thread explicitly give up the CPU to another thread. You may
be doing something proces- sor-intensive and want to make
sure that the user-interface thread gets called frequently.
Regardless, there are times that you might want a thread to
give up the processor.</p>

<p>Perls threading package provides the yield() function
that does this. yield() is pretty straightforward, and works
like this:</p>

<p>use threads;</p>

<p>sub loop { my $thread = shift; my $foo = 50;
while($foo--) { print &quot;in thread $thread0 }
threads-&gt;yield; $foo = 50; while($foo--) { print &quot;in
thread $thread0 } }</p>

<p>my $thread1 = threads-&gt;new(loop, first); my $thread2
= threads-&gt;new(loop, second); my $thread3 =
threads-&gt;new(loop, third);</p>

<p>It is important to remember that yield() is only a hint
to give up the CPU, it depends on your hardware, OS and
threading libraries what actu- ally happens. On many
operating systems, yield() is a no-op. There- fore it is
important to note that one should not build the scheduling
of the threads around yield() calls. It might work on your
platform but it wont work on another platform.</p>

<p>General Thread Utility Routines We ve covered the
workhorse parts of Perls threading package, and with these
tools you should be well on your way to writing threaded
code and packages. There are a few useful little pieces that
didnt really fit in anyplace else.</p>

<p>What Thread Am I In?</p>

<p>The &quot;threads-&gt;self&quot; class method provides
your program with a way to get an object representing the
thread its currently in. You can use this object in the same
way as the ones returned from thread creation.</p>

<p>Thread IDs</p>

<p>tid() is a thread object method that returns the thread
ID of the thread the object represents. Thread IDs are
integers, with the main thread in a program being 0.
Currently Perl assigns a unique tid to every thread ever
created in your program, assigning the first thread to be
created a tid of 1, and increasing the tid by 1 for each new
thread thats created.</p>

<p>Are These Threads The Same?</p>

<p>The equal() method takes two thread objects and returns
true if the objects represent the same thread, and false if
they dont.</p>

<p>Thread objects also have an overloaded == comparison so
that you can do comparison on them as you would with normal
objects.</p>

<p>What Threads Are Running?</p>

<p>&quot;threads-&gt;list&quot; returns a list of thread
objects, one for each thread thats currently running and not
detached. Handy for a number of things, including cleaning
up at the end of your program:</p>

<p># Loop through all the threads foreach $thr
(threads-&gt;list) { # Dont join the main thread or
ourselves if ($thr-&gt;tid &amp;&amp; !threads::equal($thr,
threads-&gt;self)) { $thr-&gt;join; } }</p>

<p>If some threads have not finished running when the main
Perl thread ends, Perl will warn you about it and die, since
it is impossible for Perl to clean up itself while other
threads are running</p>

<p>A Complete Example Confused yet? Its time for an example
program to show some of the things we ve covered. This
program finds prime numbers using threads.</p>

<p>1 #!/usr/bin/perl -w 2 # prime-pthread, courtesy of Tom
Christiansen 3 4 use strict; 5 6 use threads; 7 use
Thread::Queue; 8 9 my $stream = new Thread::Queue; 10 my
$kid = new threads(check_num, $stream, 2); 11 12 for my $i (
3 .. 1000 ) { 13 $stream-&gt;enqueue($i); 14 } 15 16
$stream-&gt;enqueue(undef); 17 $kid-&gt;join; 18 19 sub
check_num { 20 my ($upstream, $cur_prime) = @_; 21 my $kid;
22 my $downstream = new Thread::Queue; 23 while (my $num =
$upstream-&gt;dequeue) { 24 next unless $num % $cur_prime;
25 if ($kid) { 26 $downstream-&gt;enqueue($num); 27 } else {
28 print &quot;Found prime $num0; 29 $kid = new
threads(check_num, $downstream, $num); 30 } 31 } 32
$downstream-&gt;enqueue(undef) if $kid; 33 $kid-&gt;join if
$kid; 34 }</p>

<p>This program uses the pipeline model to generate prime
numbers. Each thread in the pipeline has an input queue that
feeds numbers to be checked, a prime number that its
responsible for, and an output queue into which it funnels
numbers that have failed the check. If the thread has a
number thats failed its check and theres no child thread,
then the thread must have found a new prime number. In that
case, a new child thread is created for that prime and stuck
on the end of the pipeline.</p>

<p>This probably sounds a bit more confusing than it really
is, so lets go through this program piece by piece and see
what it does. (For those of you who might be trying to
remember exactly what a prime num- ber is, its a number
thats only evenly divisible by itself and 1)</p>

<p>The bulk of the work is done by the check_num()
subroutine, which takes a reference to its input queue and a
prime number that its responsible for. After pulling in the
input queue and the prime that the subrou- tine s checking
(line 20), we create a new queue (line 22) and reserve a
scalar for the thread that were likely to create later (line
21).</p>

<p>The while loop from lines 23 to line 31 grabs a scalar
off the input queue and checks against the prime this thread
is responsible for. Line 24 checks to see if theres a
remainder when we modulo the number to be checked against
our prime. If there is one, the number must not be evenly
divisible by our prime, so we need to either pass it on to
the next thread if weve created one (line 26) or create a
new thread if we havent.</p>

<p>The new thread creation is line 29. We pass on to it a
reference to the queue weve created, and the prime number
weve found.</p>

<p>Finally, once the loop terminates (because we got a 0 or
undef in the queue, which serves as a note to die), we pass
on the notice to our child and wait for it to exit if we ve
created a child (lines 32 and 37).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back in the main thread, we create a queue
(line 9) and the initial child thread (line 10), and
pre-seed it with the first prime: 2. Then we queue all the
numbers from 3 to 1000 for checking (lines 12-14), then
queue a die notice (line 16) and wait for the first child
thread to terminate (line 17). Because a child wont die
until its child has died, we know that were done once we
return from the join.</p>

<p>That s how it works. Its pretty simple; as with many
Perl programs, the explanation is much longer than the
program.</p>

<p>Different implementations of threads Some background on
thread implementations from the operating system viewpoint.
There are three basic categories of threads: user-mode
threads, kernel threads, and multiprocessor kernel
threads.</p>

<p>User-mode threads are threads that live entirely within
a program and its libraries. In this model, the OS knows
nothing about threads. As far as its concerned, your process
is just a process.</p>

<p>This is the easiest way to implement threads, and the
way most OSes start. The big disadvantage is that, since the
OS knows nothing about threads, if one thread blocks they
all do. Typical blocking activities include most system
calls, most I/O, and things like sleep().</p>

<p>Kernel threads are the next step in thread evolution.
The OS knows about kernel threads, and makes allowances for
them. The main differ- ence between a kernel thread and a
user-mode thread is blocking. With kernel threads, things
that block a single thread don t block other threads. This
is not the case with user-mode threads, where the kernel
blocks at the process level and not the thread level.</p>

<p>This is a big step forward, and can give a threaded
program quite a performance boost over non-threaded
programs. Threads that block per- forming I/O, for example,
won t block threads that are doing other things. Each
process still has only one thread running at once, though,
regardless of how many CPUs a system might have.</p>

<p>Since kernel threading can interrupt a thread at any
time, they will uncover some of the implicit locking
assumptions you may make in your program. For example,
something as simple as &quot;$a = $a + 2&quot; can behave
unpredictably with kernel threads if $a is visible to other
threads, as another thread may have changed $a between the
time it was fetched on the right hand side and the time the
new value is stored.</p>

<p>Multiprocessor kernel threads are the final step in
thread support. With multiprocessor kernel threads on a
machine with multiple CPUs, the OS may schedule two or more
threads to run simultaneously on different CPUs.</p>

<p>This can give a serious performance boost to your
threaded program, since more than one thread will be
executing at the same time. As a tradeoff, though, any of
those nagging synchronization issues that might not have
shown with basic kernel threads will appear with a
vengeance.</p>

<p>In addition to the different levels of OS involvement in
threads, dif- ferent OSes (and different thread
implementations for a particular OS) allocate CPU cycles to
threads in different ways.</p>

<p>Cooperative multitasking systems have running threads
give up control if one of two things happen. If a thread
calls a yield function, it gives up control. It also gives
up control if the thread does some- thing that would cause
it to block, such as perform I/O. In a cooperative
multitasking implementation, one thread can starve all the
others for CPU time if it so chooses.</p>

<p>Preemptive multitasking systems interrupt threads at
regular intervals while the system decides which thread
should run next. In a preemptive multitasking system, one
thread usually won t monopolize the CPU.</p>

<p>On some systems, there can be cooperative and preemptive
threads run- ning simultaneously. (Threads running with
realtime priorities often behave cooperatively, for example,
while threads running at normal pri- orities behave
preemptively.)</p>

<p>Most modern operating systems support preemptive
multitasking nowadays.</p>

<p>Performance considerations The main thing to bear in
mind when comparing ithreads to other thread- ing models is
the fact that for each new thread created, a complete copy
of all the variables and data of the parent thread has to be
taken. Thus thread creation can be quite expensive, both in
terms of memory usage and time spent in creation. The ideal
way to reduce these costs is to have a relatively short
number of long-lived threads, all created fairly early on -
before the base thread has accumulated too much data. Of
course, this may not always be possible, so compromises have
to be made. However, after a thread has been created, its
perfor- mance and extra memory usage should be little
different than ordinary code.</p>

<p>Also note that under the current implementation, shared
variables use a little more memory and are a little slower
than ordinary variables.</p>

<p>Process-scope Changes Note that while threads themselves
are separate execution threads and Perl data is
thread-private unless explicitly shared, the threads can
affect process-scope state, affecting all the threads.</p>

<p>The most common example of this is changing the current
working direc- tory using chdir(). One thread calls chdir(),
and the working direc- tory of all the threads changes.</p>

<p>Even more drastic example of a process-scope change is
chroot(): the root directory of all the threads changes, and
no thread can undo it (as opposed to chdir()).</p>

<p>Further examples of process-scope changes include
umask() and changing uids/gids.</p>

<p>Thinking of mixing fork() and threads? Please lie down
and wait until the feeling passes. Be aware that the
semantics of fork() vary between platforms. For example,
some UNIX systems copy all the current threads into the
child process, while others only copy the thread that called
fork(). You have been warned!</p>

<p>Similarly, mixing signals and threads should not be
attempted. Imple- mentations are platform-dependent, and
even the POSIX semantics may not be what you expect (and
Perl doesnt even give you the full POSIX API).</p>

<p>Thread-Safety of System Libraries Whether various
library calls are thread-safe is outside the control of
Perl. Calls often suffering from not being thread-safe
include: local- time(), gmtime(),
get{gr,host,net,proto,serv,pw}*(), readdir(), rand(), and
srand() -- in general, calls that depend on some global
external state.</p>

<p>If the system Perl is compiled in has thread-safe
variants of such calls, they will be used. Beyond that, Perl
is at the mercy of the thread-safety or -unsafety of the
calls. Please consult your C library call documentation.</p>

<p>On some platforms the thread-safe library interfaces may
fail if the result buffer is too small (for example the user
group databases may be rather large, and the reentrant
interfaces may have to carry around a full snapshot of those
databases). Perl will start with a small buffer, but keep
retrying and growing the result buffer until the result
fits. If this limitless growing sounds bad for security or
mem- ory consumption reasons you can recompile Perl with
PERL_REENTRANT_MAX- SIZE defined to the maximum number of
bytes you will allow.</p>

<p>Conclusion A complete thread tutorial could fill a book
(and has, many times), but with what weve covered in this
introduction, you should be well on your way to becoming a
threaded Perl expert.</p>
