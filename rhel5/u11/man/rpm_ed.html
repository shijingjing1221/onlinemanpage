<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>NAME ed, red - text editor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ed [-] [-Gs] [-p string] [file]</p>

<p>red [-] [-Gs] [-p string] [file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ed is a line-oriented text editor. It is
used to create, display, mod- ify and otherwise manipulate
text files. red is a restricted ed: it can only edit files
in the current directory and cannot execute shell
commands.</p>

<p>If invoked with a file argument, then a copy of file is
read into the editors buffer. Changes are made to this copy
and not directly to file itself. Upon quitting ed, any
changes not explicitly saved with a w_command are lost.</p>

<p>Editing is done in two distinct modes: command and
input. When first invoked, ed is in command mode. In this
mode commands are read from the standard input and executed
to manipulate the contents of the edi- tor buffer. A typical
command might look like:</p>

<p>,s/old/new/g</p>

<p>which replaces all occurences of the string old with
new.</p>

<p>When an input command, such as a_ (append), i_ (insert)
or c_ (change), is given, ed enters input mode. This is the
primary means of adding text to a file. In this mode, no
commands are available; instead, the standard input is
written directly to the editor buffer. Lines consist of text
up to and including a newline character. Input mode is
terminated by entering a single period (.) on a line.</p>

<p>All ed commands operate on whole lines or ranges of
lines; e.g., the d_command deletes lines; the m_command
moves lines, and so on. It is possible to modify only a
portion of a line by means of replacement, as in the example
above. However even here, the s_command is applied to whole
lines at a time.</p>

<p>In general, ed commands consist of zero or more line
addresses, fol- lowed by a single character command and
possibly additional parameters; i.e., commands have the
structure:</p>

<p>[address [,address]]command[parameters]</p>

<p>The address(es) indicate the line or range of lines to
be affected by the command. If fewer addresses are given
than the command accepts, then default addresses are
supplied.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -G Forces backwards compatibility. Affects the
commands G, V, f, l, m, t, and !!.</p>

<p>-s Suppresses diagnostics. This should be used if eds
standard input is from a script.</p>

<p>-p string Specifies a command prompt. This may be
toggled on and off with the P_command.</p>

<p>file Specifies the name of a file to read. If file is
prefixed with a bang (!), then it is interpreted as a shell
command. In this case, what is read is the standard output
of file executed via sh(1). To read a file whose name begins
with a bang, prefix the name with a backslash (. The default
filename is set to file only if it is not prefixed with a
bang.</p>

<p>LINE ADDRESSING An address represents the number of a
line in the buffer. ed maintains a current address which is
typically supplied to commands as the default address when
none is specified. When a file is first read, the current
address is set to the last line of the file. In general, the
current address is set to the last line affected by a
command.</p>

<p>A line address is constructed from one of the bases in
the list below, optionally followed by a numeric offset. The
offset may include any combination of digits, operators
(i.e., +, - and ^) and whitespace. Addresses are read from
left to right, and their values are computed relative to the
current address.</p>

<p>One exception to the rule that addresses represent line
numbers is the address 0 (zero). This means &quot;before the
first line,&quot; and is legal wherever it makes sense.</p>

<p>An address range is two addresses separated either by a
comma or semi- colon. The value of the first address in a
range cannot exceed the value of the the second. If only one
address is given in a range, then the second address is set
to the given address. If an n-tuple of addresses is given
where n &gt; 2, then the corresponding range is deter- mined
by the last two addresses in the n-tuple. If only one
address is expected, then the last address is used.</p>

<p>Each address in a comma-delimited range is interpreted
relative to the current address. In a semicolon-delimited
range, the first address is used to set the current address,
and the second address is interpreted relative to the
first.</p>

<p>The following address symbols are recognized.</p>

<p>. The current line (address) in the buffer.</p>

<p>$ The last line in the buffer.</p>

<p>n The nth, line in the buffer where n is a number in the
range [0,$].</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>^ The previous line. This is equivalent to -1 and may be
repeated with cumulative effect.</p>

<p>-n</p>

<p>^n The nth previous line, where n is a non-negative
number.</p>

<p>+ The next line. This is equivalent to +1 and may be
repeated with cumulative effect.</p>

<p>+n</p>

<p>whitespace n The nth next line, where n is a
non-negative number. Whites- pace followed by a number n is
interpreted as +n.</p>

<p>,</p>

<p>% The first through last lines in the buffer. This is
equivalent to the address range 1,$.</p>

<p>; The current through last lines in the buffer. This is
equiva- lent to the address range .,$.</p>

<p>/re/ The next line containing the regular expression re.
The search wraps to the beginning of the buffer and
continues down to the current line, if necessary. // repeats
the last search.</p>

<p>?re? The previous line containing the regular expression
re. The search wraps to the end of the buffer and continues
up to the current line, if necessary. ?? repeats the last
search.</p>

<p>&acute;lc The line previously marked by a k_(mark)
command, where lc is a lower case letter.</p>

<p>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS Regular expressions are patterns
used in selecting text. For example, the ed command</p>

<p>g/string/</p>

<p>prints all lines containing string. Regular expressions
are also used by the _s_ command for selecting old text to
be replaced with new.</p>

<p>In addition to a specifying string literals, regular
expressions can represent classes of strings. Strings thus
represented are said to be matched by the corresponding
regular expression. If it is possible for a regular
expression to match several strings in a line, then the
left- most longest match is the one selected.</p>

<p>The following symbols are used in constructing regular
expressions:</p>

<p>c Any character c not listed below, including {, }, (,
), &lt; and &gt;, matches itself.</p>

<p>c A backslash-escaped character c other than {, }, (, ),
&lt;, &gt;, b, B, w, W, +, and ? matches itself.</p>

<p>Matches any single character.</p>

<p>[char-class] Matches any single character in char-class.
To include a ] in char-class, it must be the first
character. A range of characters may be specified by
separating the end characters of the range with a -, e.g.,
a-z specifies the lower case characters. The following
literal expressions can also be used in char-class to
specify sets of characters:</p>

<p>[:alnum:] [:cntrl:] [:lower:] [:space:] [:alpha:]
[:digit:] [:print:] [:upper:] [:blank:] [:graph:] [:punct:]
[:xdigit:]</p>

<p>If - appears as the first or last character of
char-class, then it matches itself. All other characters in
char-class match themselves.</p>

<p>Patterns in char-class of the form:</p>

<p>[.col-elm.] or, [=col-elm=]</p>

<p>where col-elm is a collating element are interpreted
according to locale(5) (not currently supported). See
regex(3) for an explanation of these constructs.</p>

<p>[^char-class] Matches any single character, other than
newline, not in char- class. char-class is defined as
above.</p>

<p>^ If ^ is the first character of a regular expression,
then it anchors the regular expression to the beginning of a
line. Otherwise, it matches itself.</p>

<p>$ If $ is the last character of a regular expression, it
anchors the regular expression to the end of a line. Other-
wise, it matches itself.</p>

<p>re Defines a (possibly null) subexpression re.
Subexpressions may be nested. A subsequent backreference of
the form n, where n is a number in the range [1,9], expands
to the text matched by the nth subexpression. For example,
the regular expression &#729;c1 matches the string abcabc,
but not abcadc . Subexpressions are ordered relative to
their left delimiter.</p>

<p>* Matches the single character regular expression or
subexpres- sion immediately preceding it zero or more times.
If * is the first character of a regular expression or
subexpression, then it matches itself. The * operator
sometimes yields unexpected results. For example, the
regular expression b* matches the beginning of the string
abbb , as opposed to the substring bbb, since a null match
is the only left-most match.</p>

<p>n,m n, n Matches the single character regular expression
or subexpres- sion immediately preceding it at least n and
at most m times. If m is omitted, then it matches at least n
times. If the comma is also omitted, then it matches exactly
n times. If any of these forms occurs first in a regular
expression or subexpression, then it is interpreted
literally (i.e., the reg- ular expression 2 matches the
string {2}, and so on).</p>

<p>&lt; &gt; Anchors the single character regular
expression or subexpres- sion immediately following it to
the beginning (&lt;) or ending (&gt;) of a word, i.e., in
ASCII, a maximal string of alphanu- meric characters,
including the underscore (_).</p>

<p>The following extended operators are preceded by a
backslash ( to distinguish them from traditional ed
syntax.</p>

<p>Unconditionally matches the beginning () or ending () of
a line.</p>

<p>subexpression immediately preceding it. For example, the
regu- lar expression a[bd] ac . If or subexpression, then it
matches a literal ?.</p>

<p>+ Matches the single character regular expression or
subexpres- sion immediately preceding it one or more times.
So the regu- lar expression a+ is shorthand for aa* . If +
occurs at the beginning of a regular expression or
subexpression, then it matches a literal +.</p>

<p>Matches the beginning or ending (null string) of a word.
Thus e l the regular expression l o&lt;hello&gt;. However,
whereas &lt;&gt; is not.</p>

<p>0 Matches (a null string) inside a word.</p>

<p>0 Matches any character in a word.</p>

<p>W Matches any character not in a word.</p>

<p>COMMANDS All ed commands are single characters, though
some require additonal parameters. If a commands parameters
extend over several lines, then each line except for the
last must be terminated with a backslash (.</p>

<p>In general, at most one command is allowed per line.
However, most commands accept a print suffix, which is any
of p_(print), l_(list) , or n_(enumerate), to print the last
line affected by the command.</p>

<p>An interrupt (typically ^C) has the effect of aborting
the current com- mand and returning the editor to command
mode.</p>

<p>ed recognizes the following commands. The commands are
shown together with the default address or address range
supplied if none is specified (in parenthesis).</p>

<p>(.)a Appends text to the buffer after the addressed
line, which may be the address 0 (zero). Text is entered in
input mode. The current address is set to last line
entered.</p>

<p>(.,.)c Changes lines in the buffer. The addressed lines
are deleted from the buffer, and text is appended in their
place. Text is entered in input mode. The current address is
set to last line entered.</p>

<p>(.,.)d Deletes the addressed lines from the buffer. If
there is a line after the deleted range, then the current
address is set to this line. Otherwise the current address
is set to the line before the deleted range.</p>

<p>e file Edits file, and sets the default filename. If
file is not specified, then the default filename is used.
Any lines in the buffer are deleted before the new file is
read. The cur- rent address is set to the last line
read.</p>

<p>e !command Edits the standard output of _!command_, (see
!command below). The default filename is unchanged. Any
lines in the buffer are deleted before the output of command
is read. The current address is set to the last line
read.</p>

<p>E file Edits file unconditionally. This is similar to
the e command, except that unwritten changes are discarded
without warning. The current address is set to the last line
read.</p>

<p>f file Sets the default filename to file. If file is not
specified, then the default unescaped filename is
printed.</p>

<p>(1,$)g/re/command-list Applies command-list to each of
the addressed lines matching a regular expression re. The
current address is set to the line currently matched before
command-list is executed. At the end of the _g_command, the
current address is set to the last line affected by
command-list.</p>

<p>Each command in command-list must be on a separate line,
and every line except for the last must be terminated by a
back- slash (. Any commands are allowed, except for g, _ G,
v, and _V_. A newline alone in command-list is equivalent to
a p_command.</p>

<p>(1,$)G/re/ Interactively edits the addressed lines
matching a regular expression re. For each matching line,
the line is printed, the current address is set, and the
user is prompted to enter a command-list. At the end of the
G_command, the current address is set to the last line
affected by (the last) command- list.</p>

<p>The format of command-list is the same as that of the
g_com- mand. A newline alone acts as a null command list. A
single &amp; repeats the last non-null command list.</p>

<p>H Toggles the printing of error explanations. By
default, expla- nations are not printed. It is recommended
that ed scripts begin with this command to aid in
debugging.</p>

<p>h Prints an explanation of the last error.</p>

<p>(.)i Inserts text in the buffer before the current line.
Text is entered in input mode. The current address is set to
the last line entered.</p>

<p>(.,.+1)j Joins the addressed lines. The addressed lines
are deleted from the buffer and replaced by a single line
containing their joined text. The current address is set to
the resultant line.</p>

<p>(.)klc Marks a line with a lower case letter lc. The
line can then be addressed as _lc (i.e., a single quote
followed by lc ) in subsequent commands. The mark is not
cleared until the line is deleted or otherwise modified.</p>

<p>(.,.)l Prints the addressed lines unambiguously. If
invoked from a terminal, ed pauses at the end of each page
until a newline is entered. The current address is set to
the last line printed.</p>

<p>(.,.)m(.) Moves lines in the buffer. The addressed lines
are moved to after the right-hand destination address, which
may be the address 0 (zero). The current address is set to
the last line moved.</p>

<p>(.,.)n Prints the addressed lines along with their line
numbers. The current address is set to the last line
printed.</p>

<p>(.,.)p Prints the addressed lines. If invoked from a
terminal, ed pauses at the end of each page until a newline
is entered. The current address is set to the last line
printed.</p>

<p>P Toggles the command prompt on and off. Unless a prompt
was specified by with command-line option -p string, the
command prompt is by default turned off.</p>

<p>q Quits ed.</p>

<p>Q Quits ed unconditionally. This is similar to the q
command, except that unwritten changes are discarded without
warning.</p>

<p>($)r file Reads file to after the addressed line. If
file is not speci- fied, then the default filename is used.
If there was no default filename prior to the command, then
the default file- name is set to file. Otherwise, the
default filename is unchanged. The current address is set to
the last line read.</p>

<p>($)r !command Reads to after the addressed line the
standard output of !com- mand, (see the !command below). The
default filename is unchanged. The current address is set to
the last line read.</p>

<p>(.,.)s/re/replacement/ (.,.)s/re/replacement/g
(.,.)s/re/replacement/n Replaces text in the addressed lines
matching a regular expres- sion re with replacement. By
default, only the first match in each line is replaced. If
the _g_ (global) suffix is given, then every match to be
replaced. The n_suffix, where n is a postive number, causes
only the nth match to be replaced. It is an error if no
substitutions are performed on any of the addressed lines.
The current address is set the last line affected.</p>

<p>re and replacement may be delimited by any character
other than space and newline (see the s_command below). If
one or two of the last delimiters is omitted, then the last
line affected is printed as though the print suffix _p_ were
specified.</p>

<p>An unescaped &amp; in replacement is replaced by the
currently matched text. The character sequence m, where m is
a number in the range [1,9], is replaced by the mth
backreference expression of the matched text. If replacement
consists of a single % , then replacement from the last
substitution is used. Newlines may be embedded in
replacement if they are escaped with a backslash (.</p>

<p>(.,.)s Repeats the last substitution. This form of the
s_command accepts a count suffix n, or any combination of
the charac- ters r, g, and p. If a count suffix n_is given,
then only the nth match is replaced. The _r_ suffix causes
the reg- ular expression of the last search to be used
instead of the that of the last substitution. The _g_ suffix
toggles the global suffix of the last substitution. The p_
suffix toggles the print suffix of the last substitution The
current address is set to the last line affected.</p>

<p>(.,.)t(.) Copies (i.e., transfers) the addressed lines
to after the right-hand destination address, which may be
the address 0 (zero). The current address is set to the last
line copied.</p>

<p>u Undoes the last command and restores the current
address to what it was before the command. The global
commands g, G, v, and V. are treated as a single command by
undo. u_is its own inverse.</p>

<p>(1,$)v/re/command-list Applies command-list to each of
the addressed lines not match- ing a regular expression re.
This is similar to the g_com- mand.</p>

<p>(1,$)V/re/ Interactively edits the addressed lines not
matching a regular expression re. This is similar to the G_
command.</p>

<p>(1,$)w file Writes the addressed lines to file. Any
previous contents of file is lost without warning. If there
is no default filename, then the default filename is set to
file, otherwise it is unchanged. If no filename is
specified, then the default file- name is used. The current
address is unchanged.</p>

<p>(1,$)wq file Writes the addressed lines to file, and
then executes a q_ command.</p>

<p>(1,$)w !command Writes the addressed lines to the
standard input of !command, (see the !command below). The
default filename and current address are unchanged.</p>

<p>(1,$)W file Appends the addressed lines to the end of
file. This is simi- lar to the w_command, expect that the
previous contents of file is not clobbered. The current
address is unchanged.</p>

<p>(.)x Copies (puts) the contents of the cut buffer to
after the addressed line. The current address is set to the
last line copied.</p>

<p>(.,.)y Copies (yanks) the addressed lines to the cut
buffer. The cut buffer is overwritten by subsequent y, s, j,
_d_, or c_ commands. The current address is unchanged.</p>

<p>(.+1)zn Scrolls n lines at a time starting at addressed
line. If n is not specified, then the current window size is
used. The cur- rent address is set to the last line
printed.</p>

<p>!command Executes command via sh(1). If the first
character of command is !, then it is replaced by text of
the previous _ !command. ed does not process command for
backslash ( escapes. How- ever, an unescaped _%_ is replaced
by the default filename. When the shell returns from
execution, a ! is printed to the standard output. The
current line is unchanged.</p>

<p>(.,.)# Begins a comment; the rest of the line, up to a
newline, is ignored. If a line address followed by a
semicolon is given, then the current address is set to that
address. Otherwise, the current address is unchanged.</p>

<p>($)= Prints the line number of the addressed line.</p>

<p>(.+1)newline Prints the addressed line, and sets the
current address to that line.</p>

<p>FILES /tmp/ed.* Buffer file ed.hup The file to which ed
attempts to write the buffer if the terminal hangs up.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO vi(1), sed(1), regex(3), sh(1).</p>

<p>USD:12-13</p>

<p>B. W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger, Software Tools in
Pascal , Addison- Wesley, 1981.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS ed processes file arguments for backslash
escapes, i.e., in a file- name, any characters preceded by a
backslash ( are interpreted liter- ally.</p>

<p>If a text (non-binary) file is not terminated by a
newline character, then ed appends one on reading/writing
it. In the case of a binary file, ed does not append a
newline on reading/writing.</p>

<p>per line overhead: 4 ints</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS When an error occurs, if eds input is from a
regular file or here doc- ument, then it exits, otherwise it
prints a ? and returns to command mode. An explanation of
the last error can be printed with the h_ (help)
command.</p>

<p>Attempting to quit ed or edit another file before
writing a modified buffer results in an error. If the
command is entered a second time, it succeeds, but any
changes to the buffer are lost.</p>

<p>ed exits with 0 if no errors occurred; otherwise
&gt;0.</p>
