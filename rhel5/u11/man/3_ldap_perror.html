<p>LDAP_ERROR(3) LDAP_ERROR(3)</p>

<p>NAME ldap_perror, ld_errno, ldap_result2error,
ldap_errlist, ldap_err2string - LDAP protocol error handling
routines</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ldap.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *ldap_err2string( int err );</p>

<p>void ldap_perror( LDAP *ld, const char *s )</p>

<p>int ldap_result2error( LDAP *ld, LDAPMessage *res, int
freeit )</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These routines provide interpretation of the
various error codes returned by the LDAP protocol and LDAP
library routines or associated with an LDAP session. The
error code associated with an LDAP session is accessible
using ldap_get_option(3) and ldap_set_option(3) with the
LDAP_OPT_RESULT_CODE option (previously called
LDAP_OPT_ERROR_NUMBER).</p>

<p>The ldap_result2error() routine takes res, a result as
produced by ldap_result(3) or ldap_search_s(3), and returns
the corresponding error code. Possible error codes are
listed below. If the freeit parameter is non zero it
indicates that the res parameter should be freed by a call
to ldap_msgfree(3) after the error code has been extracted.
The ld_errno field in ld is set and returned.</p>

<p>The returned value can be passed to ldap_err2string() to
get a text description of the message. The string returned
from ldap_err2string() is a pointer to a static area that
should not be modified.</p>

<p>The ldap_perror() routine can be called to print an
indication of the error on standard error, similar to the
way perror(3) works.</p>

<p>ERRORS The possible values for an ldap error code
are:</p>

<p>LDAP_SUCCESS The request was successful.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPERATIONS_ERROR An operations error occurred.</p>

<p>LDAP_PROTOCOL_ERROR A protocol violation was
detected.</p>

<p>LDAP_TIMELIMIT_EXCEEDED An LDAP time limit was
exceeded.</p>

<p>LDAP_SIZELIMIT_EXCEEDED An LDAP size limit was
exceeded.</p>

<p>LDAP_COMPARE_FALSE A compare operation returned
false.</p>

<p>LDAP_COMPARE_TRUE A compare operation returned true.</p>

<p>LDAP_STRONG_AUTH_NOT_SUPPORTED The LDAP server does not
support strong authentica- tion.</p>

<p>LDAP_STRONG_AUTH_REQUIRED Strong authentication is
required for the opera- tion.</p>

<p>LDAP_PARTIAL_RESULTS Partial results only returned.</p>

<p>LDAP_NO_SUCH_ATTRIBUTE The attribute type specified does
not exist in the entry.</p>

<p>LDAP_UNDEFINED_TYPE The attribute type specified is
invalid.</p>

<p>LDAP_INAPPROPRIATE_MATCHING Filter type not supported
for the specified attribute.</p>

<p>LDAP_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION An attribute value specified
violates some con- straint (e.g., a postalAddress has too
many lines, or a line that is too long).</p>

<p>LDAP_TYPE_OR_VALUE_EXISTS An attribute type or attribute
value specified already exists in the entry.</p>

<p>LDAP_INVALID_SYNTAX An invalid attribute value was
specified.</p>

<p>LDAP_NO_SUCH_OBJECT The specified object does not exist
in The Direc- tory.</p>

<p>LDAP_ALIAS_PROBLEM An alias in The Directory points to a
nonexistent entry.</p>

<p>LDAP_INVALID_DN_SYNTAX A syntactically invalid DN was
specified.</p>

<p>LDAP_IS_LEAF The object specified is a leaf.</p>

<p>LDAP_ALIAS_DEREF_PROBLEM A problem was encountered when
dereferencing an alias.</p>

<p>LDAP_INAPPROPRIATE_AUTH Inappropriate authentication was
specified (e.g., LDAP_AUTH_SIMPLE was specified and the
entry does not have a userPassword attribute).</p>

<p>LDAP_INVALID_CREDENTIALS Invalid credentials were
presented (e.g., the wrong password).</p>

<p>LDAP_INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS The user has insufficient
access to perform the operation.</p>

<p>LDAP_BUSY The DSA is busy.</p>

<p>LDAP_UNAVAILABLE The DSA is unavailable.</p>

<p>LDAP_UNWILLING_TO_PERFORM The DSA is unwilling to
perform the operation.</p>

<p>LDAP_LOOP_DETECT A loop was detected.</p>

<p>LDAP_NAMING_VIOLATION A naming violation occurred.</p>

<p>LDAP_OBJECT_CLASS_VIOLATION An object class violation
occurred (e.g., a &quot;must&quot; attribute was missing
from the entry).</p>

<p>LDAP_NOT_ALLOWED_ON_NONLEAF The operation is not allowed
on a nonleaf object.</p>

<p>LDAP_NOT_ALLOWED_ON_RDN The operation is not allowed on
an RDN.</p>

<p>LDAP_ALREADY_EXISTS The entry already exists.</p>

<p>LDAP_NO_OBJECT_CLASS_MODS Object class modifications are
not allowed.</p>

<p>LDAP_OTHER An unknown error occurred.</p>

<p>LDAP_SERVER_DOWN The LDAP library cant contact the LDAP
server.</p>

<p>LDAP_LOCAL_ERROR Some local error occurred. This is
usually a failed dynamic memory allocation.</p>

<p>LDAP_ENCODING_ERROR An error was encountered encoding
parameters to send to the LDAP server.</p>

<p>LDAP_DECODING_ERROR An error was encountered decoding a
result from the LDAP server.</p>

<p>LDAP_TIMEOUT A timelimit was exceeded while waiting for
a result.</p>

<p>LDAP_AUTH_UNKNOWN The authentication method specified to
ldap_bind() is not known.</p>

<p>LDAP_FILTER_ERROR An invalid filter was supplied to
ldap_search() (e.g., unbalanced parentheses).</p>

<p>LDAP_PARAM_ERROR An ldap routine was called with a bad
parameter.</p>

<p>LDAP_NO_MEMORY An memory allocation (e.g., malloc(3) or
other dynamic memory allocator) call failed in an ldap
library routine.</p>
