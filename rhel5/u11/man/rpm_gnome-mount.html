<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) gnome-mount(1)
gnome-mount(1)</p>

<p>NAME gnome-mount - Mount drives and volumes using HAL
and read settings from the GNOME desktop configuration
system gconf.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gnome-mount [-?|--help] [-v] [-n] [-t] [-b] [-d
/dev/file | -h /org/fd/Hal/udi | -p nickname] [--unmount |
--eject | --write-settings | --erase-settings |
--show-settings] [--mount-point where-to-mount]
[--mount-options opt1,opt2=foo,opt3] [--extra-mount-options
opt4,opt5=bar] [--fstype fstype-to-use]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is used to mount and unmount
file systems for GNOME desk- top users. It can also be used
to eject discs from CD drives and other devices that needs
to be ejected. For example, iPods needs this to make the
&quot;Do not disconnect&quot; message go away.</p>

<p>Normally, this program is invoked by software in the
GNOME stack (specifically gnome-vfs-daemon and
gnome-volume-manager ). End users should never have to deal
with gnome-mount directly on the command line, nor should
they have to read this manual page.</p>

<p>Mounting a file system into the root file system
involves a certain degree of configuration and as such is
subject to whatever preferences an user might have.
gnome-mount allows the user to control the mount point
location, the mount options and what file system to use for
mounting a file system. The settings are read from the gconf
database (which is per-user) and can also be overridden on
the command line using the appropriate parameters. See
below.</p>

<p>SPECIFYING THE TARGET The target (e.g. the partition or
file system to mount, unmount or eject) can be specified
using the HAL UDI (Unique Device Identifier), e.g.
/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/volume_uuid_E18B_10EC , the
name of the special device file, e.g. /dev/sda1 or a
pseudonym. The latter is a textual string used to locate the
target and it makes gnome-mount search for the target by
comparing the given textual string to the mount points and
file system labels.</p>

<p>DETERMINING SETTINGS Settings (e.g. mount point, mount
options, file system type) are read in the order below. Note
that each option is treated individually; for example it is
valid for a drive to only specify the mount point setting
and not the mount options. Also note that the even if the
drive speci- fies mount options, these can be overridden on
a per-volume basis.</p>

<p>FILE SYSTEM DEFAULTS First, default mount options are
read from /system/stor- age/defaults/FS_TYPE/ for the probed
file system type of the volume. The option uid=, is treated
specially by gnome-mount and will be replaced by
uid=UID_OF_USER to cope with the fact that the uid is a
function of the user calling it.</p>

<p>PER DRIVE Second, the gconf tree at
/system/storage/drives/UDI_OF_DRIVE/ is consulted for
options that depend on what drive the volume belongs to. For
example, this is useful for configuring that volumes
inserted into a given drive is always mounted at the same
location. For example, this can be used to emulate
/etc/fstab behaviour by where CD media is always mounted at
e.g. /media/cdrom</p>

<p>PER VOLUME Third, the gconf tree at
/system/storage/drives/UDI_OF_VOLUME/ is consulted for
options that are specific to a particular piece of media and
as such depends on either the file system label (e.g.
EOS_DIGITAL ) or the file system UUID (e.g. E18B_10EC ) or
both.</p>

<p>COMMANDLINE OPTIONS Users can pass --mount-point ,
--mount-options or --fstype on the commandline to override
settings.</p>

<p>EXTRA COMMANDLINE OPTIONS Finally, if mount options are
passed via --extra-mount-options these are not replacing the
mount options, they are simply added. This is useful for
doing e.g.</p>

<p>gnome-mount --extra-mount-options remount,exec -d
/dev/sda1</p>

<p>to remount a volumes such that programs can be run from
the media. This is useful for e.g. gnome-volume-manager if
it dis- covers an autorun file on the media.</p>

<p>PASSWORDED MEDIA gnome-mount supports passworded media
through the org.freedesk- top.Hal.Device.Volume.Crypto
interface supported by HAL and this includes volumes
formatted in a way that adheres to the LUKS (Linux Unified
Key Setup) specification. In addition, gnome-mount uses
gnome- keyring to retrieve and store the pass phrase. If no
key can be retrieved, gnome-mount will prompt the user for
one. In addition, if the keyring is locked, the user may be
prompted to unlock it via stan- dard gnome-keyring
mechanisms.</p>

<p>PRIVILEGES gnome-mount is intended for unprivileged
users and HAL ultimately con- trols if the calling user is
allowed to mount, unmount or eject volumes as well as what
mount options are valid. As such, requests may be denied.
See the (human readable) exception returned from HAL for
details if a request fails.</p>

<p>Note that HAL has a notion of what mount options are
valid for a given volume. They are listed in the HAL
property volume.mount.valid_options on the device object
representing the volume to mount. Consult lshal(1) for
details. Also note that HAL by default appends the options
nosuid and nodev to prevent privilege escalation.</p>

<p>In addition to using HAL as the mechanism for mounting
file systems, the /etc/fstab file is also consulted as HAL
will refuse to mount any file system listed in this file as
it would violate system policy. If this is the case,
gnome-mount will invoke mount(1) as the calling user rather
than invoking the Mount method on the org.freedesk-
top.Hal.Device.Volume interface on the device object
representing the volume / drive. This means that settings
(mount point, mount options, file system type) read by
gnome-mount are not passed along as these are already
specified in the /etc/fstab file and there are no mechanism
to override them. When parsing the /etc/fstab file,
gnome-mount (and also HAL for that matter) resolves symbolic
links and also respects the LABEL= and UUID= notations. For
example, if this line is in /etc/fstab</p>

<p>LABEL=MyVolume /mnt/myvolume auto user,defaults 0 0</p>

<p>then gnome-mount mounts the file system with the label
MyVolume via mount(1) and /etc/fstab rather than using the
HAL mechanisms.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Options available for the gnome-mount
command:</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Verbose operation, shows debug
messages.</p>

<p>-n, --no-ui Don t show any dialogs the user needs to
dismiss. If X11 is available, gnome-mount may pop up
transient notification bubbles e.g. suggesting the user to
remount a volume with different options to streamline access
to file systems with ownership attributes. This is the
option that storage policy daemons such as
gnome-volume-manager should invoke gnome-mount in. File man-
agers, however, such as Nautilus , should never use this
option as the user should get e.g. an error dialog if he
tries to access a volume with a missing, unsupported or
unknown file sys- tem.</p>

<p>-b, --block Allow gnome-mount to block even if an error
occured. By default, gnome-mount will daemonize so it can
return control to the invoking application as soon as
possible (e.g. when an operation either fails or succeeds )
while still showing an error dialog to the end user. Useful
when debugging.</p>

<p>-u, --unmount Use this for unmounting rather than
mounting. If gnome-mount is invoked as gnome-umount (a
symlink to gnome-mount ) then this option is automatically
selected.</p>

<p>-e, --eject Use this for ejecting rather than mounting.
If gnome-mount is invoked as gnome-eject (a symlink to
gnome-mount ) then this option is automatically
selected.</p>

<p>-d, --device Specify target volume by the special device
file.</p>

<p>-h, --hal-udi Specify target volume by HAL UDI (Unique
Device Identifier).</p>

<p>-p, --pseudonym Specify target volume by pseudonym. See
above for how this works.</p>

<p>-t, --text Never use X11 dialogs or notification bubbles
even if an X11 server is available. Also prohibits the use
of gnome-keyring to retrieve pass phrases for passworded
media because this might require unlocking the keyring which
happens through an X11 dia- log out of process. Useful for
command line operation.</p>

<p>-m, --mount-point Specify mount point to use; dont
include /media as this is automatically appened by the
mechanism used to mount, e.g. the HAL methods.</p>

<p>-o, --mount-options Specify mount options. Separate by
comma.</p>

<p>-f, --fstype Specify file system type. This is useful
for using e.g. the msdos file system instead of the vfat
file system.</p>

<p>--write-settings Instead of mounting a drive, specify
what options to store in the gconf database. Can be used on
both drives and volumes. Be careful using this with the
--device option as optical drives (among others) use the
same special device file for both the drive and the volume.
One trick is to ensure the optical drive has no media when
configuring it via this option. Another pos- sibility is to
use the HAL UDI instead.</p>

<p>--display-settings Display settings for a drive or
volume.</p>

<p>--erase-settings Erase settings for a drive or
volume.</p>

<p>RETURN CODES gnome-mount will return zero if the request
succeeded or non-zero if it failed. Note that gnome-mount is
specifically designed to run in a graphical user environment
and as such all error reporting (and resolu- tion) is
through X11 dialogs. For example, if HAL reports that a
volume could not be mounted because of a missing file system
driver, gnome- mount might, one day, launch a tool to ask
the user if he wants to download and install the driver. In
a similar way, all error dialogs are presented via X11
dialogs to the user as well.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE We want to make sure that the discs inserted
into an optical drive are always mounted at
/media/cdrecorder instead of using the default which is
using the label specified in the iso9660 or udf file system
header. Assuming that the drive is empty and the special
device file for the drive is /dev/hdc the following command
will work</p>

<p>gnome-mount --write-settings --device /dev/hdc
--mount-point cdrecorder</p>

<p>This can be inspected via the --display-settings option
and the set- tings can also be erased via the
--erase-settings option. Also note that gconf-editor(1) can
be used for tasks like these.</p>

<p>HARDWARE THAT CANNOT BE POLLED HAL polls most storage
devices for media insertion / removal and main- tains the
list of devices exported. However, some hardware cannot be
polled for media changes without making noise or for other
reasons. PC floppy drives, Zip drives connected through an
IDE interface and broken optical drives falls into this
category.</p>

<p>For such hardware HAL only exports the drive and rather
than exporting volume as childs of the drive, the
org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.Volume interface is exported on
the drive itself. gnome-mount supports this but it means
that it is impossible to know ahead of time what file sys-
tem is on the media in the problematic drive, so in this
case gnome- mount passes auto as the file system type and
passes the mount options uid=UID_OF_USER as most media in
such devices are formatted with either the vfat , udf or
iso9660 file systems.</p>

<p>This also means that per-volume settings are not
possible; one can only specify settings per-drive.</p>
