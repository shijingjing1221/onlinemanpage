<p>RENAMEAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual RENAMEAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME renameat - rename a file relative to directory file
descriptors</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int renameat(int olddirfd, const char *oldpath, int
newdirfd, const char *newpath);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The renameat() system call operates in
exactly the same way as rename(2), except for the
differences described in this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in oldpath is relative, then it is
interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor olddirfd (rather than relative to the
current working directory of the calling process, as is done
by rename(2) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in oldpath is relative and
olddirfd is the spe- cial value AT_FDCWD, then oldpath is
interpreted relative to the cur- rent working directory of
the calling process (like rename(2)).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in oldpath is absolute, then
olddirfd is ignored.</p>

<p>The interpretation of newpath is as for oldpath, except
that a relative pathname is interpreted relative to the
directory referred to by the file descriptor newdirfd.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, renameat() returns 0. On error,
-1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for rename(2) can also
occur for renameat(). The following additional errors can
occur for renameat():</p>

<p>EBADF olddirfd or newdirfd is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR oldpath is a relative path and olddirfd is a
file descriptor referring to a file other than a directory;
or similar for new- path and newdirfd</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
renameat().</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is non-standard but is
proposed for inclusion in a future revision of POSIX.1.</p>

<p>VERSIONS renameat() was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16.</p>
