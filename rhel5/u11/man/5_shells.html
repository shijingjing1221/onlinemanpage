<p>NAME shells - pathnames of valid login shells</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION /etc/shells is a text file which contains
the full pathnames of valid login shells. This file is
consulted by chsh(1) and available to be queried by other
programs.</p>

<p>Be aware that there are programs which consult this file
to find out if a user is a normal user. E.g.: ftp daemons
traditionally disallow access to users with shells not
included in this file.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE /etc/shells may contain the following paths:</p>

<p>/bin/sh /bin/csh</p>

<p>FILES /etc/shells</p>

<p>SEE ALSO chsh(1), getusershell(3)</p>
