<p>NAME filterdiff - extract or exclude diffs from a diff
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS filterdiff [-i PATTERN] [-p n] [--strip=n]
[--addprefix=PREFIX] [-x PATTERN] [--verbose] [-v] [-z] [[-#
RANGE] [--hunks=RANGE]] [--lines=RANGE] [--files=RANGE]
[--annotate] [--format=FORMAT] [--as-numbered-lines=WHEN]
[--remove-timestamps] [file...]</p>

<p>filterdiff {[--help] [--version] [--list] [--grep
...]}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION You can use filterdiff to obtain a patch
that applies to files matching the shell wildcard PATTERN
from a larger collection of patches. For example, to see the
patches in patch-2.4.3.gz that apply to all files called
lp.c:</p>

<p>filterdiff -z -i */lp.c patch-2.4.3.gz</p>

<p>If neither -i nor -x options are given, -i * is assumed.
This way filterdiff can be used to clean up an existing diff
file, removing redundant lines from the beginning (eg. the
text from the mail body) or between the chunks (eg. in CVS
diffs). To extract pure patch data, use a command like
this:</p>

<p>filterdiff message-with-diff-in-the-body &gt; patch</p>

<p>Note that the interpretation of the shell wildcard
pattern does not count slash characters or periods as
special (in other words, no flags are given to fnmatch).
This is so that */basename -type patterns can be given
without limiting the number of pathname components.</p>

<p>You can use both unified and context format diffs with
this program.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -i PATTERN Include only files matching PATTERN.
All other lines in the input are suppressed.</p>

<p>-x PATTERN Exclude files matching PATTERN. All other
lines in the input are displayed.</p>

<p>-p n When matching, ignore the first n components of the
pathname.</p>

<p>-# RANGE | --hunks=RANGE Only include hunks within the
specified RANGE. Hunks are numbered from 1, and the range is
a comma-separated list of numbers or first-last spans;
either the first or the last in the span may be omitted to
indicate no limit in that direction.</p>

<p>--lines=RANGE Only include hunks that contain lines from
the original file that lie within the specified RANGE. Lines
are numbered from 1, and the range is a comma-separated list
of numbers or first-last spans; either the first or the last
in the span may be omitted to indicate no limit in that
direction.</p>

<p>--files=RANGE Only include files indicated by the
specified RANGE. Files are numbered from 1 in the order they
appear in the patch input, and the range is a
comma-separated list of numbers or first-last spans; either
the first or the last in the span may be omitted to indicate
no limit in that direction.</p>

<p>--annotate Annotate each hunk with the filename and hunk
number.</p>

<p>--format=unified|context Use specified output
format.</p>

<p>--strip=n Remove the first n components of pathnames in
the output.</p>

<p>--addprefix=PREFIX Prefix pathnames in the output by
PREFIX.</p>

<p>--as-numbered-lines=before|after Instead of a patch
fragment, display the lines of the selected hunks with the
line number of the file before (or after) the patch is
applied, followed by a TAB character and a colon, at the
beginning of each line. Each hunk except the first will have
a line consisting of ... before it.</p>

<p>--remove-timestamps Do not include file timestamps in
the output.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Always show non-diff lines in the output.
By default, non-diff lines are only shown when excluding a
filename pattern.</p>

<p>-z Decompress files with extensions .gz and .bz2.</p>

<p>--help Display a short usage message.</p>

<p>--version Display the version number of filterdiff.</p>

<p>--list Behave like lsdiff(1) instead.</p>

<p>--grep Behave like grepdiff(1) instead.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To see all patch hunks that affect the first
five lines of a C file:</p>

<p>filterdiff -i *.c --lines=-5 &lt; patch</p>

<p>To see the first hunk of each file patch, use:</p>

<p>filterdiff -#1 patchfile</p>

<p>To see patches modifying a ChangeLog file in a
subdirectory, use:</p>

<p>filterdiff -p1 Changelog</p>

<p>To see the complete patches for each patch that modifies
line 1 of the original file, use:</p>

<p>filterdiff --lines=1 patchfile | lsdiff | xargs -rn1
filterdiff patchfile -i</p>

<p>To see all but the first hunk of a particular patch, you
might use:</p>

<p>filterdiff -p1 -i file.c -#2- foo-patch</p>

<p>If you have a very specific list of hunks in a patch
that you want to see, list them:</p>

<p>filterdiff -#1,2,5-8,10,12,27-</p>

<p>To see the lines of the files that would be patched as
they will appear after the patch is applied, use:</p>

<p>filterdiff --as-numbered-lines=after patch.file</p>

<p>You can see the same context before the patch is applied
with:</p>

<p>filterdiff --as-numbered-lines=before patch.file</p>

<p>Filterdiff can also be used to convert between unified
and context format diffs:</p>

<p>filterdiff -v --format=unified context.diff</p>

<p>SEE ALSO lsdiff(1), grepdiff(1)</p>
