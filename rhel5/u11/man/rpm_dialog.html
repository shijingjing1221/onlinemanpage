<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) DIALOG(1)
DIALOG(1)</p>

<p>NAME dialog - display dialog boxes from shell
scripts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dialog --clear dialog --create-rc file dialog
--print-maxsize dialog common-options box-options</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Dialog is a program that will let you to
present a variety of questions or display messages using
dialog boxes from a shell script. These types of dialog
boxes are implemented (though not all are necessarily
compiled into dialog):</p>

<p>calendar, checklist, form, fselect, gauge, infobox,
inputbox, inputmenu, menu, msgbox (message), password,
pause, radiolist, tailbox, tailboxbg, textbox, timebox, and
yesno (yes/no).</p>

<p>You can put more than one dialog box into a script:</p>

<p>- Use the &quot;--and-widget&quot; token to force Dialog
to proceed to the next dialog unless you have pressed ESC to
cancel, or</p>

<p>- Simply add the tokens for the next dialog box, making
a chain. Dialog stops chaining when the return code from a
dialog is nonzero, e.g., Cancel or No (see DIAGNOSTICS).</p>

<p>Some widgets, e.g., checklist, will write text to
dialogs output. Normally that is the standard error, but
there are options for changing this:
&quot;--output-fd&quot;, &quot;--stderr&quot; and
&quot;--stdout&quot;. No text is written if the Cancel
button (or ESC) is pressed; dialog exits immediately in that
case.</p>

<p>OPTIONS All options begin with &quot;--&quot; (two ASCII
hyphens, for the benefit of those using systems with
deranged locale support).</p>

<p>A &quot;--&quot; by itself is used as an escape, i.e.,
the next token on the com- mand-line is not treated as an
option. dialog --title -- --Not an option</p>

<p>The &quot;--args&quot; option tells dialog to list the
command-line parameters to the standard error. This is
useful when debugging complex scripts using the
&quot;--&quot; and &quot;--file&quot;, since the
command-line may be rewritten as these are expanded.</p>

<p>The &quot;--file&quot; option tells dialog to read
parameters from the file named as its value. dialog --file
parameterfile Blanks not within double-quotes are discarded
(use backslashes to quote single characters). The result is
inserted into the command-line, replacing &quot;--file&quot;
and its option value. Interpretation of the com- mand-line
resumes from that point.</p>

<p>Common Options --aspect ratio This gives you some
control over the box dimensions when using auto sizing
(specifying 0 for height and width). It represents width /
height. The default is 9, which means 9 characters wide to
every 1 line high.</p>

<p>--backtitle backtitle Specifies a backtitle string to be
displayed on the backdrop, at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>--begin y x Specify the position of the upper left
corner of a dialog box on the screen.</p>

<p>--cancel-label string Override the label used for
&quot;Cancel&quot; buttons.</p>

<p>--clear Clears the widget screen, keeping only the
screen_color back- ground. Use this when you combine widgets
with &quot;--and-widget&quot; to erase the contents of a
previous widget on the screen, so it won t be seen under the
contents of a following widget. Under- stand this as the
complement of &quot;--keep-window&quot;. To compare the
effects, use these:</p>

<p>All three widgets visible, staircase effect, ordered
1,2,3: dialog --begin 2 2 --yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0
--and-widget --begin 4 4 --yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0
--and-widget --begin 6 6 --yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0</p>

<p>Only the last widget is left visible: dialog --clear
--begin 2 2 --yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --clear
--begin 4 4 --yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --begin 6
6 --yesno &quot;&quot; 0 0</p>

<p>All three widgets visible, staircase effect, ordered
3,2,1: dialog --keep-window --begin 2 2 --yesno &quot;&quot;
0 0 --and-widget --keep-window --begin 4 4 --yesno
&quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --begin 6 6 --yesno
&quot;&quot; 0 0</p>

<p>First and third widget visible, staircase effect,
ordered 3,1: dialog --keep-window --begin 2 2 --yesno
&quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --clear --begin 4 4 --yesno
&quot;&quot; 0 0 --and-widget --begin 6 6 --yesno
&quot;&quot; 0 0</p>

<p>Note, if you want to restore original console colors and
send your cursor home after the dialog program has exited,
use the clear (1) command.</p>

<p>--colors Interpret embedded &quot; sequences in the
dialog text by the following character, which tells dialog
to set colors or video attributes: 0 through 7 are the ANSI
used in curses: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta,
cyan and white respectively. Bold is set by b, reset by B.
Reverse is set by r, reset by R. Underline is set by u,
reset by U . The settings are cumulative, e.g., &quot;&quot;
makes thered.followingRestoretextnormalbold (perhapright)
settings with &quot;&quot;. --cr-wrap Interpret embedded
newlines in the dialog text as a newline on the screen.
Otherwise, dialog will only wrap lines where needed to fit
inside the text box. Even though you can control line breaks
with this, dialog will still wrap any lines that are too
long for the width of the box. Without cr-wrap, the layout
of your text may be formatted to look nice in the source
code of your script without affecting the way it will look
in the dia- log.</p>

<p>See also the &quot;--no-collapse&quot; and
&quot;--trim&quot; options.</p>

<p>--create-rc file When dialog supports run-time
configuration, this can be used to dump a sample
configuration file to the file specified by file.</p>

<p>--defaultno Make the default value of the yes/no box a
No. Likewise, make the default button of widgets that
provide &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; a Cancel. If
&quot;--nocancel&quot; or &quot;--visit-items&quot; are
given those options overrides this, making the default
button always &quot;Yes&quot; (internally the same as
&quot;OK&quot;).</p>

<p>--default-item string Set the default item in a
checklist, form or menu box. Normally the first item in the
box is the default.</p>

<p>--exit-label string Override the label used for
&quot;EXIT&quot; buttons.</p>

<p>--extra-button Show an extra button, between
&quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons.</p>

<p>--extra-label string Override the label used for
&quot;Extra&quot; buttons. Note: for input- menu widgets,
this defaults to &quot;Rename&quot;.</p>

<p>--help Prints the help message to dialogs output. The
help message is printed if no options are given.</p>

<p>--help-button Show a help-button after &quot;OK&quot;
and &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons, i.e., in checklist,
radiolist and menu boxes. If &quot;--item-help&quot; is also
given, on exit the return status will be the same as for the
&quot;OK&quot; button, and the item-help text will be
written to dialogs output after the token &quot;HELP&quot;.
Otherwise, the return status will indicate that the Help
button was pressed, and no message printed.</p>

<p>--help-label string Override the label used for
&quot;Help&quot; buttons.</p>

<p>--help-status If the help-button is selected, writes the
checklist, radiolist or form information after the item-help
&quot;HELP&quot; information. This can be used to
reconstruct the state of a checklist after processing the
help request.</p>

<p>--ignore Ignore options that dialog does not recognize.
Some well-known ones such as &quot;--icon&quot; are ignored
anyway, but this is a better choice for compatibility with
other implementations.</p>

<p>--input-fd fd Read keyboard input from the given file
descriptor. Most dialog scripts read from the standard
input, but the gauge widget reads a pipe (which is always
standard input). Some configurations do not work properly
when dialog tries to reopen the terminal. Use this option
(with appropriate juggling of file-descriptors) if your
script must work in that type of environment.</p>

<p>--insecure Makes the password widget friendlier but less
secure, by echoing asterisks for each character.</p>

<p>--item-help Interpret the tags data for checklist,
radiolist and menu boxes adding a column which is displayed
in the bottom line of the screen, for the currently selected
item.</p>

<p>--keep-window Normally when dialog performs several
tailboxbg widgets con- nected by &quot;--and-widget&quot;,
it clears the old widget from the screen by painting over
it. Use this option to suppress that repainting.</p>

<p>At exit, dialog repaints all of the widgets which have
been marked with &quot;--keep-window&quot;, even if they are
not tailboxbg wid- gets. That causes them to be repainted in
reverse order. See the discussion of the &quot;--clear&quot;
option for examples.</p>

<p>--max-input size Limit input strings to the given size.
If not specified, the limit is 2048.</p>

<p>--no-cancel</p>

<p>--nocancel Suppress the &quot;Cancel&quot; button in
checklist, inputbox and menu box modes. A script can still
test if the user pressed the ESC key to cancel to quit.</p>

<p>--no-collapse Normally dialog converts tabs to spaces
and reduces multiple spaces to a single space for text which
is displayed in a mes- sage boxes, etc. Use this option to
disable that feature. Note that dialog will still wrap text,
subject to the &quot;--cr-wrap&quot; and &quot;--trim&quot;
options.</p>

<p>--no-kill Tells dialog to put the tailboxbg box in the
background, print- ing its process id to dialogs output.
SIGHUP is disabled for the background process.</p>

<p>--no-label string Override the label used for
&quot;No&quot; buttons.</p>

<p>--no-shadow Suppress shadows that would be drawn to the
right and bottom of each dialog box.</p>

<p>--ok-label string Override the label used for
&quot;OK&quot; buttons.</p>

<p>--output-fd fd Direct output to the given file
descriptor. Most dialog scripts write to the standard error,
but error messages may also be written there, depending on
your script.</p>

<p>--print-maxsize Print the maximum size of dialog boxes,
i.e., the screen size, to dialog s output. This may be used
alone, without other options.</p>

<p>--print-size Prints the size of each dialog box to
dialog s output.</p>

<p>--print-version Prints dialog s version to dialogs
output. This may be used alone, without other options.</p>

<p>--separate-output For checklist widgets, output result
one line at a time, with no quoting. This facilitates
parsing by another program.</p>

<p>--separator string</p>

<p>--separate-widget string Specify a string that will
separate the output on dialogs out- put from each widget.
This is used to simplify parsing the result of a dialog with
several widgets. If this option is not given, the default
separator string is a tab character.</p>

<p>--shadow Draw a shadow to the right and bottom of each
dialog box.</p>

<p>--single-quoted Use single-quoting as needed (and no
quotes if unneeded) for the output of checklist s as well as
the item-help text. If this option is not set, dialog uses
double quotes around each item. That requires occasional use
of backslashes to make the output useful in shell
scripts.</p>

<p>--size-err Check the resulting size of a dialog box
before trying to use it, printing the resulting size if it
is larger than the screen. (This option is obsolete, since
all new-window calls are checked).</p>

<p>--sleep secs Sleep (delay) for the given number of
seconds after processing a dialog box.</p>

<p>--stderr Direct output to the standard error. This is
the default, since curses normally writes screen updates to
the standard output.</p>

<p>--stdout Direct output to the standard output. This
option is provided for compatibility with Xdialog, however
using it in portable scripts is not recommended, since
curses normally writes its screen updates to the standard
output. If you use this option, dialog attempts to reopen
the terminal so it can write to the display. Depending on
the platform and your environment, that may fail.</p>

<p>--tab-correct Convert each tab character to one or more
spaces. Otherwise, tabs are rendered according to the curses
librarys interpreta- tion.</p>

<p>--tab-len n Specify the number of spaces that a tab
character occupies if the &quot;--tab-correct&quot; option
is given. The default is 8.</p>

<p>--timeout secs Timeout (exit with error code) if no user
response within the given number of seconds. This is
overridden if the background &quot;--tailboxbg is used. A
timeout of zero seconds is ignored.</p>

<p>--title title Specifies a title string to be displayed
at the top of the dia- log box.</p>

<p>--trim eliminate leading blanks, trim literal newlines
and repeated blanks from message text.</p>

<p>See also the &quot;--cr-wrap&quot; and
&quot;--no-collapse&quot; options.</p>

<p>--version Same as &quot;--print-version&quot;.</p>

<p>--visit-items Modify the tab-traversal of checklist,
radiobox, menubox and inputmenu to include the list of items
as one of the states. This is useful as a visual aid, i.e.,
the cursor position helps some users.</p>

<p>When this option is given, the cursor is initially
placed on the list. Abbreviations (the first letter of the
tag) apply to the list items. If you tab to the button row,
abbreviations apply to the buttons.</p>

<p>--yes-label string Override the label used for
&quot;Yes&quot; buttons.</p>

<p>Box Options All dialog boxes have at least three
parameters:</p>

<p>text the caption or contents of the box.</p>

<p>height the height of the dialog box.</p>

<p>width the width of the dialog box.</p>

<p>Other parameters depend on the box type.</p>

<p>--calendar text height width day month year A calendar
box displays month, day and year in separately adjustable
windows. If the values for day, month or year are missing or
negative, the current date s corresponding values are used.
You can increment or decrement any of those using the left-,
up-, right- and down-arrows. Use vi-style h, j, k and l for
moving around the array of days in a month. Use tab or
backtab to move between windows. If the year is given as
zero, the current date is used as an initial value.</p>

<p>On exit, the date is printed in the form
day/month/year.</p>

<p>--checklist text height width list-height [ tag item
status ] ... A checklist box is similar to a menu box; there
are multiple entries presented in the form of a menu.
Instead of choosing one entry among the entries, each entry
can be turned on or off by the user. The initial on/off
state of each entry is speci- fied by status.</p>

<p>On exit, a list of the tag strings of those entries that
are turned on will be printed on dialogs output. If the
&quot;--sepa- rate-output&quot; option is not given, the
strings will be quoted to make it simple for scripts to
separate them. See the &quot;--single- quoted&quot; option,
which modifies the quoting behavior.</p>

<p>--form text height width formheight [ label y x item y x
flen ilen ] ... The form dialog displays a form consisting
of labels and fields, which are positioned on a scrollable
window by coordinates given in the script. The field length
flen and input-length ilen tell how long the field can be.
The former defines the length shown for a selected field,
while the latter defines the permissible length of the data
entered in the field.</p>

<p>- If flen is zero, the corresponding field cannot be
altered. and the contents of the field determine the
displayed-length.</p>

<p>- If flen is negative, the corresponding field cannot be
altered, and the negated value of flen is used as the dis-
played-length.</p>

<p>- If ilen is zero, it is set to flen.</p>

<p>Use up/down arrows (or control/N, control/P) to move
between fields. Use tab to move between windows.</p>

<p>On exit, the contents of the form-fields are written to
dialogs output, each field separated by a newline. The text
used to fill non-editable fields (flen is zero or negative)
is not writ- ten out.</p>

<p>--fselect filepath height width The file-selection
dialog displays a text-entry window in which you can type a
filename (or directory), and above that two win- dows with
directory names and filenames.</p>

<p>Here filepath can be a filepath in which case the file
and directory windows will display the contents of the path
and the text-entry window will contain the preselected
filename.</p>

<p>Use tab or arrow keys to move between the windows.
Within the directory or filename windows, use the up/down
arrow keys to scroll the current selection. Use the
space-bar to copy the current selection into the text-entry
window.</p>

<p>Typing any printable characters switches focus to the
text-entry window, entering that character as well as
scrolling the direc- tory and filename windows to the
closest match.</p>

<p>Use a carriage return or the &quot;OK&quot; button to
accept the current value in the text-entry window and
exit.</p>

<p>On exit, the contents of the text-entry window are
written to dialogs output.</p>

<p>--gauge text height width [percent] A gauge box displays
a meter along the bottom of the box. The meter indicates the
percentage. New percentages are read from standard input,
one integer per line. The meter is updated to reflect each
new percentage. If the standard input reads the string
&quot;XXX&quot;, then subsequent lines up to another
&quot;XXX&quot; are used for a new prompt. The gauge exits
when EOF is reached on the standard input.</p>

<p>The percent value denotes the initial percentage shown
in the meter. If not specified, it is zero.</p>

<p>On exit, no text is written to dialogs output. The
widget accepts no input, so the exit status is always
OK.</p>

<p>--infobox text height width An info box is basically a
message box. However, in this case, dialog will exit
immediately after displaying the message to the user. The
screen is not cleared when dialog exits, so that the message
will remain on the screen until the calling shell script
clears it later. This is useful when you want to inform the
user that some operations are carrying on that may require
some time to finish.</p>

<p>On exit, no text is written to dialog s output. Only an
&quot;OK&quot; button is provided for input, but an ESC exit
status may be returned.</p>

<p>--inputbox text height width [init] An input box is
useful when you want to ask questions that require the user
to input a string as the answer. If init is supplied it is
used to initialize the input string. When enter- ing the
string, the backspace, delete and cursor keys can be used to
correct typing errors. If the input string is longer than
can fit in the dialog box, the input field will be
scrolled.</p>

<p>On exit, the input string will be printed on dialog s
output.</p>

<p>--inputmenu text height width menu-height [ tag item ]
... An inputmenu box is very similar to an ordinary menu
box. There are only a few differences between them:</p>

<p>1. The entries are not automatically centered but left
adjusted.</p>

<p>2. An extra button (called Rename) is implied to rename
the current item when it is pressed.</p>

<p>3. It is possible to rename the current entry by
pressing the Rename button. Then dialog will write the
following on dia- logs output.</p>

<p>RENAMED &lt;tag&gt; &lt;item&gt;</p>

<p>--menu text height width menu-height [ tag item ] ... As
its name suggests, a menu box is a dialog box that can be
used to present a list of choices in the form of a menu for
the user to choose. Choices are displayed in the order
given. Each menu entry consists of a tag string and an item
string. The tag gives the entry a name to distinguish it
from the other entries in the menu. The item is a short
description of the option that the entry represents. The
user can move between the menu entries by pressing the
cursor keys, the first letter of the tag as a hot-key, or
the number keys 1-9. There are menu-height entries displayed
in the menu at one time, but the menu will be scrolled if
there are more entries than that.</p>

<p>On exit the tag of the chosen menu entry will be printed
on dia- logs output. If the &quot;--help-button&quot; option
is given, the cor- responding help text will be printed if
the user selects the help button.</p>

<p>--msgbox text height width A message box is very similar
to a yes/no box. The only differ- ence between a message box
and a yes/no box is that a message box has only a single OK
button. You can use this dialog box to display any message
you like. After reading the message, the user can press the
ENTER key so that dialog will exit and the calling shell
script can continue its operation.</p>

<p>On exit, no text is written to dialogs output. Only an
&quot;OK&quot; button is provided for input, but an ESC exit
status may be returned.</p>

<p>--pause text height width seconds A pause box displays a
meter along the bottom of the box. The meter indicates how
many seconds remain until the end of the pause. The pause
exits when timeout is reached (status OK) or the user
presses the Exit button (status CANCEL).</p>

<p>--passwordbox text height width [init] A password box is
similar to an input box, except that the text the user
enters is not displayed. This is useful when prompting for
passwords or other sensitive information. Be aware that if
anything is passed in &quot;init&quot;, it will be visible
in the systems process table to casual snoopers. Also, it is
very confusing to the user to provide them with a default
password they cannot see. For these reasons, using
&quot;init&quot; is highly discouraged. See
&quot;--insecure&quot; if you do not care about your
password.</p>

<p>On exit, the input string will be printed on dialog s
output.</p>

<p>--radiolist text height width list-height [ tag item
status ] ... A radiolist box is similar to a menu box. The
only difference is that you can indicate which entry is
currently selected, by setting its status to on.</p>

<p>On exit, the name of the selected item is written to
dialogs output.</p>

<p>--tailbox file height width Display text from a file in
a dialog box, as in a &quot;tail -f&quot; com- mand. Scroll
left/right using vi-style h and l , or arrow- keys. A 0
resets the scrolling.</p>

<p>On exit, no text is written to dialogs output. Only an
&quot;OK&quot; button is provided for input, but an ESC exit
status may be returned.</p>

<p>--tailboxbg file height width Display text from a file
in a dialog box as a background task, as in a &quot;tail -f
&amp;&quot; command. Scroll left/right using vi-style h and
l, or arrow-keys. A 0 resets the scrolling.</p>

<p>Dialog treats the background task specially if there are
other widgets (--and-widget) on the screen concurrently.
Until those widgets are closed (e.g., an &quot;OK&quot;),
dialog will perform all of the tailboxbg widgets in the same
process, polling for updates. You may use a tab to traverse
between the widgets on the screen, and close them
individually, e.g., by pressing ENTER. Once the
non-tailboxbg widgets are closed, dialog forks a copy of
itself into the background, and prints its process id if the
&quot;--no- kill&quot; option is given.</p>

<p>On exit, no text is written to dialog s output. Only an
&quot;EXIT&quot; button is provided for input, but an ESC
exit status may be returned.</p>

<p>NOTE: Older versions of dialog forked immediately and
attempted to update the screen individually. Besides being
bad for per- formance, it was unworkable. Some older scripts
may not work properly with the polled scheme.</p>

<p>--textbox file height width A text box lets you display
the contents of a text file in a dialog box. It is like a
simple text file viewer. The user can move through the file
by using the cursor, page-up, page-down and HOME/END keys
available on most keyboards. If the lines are too long to be
displayed in the box, the LEFT/RIGHT keys can be used to
scroll the text region horizontally. You may also use
vi-style keys h, j, k, l in place of the cursor keys, and B
or N in place of the page-up and page-down keys. Scroll
up/down using vi-style k and j, or arrow-keys. Scroll
left/right using vi-style h and l , or arrow-keys. A 0
resets the left/right scrolling. For more convenience,
vi-style forward and backward searching functions are also
provided.</p>

<p>On exit, no text is written to dialogs output. Only an
&quot;EXIT&quot; button is provided for input, but an ESC
exit status may be returned.</p>

<p>--timebox text height [width hour minute second] A
dialog is displayed which allows you to select hour, minute
and second. If the values for hour, minute or second are
miss- ing or negative, the current dates corresponding
values are used. You can increment or decrement any of those
using the left-, up-, right- and down-arrows. Use tab or
backtab to move between windows.</p>

<p>On exit, the result is printed in the form
hour:minute:second.</p>

<p>--yesno text height width A yes/no dialog box of size
height rows by width columns will be displayed. The string
specified by text is displayed inside the dialog box. If
this string is too long to fit in one line, it will be
automatically divided into multiple lines at appropriate
places. The text string can also contain the sub-string
&quot;n&quot; or newline characters n_to control line
breaking explicitly. This dialog box is useful for asking
questions that require the user to answer either yes or no.
The dialog box has a Yes but- ton and a No button, in which
the user can switch between by pressing the TAB key.</p>

<p>On exit, no text is written to dialogs output. In
addition to the &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; exit
codes (see DIAGNOSTICS) an ESC exit sta- tus may be
returned.</p>

<p>The codes used for &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;
match those used for &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot;,
internally no distinction is made.</p>

<p>Obsolete Options --beep This was used to tell the
original cdialog that it should make a beep when the
separate processes of the tailboxbg widget would repaint the
screen.</p>

<p>--beep-after Beep after a user has completed a widget by
pressing one of the buttons.</p>

<p>RUN-TIME CONFIGURATION 1. Create a sample configuration
file by typing:</p>

<p>&quot;dialog --create-rc &lt;file&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>2. At start, dialog determines the settings to use as
follows:</p>

<p>a) if environment variable DIALOGRC is set, its value
determines the name of the configuration file.</p>

<p>b) if the file in (a) is not found, use the file
$HOME/.dialogrc as the configuration file.</p>

<p>c) if the file in (b) is not found, try using the
GLOBALRC file determined at compile-time, i.e.,
/etc/dialogrc.</p>

<p>d) if the file in (c) is not found, use compiled in
defaults.</p>

<p>3. Edit the sample configuration file and copy it to
some place that dialog can find, as stated in step 2
above.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DIALOGOPTS Define this variable to apply any
of the common options to each widget. Most of the common
options are reset before processing each widget. If you set
the options in this environment variable, they are applied
to dia- logs state after the reset. As in the
&quot;--file&quot; option, double-quotes and backslashes are
interpreted.</p>

<p>The &quot;--file&quot; option is not considered a common
option (so you cannot embed it within this environment vari-
able).</p>

<p>DIALOGRC Define this variable if you want to specify the
name of the configuration file to use.</p>

<p>DIALOG_CANCEL</p>

<p>DIALOG_ERROR</p>

<p>DIALOG_ESC</p>

<p>DIALOG_EXTRA</p>

<p>DIALOG_HELP</p>

<p>DIALOG_ITEM_HELP</p>

<p>DIALOG_OK Define any of these variables to change the
exit code on Cancel (1), error (-1), ESC (255), Extra (3),
Help (2), Help with --item-help (2), or OK (0). Normally
shell scripts cannot distinguish between -1 and 255.</p>

<p>DIALOG_TTY Set this variable to &quot;1&quot; to provide
compatibility with older versions of dialog which assumed
that if the script redirects the standard output, that the
&quot;--std- out&quot; option was given.</p>

<p>FILES $HOME/.dialogrc default configuration file</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The dialog sources contain several samples of
how to use the different box options and how they look. Just
take a look into the directory samples/ of the source.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Exit status is subject to being overridden
by environment variables. Normally they are:</p>

<p>0 if dialog is exited by pressing the Yes or OK
button.</p>

<p>1 if the No or Cancel button is pressed.</p>

<p>2 if the Help button is pressed.</p>

<p>3 if the Extra button is pressed.</p>

<p>-1 if errors occur inside dialog or dialog is exited by
pressing the ESC key.</p>
