<p>NAME overview.fmt - format of news overview database</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file &lt;pathetc in
inn.conf&gt;/overview.fmt specifies the organization of the
news overview database. Blank lines and lines beginning with
a number sign (#) are ignored. The order of lines in this
file is important; it determines the order in which the
fields will appear in the database.</p>

<p>Most lines will consist of an article header name,
optionally followed by a colon. A trailing set of lines can
have the word full appear after the colon; this indicates
that the header should appear as well as its value.</p>

<p>If this file is changed, new overview records will be
constructed with the modified format. If it is desired that
existing records be updated to the new format, it is
necessary to rebuild the overview database using
makehistory(8) after removing all existing overview
files.</p>

<p>Xref:full must be included, or innd(8) and other
programs which utilize overview method cannot start.</p>

<p>The default file, show below, is compatible with Geoff
Collyers nov package:</p>

<p>Subject: From: Date: Message-ID: References: Bytes:
Lines: Xref:full</p>

<p>Usually the only modifications which should be made to
the default file are additions of new fields to the end of
the file; all such fields should have full after the colon.
The first eight fields should remain in the same order as
above.</p>
