<p>YACC(1) BSD General Commands Manual YACC(1)</p>

<p>NAME yacc - an LALR(1) parser generator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS yacc [-dlrtv] [-b file_prefix] [-o
output_filename] [-p symbol_prefix] filename</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Yacc reads the grammar specification in the
file filename and generates an LR(1) parser for it. The
parsers consist of a set of LALR(1) parsing tables and a
driver routine written in the C programming language. Yacc
normally writes the parse tables and the driver routine to
the file y.tab.c.</p>

<p>The following options are available:</p>

<p>-b file_prefix Change the prefix prepended to the output
file names to the string denoted by file_prefix. The default
prefix is the charac- ter y.</p>

<p>-d Cause the header file y.tab.h to be written.</p>

<p>-l If the -l option is not specified, yacc will insert
#line direc- tives in the generated code. The #line
directives let the C com- piler relate errors in the
generated code to the users original code. If the -l option
is specified, yacc will not insert the #line directives. Any
#line directives specified by the user will be retained.</p>

<p>-o output_filename Cause yacc to write the generated
code to output_filename instead of the default file,
y.tab.c.</p>

<p>-p symbol_prefix Change the prefix prepended to
yacc-generated symbols to the string denoted by
symbol_prefix. The default prefix is the string yy.</p>

<p>-r Cause yacc to produce separate files for code and
tables. The code file is named y.code.c, and the tables file
is named y.tab.c.</p>

<p>-t Change the preprocessor directives generated by yacc
so that debugging statements will be incorporated in the
compiled code.</p>

<p>-v Cause a human-readable description of the generated
parser to be written to the file y.output.</p>

<p>If the environment variable TMPDIR is set, the string
denoted by TMPDIR will be used as the name of the directory
where the temporary files are created.</p>

<p>FILES y.code.c y.tab.c y.tab.h y.output
/tmp/yacc.aXXXXXXXXXX /tmp/yacc.tXXXXXXXXXX
/tmp/yacc.uXXXXXXXXXX</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS If there are rules that are never reduced,
the number of such rules is reported on standard error. If
there are any LALR(1) conflicts, the num- ber of conflicts
is reported on standard error.</p>
