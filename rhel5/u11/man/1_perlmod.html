<p>NAME perlmod - Perl modules (packages and symbol
tables)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Packages</p>

<p>Perl provides a mechanism for alternative namespaces to
protect pack- ages from stomping on each others variables.
In fact, theres really no such thing as a global variable in
Perl. The package statement declares the compilation unit as
being in the given namespace. The scope of the package
declaration is from the declaration itself through the end
of the enclosing block, &quot;eval&quot;, or file, whichever
comes first (the same scope as the my() and local()
operators). Unqualified dynamic identifiers will be in this
namespace, except for those few identifiers that if
unqualified, default to the main package instead of the
current one as described below. A package statement affects
only dynamic variables--including those you ve used local()
on--but not lex- ical variables created with my(). Typically
it would be the first dec- laration in a file included by
the &quot;do&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot;
operators. You can switch into a package in more than one
place; it merely influ- ences which symbol table is used by
the compiler for the rest of that block. You can refer to
variables and filehandles in other packages by prefixing the
identifier with the package name and a double colon:
$Package::Variable. If the package name is null, the
&quot;main&quot; package is assumed. That is, $::sail is
equivalent to $main::sail.</p>

<p>The old package delimiter was a single quote, but double
colon is now the preferred delimiter, in part because its
more readable to humans, and in part because its more
readable to emacs macros. It also makes C++ programmers feel
like they know whats going on--as opposed to using the
single quote as separator, which was there to make Ada pro-
grammers feel like they knew what was going on. Because the
old-fash- ioned syntax is still supported for backwards
compatibility, if you try to use a string like &quot;This is
$owner&rsquo;s house&quot;, youll be accessing $owner::s;
that is, the $s variable in package &quot;owner&quot;, which
is proba- bly not what you meant. Use braces to
disambiguate, as in &quot;This is ${owner}&rsquo;s
house&quot;.</p>

<p>Packages may themselves contain package separators, as
in $OUTER::INNER::var. This implies nothing about the order
of name lookups, however. There are no relative packages:
all symbols are either local to the current package, or must
be fully qualified from the outer package name down. For
instance, there is nowhere within package &quot;OUTER&quot;
that $INNER::var refers to $OUTER::INNER::var.
&quot;INNER&quot; refers to a totally separate global
package.</p>

<p>Only identifiers starting with letters (or underscore)
are stored in a packages symbol table. All other symbols are
kept in package &quot;main&quot;, including all punctuation
variables, like $_. In addition, when unqualified, the
identifiers STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, ARGV, ARGVOUT, ENV, INC,
and SIG are forced to be in package &quot;main&quot;, even
when used for other purposes than their built-in ones. If
you have a package called &quot;m&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, or
&quot;y&quot;, then you cant use the qualified form of an
identi- fier because it would be instead interpreted as a
pattern match, a sub- stitution, or a transliteration.</p>

<p>Variables beginning with underscore used to be forced
into package main, but we decided it was more useful for
package writers to be able to use leading underscore to
indicate private variables and method names. However,
variables and functions named with a single &quot;_&quot;,
such as $_ and &quot;sub _&quot;, are still forced into the
package &quot;main&quot;. See also &quot;Technical Note on
the Syntax of Variable Names&quot; in perlvar.</p>

<p>&quot;eval&quot;ed strings are compiled in the package
in which the eval() was compiled. (Assignments to $SIG{},
however, assume the signal handler specified is in the
&quot;main&quot; package. Qualify the signal handler name if
you wish to have a signal handler in a package.) For an
example, exam- ine perldb.pl in the Perl library. It
initially switches to the &quot;DB&quot; package so that the
debugger doesn t interfere with variables in the program you
are trying to debug. At various points, however, it tem-
porarily switches back to the &quot;main&quot; package to
evaluate various expressions in the context of the
&quot;main&quot; package (or wherever you came from). See
perldebug.</p>

<p>The special symbol &quot;__PACKAGE__&quot; contains the
current package, but can- not (easily) be used to construct
variable names.</p>

<p>See perlsub for other scoping issues related to my() and
local(), and perlref regarding closures.</p>

<p>Symbol Tables</p>

<p>The symbol table for a package happens to be stored in
the hash of that name with two colons appended. The main
symbol tables name is thus %main::, or %:: for short.
Likewise the symbol table for the nested package mentioned
earlier is named %OUTER::INNER::.</p>

<p>The value in each entry of the hash is what you are
referring to when you use the *name typeglob notation. In
fact, the following have the same effect, though the first
is more efficient because it does the symbol table lookups
at compile time:</p>

<p>local *main::foo = *main::bar; local $main::{foo} =
$main::{bar};</p>

<p>(Be sure to note the vast difference between the second
line above and &quot;local $main::foo = $main::bar&quot;.
The former is accessing the hash %main::, which is the
symbol table of package &quot;main&quot;. The latter is
simply assigning scalar $bar in package &quot;main&quot; to
scalar $foo of the same package.)</p>

<p>You can use this to print out all the variables in a
package, for instance. The standard but antiquated
dumpvar.pl library and the CPAN module Devel::Symdump make
use of this.</p>

<p>Assignment to a typeglob performs an aliasing operation,
i.e.,</p>

<p>*dick = *richard;</p>

<p>causes variables, subroutines, formats, and file and
directory handles accessible via the identifier
&quot;richard&quot; also to be accessible via the identifier
&quot;dick&quot;. If you want to alias only a particular
variable or subroutine, assign a reference instead:</p>

<p>*dick = ichard;</p>

<p>Which makes $richard and $dick the same variable, but
leaves @richard and @dick as separate arrays. Tricky,
eh?</p>

<p>There is one subtle difference between the following
statements:</p>

<p>*foo = *bar; *foo = ar;</p>

<p>&quot;*foo = *bar&quot; makes the typeglobs themselves
synonymous while &quot;*foo = ar&quot; makes the SCALAR
portions of two distinct typeglobs refer to the same scalar
value. This means that the following code:</p>

<p>$bar = 1; *foo = ar; # Make $foo an alias for $bar</p>

<p>{ local $bar = 2; # Restrict changes to block print
$foo; # Prints 1! }</p>

<p>Would print 1, because $foo holds a reference to the
original $bar -- the one that was stuffed away by
&quot;local()&quot; and which will be restored when the
block ends. Because variables are accessed through the type-
glob, you can use &quot;*foo = *bar&quot; to create an alias
which can be local- ized. (But be aware that this means you
can t have a separate @foo and @bar, etc.)</p>

<p>What makes all of this important is that the Exporter
module uses glob aliasing as the import/export mechanism.
Whether or not you can prop- erly localize a variable that
has been exported from a module depends on how it was
exported:</p>

<p>@EXPORT = qw($FOO); # Usual form, cant be localized
@EXPORT = qw(*FOO); # Can be localized</p>

<p>You can work around the first case by using the fully
qualified name ($Package::FOO) where you need a local value,
or by overriding it by saying &quot;*FOO =
*Package::FOO&quot; in your script.</p>

<p>The &quot;*x = &quot; mechanism may be used to pass and
return cheap refer- ences into or from subroutines if you
dont want to copy the whole thing. It only works when
assigning to dynamic variables, not lexi- cals.</p>

<p>%some_hash = (); # cant be my() *some_hash = fn(
another_hash ); sub fn { local *hashsym = shift; # now use
%hashsym normally, and you # will affect the callers
%another_hash my %nhash = (); # do what you want return
nhash; }</p>

<p>On return, the reference will overwrite the hash slot in
the symbol ta- ble specified by the *some_hash typeglob.
This is a somewhat tricky way of passing around references
cheaply when you dont want to have to remember to
dereference variables explicitly.</p>

<p>Another use of symbol tables is for making
&quot;constant&quot; scalars.</p>

<p>*PI = 3.14159265358979;</p>

<p>Now you cannot alter $PI, which is probably a good thing
all in all. This isnt the same as a constant subroutine,
which is subject to opti- mization at compile-time. A
constant subroutine is one prototyped to take no arguments
and to return a constant expression. See perlsub for details
on these. The &quot;use constant&quot; pragma is a
convenient shorthand for these.</p>

<p>You can say *foo{PACKAGE} and *foo{NAME} to find out
what name and package the *foo symbol table entry comes
from. This may be useful in a subroutine that gets passed
typeglobs as arguments:</p>

<p>sub identify_typeglob { my $glob = shift; print You gave
me , *{$glob}{PACKAGE}, :: , *{$glob}{NAME}, &quot;0; }
identify_typeglob *foo; identify_typeglob *bar::baz;</p>

<p>This prints</p>

<p>You gave me main::foo You gave me bar::baz</p>

<p>The *foo{THING} notation can also be used to obtain
references to the individual elements of *foo. See
perlref.</p>

<p>Subroutine definitions (and declarations, for that
matter) need not necessarily be situated in the package
whose symbol table they occupy. You can define a subroutine
outside its package by explicitly qualify- ing the name of
the subroutine:</p>

<p>package main; sub Some_package::foo { ... } # &amp;foo
defined in Some_package</p>

<p>This is just a shorthand for a typeglob assignment at
compile time:</p>

<p>BEGIN { *Some_package::foo = sub { ... } }</p>

<p>and is not the same as writing:</p>

<p>{ package Some_package; sub foo { ... } }</p>

<p>In the first two versions, the body of the subroutine is
lexically in the main package, not in Some_package. So
something like this:</p>

<p>package main;</p>

<p>$Some_package::name = &quot;fred&quot;; $main::name =
&quot;barney&quot;;</p>

<p>sub Some_package::foo { print &quot;in &quot;,
__PACKAGE__, &quot;: ame is $name0; }</p>

<p>Some_package::foo();</p>

<p>prints:</p>

<p>in main: $name is barney</p>

<p>rather than:</p>

<p>in Some_package: $name is fred</p>

<p>This also has implications for the use of the SUPER::
qualifier (see perlobj).</p>

<p>BEGIN, CHECK, INIT and END</p>

<p>Four specially named code blocks are executed at the
beginning and at the end of a running Perl program. These
are the &quot;BEGIN&quot;, &quot;CHECK&quot;,
&quot;INIT&quot;, and &quot;END&quot; blocks.</p>

<p>These code blocks can be prefixed with &quot;sub&quot;
to give the appearance of a subroutine (although this is not
considered good style). One should note that these code
blocks dont really exist as named subroutines (despite their
appearance). The thing that gives this away is the fact that
you can have more than one of these code blocks in a
program, and they will get all executed at the appropriate
moment. So you cant execute any of these code blocks by
name.</p>

<p>A &quot;BEGIN&quot; code block is executed as soon as
possible, that is, the moment it is completely defined, even
before the rest of the containing file (or string) is
parsed. You may have multiple &quot;BEGIN&quot; blocks
within a file (or evaled string) -- they will execute in
order of def- inition. Because a &quot;BEGIN&quot; code
block executes immediately, it can pull in definitions of
subroutines and such from other files in time to be visible
to the rest of the compile and run time. Once a
&quot;BEGIN&quot; has run, it is immediately undefined and
any code it used is returned to Perls memory pool.</p>

<p>It should be noted that &quot;BEGIN&quot; code blocks
are executed inside string &quot;eval()&quot; s. The
&quot;CHECK&quot; and &quot;INIT&quot; code blocks are not
executed inside a string eval, which e.g. can be a problem
in a mod_perl environment.</p>

<p>An &quot;END&quot; code block is executed as late as
possible, that is, after perl has finished running the
program and just before the interpreter is being exited,
even if it is exiting as a result of a die() function. (But
not if its morphing into another program via
&quot;exec&quot;, or being blown out of the water by a
signal--you have to trap that yourself (if you can).) You
may have multiple &quot;END&quot; blocks within a file--they
will execute in reverse order of definition; that is: last
in, first out (LIFO). &quot;END&quot; blocks are not
executed when you run perl with the &quot;-c&quot; switch,
or if compilation fails.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;END&quot; code blocks are not executed
at the end of a string &quot;eval()&quot;: if any
&quot;END&quot; code blocks are created in a string
&quot;eval()&quot;, they will be executed just as any other
&quot;END&quot; code block of that pack- age in LIFO order
just before the interpreter is being exited.</p>

<p>Inside an &quot;END&quot; code block, $? contains the
value that the program is going to pass to
&quot;exit()&quot;. You can modify $? to change the exit
value of the program. Beware of changing $? by accident
(e.g. by running something via &quot;system&quot;).</p>

<p>&quot;CHECK&quot; and &quot;INIT&quot; code blocks are
useful to catch the transition between the compilation phase
and the execution phase of the main pro- gram.</p>

<p>&quot;CHECK&quot; code blocks are run just after the
initial Perl compile phase ends and before the run time
begins, in LIFO order. &quot;CHECK&quot; code blocks are
used in the Perl compiler suite to save the compiled state
of the program.</p>

<p>&quot;INIT&quot; blocks are run just before the Perl
runtime begins execution, in &quot;first in, first out&quot;
(FIFO) order. For example, the code generators documented in
perlcc make use of &quot;INIT&quot; blocks to initialize and
resolve pointers to XSUBs.</p>

<p>When you use the -n and -p switches to Perl,
&quot;BEGIN&quot; and &quot;END&quot; work just as they do
in awk, as a degenerate case. Both &quot;BEGIN&quot; and
&quot;CHECK&quot; blocks are run when you use the -c switch
for a compile-only syntax check, although your main code is
not.</p>

<p>The begincheck program makes it all clear,
eventually:</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/perl</p>

<p># begincheck</p>

<p>print &quot; 8. Ordinary code runs at runtime.0;</p>

<p>END { print &quot;14. So this is the end of the tale.0 }
INIT { print &quot; 5. INIT blocks run FIFO just before
runtime.0 } CHECK { print &quot; 4. So this is the fourth
line.0 }</p>

<p>print &quot; 9. It runs in order, of course.0;</p>

<p>BEGIN { print &quot; 1. BEGIN blocks run FIFO during
compilation.0 } END { print &quot;13. Read perlmod for the
rest of the story.0 } CHECK { print &quot; 3. CHECK blocks
run LIFO at compilations end.0 } INIT { print &quot; 6. Run
this again, using Perls -c switch.0 }</p>

<p>print &quot;10. This is anti-obfuscated code.0;</p>

<p>END { print &quot;12. END blocks run LIFO at quitting
time.0 } BEGIN { print &quot; 2. So this line comes out
second.0 } INIT { print &quot; 7. Youll see the difference
right away.0 }</p>

<p>print &quot;11. It merely _looks_ like it should be
confusing.0;</p>

<p>__END__</p>

<p>Perl Classes</p>

<p>There is no special class syntax in Perl, but a package
may act as a class if it provides subroutines to act as
methods. Such a package may also derive some of its methods
from another class (package) by listing the other package
name(s) in its global @ISA array (which must be a package
global, not a lexical).</p>

<p>For more on this, see perltoot and perlobj.</p>

<p>Perl Modules</p>

<p>A module is just a set of related functions in a library
file, i.e., a Perl package with the same name as the file.
It is specifically designed to be reusable by other modules
or programs. It may do this by providing a mechanism for
exporting some of its symbols into the symbol table of any
package using it, or it may function as a class definition
and make its semantics available implicitly through method
calls on the class and its objects, without explicitly
exporting any- thing. Or it can do a little of both.</p>

<p>For example, to start a traditional, non-OO module
called Some::Module, create a file called Some/Module.pm and
start with this template:</p>

<p>package Some::Module; # assumes Some/Module.pm</p>

<p>use strict; use warnings;</p>

<p>BEGIN { use Exporter (); our ($VERSION, @ISA, @EXPORT,
@EXPORT_OK, %EXPORT_TAGS);</p>

<p># set the version for version checking $VERSION = 1.00;
# if using RCS/CVS, this may be preferred $VERSION = sprintf
&quot;%d.%03d&quot;, q$Revision: 1.1 $ =~ /(+)/g;</p>

<p>@ISA = qw(Exporter); @EXPORT = qw(&amp;func1 &amp;func2
&amp;func4); %EXPORT_TAGS = ( ); # eg: TAG =&gt; [ qw!name1
name2! ],</p>

<p># your exported package globals go here, # as well as
any optionally exported functions @EXPORT_OK = qw($Var1
%Hashit &amp;func3); } our @EXPORT_OK;</p>

<p># exported package globals go here our $Var1; our
%Hashit;</p>

<p># non-exported package globals go here our @more; our
$stuff;</p>

<p># initialize package globals, first exported ones $Var1
= ; %Hashit = ();</p>

<p># then the others (which are still accessible as
$Some::Module::stuff) $stuff = ; @more = ();</p>

<p># all file-scoped lexicals must be created before # the
functions below that use them.</p>

<p># file-private lexicals go here my $priv_var = ; my
%secret_hash = ();</p>

<p># heres a file-private function as a closure, # callable
as &amp;$priv_func; it cannot be prototyped. my $priv_func =
sub { # stuff goes here. };</p>

<p># make all your functions, whether exported or not; #
remember to put something interesting in the {} stubs sub
func1 {} # no prototype sub func2() {} # protod void sub
func3($$) {} # protod to 2 scalars</p>

<p># this one isnt exported, but could be called! sub
func4() {} # protod to 1 hash ref</p>

<p>END { } # module clean-up code here (global
destructor)</p>

<p>## YOUR CODE GOES HERE</p>

<p>1; # dont forget to return a true value from the
file</p>

<p>Then go on to declare and use your variables in
functions without any qualifications. See Exporter and the
perlmodlib for details on mechan- ics and style issues in
module creation.</p>

<p>Perl modules are included into your program by
saying</p>

<p>use Module;</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>use Module LIST;</p>

<p>This is exactly equivalent to</p>

<p>BEGIN { require Module; import Module; }</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>BEGIN { require Module; import Module LIST; }</p>

<p>As a special case</p>

<p>use Module ();</p>

<p>is exactly equivalent to</p>

<p>BEGIN { require Module; }</p>

<p>All Perl module files have the extension .pm. The
&quot;use&quot; operator assumes this so you dont have to
spell out &quot;Module.pm&quot; in quotes. This also helps
to differentiate new modules from old .pl and .ph files.
Module names are also capitalized unless they re functioning
as pragmas; pragmas are in effect compiler directives, and
are sometimes called &quot;pragmatic modules&quot; (or even
&quot;pragmata&quot; if youre a classicist).</p>

<p>The two statements:</p>

<p>require SomeModule; require
&quot;SomeModule.pm&quot;;</p>

<p>differ from each other in two ways. In the first case,
any double colons in the module name, such as
&quot;Some::Module&quot;, are translated into your system s
directory separator, usually &quot;/&quot;. The second case
does not, and would have to be specified literally. The
other difference is that seeing the first
&quot;require&quot; clues in the compiler that uses of
indirect object notation involving &quot;SomeModule&quot;,
as in &quot;$ob = purge SomeModule&quot;, are method calls,
not function calls. (Yes, this really can make a
difference.)</p>

<p>Because the &quot;use&quot; statement implies a
&quot;BEGIN&quot; block, the importing of semantics happens
as soon as the &quot;use&quot; statement is compiled, before
the rest of the file is compiled. This is how it is able to
function as a pragma mechanism, and also how modules are
able to declare subrou- tines that are then visible as list
or unary operators for the rest of the current file. This
will not work if you use &quot;require&quot; instead of
&quot;use&quot;. With &quot;require&quot; you can get into
this problem:</p>

<p>require Cwd; # make Cwd:: accessible $here =
Cwd::getcwd();</p>

<p>use Cwd; # import names from Cwd:: $here = getcwd();</p>

<p>require Cwd; # make Cwd:: accessible $here = getcwd(); #
oops! no main::getcwd()</p>

<p>In general, &quot;use Module ()&quot; is recommended
over &quot;require Module&quot;, because it determines
module availability at compile time, not in the middle of
your programs execution. An exception would be if two mod-
ules each tried to &quot;use&quot; each other, and each also
called a function from that other module. In that case, it s
easy to use &quot;require&quot; instead.</p>

<p>Perl packages may be nested inside other package names,
so we can have package names containing &quot;::&quot;. But
if we used that package name directly as a filename it would
make for unwieldy or impossible file- names on some systems.
Therefore, if a modules name is, say,
&quot;Text::Soundex&quot;, then its definition is actually
found in the library file Text/Soundex.pm.</p>

<p>Perl modules always have a .pm file, but there may also
be dynamically linked executables (often ending in .so) or
autoloaded subroutine defi- nitions (often ending in .al)
associated with the module. If so, these will be entirely
transparent to the user of the module. It is the
responsibility of the .pm file to load (or arrange to
autoload) any additional functionality. For example,
although the POSIX module hap- pens to do both dynamic
loading and autoloading, the user can say just &quot;use
POSIX&quot; to get it all.</p>

<p>Making your module threadsafe</p>

<p>Since 5.6.0, Perl has had support for a new type of
threads called interpreter threads (ithreads). These threads
can be used explicitly and implicitly.</p>

<p>Ithreads work by cloning the data tree so that no data
is shared between different threads. These threads can be
used by using the &quot;threads&quot; module or by doing
fork() on win32 (fake fork() support). When a thread is
cloned all Perl data is cloned, however non-Perl data cannot
be cloned automatically. Perl after 5.7.2 has support for
the &quot;CLONE&quot; special subroutine. In
&quot;CLONE&quot; you can do whatever you need to do, like
for example handle the cloning of non-Perl data, if
necessary. &quot;CLONE&quot; will be called once as a class
method for every package that has it defined (or inherits
it). It will be called in the context of the new thread, so
all modifications are made in the new area. Cur- rently
CLONE is called with no parameters other than the invocant
pack- age name, but code should not assume that this will
remain unchanged, as it is likely that in future extra
parameters will be passed in to give more information about
the state of cloning.</p>

<p>If you want to CLONE all objects you will need to keep
track of them per package. This is simply done using a hash
and Scalar::Util::weaken().</p>

<p>Perl after 5.8.7 has support for the
&quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot; special subroutine. Like
&quot;CLONE&quot;, &quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot; is called once per
package; however, it is called just before cloning starts,
and in the context of the parent thread. If it returns a
true value, then no objects of that class will be cloned; or
rather, they will be copied as unblessed, undef values. This
provides a simple mechanism for making a module threadsafe;
just add &quot;sub CLONE_SKIP { 1 }&quot; at the top of the
class, and &quot;DESTROY()&quot; will be now only be called
once per object. Of course, if the child thread needs to
make use of the objects, then a more sophisticated approach
is needed.</p>

<p>Like &quot;CLONE&quot;, &quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot; is
currently called with no parameters other than the invocant
package name, although that may change. Similarly, to allow
for future expansion, the return value should be a single 0
or 1 value.</p>
