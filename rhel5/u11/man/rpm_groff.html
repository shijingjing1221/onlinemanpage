<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) GROFF(1) GROFF(1)</p>

<p>NAME groff - front-end for the groff document formatting
system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groff [-abcegilpstzCEGNRSUVXZ] [-d cs] [-f fam]
[-F dir] [-I dir] [-L arg] [-m name] [-M dir] [-n num] [-o
list] [-P arg] [-r cn] [-T dev] [-w name] [-W name] [file
...] groff -h | --help groff -v | --version [option ...]</p>

<p>The command line is parsed according to the usual GNU
convention. The whitespace between a command line option and
its argument is optional. Options can be grouped behind a
single - (minus character). A filename of - (minus
character) denotes the standard input.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes the groff program,
the main front-end for the groff document formatting system.
The groff program and macro suite is the implementation of a
roff(7) system within the free software collec- tion GNU
http://www.gnu.org. The groff system has all features of the
classical roff, but adds many extensions.</p>

<p>The groff program allows to control the whole groff
system by command line options. This is a great
simplification in comparison to the classical case (which
uses pipes only).</p>

<p>OPTIONS As groff is a wrapper program for troff both
programs share a set of options. But the groff program has
some additional, native options and gives a new meaning to
some troff options. On the other hand, not all troff options
can be fed into groff.</p>

<p>Native groff Options The following options either do not
exist for troff or are differently interpreted by groff.</p>

<p>-e Preprocess with eqn.</p>

<p>-g Preprocess with grn.</p>

<p>-G Preprocess with grap.</p>

<p>-h --help Print a help message.</p>

<p>-I dir Add search directory for soelim(1). This option
implies the -s option.</p>

<p>-l Send the output to a spooler program for printing.
The command that should be used for this is specified by the
print command in the device description file, see
groff_font(5). If this com- mand is not present, the output
is piped into the lpr(1) program by default. See options -L
and -X.</p>

<p>-L arg Pass arg to the spooler program. Several
arguments should be passed with a separate -L option each.
Note that groff does not prepend - (a minus sign) to arg
before passing it to the spooler program.</p>

<p>-N Dont allow newlines within eqn delimiters. This is
the same as the -N option in eqn.</p>

<p>-p Preprocess with pic.</p>

<p>-P -option -P -option -P arg Pass -option or -option arg
to the postprocessor. The option must be specified with the
necessary preceding minus sign(s) - or -- because groff does
not prepend any dashes before passing it to the
postprocessor. For example, to pass a title to the gxditview
postprocessor, the shell command</p>

<p>sh# groff -X -P -title -P groff it foo</p>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<p>sh# groff -X -Z foo | gxditview -title groff it -</p>

<p>-R Preprocess with refer. No mechanism is provided for
passing ar- guments to refer because most refer options have
equivalent lan- guage elements that can be specified within
the document. See refer(1) for more details.</p>

<p>-s Preprocess with soelim.</p>

<p>-S Safer mode. Pass the -S option to pic and disable the
following troff requests: .open, .opena, .pso, .sy, and .pi.
For security reasons, safer mode is enabled by default.</p>

<p>-t Preprocess with tbl.</p>

<p>-T dev Set output device to dev. The possible values in
groff are ascii, cp1047, dvi, html, latin1, lbp, lj4, ps,
utf8, X75, and X100. Additionally, X75-12 and X100-12 are
available for docu- ments which use 12pt as the base
document size. The default de- vice is ps.</p>

<p>-U Unsafe mode. Reverts to the (old) unsafe behaviour;
see option -S.</p>

<p>-v --version Output version information of groff and of
all programs that are run by it; that is, the given command
line is parsed in the usu- al way, passing -v to all
subprograms.</p>

<p>-V Output the pipeline that would be run by groff (as a
wrapper program), but do not execute it.</p>

<p>-X Use gxditview instead of using the usual
postprocessor to (pre)view a document. The printing spooler
behavior as outlined with options -l and -L is carried over
to gxditview(1) by deter- mining an argument for the
-printCommand option of gxditview(1). This sets the default
Print action and the corresponding menu entry to that value.
-X only produces good results with -Tps, -TX75, -TX75-12,
-TX100, and -TX100-12. The default resolution for previewing
-Tps output is 75dpi; this can be changed by passing the
-resolution option to gxditview, for example</p>

<p>sh# groff -X -P-resolution -P100 -man foo.1</p>

<p>-z Suppress output generated by troff. Only error
messages will be printed.</p>

<p>-Z Do not postprocess the output of troff that is
normally called automatically by groff. This will print the
intermediate output to standard output; see
groff_out(5).</p>

<p>Transparent Options The following options are
transparently handed over to the formatter program troff
that is called by groff subsequently. These options are
described in more detail in troff(1).</p>

<p>-a ascii approximation of output.</p>

<p>-b backtrace on error or warning.</p>

<p>-c disable color output.</p>

<p>-C enable compatibility mode.</p>

<p>-d cs -d name=s define string.</p>

<p>-E disable troff error messages.</p>

<p>-f fam set default font family.</p>

<p>-F dir set path for font DESC files.</p>

<p>-i process standard input after the specified input
files.</p>

<p>-m name include macro file name.tmac (or tmac.name); see
also groff_tmac(5).</p>

<p>-M dir path for macro files.</p>

<p>-n num number the first page num.</p>

<p>-o list output only pages in list.</p>

<p>-r cn -r name=n set number register.</p>

<p>-w name enable warning name.</p>

<p>-W name disable warning name.</p>

<p>USING GROFF The groff system implements the
infrastructure of classical roff; see roff(7) for a survey
on how a roff system works in general. Due to the front-end
programs available within the groff system, using groff is
much easier than classical roff. This section gives an
overview of the parts that constitute the groff system. It
complements roff(7) with groff-specific features. This
section can be regarded as a guide to the documentation
around the groff system.</p>

<p>Front-ends The groff program is a wrapper around the
troff(1) program. It allows to specify the preprocessors by
command line options and automatically runs the
postprocessor that is appropriate for the selected device.
Doing so, the sometimes tedious piping mechanism of
classical roff(7) can be avoided.</p>

<p>The grog(1) program can be used for guessing the correct
groff command line to format a file.</p>

<p>The groffer(1) program is an allround-viewer for groff
files and man pages.</p>

<p>Preprocessors The groff preprocessors are
reimplementations of the classical prepro- cessors with
moderate extensions. The preprocessors distributed with the
groff package are</p>

<p>eqn(1) for mathematical formul&aelig;,</p>

<p>grn(1) for including gremlin(1) pictures,</p>

<p>pic(1) for drawing diagrams,</p>

<p>refer(1) for bibliographic references,</p>

<p>soelim(1) for including macro files from standard
locations,</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>tbl(1) for tables.</p>

<p>Besides these, there are some internal preprocessors
that are automati- cally run with some devices. These arent
visible to the user.</p>

<p>Macro Packages Macro packages can be included by option
-m. The groff system imple- ments and extends all classical
macro packages in a compatible way and adds some packages of
its own. Actually, the following macro packages come with
groff:</p>

<p>man The traditional man page format; see groff_man(7).
It can be specified on the command line as -man or -m
man.</p>

<p>mandoc The general package for man pages; it
automatically recognizes whether the documents uses the man
or the mdoc format and branches to the corresponding macro
package. It can be speci- fied on the command line as
-mandoc or -m mandoc.</p>

<p>mdoc The BSD-style man page format; see groff_mdoc(7).
It can be specified on the command line as -mdoc or -m
mdoc.</p>

<p>me The classical me document format; see groff_me(7). It
can be specified on the command line as -me or -m me.</p>

<p>mm The classical mm document format; see groff_mm(7). It
can be specified on the command line as -mm or -m mm.</p>

<p>ms The classical ms document format; see groff_ms(7). It
can be specified on the command line as -ms or -m ms.</p>

<p>www HTML-like macros for inclusion in arbitrary groff
documents; see groff_www(7).</p>

<p>Details on the naming of macro files and their placement
can be found in groff_tmac(5).</p>

<p>Programming Language General concepts common to all roff
programming languages are described in roff(7).</p>

<p>The groff extensions to the classical troff language are
documented in groff_diff(7).</p>

<p>The groff language as a whole is described in the (still
incomplete) groff info file; a short (but complete)
reference can be found in groff(7).</p>

<p>Formatters The central roff formatter within the groff
system is troff(1). It provides the features of both the
classical troff and nroff, as well as the groff extensions.
The command line option -C switches troff into compatibility
mode which tries to emulate classical roff as much as
possible.</p>

<p>There is a shell script nroff(1) that emulates the
behavior of classi- cal nroff. It tries to automatically
select the proper output encod- ing, according to the
current locale.</p>

<p>The formatter program generates intermediate output; see
groff_out(7).</p>

<p>Devices In roff, the output targets are called devices.
A device can be a piece of hardware, e.g. a printer, or a
software file format. A device is specified by the option
-T. The groff devices are as follows.</p>

<p>ascii Text output using the ascii(7) character set.</p>

<p>cp1047 Text output using the EBCDIC code page IBM cp1047
(e.g. OS/390 Unix).</p>

<p>nippon Text output using the Japanese-EUC character
set.</p>

<p>dvi TeX DVI format.</p>

<p>html HTML output.</p>

<p>ascii8 For typewriter-like devices. Unlike ascii, this
device is 8 bit clean. This device is intended to be used
for codesets other than ASCII and ISO-8859-1.</p>

<p>latin1 Text output using the ISO Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1)
character set; see iso_8859_1(7).</p>

<p>lbp Output for Canon CAPSL printers (LBP-4 and LBP-8
series laser printers).</p>

<p>lj4 HP LaserJet4-compatible (or other PCL5-compatible)
printers.</p>

<p>ps PostScript output; suitable for printers and
previewers like gv(1).</p>

<p>utf8 Text output using the Unicode (ISO 10646) character
set with UTF-8 encoding; see unicode(7).</p>

<p>X75 75dpi X Window System output suitable for the
previewers xditview(1x) and gxditview(1). A variant for a
12pt document base font is X75-12.</p>

<p>X100 100dpi X Window System output suitable for the
previewers xditview(1x) and gxditview(1). A variant for a
12pt document base font is X100-12.</p>

<p>The postprocessor to be used for a device is specified
by the postpro command in the device description file; see
groff_font(5). This can be overridden with the -X
option.</p>

<p>The default device is ps.</p>

<p>Postprocessors groff provides 3 hardware
postprocessors:</p>

<p>grolbp(1) for some Canon printers,</p>

<p>grolj4(1) for printers compatible to the HP LaserJet 4
and PCL5,</p>

<p>grotty(1) for text output using various encodings, e.g.
on text-oriented terminals or line-printers.</p>

<p>Today, most printing or drawing hardware is handled by
the operating system, by device drivers, or by software
interfaces, usually accepting PostScript. Consequently,
there isnt an urgent need for more hardware device
postprocessors.</p>

<p>The groff software devices for conversion into other
document file for- mats are</p>

<p>grodvi(1) for the DVI format,</p>

<p>grohtml(1) for HTML format,</p>

<p>grops(1) for PostScript.</p>

<p>Combined with the many existing free conversion tools
this should be sufficient to convert a troff document into
virtually any existing data format.</p>

<p>Utilities The following utility programs around groff
are available.</p>

<p>addftinfo(1) Add information to troff font description
files for use with groff.</p>

<p>afmtodit(1) Create font description files for PostScript
device.</p>

<p>groffer(1) General viewer program for groff files and
man pages.</p>

<p>gxditview(1) The groff X viewer, the GNU version of
xditview.</p>

<p>hpftodit(1) Create font description files for lj4
device.</p>

<p>indxbib(1) Make inverted index for bibliographic
databases.</p>

<p>lkbib(1) Search bibliographic databases.</p>

<p>lookbib(1) Interactively search bibliographic
databases.</p>

<p>pfbtops(1) Translate a PostScript font in .pfb format to
ASCII.</p>

<p>tfmtodit(1) Create font description files for TeX DVI
device.</p>

<p>xditview(1x) roff viewer distributed with X window.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Normally, the path separator in the
following environment variables is the colon; this may vary
depending on the operating system. For exam- ple, DOS and
Windows use a semicolon instead.</p>

<p>GROFF_BIN_PATH This search path, followed by $PATH, will
be used for commands that are executed by groff. If it is
not set then the directory where the groff binaries were
installed is prepended to PATH.</p>

<p>GROFF_COMMAND_PREFIX When there is a need to run
different roff implementations at the same time groff
provides the facility to prepend a prefix to most of its
programs that could provoke name clashings at run time
(default is to have none). Historically, this prefix was the
character g, but it can be anything. For example, gtroff
stood for groffs troff, gtbl for the groff version of tbl.
By setting GROFF_COMMAND_PREFIX to different values, the
different roff installations can be addressed. More exactly,
if it is set to prefix xxx then groff as a wrapper program
will internally call xxxtroff instead of troff. This also
applies to the pre- processors eqn, grn, pic, refer, tbl,
soelim, and to the utili- ties indxbib and lookbib. This
feature does not apply to any programs different from the
ones above (most notably groff it- self) since they are
unique to the groff package.</p>

<p>GROFF_FONT_PATH A list of directories in which to search
for the devname direc- tory in addition to the default ones.
See troff(1) and groff_font(5) for more details.</p>

<p>GROFF_TMAC_PATH A list of directories in which to search
for macro files in ad- dition to the default directories.
See troff(1) and groff_tmac(5) for more details.</p>

<p>GROFF_TMPDIR The directory in which temporary files will
be created. If this is not set but the environment variable
TMPDIR instead, tempo- rary files will be created in the
directory $TMPDIR. Otherwise temporary files will be created
in /tmp. The refer(1), groffer(1), grohtml(1), and grops(1)
commands use temporary files.</p>

<p>GROFF_TYPESETTER Preset the default device. If this is
not set the ps device is used as default. This device name
is overwritten by the option -T.</p>

<p>FILES There are some directories in which groff installs
all of its data files. Due to different installation habits
on different operating systems, their locations are not
absolutely fixed, but their function is clearly defined and
coincides on all systems.</p>

<p>groff Macro Directory This contains all information
related to macro packages. Note that more than a single
directory is searched for those files as documented in
groff_tmac(5). For the groff installation corresponding to
this document, it is located at
/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.1/tmac. The follow- ing files
contained in the groff macro directory have a special mean-
ing:</p>

<p>troffrc Initialization file for troff. This is
interpreted by troff be- fore reading the macro sets and any
input.</p>

<p>troffrc-end Final startup file for troff, it is parsed
after all macro sets have been read.</p>

<p>name.tmac tmac.name Macro file for macro package
name.</p>

<p>groff Font Directory This contains all information
related to output devices. Note that more than a single
directory is searched for those files; see troff(1). For the
groff installation corresponding to this document, it is
locat- ed at /usr/share/groff/1.18.1.1/font. The following
files contained in the groff font directory have a special
meaning:</p>

<p>devname/DESC Device description file for device name,
see groff_font(5).</p>

<p>devname/F Font file for font F of device name.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following example illustrates the power of
the groff program as a wrapper around troff.</p>

<p>To process a roff file using the preprocessors tbl and
pic and the me macro set, classical troff had to be called
by</p>

<p>sh# pic foo.me | tbl | troff -me -Tlatin1 | grotty</p>

<p>Using groff, this pipe can be shortened to the
equivalent command</p>

<p>sh# groff -p -t -me -T latin1 foo.me</p>

<p>An even easier way to call this is to use grog(1) to
guess the prepro- cessor and macro options and execute the
generated command (by specify- ing shell left quotes)</p>

<p>sh# grog -Tlatin1 foo.me</p>

<p>The simplest way is to view the contents in an automated
way by calling</p>

<p>sh# groffer foo.me</p>

<p>BUGS On EBCDIC hosts (e.g. OS/390 Unix), output devices
ascii and latin1 arent available. Similarly, output for
EBCDIC code page cp1047 is not available on ASCII based
operating systems.</p>

<p>Report bugs to bug-groff@gnu.org. Include a complete,
