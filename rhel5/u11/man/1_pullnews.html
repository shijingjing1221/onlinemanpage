<p>PULLNEWS(1) InterNetNews Documentation PULLNEWS(1)</p>

<p>NAME pullnews - Pull news from one news server and feed
it to another</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pullnews [-hq] [-c config] [-g groups] [-p
port] [-r file] [-s to- server] [&lt;from-server&gt;
...]</p>

<p>REQUIREMENTS The Net::NNTP module must be installed.
This module is available as part of the libnet distribution
and comes with recent versions of Perl. For older versions
of Perl, you can download it from
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pullnews reads a config file in the running
user s home directory (nor- mally called ~/.pullnews) and
connects to the upstream servers given there as a reader
client. By default, it connects to all servers listed in the
configuration file, but you can limit pullnews to spe- cific
servers by listing them on the command line. For each server
it connects to, it pulls over articles and feeds them to the
destination server via the IHAVE command. This means that
the system pullnews is run on must have feeding access to
the destination news server.</p>

<p>pullnews is designed for very small sites that don t
want to bother setting up traditional peering and is not
meant for handling large feeds.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c config Normally, the config file is stored in
~/.pullnews for the user running pullnews. If -c is given,
config will be used as the con- fig file instead. This is
useful if you re running pullnews as a system user on an
automated basis out of cron rather than as an individual
user.</p>

<p>-g groups Specifies a collection of groups to get.
groups is a list of news- groups separated by commas (only
commas, no spaces). Each group must be defined in the config
file, and only the remote hosts that carry those groups will
be contacted. Note that this is a simple list of groups, not
a wildmat expression, and wildcards are not supported.</p>

<p>-h Print a usage message and exit.</p>

<p>-p port Connect to the destination news server on a port
other than the default of 119. This option does not change
the port used to con- nect to the remote news servers.</p>

<p>-q Print out less status information while running.</p>

<p>-r file Rather than feeding the downloaded articles to a
local server, instead create a batch file that can later be
fed to a server using rnews. See rnews(1) for more
information about the batch file for- mat.</p>

<p>-s to-server Normally, pullnews will feed the articles
it retrieves to the news server running on localhost. To
connect to a different host, spec- ify a server with the -s
flag.</p>

<p>CONFIG FILE The config file for pullnews is divided into
blocks, one block for each remote server to connect to. A
block begins with the host line, which must have no leading
whitespace and contains just the hostname of the remote
server. Following this line should be one or more newsgroup
lines which start with whitespace followed by the name of a
newsgroup to retrieve. Only one newsgroup should be listed
on each line.</p>

<p>pullnews will update the config file to include the time
the group was last checked and the highest numbered article
successfully retrieved and transferred to the destination
server. It uses this data to avoid doing duplicate work the
next time it runs.</p>

<p>The full syntax is:</p>

<p>&lt;host&gt; [&lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;]
&lt;group&gt; [&lt;time&gt; &lt;high&gt;] &lt;group&gt;
[&lt;time&gt; &lt;high&gt;]</p>

<p>where the &lt;host&gt; line must not have leading
whitespace and the &lt;group&gt; lines must. Note that you
may optionally specify a username and pass- word for basic
authentication to the remote server if necessary.</p>

<p>A typical configuration file would be:</p>

<p># Format group date high data.pa.vix.com
rec.bicycles.racing 908086612 783 rec.humor.funny 908086613
18 comp.programming.threads nnrp.vix.com pull sekret
comp.std.lisp</p>

<p>Note that an earlier run of pullnews has filled in
details about the last article downloads from the two rec.*
groups. The two comp.* groups were just added by the user
and have not yet been checked.</p>

<p>The nnrp.vix.com server requires authentication, and
pullnews will use the username &quot;pull&quot; and the
password &quot;sekret&quot;.</p>

<p>BUGS pullnews is very simple and is lacking in more
sophisticated features (like killing articles based on
user-defined conditions) that better pull feeders most
certainly have. It also doesnt keep or log much detail on
articles transferred.</p>

<p>HISTORY pullnews was written by James Brister for INN.
The documentation was rewritten in POD by Russ Allbery
