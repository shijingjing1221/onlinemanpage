<p>PUTENV(3) Linux Programmer s Manual PUTENV(3)</p>

<p>NAME putenv - change or add an environment variable</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int putenv(char *string);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The putenv() function adds or changes the
value of environment vari- ables. The argument string is of
the form name=value. If name does not already exist in the
environment, then string is added to the envi- ronment. If
name does exist, then the value of name in the environment
is changed to value. The string pointed to by string becomes
part of the environment, so altering the string changes the
environment.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The putenv() function returns zero on
success, or non-zero if an error occurs.</p>

<p>ERRORS ENOMEM Insufficient space to allocate new
environment.</p>

<p>NOTES The putenv() function is not required to be
reentrant, and the one in libc4, libc5 and glibc2.0 is not,
but the glibc2.1 version is.</p>

<p>Description for libc4, libc5, glibc: If the argument
string is of the form name, and does not contain an =
character, then the variable name is removed from the
environment. If putenv() has to allocate a new array
environ, and the previous array was also allocated by
putenv(), then it will be freed. In no case will the old
storage asso- ciated to the environment variable itself be
freed.</p>

<p>The libc4 and libc5 and glibc 2.1.2 versions conform to
SUSv2: the pointer string given to putenv() is used. In
particular, this string becomes part of the environment;
changing it later will change the environment. (Thus, it is
an error is to call putenv() with an auto- matic variable as
the argument, then return from the calling function while
string is still part of the environment.) However, glibc
2.0-2.1.1 differs: a copy of the string is used. On the one
hand this causes a memory leak, and on the other hand it
violates SUSv2. This has been fixed in glibc2.1.2.</p>

<p>The 4.4BSD version, like glibc 2.0, uses a copy.</p>

<p>SUSv2 removes the const from the prototype, and so does
glibc 2.1.3.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD</p>
