<p>NAME cvtbatch - convert Usenet batch file to INN
format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cvtbatch [ -w items ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Cvtbatch reads standard input as a sequence
of lines, converts each line, and writes it to standard
output. It is used to convert simple batchfiles that contain
just the article name to INN batchfiles that contain
additional information about each article.</p>

<p>Each line is taken as a storage API token indicating a
Usenet article. (Only the first word of each line is parsed;
anything following whites- pace is ignored. Lines not
starting with a valid token are also silently ignored.)</p>

<p>If the input file consists of a series of Message-IDs,
then use grephistory(1) with the-s flag piped into
cvtbatch.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -w The -w flag specifies how each output line
should be writ- ten. The items for this flag should be
chosen from the W flag items as specified in newsfeeds(5).
They may be chosen from the following set:</p>

<p>b Size of article in bytes f full pathname of article m
article message-id n relative pathname of article</p>
