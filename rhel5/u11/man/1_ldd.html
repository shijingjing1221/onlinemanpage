<p>NAME ldd - print shared library dependencies</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ldd [OPTION]... FILE...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ldd prints the shared libraries required by
each program or shared library specified on the command
line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --version Print the version number of ldd.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Print all information, including e.g.
symbol versioning informa- tion.</p>

<p>-u --unused Print unused direct dependencies.</p>

<p>-d --data-relocs Perform relocations and report any
missing objects (ELF only).</p>

<p>-r --function-relocs Perform relocations for both data
objects and functions, and report any missing objects or
functions (ELF only).</p>

<p>--help Usage information.</p>

<p>NOTES The standard version of ldd comes with glibc2.
Libc5 came with an older version, still present on some
systems. The long options are not sup- ported by the libc5
version. On the other hand, the glibc2 version does not
support -V and only has the equivalent --version.</p>

<p>The libc5 version of this program will use the name of a
library given on the command line as-is when it contains a
/; otherwise it searches for the library in the standard
locations. To run it on a shared library in the current
directory, prefix the name with &quot;./&quot;.</p>

<p>BUGS ldd does not work on a.out shared libraries.</p>

<p>ldd does not work with some extremely old a.out programs
which were built before ldd support was added to the
compiler releases. If you use ldd on one of these programs,
the program will attempt to run with argc = 0 and the
results will be unpredictable.</p>
