<p>NAME e2fsck.conf - Configuration file for e2fsck</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION e2fsck.conf is the configuration file for
e2fsck(8). It controls the default parameters used by
e2fsck(8) when it is creating ext2 or ext3 filesystems.</p>

<p>The e2fsck.conf file uses an INI-style format. Stanzas,
or top-level sections, are delimited by square braces: [ ].
Within each section, each line defines a relation, which
assigns tags to values, or to a subsection, which contains
further relations or subsections. An exam- ple of the
INI-style format used by this configuration file follows
below:</p>

<p>[section1] tag1 = value_a tag1 = value_b tag2 =
value_c</p>

<p>[section 2] tag3 = { subtag1 = subtag_value_a subtag1 =
subtag_value_b subtag2 = subtag_value_c } tag1 = value_d
tag2 = value_e }</p>

<p>Comments are delimited by a semicolon (;) or a hash (#)
character at the beginning of the comment, and are
terminated by the end of line character.</p>

<p>Tags and values must be quoted using double quotes if
they contain spaces. Within a quoted string, the standard
backslash interpretations apply: &quot;0 (for the newline
character), &quot;&quot; (for the tab character), ( f o r t
h e b a c k s p a c &quot;e\&quot; (for the backslash
charac- c h a r a c t e r ) , a n d ter).</p>

<p>The following stanzas are used in the e2fsck.conf file.
They will be described in more detail in future sections of
this document.</p>

<p>[options] This stanza contains general configuration
parameters for e2fsck s behavior. [problems] This stanza
allows the adminis- trator to reconfigure how e2fsck handles
various filesystem inconsistencies.</p>

<p>THE [options] STANZA The following relations are defined
in the [options] stanza.</p>

<p>allow_cancellation If this relation is set to a boolean
value of true, then if the user interrupts e2fsck using ^C,
and the filesystem is not explicitly flagged as containing
errors, e2fsck will exit with an exit status of 0 instead of
32. This setting defaults to false.</p>

<p>defer_check_on_battery This boolean relation controls
whether or not the interval between filesystem checks
(either based on time or number of mounts) should be doubled
if the system is running on battery. It defaults to
true.</p>

<p>THE [problems] STANZA Each tag in the [problems] stanza
names a problem code specified with a leading &quot;0x&quot;
followed by six hex digits. The value of the tag is a
subsection where the relations in that subsection override
the default treatment of that particular problem code.</p>

<p>Note that inappropriate settings in this stanza may
cause e2fsck to behave incorrectly, or even crash. Most
system administrators should not be making changes to this
section without referring to source code.</p>

<p>Within each problem codes subsection, the following tags
may be used:</p>

<p>description This relation allows the message which is
printed when this filesystem inconsistency is detected to be
overridden.</p>

<p>preen_ok This boolean relation overrides the default
behavior controlling whether this filesystem problem should
be automatically fixed when e2fsck is running in preen
mode.</p>

<p>no_ok This boolean relation overrides the default
behavior determining whether or not the filesystem will be
marked as inconsistent if the user declines to fix the
reported problem.</p>

<p>no_default This boolean relation overrides whether the
default answer for this problem (or question) should be
&quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>preen_nomessage This boolean relation overrides the
default behavior controlling whether or not the description
for this filesystem problem should be suppressed when e2fsck
is running in preen mode.</p>

<p>no_nomsg This boolean relation overrides the default
behavior controlling whether or not the description for this
filesystem problem should be suppressed when e2fsck is run
with the -n option.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following recipe will prevent e2fsck from
aborting during the boot process when a filesystem contains
orphaned files. (Of course, this is not always a good idea,
since critical files that are needed for the security of the
system could potentially end up in lost+found, and starting
the system without first having a system administrator check
things out may be dangerous.)</p>

&quot;@u @i %i. &quot; }</p>
