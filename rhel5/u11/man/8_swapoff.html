<p>SWAPON(8) Linux Programmer s Manual SWAPON(8)</p>

<p>NAME swapon, swapoff - enable/disable devices and files
for paging and swap- ping</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /sbin/swapon [-h -V] /sbin/swapon -a [-v] [-e]
/sbin/swapon [-v] [-p priority] specialfile ... /sbin/swapon
[-s] /sbin/swapoff [-h -V] /sbin/swapoff -a /sbin/swapoff
specialfile ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Swapon is used to specify devices on which
paging and swapping are to take place.</p>

<p>The device or file used is given by the specialfile
parameter. It may be of the form -L label or -U uuid to
indicate a device by label or uuid.</p>

<p>Calls to swapon normally occur in the system multi-user
initialization file /etc/rc making all swap devices
available, so that the paging and swapping activity is
interleaved across several devices and files.</p>

<p>Normally, the first form is used:</p>

<p>-a All devices marked as swap swap devices in /etc/fstab
are made available, except for those with the noauto option.
Devices that are already running as swap are silently
skipped.</p>

<p>-e When -a is used with swapon, -e makes swapon silently
skip devices that do not exist.</p>

<p>-h Provide help</p>

<p>-L label Use the partition that has the specified label.
(For this, access to /proc/partitions is needed.)</p>

<p>-p priority Specify priority for swapon. This option is
only available if swapon was compiled under and is used
under a 1.3.2 or later kernel. priority is a value between 0
and 32767. Higher numbers indicate higher priority. See
swapon(2) for a full description of swap priorities. Add
pri=value to the option field of /etc/fstab for use with
swapon -a.</p>

<p>-s Display swap usage summary by device. Equivalent to
&quot;cat /proc/swaps&quot;. Not available before Linux
2.1.25.</p>

<p>-U uuid Use the partition that has the specified uuid.
(For this, access to /proc/partitions is needed.)</p>

<p>-v Be verbose.</p>

<p>-V Display version</p>

<p>Swapoff disables swapping on the specified devices and
files. When the -a flag is given, swapping is disabled on
all known swap devices and files (as found in /proc/swaps or
/etc/fstab).</p>

<p>NOTE You should not use swapon on a file with holes.
Swap over NFS may not work.</p>
