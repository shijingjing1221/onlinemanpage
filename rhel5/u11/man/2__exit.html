<p>_EXIT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual _EXIT(2)</p>

<p>NAME _exit, _Exit - terminate the current process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>void _exit(int status);</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>void _Exit(int status);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The function _exit() terminates the calling
process &quot;immediately&quot;. Any open file descriptors
belonging to the process are closed; any children of the
process are inherited by process 1, init, and the processs
par- ent is sent a SIGCHLD signal.</p>

<p>The value status is returned to the parent process as
the processs exit status, and can be collected using one of
the wait() family of calls.</p>

<p>The function _Exit() is equivalent to _exit().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE These functions do not return.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD. The function
_Exit() was introduced by C99.</p>

<p>NOTES For a discussion on the effects of an exit, the
transmission of exit status, zombie processes, signals sent,
etc., see exit(3).</p>

<p>The function _exit() is like exit(), but does not call
any functions registered with atexit() or on_exit(). Whether
it flushes standard I/O buffers and removes temporary files
created with tmpfile(3) is imple- mentation dependent. On
the other hand, _exit() does close open file descriptors,
and this may cause an unknown delay, waiting for pending
output to finish. If the delay is undesired, it may be
useful to call functions like tcflush() before calling
_exit(). Whether any pending I/O is cancelled, and which
pending I/O may be cancelled upon _exit(), is
implementation-dependent.</p>
