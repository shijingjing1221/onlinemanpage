<p>FLAC(1) FLAC(1)</p>

<p>NAME flac - Free Lossless Audio Codec</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS flac [ options ] [ infile.wav | infile.aiff |
infile.raw | - ... ]</p>

<p>flac [ -d | --decode | -t | --test | -a | --analyze ] [
OPTIONS ] [ infile.flac ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION flac is a command-line tool for encoding,
decoding, testing and analyz- ing FLAC streams.</p>

<p>This manual page was originally written for the Debian
GNU/Linux dis- tribution because the original program did
not have a manual page.</p>

<p>OPTIONS A summary of options is included below. For a
complete description, see the HTML documentation.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS -v, --version Show the flac version
number</p>

<p>-h, --help Show basic usage and a list of all
options</p>

<p>-H, --explain Show detailed explanation of usage and all
options</p>

<p>-d, --decode Decode (the default behavior is to
encode)</p>

<p>-t, --test Test a flac encoded file (same as -d except
no decoded file is written)</p>

<p>-a, --analyze Analyze a FLAC encoded file (same as -d
except an analysis file is written)</p>

<p>-c, --stdout Write output to stdout</p>

<p>-s, --silent Silent mode (do not write runtime
encode/decode statistics to stderr)</p>

<p>--totally-silent Do not print anything of any kind,
including warnings or errors. The exit code will be the only
way to determine successful com- pletion.</p>

<p>-f, --force Force overwriting of output files. By
default, flac warns that the output file already exists and
continues to the next file.</p>

<p>-o filename, --output-name=filename Force the output
file name (usually flac just changes the exten- sion). May
only be used when encoding a single file. May not be used in
conjunction with --output-prefix.</p>

<p>--output-prefix=string Prefix each output file name with
the given string. This can be useful for encoding or
decoding files to a different directory. Make sure if your
string is a path name that it ends with a trailing /
(slash).</p>

<p>--delete-input-file Automatically delete the input file
after a successful encode or decode. If there was an error
(including a verify error) the input file is left
intact.</p>

<p>--skip={#|mm:ss.ss} Skip over the first number of
samples of the input. This works for both encoding and
decoding, but not testing. The alterna- tive form mm:ss.ss
can be used to specify minutes, seconds, and fractions of a
second.</p>

<p>--until={#|[+|-]mm:ss.ss} Stop at the given sample
number for each input file. This works for both encoding and
decoding, but not testing. The given sam- ple number is not
included in the decoded output. The alterna- tive form
mm:ss.ss can be used to specify minutes, seconds, and
fractions of a second. If a + (plus) sign is at the begin-
ning, the --until point is relative to the --skip point. If
a - (minus) sign is at the beginning, the --until point is
rela- tive to end of the audio.</p>

<p>--ogg When encoding, generate Ogg FLAC output instead of
native FLAC. Ogg FLAC streams are FLAC streams wrapped in an
Ogg transport layer. The resulting file should have an .ogg
extension and will still be decodable by flac.</p>

<p>When decoding, force the input to be treated as Ogg
FLAC. This is useful when piping input from stdin or when
the filename does not end in .ogg.</p>

<p>--serial-number=# When used with --ogg, specifies the
serial number to use for the first Ogg FLAC stream, which is
then incremented for each addi- tional stream. When encoding
and no serial number is given, flac uses a random number for
the first stream, then increments it for each additional
stream. When decoding and no number is given, flac uses the
serial number of the first page.</p>

<p>ANALYSIS OPTIONS --residual-text Includes the residual
signal in the analysis file. This will make the file very
big, much larger than even the decoded file.</p>

<p>--residual-gnuplot Generates a gnuplot file for every
subframe; each file will con- tain the residual distribution
of the subframe. This will cre- ate a lot of files.</p>

<p>DECODING OPTIONS --cue=[#.#][-[#.#]] Set the beginning
and ending cuepoints to decode. The optional first #.# is
the track and index point at which decoding will start; the
default is the beginning of the stream. The optional second
#.# is the track and index point at which decoding will end;
the default is the end of the stream. If the cuepoint does
not exist, the closest one before it (for the start point)
or after it (for the end point) will be used. If those dont
exist, the start of the stream (for the start point) or end
of the stream (for the end point) will be used. The
cuepoints are merely translated into sample numbers then
used as --skip and --until.</p>

<p>-F, --decode-through-errors By default flac stops
decoding with an error and removes the partially decoded
file if it encounters a bitstream error. With -F, errors are
still printed but flac will continue decoding to completion.
Note that errors may cause the decoded audio to be missing
some samples or have silent sections.</p>

<p>ENCODING OPTIONS -V, --verify Verify a correct encoding
by decoding the output in parallel and comparing to the
original</p>

<p>--lax Allow encoder to generate non-Subset files. The
resulting FLAC file may not be streamable or might have
trouble being played in all players (especially hardware
devices), so you should only use this option in combination
with custom encoding options meant for archival.</p>

<p>--replay-gain Calculate ReplayGain values and store in
Vorbis comments, simi- lar to vorbisgain. Title gains/peaks
will be computed for each input file, and an album gain/peak
will be computed for all files. All input files must have
the same resolution, sample rate, and number of channels.
Only mono and stereo files are allowed, and the sample rate
must be one of 8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, or 48
kHz. Also note that this option may leave a few extra bytes
in a PADDING block as the exact size of the tags is not
known until all files are processed. Note that this option
cannot be used when encoding to standard output
(stdout).</p>

<p>--cuesheet=filename Import the given cuesheet file and
store it in a CUESHEET meta- data block. This option may
only be used when encoding a single file. A seekpoint will
be added for each index point in the cuesheet to the
SEEKTABLE unless --no-cued-seekpoints is speci- fied.</p>

<p>--sector-align Align encoding of multiple CD format WAVE
files on sector bound- aries. See the HTML documentation for
more information.</p>

<p>-S {#|X|#x|#s}, --seekpoint={#|X|#x|#s} Include a point
or points in a SEEKTABLE. Using #, a seek point at that
sample number is added. Using X, a placeholder point is
added at the end of a the table. Using #x, # evenly spaced
seek points will be added, the first being at sample 0.
Using #s, a seekpoint will be added every # seconds (# does
not have to be a whole number; it can be, for example, 9.5,
meaning a seekpoint every 9.5 seconds). You may use many -S
options; the resulting SEEKTABLE will be the unique-ified
union of all such values. With no -S options, flac defaults
to -S 10s. Use --no-seek- table for no SEEKTABLE. Note: -S
#x and -S #s will not work if the encoder can t determine
the input size before starting. Note: if you use -S # and #
is &gt;= samples in the input, there will be either no seek
point entered (if the input size is determinable before
encoding starts) or a placeholder point (if input size is
not determinable).</p>

<p>-P #, --padding=# Tell the encoder to write a PADDING
metadata block of the given length (in bytes) after the
STREAMINFO block. This is useful if you plan to tag the file
later with an APPLICATION block; instead of having to
rewrite the entire file later just to insert your block, you
can write directly over the PADDING block. Note that the
total length of the PADDING block will be 4 bytes longer
than the length given because of the 4 metadata block header
bytes. You can force no PADDING block at all to be written
with --no-padding. The encoder writes a PADDING block of
4096 bytes by default.</p>

<p>-T FIELD=VALUE, --tag=FIELD=VALUE Add a Vorbis comment.
The comment must adhere to the Vorbis comment spec; i.e. the
FIELD must contain only legal characters, terminated by an
equals sign. Make sure to quote the comment if necessary.
This option may appear more than once to add sev- eral
comments. NOTE: all tags will be added to all encoded
files.</p>

<p>-b #, --blocksize=# Specify the block size in samples.
The default is 1152 for -l 0, else 4608; must be one of 192,
576, 1152, 2304, 4608, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192,
16384, or 32768 (unless --lax is used)</p>

<p>-m, --mid-side Try mid-side coding for each frame
(stereo input only)</p>

<p>-M, --adaptive-mid-side Adaptive mid-side coding for all
frames (stereo input only)</p>

<p>-0..-8, --compression-level-0..--compression-level-8
Fastest compression..highest compression (default is -5).
These are synonyms for other options:</p>

<p>-0, --compression-level-0 Synonymous with -l 0 -b 1152
-r 2,2</p>

<p>-1, --compression-level-1 Synonymous with -l 0 -b 1152
-M -r 2,2</p>

<p>-2, --compression-level-2 Synonymous with -l 0 -b 1152
-m -r 3</p>

<p>-3, --compression-level-3 Synonymous with -l 6 -b 4608
-r 3,3</p>

<p>-4, --compression-level-4 Synonymous with -l 8 -b 4608
-M -r 3,3</p>

<p>-5, --compression-level-5 Synonymous with -l 8 -b 4608
-m -r 3,3</p>

<p>-6, --compression-level-6 Synonymous with -l 8 -b 4608
-m -r 4</p>

<p>-7, --compression-level-7 Synonymous with -l 8 -b 4608
-m -e -r 6</p>

<p>-8, --compression-level-8 Synonymous with -l 12 -b 4608
-m -e -r 6</p>

<p>--fast Fastest compression. Currently synonymous with
-0.</p>

<p>--best Highest compression. Currently synonymous with
-8.</p>

<p>-e, --exhaustive-model-search Do exhaustive model search
(expensive!)</p>

<p>-l #, --max-lpc-order=# Set the maximum LPC order; 0
means use only the fixed predictors</p>

<p>-p, --qlp-coeff-precision-search Do exhaustive search of
LP coefficient quantization (expen- sive!). Overrides -q;
does nothing if using -l 0</p>

<p>-q #, --qlp-coeff-precision=# Precision of the quantized
linear-predictor coefficients, 0 =&gt; let encoder decide
(min is 5, default is 0)</p>

<p>-r [#,]#, --rice-partition-order=[#,]# Set the [min,]max
residual partition order (0..16). min defaults to 0 if
unspecified. Default is -r 3,3.</p>

<p>FORMAT OPTIONS --endian={big|little} Set the byte order
for samples</p>

<p>--channels=# Set number of channels.</p>

<p>--bps=# Set bits per sample.</p>

<p>--sample-rate=# Set sample rate (in Hz).</p>

<p>--sign={signed|unsigned} Set the sign of samples (the
default is signed).</p>

<p>--input-size=# Specify the size of the raw input in
bytes. If you are encoding raw samples from stdin, you must
set this option in order to be able to use --skip, --until,
--cue-sheet, or other options that need to know the size of
the input beforehand. If the size given is greater than what
is found in the input stream, the encoder will complain
about an unexpected end-of-file. If the size given is less,
samples will be truncated.</p>

<p>--force-aiff-format Force the decoder to output AIFF
format. This option is not needed if the output filename (as
set by -o) ends with .aiff. Also, this option has no effect
when encoding since input AIFF is auto-detected.</p>

<p>--force-raw-format Force input (when encoding) or output
(when decoding) to be treated as raw samples (even if
filename ends in .wav).</p>

<p>NEGATIVE OPTIONS --no-adaptive-mid-side</p>

<p>--no-decode-through-errors</p>

<p>--no-delete-input-file</p>

<p>--no-exhaustive-model-search</p>

<p>--no-lax</p>

<p>--no-mid-side</p>

<p>--no-ogg</p>

<p>--no-padding</p>

<p>--no-qlp-coeff-precision-search</p>

<p>--no-residual-gnuplot</p>

<p>--no-residual-text</p>

<p>--no-sector-align</p>

<p>--no-seektable</p>

<p>--no-silent</p>

<p>--no-verify These flags can be used to invert the sense
of the corresponding normal option.</p>
