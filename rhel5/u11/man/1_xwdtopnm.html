<p>NAME xwdtopnm - convert an X11 or X10 window dump file
to a PNM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xwdtopnm [-verbose] [-headerdump] [xwdfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>xwdtopnm reads an X11 or X10 window dump file as input
and produces a PNM image as output. The type of the output
image depends on the input file - if its black and white,
the output is PBM. If its grayscale, the output is PGM.
Otherwise, its PPM. The program tells you which type it is
writing.</p>

<p>Using this program, you can convert anything you can
display on an X workstations screen into a PNM image. Just
display whatever youre interested in, run the xwd program to
capture the contents of the win- dow, run it through
xwdtopnm, and then use pamcut to select the part you
want.</p>

<p>Note that a pseudocolor XWD image (typically what you
get when you make a dump of a pseudocolor X window) has
maxval 65535, which means the PNM file that xwdtopnm
generates has maxval 65535. Many older image pro- cessing
programs (that arent part of the Netpbm package and dont use
the Netpbm programming library) dont know how to handle a
PNM image with maxval greater than 255 (because there are
two bytes instead of one for each sample in the image). So
you may want to run the output of xwdtopnm through pamdepth
before feeding it to one of these old pro- grams.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -verbose This option causes xwdtopnm to display
handy information about the input image and the conversion
process</p>

<p>-headerdump This option causes xwdtopnm to display the
contents of the X11 header. It has no effect when the input
is X10. This option was new in Netpbm 10.26 (December
2004).</p>
