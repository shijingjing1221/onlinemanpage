<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>DESCRIPTION GNU dbm is a library of routines that
manages data files that contain key/data pairs. The access
provided is that of storing, retrieval, and deletion by key
and a non-sorted traversal of all keys. A process is allowed
to use multiple data files at the same time.</p>

<p>A process that opens a gdbm file is designated as a
&quot;reader&quot; or a &quot;writer&quot;. Only one writer
may open a gdbm file and many readers may open the file.
Readers and writers can not open the gdbm file at the same
time. The procedure for opening a gdbm file is:</p>

<p>GDBM_FILE dbf;</p>

<p>dbf = gdbm_open ( name, block_size, read_write, mode,
fatal_func )</p>

<p>Name is the name of the file (the complete name, gdbm
does not append any characters to this name). Block_size is
the size of a single transfer from disk to memory. This
parameter is ignored unless the file is a new file. The
minimum size is 512. If it is less than 512, dbm will use
the stat block size for the file system. Read_write can have
one of the following values: GDBM_READER reader GDBM_WRITER
writer GDBM_WRCREAT writer - if database does not exist
create new one GDBM_NEWDB writer - create new database
regardless if one exists For the last three (writers of the
database) the following may be added added to read_write by
bitwise or: GDBM_SYNC, which causes all database operations
to be synchronized to the disk, and GDBM_NOLOCK, which pre-
vents the library from performing any locking on the
database file. The option GDBM_FAST is now obsolete, since
gdbm defaults to no-sync mode. Mode is the file mode (see
chmod(2) and open(2)) if the file is cre- ated.
(*Fatal_func) () is a function for dbm to call if it detects
a fatal error. The only parameter of this function is a
string. If the value of 0 is provided, gdbm will use a
default function.</p>

<p>The return value dbf is the pointer needed by all other
routines to access that gdbm file. If the return is the NULL
pointer, gdbm_open was not successful. The errors can be
found in gdbm_errno for gdbm errors and in errno for system
errors. (For error codes, see gdbmer- rno.h.)</p>

<p>In all of the following calls, the parameter dbf refers
to the pointer returned from gdbm_open.</p>

<p>It is important that every file opened is also closed.
This is needed to update the reader/writer count on the
file. This is done by:</p>

<p>gdbm_close (dbf);</p>

<p>The database is used by 3 primary routines. The first
stores data in the database.</p>

<p>ret = gdbm_store ( dbf, key, content, flag )</p>

<p>Dbf is the pointer returned by gdbm_open. Key is the key
data. Con- tent is the data to be associated with the key.
Flag can have one of the following values: GDBM_INSERT
insert only, generate an error if key exists GDBM_REPLACE
replace contents if key exists.</p>

<p>If a reader calls gdbm_store, the return value will be
-1. If called with GDBM_INSERT and key is in the database,
the return value will be 1. Otherwise, the return value is
0.</p>

<p>NOTICE: If you store data for a key that is already in
the data base, gdbm replaces the old data with the new data
if called with GDBM_REPLACE. You do not get two data items
for the same key and you do not get an error from
gdbm_store.</p>

<p>NOTICE: The size in gdbm is not restricted like dbm or
ndbm. Your data can be as large as you want.</p>

<p>To search for some data:</p>

<p>content = gdbm_fetch ( dbf, key )</p>

<p>Dbf is the pointer returned by gdbm_open. Key is the key
data.</p>

<p>If the dptr element of the return value is NULL, no data
was found. Otherwise the return value is a pointer to the
found data. The storage space for the dptr element is
allocated using malloc(3C). Gdbm does not automatically free
this data. It is the programmers responsibil- ity to free
this storage when it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>To search for some data, without retrieving it:</p>

<p>ret = gdbm_exists ( dbf, key )</p>

<p>Dbf is the pointer returned by gdbm_open. Key is the key
data to search for.</p>

<p>If the key is found within the database, the return
value ret will be true. If nothing appropiate is found, ret
will be false. This routine is useful for checking for the
existance of a record, without perform- ing the memory
allocation done by gdbm_fetch.</p>

<p>To remove some data from the database:</p>

<p>ret = gdbm_delete ( dbf, key )</p>

<p>Dbf is the pointer returned by gdbm_open. Key is the key
data.</p>

<p>The return value is -1 if the item is not present or the
requester is a reader. The return value is 0 if there was a
successful delete.</p>

<p>The next two routines allow for accessing all items in
the database. This access is not key sequential, but it is
guaranteed to visit every key in the database once. (The
order has to do with the hash values.)</p>

<p>key = gdbm_firstkey ( dbf )</p>

<p>nextkey = gdbm_nextkey ( dbf, key )</p>

<p>Dbf is the pointer returned by gdbm_open. Key is the key
data.</p>

<p>The return values are both of type datum. If the dptr
element of the return value is NULL, there is no first key
or next key. Again notice that dptr points to data allocated
by malloc(3C) and gdbm will not free it for you.</p>

<p>These functions were intended to visit the database in
read-only algo- rithms, for instance, to validate the
database or similar operations.</p>

<p>File visiting is based on a hash table . gdbm_delete
re-arranges the hash table to make sure that any collisions
in the table do not leave some item un-findable. The
original key order is NOT guaran- teed to remain unchanged
in ALL instances. It is possible that some key will not be
visited if a loop like the following is executed:</p>

<p>key = gdbm_firstkey ( dbf ); while ( key.dptr ) {
nextkey = gdbm_nextkey ( dbf, key ); if ( some condition ) {
gdbm_delete ( dbf, key ); free ( key.dptr ); } key =
nextkey; }</p>

<p>The following routine should be used very
infrequently.</p>

<p>ret = gdbm_reorganize ( dbf )</p>

<p>If you have had a lot of deletions and would like to
shrink the space used by the gdbm file, this routine will
reorganize the database. Gdbm will not shorten the length of
a gdbm file except by using this reorga- nization. (Deleted
file space will be reused.)</p>

<p>Unless your database was opened with the GDBM_SYNC flag,
gdbm does not wait for writes to be flushed to the disk
before continuing. The following routine can be used to
guarantee that the database is physi- cally written to the
disk file.</p>

<p>gdbm_sync ( dbf )</p>

<p>It will not return until the disk file state is
syncronized with the in-memory state of the database.</p>

<p>To convert a gdbm error code into English text, use this
routine:</p>

<p>ret = gdbm_strerror ( errno )</p>

<p>Where errno is of type gdbm_error, usually the global
variable gdbm_errno. The appropiate phrase is returned.</p>

<p>Gdbm now supports the ability to set certain options on
an already open database.</p>

<p>ret = gdbm_setopt ( dbf, option, value, size )</p>

<p>Where dbf is the return value from a previous call to
gdbm_open, and option specifies which option to set. The
valid options are currently:</p>

<p>GDBM_CACHESIZE - Set the size of the internal bucket
cache. This option may only be set once on each GDBM_FILE
descriptor, and is set automatically to 100 upon the first
access to the database.</p>

<p>GDBM_FASTMODE - Set fast mode to either on or off. This
allows fast mode to be toggled on an already open and active
database. value (see below) should be set to either TRUE or
FALSE. This option is now obsolete.</p>

<p>GDBM_SYNCMODE - Turn on or off file system
synchronization opera- tions. This setting defaults to off;
value (see below) should be set to either TRUE or FALSE.</p>

<p>GDBM_CENTFREE - Set central free block pool to either on
or off. The default is off, which is how previous versions
of Gdbm handled free blocks. If set, this option causes all
subsequent free blocks to be placed in the global pool,
allowing (in thoery) more file space to be reused more
quickly. value (see below) should be set to either TRUE or
FALSE. NOTICE: This feature is still under study.</p>

<p>GDBM_COALESCEBLKS - Set free block merging to either on
or off. The default is off, which is how previous versions
of Gdbm handled free blocks. If set, this option causes
adjacent free blocks to be merged. This can become a CPU
expensive process with time, though, especially if used in
conjunction with GDBM_CENTFREE. value (see below) should be
set to either TRUE or FALSE. NOTICE: This feature is still
under study.</p>

<p>value is the value to set option to, specified as an
integer pointer. size is the size of the data pointed to by
value. The return value will be -1 upon failure, or 0 upon
success. The global variable gdbm_errno will be set upon
failure.</p>

<p>For instance, to set a database to use a cache of 10,
after opening it with gdbm_open, but prior to accessing it
in any way, the following code could be used:</p>

<p>int value = 10;</p>

<p>ret = gdbm_setopt( dbf, GDBM_CACHESIZE, &amp;value,
sizeof(int));</p>

<p>If the database was opened with the GDBM_NOLOCK flag,
the user may wish to perform their own file locking on the
database file in order to pre- vent multiple writers
operating on the same file simultaneously.</p>

<p>In order to support this, the gdbm_fdesc routine is
provided.</p>

<p>ret = gdbm_fdesc ( dbf )</p>

<p>Where dbf is the return value from a previous call to
gdbm_open. The return value will be the file descriptor of
the database.</p>

<p>The following two external variables may be useful:</p>

<p>gdbm_errno is the variable that contains more
information about gdbm errors. (gdbm.h has the definitions
of the error values and defines gdbm_errno as an external
variable.) gdbm_version is the string containing the version
information.</p>

<p>There are a few more things of interest. First, gdbm
files are not &quot;sparse&quot;. You can copy them with the
UNIX cp(1) command and they will not expand in the copying
process. Also, there is a compatibility mode for use with
programs that already use UNIX dbm. In this compatibility
mode, no gdbm file pointer is required by the programmer,
and only one file may be opened at a time. All users in
compatibility mode are assumed to be writers. If the gdbm
file is a read only, it will fail as a writer, but will also
try to open it as a reader. All returned pointers in datum
structures point to data that gdbm WILL free. They should be
treated as static pointers (as standard UNIX dbm does).</p>

<p>LINKING This library is accessed by specifying -lgdbm as
the last parameter to the compile line, e.g.:</p>

<p>gcc -o prog prog.c -lgdbm</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES NDBM_LOCK - When the NDBM
interface is used, the database file is locked by default.
Locking might degrade performance when used on a NFS share.
This environment variable can be set to false to tell GDBM
not to lock the database file.</p>
