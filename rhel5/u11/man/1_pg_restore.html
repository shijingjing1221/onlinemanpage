<p>PG_RESTORE(1) PostgreSQL Client Applications
PG_RESTORE(1)</p>

<p>NAME pg_restore - restore a PostgreSQL database from an
archive file created by pg_dump</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pg_restore [ option... ] [ filename ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pg_restore is a utility for restoring a
PostgreSQL database from an archive created by pg_dump(1) in
one of the non-plain-text formats. It will issue the
commands necessary to reconstruct the database to the state
it was in at the time it was saved. The archive files also
allow pg_restore to be selective about what is restored, or
even to reorder the items prior to being restored. The
archive files are designed to be portable across
architectures.</p>

<p>pg_restore can operate in two modes. If a database name
is specified, pg_restore connects to that database and
restores archive contents directly into the database.
Otherwise, a script containing the SQL com- mands necessary
to rebuild the database is created and written to a file or
standard output. This script output is equivalent to the
plain text output format of pg_dump. Some of the options
controlling the output are therefore analogous to pg_dump
options.</p>

<p>Obviously, pg_restore cannot restore information that is
not present in the archive file. For instance, if the
archive was made using the dump data as INSERT commands
option, pg_restore will not be able to load the data using
COPY statements.</p>

<p>OPTIONS pg_restore accepts the following command line
arguments.</p>

<p>filename Specifies the location of the archive file to
be restored. If not specified, the standard input is
used.</p>

<p>-a</p>

<p>--data-only Restore only the data, not the schema (data
definitions).</p>

<p>-c</p>

<p>--clean Clean (drop) database objects before recreating
them.</p>

<p>-C</p>

<p>--create Create the database before restoring into it.
(When this option is used, the database named with -d is
used only to issue the initial CREATE DATABASE command. All
data is restored into the database name that appears in the
archive.)</p>

<p>-d dbname</p>

<p>--dbname=dbname Connect to database dbname and restore
directly into the database.</p>

<p>-e</p>

<p>--exit-on-error Exit if an error is encountered while
sending SQL commands to the database. The default is to
continue and to display a count of errors at the end of the
restoration.</p>

<p>-f filename</p>

<p>--file=filename Specify output file for generated
script, or for the listing when used with -l. Default is the
standard output.</p>

<p>-F format</p>

<p>--format=format Specify format of the archive. It is not
necessary to specify the format, since pg_restore will
determine the format automati- cally. If specified, it can
be one of the following:</p>

<p>t The archive is a tar archive.</p>

<p>c The archive is in the custom format of pg_dump.</p>

<p>-i</p>

<p>--ignore-version Ignore database version checks.</p>

<p>-I index</p>

<p>--index=index Restore definition of named index
only.</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>--list List the contents of the archive. The output of
this operation can be used as input to the -L option. Note
that if filtering switches such as -n or -t are used with
-l, they will restrict the items listed.</p>

<p>-L list-file</p>

<p>--use-list=list-file Restore only those archive elements
that are listed in list- file, and restore them in the order
they appear in the file. Note that if filtering switches
such as -n or -t are used with -L, they will further
restrict the items restored.</p>

<p>list-file is normally created by editing the output of a
previ- ous -l operation. Lines can be moved or removed, and
can also be commented out by placing a semicolon (;) at the
start of the line. See below for examples.</p>

<p>-n namespace</p>

<p>--schema=schema Restore only objects that are in the
named schema. This can be combined with the -t option to
restore just a specific table.</p>

<p>-O</p>

<p>--no-owner Do not output commands to set ownership of
objects to match the original database. By default,
pg_restore issues ALTER OWNER or SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION
statements to set ownership of created schema elements.
These statements will fail unless the initial connection to
the database is made by a superuser (or the same user that
owns all of the objects in the script). With -O, any user
name can be used for the initial connection, and this user
will own all the created objects.</p>

<p>-P function-name(argtype [, ...])</p>

<p>--function=function-name(argtype [, ...]) Restore the
named function only. Be careful to spell the func- tion name
and arguments exactly as they appear in the dump files table
of contents.</p>

<p>-R</p>

<p>--no-reconnect This option is obsolete but still
accepted for backwards compat- ibility.</p>

<p>-s</p>

<p>--schema-only Restore only the schema (data
definitions), not the data (table contents). Sequence
current values will not be restored, either. (Do not confuse
this with the --schema option, which uses the word schema in
a different meaning.)</p>

<p>-S username</p>

<p>--superuser=username Specify the superuser user name to
use when disabling triggers. This is only relevant if
--disable-triggers is used.</p>

<p>-t table</p>

<p>--table=table Restore definition and/or data of named
table only.</p>

<p>-T trigger</p>

<p>--trigger=trigger Restore named trigger only.</p>

<p>-v</p>

<p>--verbose Specifies verbose mode.</p>

<p>-x</p>

<p>--no-privileges</p>

<p>--no-acl Prevent restoration of access privileges
(grant/revoke com- mands).</p>

<p>-X use-set-session-authorization</p>

<p>--use-set-session-authorization Output SQL-standard SET
SESSION AUTHORIZATION commands instead of ALTER OWNER
commands to determine object ownership. This makes the dump
more standards compatible, but depending on the history of
the objects in the dump, may not restore properly.</p>

<p>-X disable-triggers</p>

<p>--disable-triggers This option is only relevant when
performing a data-only restore. It instructs pg_restore to
execute commands to temporarily disable triggers on the
target tables while the data is reloaded. Use this if you
have referential integrity checks or other triggers on the
tables that you do not want to invoke during data
reload.</p>

<p>Presently, the commands emitted for --disable-triggers
must be done as superuser. So, you should also specify a
superuser name with -S, or preferably run pg_restore as a
PostgreSQL superuser.</p>

<p>pg_restore also accepts the following command line
arguments for con- nection parameters:</p>

<p>-h host</p>

<p>--host=host Specifies the host name of the machine on
which the server is running. If the value begins with a
slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain
socket. The default is taken from the PGHOST environment
variable, if set, else a Unix domain socket connection is
attempted.</p>

<p>-p port</p>

<p>--port=port Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain
socket file exten- sion on which the server is listening for
connections. Defaults to the PGPORT environment variable, if
set, or a compiled-in default.</p>

<p>-U username Connect as the given user</p>

<p>-W Force a password prompt. This should happen
automatically if the server requires password
authentication.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT PGHOST</p>

<p>PGPORT</p>

<p>PGUSER Default connection parameters</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS When a direct database connection is
specified using the -d option, pg_restore internally
executes SQL statements. If you have problems running
pg_restore, make sure you are able to select information
from the database using, for example, psql(1).</p>

<p>NOTES If your installation has any local additions to
the template1 database, be careful to load the output of
pg_restore into a truly empty database; otherwise you are
likely to get errors due to duplicate defi- nitions of the
added objects. To make an empty database without any local
additions, copy from template0 not template1, for
example:</p>

<p>CREATE DATABASE foo WITH TEMPLATE template0;</p>

<p>The limitations of pg_restore are detailed below.</p>

<p>&middot; When restoring data to a pre-existing table and
the option --disable- triggers is used, pg_restore emits
commands to disable triggers on user tables before inserting
the data then emits commands to re- enable them after the
data has been inserted. If the restore is stopped in the
middle, the system catalogs may be left in the wrong
state.</p>

<p>&middot; pg_restore will not restore large objects for a
single table. If an archive contains large objects, then all
large objects will be restored.</p>

<p>See also the pg_dump(1) documentation for details on
limitations of pg_dump.</p>

<p>Once restored, it is wise to run ANALYZE on each
restored table so the optimizer has useful statistics.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To dump a database called mydb to a tar
file:</p>

<p>$ pg_dump -Ft mydb &gt; db.tar</p>

<p>To reload this dump into an existing database called
newdb:</p>

<p>$ pg_restore -d newdb db.tar</p>

<p>To reorder database items, it is first necessary to dump
the table of contents of the archive:</p>

<p>$ pg_restore -l archive.file &gt; archive.list</p>

<p>The listing file consists of a header and one line for
each item, e.g.,</p>

<p>; ; Archive created at Fri Jul 28 22:28:36 2000 ;
dbname: birds ; TOC Entries: 74 ; Compression: 0 ; Dump
Version: 1.4-0 ; Format: CUSTOM ; ; ; Selected TOC Entries:
; 2; 145344 TABLE species postgres 3; 145344 ACL species 4;
145359 TABLE nt_header postgres 5; 145359 ACL nt_header 6;
145402 TABLE species_records postgres 7; 145402 ACL
species_records 8; 145416 TABLE ss_old postgres 9; 145416
ACL ss_old 10; 145433 TABLE map_resolutions postgres 11;
145433 ACL map_resolutions 12; 145443 TABLE hs_old postgres
13; 145443 ACL hs_old</p>

<p>Semicolons start a comment, and the numbers at the start
of lines refer to the internal archive ID assigned to each
item.</p>

<p>Lines in the file can be commented out, deleted, and
reordered. For example,</p>

<p>10; 145433 TABLE map_resolutions postgres ;2; 145344
TABLE species postgres ;4; 145359 TABLE nt_header postgres
6; 145402 TABLE species_records postgres ;8; 145416 TABLE
ss_old postgres</p>

<p>could be used as input to pg_restore and would only
restore items 10 and 6, in that order:</p>

<p>$ pg_restore -L archive.list archive.file</p>

<p>HISTORY The pg_restore utility first appeared in
PostgreSQL 7.1.</p>
