<p>openipmi_conparms(7) Connection Parameters for OpenIPMI
openipmi_conparms(7)</p>

<p>NAME openipmi_conparms - Connection parameters for
OpenIPMI</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smi smi-num</p>

<p>lan [-U username] [-P password] [-p[2] port] [-A
authtype] [-L privi- lege] [-s] [-Ra auth alg] [-Ri integ
alg] [-Rc conf algo] [-Rl] [-Rk bmc key] [-H hackname] host
[ host]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The connection parameters for OpenIPMI vary
depending on the connection type. This document describes
the standard connection types; others may be available from
OEMs.</p>

<p>OPTIONS smi-num The SMI interface for the local
connection. There may be more than one BMC connection on a
system and they are generally num- bered, like /dev/ipmi0,
/dev/ipmi1, etc.</p>

<p>-U username Use the given username for the LAN
connection. If none is given, then no username is used.</p>

<p>-P password The password to use for the connection. If
none is given, the user is assumed to have an empty
password</p>

<p>-p[2] port The UCP port to connect to. This defaults to
the standard 623 port, so it is not necessary unless a
special port is required. Note that since you can have two
connections (hosts), -p is for the first host and -p2 is for
the second host.</p>

<p>-A authtype The authentication type to use, one of
rmcp+, md5, md2, straight, or none. If you dont supply this,
the most secure one available is chosen, in the order given
in the previous list.</p>

<p>-L privilege The privilege to use for the connection.
Lower privileges can- not execute some commands. Privileges
are: callback, user, operator, admin, and oem. The default
is admin.</p>

<p>-Ra authentication algorithm Set the RMCP+
authentication algorithm to use. Options are: bmcpick,
rakp_none, rakp_hmac_sha1, and rakp_hmac_md5. The bmcpick
option is used by default, which means the BMC picks the
algorithm it wants to use.</p>

<p>-Ri integrity algorithm The RMCP+ integrity algorithm to
use. This ensures that the data has not be altered between
the sender and receiver. Valid options are: bmcpick, none,
hmac_sha1, hmac_md5, and md5. The bmcpick option is used by
default, which means the BMC picks the algorithm it wants to
use.</p>

<p>-Rc confidentiality algorithm The RMCP+ confidentiality
(encryption) algorithm to use. This keeps evesdroppers from
seeing the data. Valid values are: bmcpick, aes_cbc_128,
xrc4_128, and xrc_40. The bmcpick option is used by default,
which means the BMC picks the algorithm it wants to use.</p>

<p>-Rl If this is specified, the username is looked up
using the privi- lege level along with the username. This
allows the same name to have different passwords with
different privilege levels.</p>

<p>-Rk BMC Key If the system requires two-key lookups, this
specifies the sec- ond key (the BMC key) to use. This is
ignored if two-key lookups are not enabled by the BMC.</p>

<p>-H hackname Well, it always happens. Things in the field
don t work quite like they are supposed to. There was some
vagueness in the first IPMI specs and different vendors
interpreted RMCP+ in dif- ferent ways. This allows different
options to be supported. Try different hacks if your RMCP+
systems don t authenticate properly. These are:</p>

<p>rakp3_wrong_rolem Some systems use the incorrect Role(m)
field in a spe- cific authentication message (the RAKP3
message). This is a common problem.</p>

<p>rmcpp_integ_sik The original IPMI 2.0 spec specified the
incorrect key to use for the integrity key. This forces use
of the Ses- sion Initiation Key. The default is to use
K(1)</p>

<p>-s Make two connections to the BMC. This means the BMC
has two different IP addresses/ports that are equivalent. If
this is specified, a second host must be supplied. This is
not the same as two connections to two different BMCs. This
must be a con- nection to the same BMC.</p>

<p>host The IP address (either by name lookup or specified
directly) to connect to. If the -s is specified, two hosts
must be supplied.</p>

<p>The -Ra, -Ri, -Rc, -Rk and -Rl options only apply to
RMCP+ connections and will be ignored if the connection does
not support RMCP+ or if a non-RMCP+ authentication type is
specified.</p>

<p>KNOWN PROBLEMS This is excessively complicated, but the
defaults should be good.</p>
