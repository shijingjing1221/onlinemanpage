<p>NAME acpid - Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
event daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS acpid [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION acpid is designed to notify user-space
programs of ACPI events. acpid should be started during the
system boot, and will run as a background process, by
default. It will open an events file (/proc/acpi/event by
default) and attempt to read whole lines. When a line is
received (an event), acpid will examine a list of rules, and
execute the rules that match the event.</p>

<p>Rules are defined by simple configuration files. acpid
will look in a configuration directory (/etc/acpi/events by
default), and parse all files that do not begin with a
period (.). Each file must define two things: an event and
an action. Any blank lines, or lines where the first
character is a pound sign ( # ) are ignored. Extraneous
lines are flagged as warnings, but are not fatal. Each line
has three tokens: the key, a literal equal sign, and the
value. The key can be up to 63 characters, and is
case-insensitive (but whitespace matters). The value can be
up to 511 characters, and is case and whitespace sen-
sitive.</p>

<p>The event value is a regular expression (see
regcomp(3)), against which events are matched.</p>

<p>The action value is a commandline, which will be invoked
via /bin/sh whenever an event matching the rule in question
occurs. The command- line may include shell-special
characters, and they will be preserved. The only special
characters in an action value are &quot;%&quot; escaped. The
string &quot;%e&quot; will be replaced by the literal text
of the event for which the action was invoked. This string
may contain spaces, so the comman- dline must take care to
quote the &quot;%e&quot; if it wants a single token. The
string &quot;%%&quot; will be replaced by a literal
&quot;%&quot;. All other &quot;%&quot; escapes are reserved,
and will cause a rule to not load.</p>

<p>This feature allows multiple rules to be defined for the
same event (though no ordering is guaranteed), as well as
one rule to be defined for multiple events. To force acpid
to reload the rule configuration, send it a SIGHUP.</p>

<p>In addition to rule files, acpid also accepts
connections on a UNIX domain socket (/var/run/acpid.socket
by default). Any application may connect to this socket.
Once connected, acpid will send the text of all ACPI events
to the client. The client has the responsibility of
filtering for messages about which it cares. acpid will not
close the client socket except in the case of a SIGHUP or
acpid exiting.</p>

<p>acpid will log all of it s activities, as well as the
stdout and stderr of any actions to a log file
(/var/log/acpid by default).</p>

<p>All the default file and directories can be changed with
commandline options.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c, --confdir directory This option changes the
directory in which acpid looks for rule configuration files.
Default is /etc/acpi/events.</p>

<p>-C, --clientmax number This option changes the maximum
number of non-root socket connections which can be made to
the acpid socket. Default is 256.</p>

<p>-d, --debug This option increases the acpid debug level
by one. If the debug level is non-zero, acpid will run in
the foreground, and will log to stdout/stderr, rather than a
log file.</p>

<p>-e, --eventfile filename This option changes the event
file from which acpid reads events. Default is
/proc/acpi/event.</p>

<p>-g, --socketgroup groupname This option changes the
group ownership of the UNIX domain socket to which acpid
publishes events.</p>

<p>-l, --logfile filename This option changes the log file
to which acpid writes. Default is /var/log/acpid.</p>

<p>-m, --socketmode mode This option changes the
permissions of the UNIX domain socket to which acpid
publishes events. Default is 0666.</p>

<p>-s, --socketfile filename This option changes the name
of the UNIX domain socket which acpid opens. Default is
/var/run/acpid.socket.</p>

<p>-S, --nosocket filename This option tells acpid not to
open a UNIX domain socket. This overrides the -s option, and
negates all other socket options.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show help and exit.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE This example - placed in /etc/acpi/events/power
- will shut down your system if you press the power
button.</p>

<p>event=button/power.* action=/usr/local/sbin/power.sh
&quot;%e&quot;</p>

<p>The script power.sh gets called and will see the
complete event string as parameter $1.</p>
