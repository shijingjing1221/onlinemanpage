<p>NAME xmlto - apply an XSL stylesheet to an XML
document</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xmlto [-o output_dir] [-x custom_xsl] [-m
xsl_fragment] [-v] [-p postprocessor_opts] [--extensions]
[--searchpath path] [--skip-validation] {format} {file}</p>

<p>xmlto {[--help] [--version]}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The purpose of xmlto is to convert an XML
file to the desired format using whatever means necessary.
This may involve two steps:</p>

<p>1. The application of an appropriate XSL stylesheet
using an XSL-T processor.</p>

<p>2. Further processing with other tools. This step may
not be necessary.</p>

<p>To decide which stylesheet to use and what, if any,
needs to be done to post-process the output, xmlto makes use
of format scripts, which are simple shell scripts that xmlto
calls during the conversion.</p>

<p>The appropriate format script is selected based on the
type of XML file and the desired output format. xmlto comes
with some format scripts for converting DocBook XML files to
a variety of formats. You may specify your own format script
by using an absolute filename for format on the command
line.</p>

<p>Firstly, if xmlto has not been told explicitly which
stylesheet to use (with the -x option), the format script
will be called with $1 set to stylesheet. The environment
variable XSLT_PROCESSOR contains the base name of the
executable that will be used to perform the XSL-T
transformation (for example xsltproc), and the environment
variable XSL_DIR contains the path to the directory
containing some useful stylesheets that come with xmlto. The
format script should write the name of the stylesheet to use
to standard output and exit successfully, or exit with a
non-zero return code if there is no appropriate stylesheet
to use (for example, if the only available stylesheet is
known not to work with the XSL-T processor that will be
used). If nothing is written to standard output but the
script exits successfully, no XSL-T transformation will be
performed.</p>

<p>Secondly, after an XSL-T processor has been run using
the stylesheet, the format script will be called again, this
time with $1 set to post-process. The format script should
perform any necessary steps to translate the XSL-T processed
output into the desired output format, including copying the
output to the desired output directory. For post-processing,
the format script is run in a temporary directory containing
just the processed output (whose name is stored in
XSLT_PROCESSED and whose basename is that of the original
XML file with any filename extension replaced with
INPUT_FILE is set to the name of the original XML file,
OUTPUT_DIR is set to the name of the directory that the
output (and only the output) must end up in, and SEARCHPATH
is set to a colon-separate list of fallback directories in
which to look for input (for images, for example). If this
step is unsuccessful the format script should exit with a
non-zero return code.</p>

<p>-v Be verbose (-vv for very verbose).</p>

<p>-x stylesheet Use stylesheet instead of asking the
format script to choose one.</p>

<p>-m fragment Use the provided XSL fragment to modify the
stylesheet.</p>

<p>-o directory Put output in the specified directory
instead of the current working directory.</p>

<p>-p postprocessor_opts Pass postprocessor_opts to
processing stages after stylesheet application (e.g. lynx or
links when going through HTML to text, or xmltex when going
from through TeX to DVI). If -p is specified a second time,
the options specified will be passed to second-stage
postprocessing; presently this is only applicable when going
through xmltex and dvips to PostScript.</p>

<p>--extensions Turn on stylesheet extensions for the tool
chain in use (for example, this might turn on
passivetex.extensions and use.extensions if PassiveTeX is
being used). The variables turned on are the ones used by
Norman Walsh s DocBook XSL stylesheets.</p>

<p>--searchpath path Add the colon-separated list of
directories in path as fallback directories for including
input.</p>

<p>--skip-validation Skip the validation step that is
normally performed.</p>

<p>--help Display a short usage message. It will describe
xmltos options, and the available output formats.</p>

<p>--version Display the version number of xmlto.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To convert a DocBook XML document to PDF,
use:</p>

<p>xmlto pdf mydoc.xml</p>

<p>To convert a DocBook XML document to HTML and store the
resulting HTML files in a separate directory use:</p>

<p>xmlto -o html-dir html mydoc.xml</p>

<p>To convert a DocBook XML document to a single HTML file
use:</p>

<p>xmlto html-nochunks mydoc.xml</p>

<p>To modify the output using an XSL fragment use:</p>

<p>xmlto -m ulink.xsl pdf mydoc.xml</p>

<p>To specify which stylesheet to use (overriding the one
that the format script would choose) use:</p>

<p>xmlto -x mystylesheet.xsl pdf mydoc.xml</p>
