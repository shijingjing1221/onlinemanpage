<p>sane-mustek_usb2(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-mustek_usb2(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-mustek_usb2 - SANE backend for SQ113 based USB
flatbed scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-mustek_usb2 library implements a
SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access
to USB flatbed scanners based on the Service &amp; Quality
SQ113 chipset. At the moment, only the Mustek BearPaw 2448
TA Pro is supported. Its planned to add support for other
scan- ners that are based on the SQ113 and maybe SQ11 chip.
For more details, see the mustek_usb2 backend homepage:
http://www.meier- geinitz.de/sane/mustek_usb2-backend/.</p>

<p>This is BETA software. Especially if you test new or
untested scanners, keep your hand at the scanners plug and
unplug it, if the head bumps at the end of the scan
area.</p>

<p>If you own a scanner other than the ones listed on the
mustek_usb2 homepage that works with this backend, please
let me know this by send- ing the scanner s exact model name
and the USB vendor and device ids (e.g. from
sane-find-scanner or syslog) to me. Even if the scanners
name is only slightly different from the models already
listed as sup- ported, please let me know.</p>

<p>LIBUSB ISSUES Please use libusb-0.1.8 or later. Without
libusb or with older libusb versions all kinds of trouble
can be expected. The scanner should be found by
sane-find-scanner without further actions. For setting
permis- sions and general USB information looks at
sane-usb(5).</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib*/sane/libsane-mustek_usb2.a The static
library implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib*/sane/libsane-mustek_usb2.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_USB2 If the library was
compiled with debug support enabled, this environment
variable controls the debug level for this backend. Higher
debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.</p>

<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_USB2=4</p>

feature: &lt;henning@meier- geinitz.de&gt;. Please send a
debug log if your scanner isnt detected correctly (see
