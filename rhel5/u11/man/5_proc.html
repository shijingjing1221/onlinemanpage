<p>PROC(5) Linux Programmer s Manual PROC(5)</p>

<p>NAME proc - process information pseudo-filesystem</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The proc filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem
which is used as an inter- face to kernel data structures.
It is commonly mounted at /proc. Most of it is read-only,
but some files allow kernel variables to be changed.</p>

<p>The following outline gives a quick tour through the
/proc hierarchy.</p>

<p>/proc/[number] There is a numerical subdirectory for
each running process; the subdirectory is named by the
process ID. Each such subdirectory contains the following
pseudo-files and directories.</p>

<p>/proc/[number]/cmdline This holds the complete command
line for the process, unless the whole process has been
swapped out or the process is a zombie. In either of these
latter cases, there is nothing in this file: i.e. a read on
this file will return 0 characters. The command line
arguments appear in this file as a set of null-separated
strings, with a further null byte after the last string.</p>

<p>/proc/[number]/cwd This is a symbolic link to the
current working directory of the process. To find out the
cwd of process 20, for instance, you can do this:</p>

<p>cd /proc/20/cwd; /bin/pwd</p>

<p>Note that the pwd command is often a shell builtin, and
might not work properly. In bash, you may use pwd -P.</p>

<p>In a multithreaded process, the contents of this
symbolic link are not available if the main thread has
already terminated (typically by calling
pthread_exit(3).</p>

<p>/proc/[number]/environ This file contains the
environment for the process. The entries are separated by
null bytes ( ), and there may be a null bytes at the end.
Thus, to print out the environment of process 1, you would
do:</p>

<p>(cat /proc/1/environ; echo) | tr &quot; 00&quot;
&quot;0</p>

<p>(For a reason why one should want to do this, see
lilo(8).)</p>

<p>/proc/[number]/exe Under Linux 2.2 and later, this file
is a symbolic link contain- ing the actual pathname of the
executed command. This symbolic link can be dereferenced
normally; attempting to open it will open the executable.
You can even type /proc/[number]/exe to run another copy of
the same executable as is being run by pro- cess [number].
In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic
link are not available if the main thread has already
terminated (typically by calling pthread_exit(3)).</p>

<p>Under Linux 2.0 and earlier /proc/[number]/exe is a
pointer to the binary which was executed, and appears as a
symbolic link. A readlink(2) call on this file under Linux
2.0 returns a string in the format:</p>

<p>[device]:inode</p>

<p>For example, [0301]:1502 would be inode 1502 on device
major 03 (IDE, MFM, etc. drives) minor 01 (first partition
on the first drive).</p>

<p>find(1) with the -inum option can be used to locate the
file.</p>

<p>/proc/[number]/fd This is a subdirectory containing one
entry for each file which the process has open, named by its
file descriptor, and which is a symbolic link to the actual
file. Thus, 0 is standard input, 1 standard output, 2
standard error, etc.</p>

<p>In a multithreaded process, the contents of this
directory are not available if the main thread has already
terminated (typi- cally by calling pthread_exit(3)).</p>

<p>Programs that will take a filename, but will not take
the stan- dard input, and which write to a file, but will
not send their output to standard output, can be effectively
foiled this way, assuming that -i is the flag designating an
input file and -o is the flag designating an output
file:</p>

<p>foobar -i /proc/self/fd/0 -o /proc/self/fd/1 ...</p>

<p>and you have a working filter.</p>

<p>/proc/self/fd/N is approximately the same as /dev/fd/N
in some UNIX and UNIX-like systems. Most Linux MAKEDEV
scripts symboli- cally link /dev/fd to /proc/self/fd, in
fact.</p>

<p>/proc/[number]/maps A file containing the currently
mapped memory regions and their access permissions.</p>

<p>The format is:</p>

<p>address perms offset dev inode pathname
08048000-08056000 r-xp 00000000 03:0c 64593 /usr/sbin/gpm
08056000-08058000 rw-p 0000d000 03:0c 64593 /usr/sbin/gpm
08058000-0805b000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0 40000000-40013000
r-xp 00000000 03:0c 4165 /lib/ld-2.2.4.so 40013000-40015000
rw-p 00012000 03:0c 4165 /lib/ld-2.2.4.so 4001f000-40135000
r-xp 00000000 03:0c 45494 /lib/libc-2.2.4.so
40135000-4013e000 rw-p 00115000 03:0c 45494
/lib/libc-2.2.4.so 4013e000-40142000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
bffff000-c0000000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0</p>

<p>where address is the address space in the process that
it occu- pies, perms is a set of permissions:</p>

<p>r = read w = write x = execute s = shared p = private
(copy on write)</p>

<p>offset is the offset into the file/whatever, dev is the
device (major:minor), and inode is the inode on that device.
0 indi- cates that no inode is associated with the memory
region, as the case would be with bss.</p>

<p>Under Linux 2.0 there is no field giving pathname.</p>

<p>/proc/[number]/mem This file can be used to access the
pages of a processs memory through open(2), read(2), and
fseek(3).</p>

<p>/proc/[number]/root Unix and Linux support the idea of a
per-process root of the filesystem, set by the chroot(2)
system call. This file is a symbolic link that points to the
processs root directory, and behaves as exe, fd/*, etc.
do.</p>

<p>In a multithreaded process, the contents of this
symbolic link are not available if the main thread has
already terminated (typically by calling
pthread_exit(3)).</p>

<p>/proc/[number]/smaps (since Linux 2.6.14) This file
shows memory consumption for each of the processs mappings.
For each of mappings there is a series of lines as
follows:</p>

<p>08048000-080bc000 r-xp 00000000 03:02 13130 /bin/bash
Size: 464 kB Rss: 424 kB Shared_Clean: 424 kB Shared_Dirty:
0 kB Private_Clean: 0 kB Private_Dirty: 0 kB</p>

<p>The first of these lines shows the same information as
is dis- played for the mapping in /proc/[number]/maps. The
remaining lines show the size of the mapping, the amount of
the mapping that is currently resident in RAM, the number
clean and dirty shared pages in the mapping, and the number
clean and dirty pri- vate pages in the mapping.</p>

<p>This file is only present if the CONFIG_MMU kernel
configuration option is enabled.</p>

<p>/proc/[number]/stat Status information about the
process. This is used by ps(1). It is defined in
/usr/src/linux/fs/proc/array.c.</p>

<p>The fields, in order, with their proper scanf(3) format
speci- fiers, are:</p>

<p>pid %d The process ID.</p>

<p>comm %s The filename of the executable, in parentheses.
This is visible whether or not the executable is swapped
out.</p>

<p>state %c One character from the string
&quot;RSDZTW&quot; where R is run- ning, S is sleeping in an
interruptible wait, D is wait- ing in uninterruptible disk
sleep, Z is zombie, T is traced or stopped (on a signal),
and W is paging.</p>

<p>ppid %d The PID of the parent.</p>

<p>pgrp %d The process group ID of the process.</p>

<p>session %d The session ID of the process.</p>

<p>tty_nr %d The tty the process uses.</p>

<p>tpgid %d The process group ID of the process which
currently owns the tty that the process is connected to.</p>

<p>flags %lu The kernel flags word of the process. For bit
meanings, see the PF_* defines in &lt;linux/sched.h&gt;.
Details depend on the kernel version.</p>

<p>minflt %lu The number of minor faults the process has
made which have not required loading a memory page from
disk.</p>

<p>cminflt %lu The number of minor faults that the process
s waited-for children have made.</p>

<p>majflt %lu The number of major faults the process has
made which have required loading a memory page from
disk.</p>

<p>cmajflt %lu The number of major faults that the process
s waited-for children have made.</p>

<p>utime %lu The number of jiffies that this process has
been sched- uled in user mode.</p>

<p>stime %lu The number of jiffies that this process has
been sched- uled in kernel mode.</p>

<p>cutime %ld The number of jiffies that this processs
waited-for children have been scheduled in user mode. (See
also times(2).)</p>

<p>cstime %ld The number of jiffies that this processs
waited-for children have been scheduled in kernel mode.</p>

<p>priority %ld (Explanation for Linux 2.6) For processes
running a real- time scheduling policy (policy below; see
sched_setsched- uler(2)), this is the negated scheduling
priority, minus one; that is, a number in the range -2 to
-100, corre- sponding to real-time priorities 1 to 99. For
processes running under a non-real-time scheduling policy,
this is the raw nice value (setpriority(2)) as represented
in the kernel. The kernel stores nice values as numbers in
the range 0 (high) to 39 (low), corresponding to the user-
visible nice range of -20 to 19.</p>

<p>Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on the
scheduler weighting given to this process.</p>

<p>nice %ld The nice value ranges from 19 (nicest) to -19
(not nice to others).</p>

<p>num_threads %ld Number of threads in this process (since
Linux 2.6). Before kernel 2.6, this field was hard coded to
0 as a placeholder for an earlier removed field.</p>

<p>itrealvalue %ld The time in jiffies before the next
SIGALRM is sent to the process due to an interval timer.</p>

<p>starttime %lu The time in jiffies the process started
after system boot.</p>

<p>vsize %lu Virtual memory size in bytes.</p>

<p>rss %ld Resident Set Size: number of pages the process
has in real memory, minus 3 for administrative purposes.
This is just the pages which count towards text, data, or
stack space. This does not include pages which have not been
demand-loaded in, or which are swapped out.</p>

<p>rlim %lu Current limit in bytes on the rss of the
process (usually 4294967295 on i386).</p>

<p>startcode %lu The address above which program text can
run.</p>

<p>endcode %lu The address below which program text can
run.</p>

<p>startstack %lu The address of the start of the
stack.</p>

<p>kstkesp %lu The current value of esp (stack pointer), as
found in the kernel stack page for the process.</p>

<p>kstkeip %lu The current EIP (instruction pointer).</p>

<p>signal %lu The bitmap of pending signals.</p>

<p>blocked %lu The bitmap of blocked signals.</p>

<p>sigignore %lu The bitmap of ignored signals.</p>

<p>sigcatch %lu The bitmap of caught signals.</p>

<p>wchan %lu This is the &quot;channel&quot; in which the
process is waiting. It is the address of a system call, and
can be looked up in a namelist if you need a textual name.
(If you have an up-to-date /etc/psdatabase, then try ps -l
to see the WCHAN field in action.)</p>

<p>nswap %lu Number of pages swapped (not maintained).</p>

<p>cnswap %lu Cumulative nswap for child processes (not
maintained).</p>

<p>exit_signal %d Signal to be sent to parent when we
die.</p>

<p>processor %d CPU number last executed on.</p>

<p>rt_priority %lu (since kernel 2.5.19) Real-time
scheduling priority (see sched_setsched- uler(2)).</p>

<p>policy %lu (since kernel 2.5.19) Scheduling policy (see
sched_setscheduler(2)).</p>

<p>delayacct_blkio_ticks %llu (since Linux 2.6.18)
Aggregated block I/O delays, measured in clock ticks
(centiseconds).</p>

<p>/proc/[number]/statm Provides information about memory
status in pages. The columns are: size total program size
resident resident set size share shared pages text text
(code) lib library data data/stack dt dirty pages (unused in
Linux 2.6)</p>

<p>/proc/[number]/status Provides much of the information
in /proc/[number]/stat and /proc/[number]/statm in a format
thats easier for humans to parse.</p>

<p>/proc/[number]/task (since kernel 2.6.0-test6) This is a
directory that contains one subdirectory for each thread in
the process. The name of each subdirectory is the numerical
thread ID of the thread (see gettid(2)). Within each of
these subdirectories, there is a set of files with the same
names and contents as under the /proc/[number] directories.
For attributes that are shared by all threads, the contents
for each of the files under the task/[thread-ID]
subdirectories will be the same as in the corresponding file
in the parent /proc/[num- ber] directory (e.g., in a
multithreaded process, all of the task/[thread-ID]/cwd files
will have the same value as the /proc/[number]/cwd file in
the parent directory, since all of the threads in a process
share a working directory). For attributes that are distinct
for each thread, the corresponding files under
task/[thread-ID] may have different values (e.g., various
fields in each of the task/[thread-ID]/status files may be
different for each thread).</p>

<p>In a multithreaded process, the contents of the
/proc/[num- ber]/task directory are not available if the
main thread has already terminated (typically by calling
pthread_exit(3)).</p>

<p>/proc/apm Advanced power management version and battery
information when CONFIG_APM is defined at kernel compilation
time.</p>

<p>/proc/bus Contains subdirectories for installed
busses.</p>

<p>/proc/bus/pccard Subdirectory for pcmcia devices when
CONFIG_PCMCIA is set at kernel compilation time.</p>

<p>/proc/bus/pccard/drivers</p>

<p>/proc/bus/pci Contains various bus subdirectories and
pseudo-files containing information about pci busses,
installed devices, and device drivers. Some of these files
are not ASCII.</p>

<p>/proc/bus/pci/devices Information about pci devices.
They may be accessed through lspci(8) and setpci(8).</p>

<p>/proc/cmdline Arguments passed to the Linux kernel at
boot time. Often done via a boot manager such as
lilo(1).</p>

<p>/proc/cpuinfo This is a collection of CPU and system
architecture dependent items, for each supported
architecture a different list. Two common entries are
processor which gives CPU number and bogomips; a system
constant that is calculated during kernel initialization.
SMP machines have information for each CPU.</p>

<p>/proc/devices Text listing of major numbers and device
groups. This can be used by MAKEDEV scripts for consistency
with the kernel.</p>

<p>/proc/diskstats (since Linux 2.5.69) This file contains
disk I/O statistics for each disk device. See the kernel
source file Documentation/iostats.txt for further
information.</p>

<p>/proc/dma This is a list of the registered ISA DMA
(direct memory access) channels in use.</p>

<p>/proc/driver Empty subdirectory.</p>

<p>/proc/execdomains List of the execution domains (ABI
personalities).</p>

<p>/proc/fb Frame buffer information when CONFIG_FB is
defined during kernel compilation.</p>

<p>/proc/filesystems A text listing of the filesystems
which were compiled into the kernel. Incidentally, this is
used by mount(1) to cycle through different filesystems when
none is specified.</p>

<p>/proc/fs Empty subdirectory.</p>

<p>/proc/ide This directory exists on systems with the ide
bus. There are directories for each ide channel and attached
device. Files include:</p>

<p>cache buffer size in KB capacity number of sectors
driver driver version geometry physical and logical geometry
identify in hexadecimal media media type model manufacturers
model number settings drive settings smart_thresholds in
hexadecimal smart_values in hexadecimal</p>

<p>The hdparm(8) utility provides access to this
information in a friendly format.</p>

<p>/proc/interrupts This is used to record the number of
interrupts per each IRQ on (at least) the i386 architecture.
Very easy to read formatting, done in ASCII.</p>

<p>/proc/iomem I/O memory map in Linux 2.4.</p>

<p>/proc/ioports This is a list of currently registered
Input-Output port regions that are in use.</p>

<p>/proc/kallsyms (since Linux 2.5.71) This holds the
kernel exported symbol definitions used by the modules(X)
tools to dynamically link and bind loadable modules. In
Linux 2.5.47 and earlier, a similar file with slightly dif-
ferent syntax was named ksyms.</p>

<p>/proc/kcore This file represents the physical memory of
the system and is stored in the ELF core file format. With
this pseudo-file, and an unstripped kernel
(/usr/src/linux/vmlinux) binary, GDB can be used to examine
the current state of any kernel data structures.</p>

<p>The total length of the file is the size of physical
memory (RAM) plus 4KB.</p>

<p>/proc/kmsg This file can be used instead of the
syslog(2) system call to read kernel messages. A process
must have superuser privileges to read this file, and only
one process should read this file. This file should not be
read if a syslog process is running which uses the syslog(2)
system call facility to log kernel mes- sages.</p>

<p>Information in this file is retrieved with the dmesg(8)
program.</p>

<p>/proc/ksyms (Linux 1.1.23-2.5.47) See
/proc/kallsyms.</p>

<p>/proc/loadavg The first three fields in this file are
load average figures giving the number of jobs in the run
queue (state R) or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged
over 1, 5, and 15 minutes. They are the same as the load
average numbers given by uptime(1) and other programs. The
fourth field consists of two numbers sepa- rated by a slash
(/). The first of these is the number of cur- rently
executing kernel scheduling entities (processes, threads);
this will be less than or equal to the number of CPUs. The
value after the slash is the number of kernel scheduling
entities that currently exist on the system. The fifth field
is the PID of the process that was most recently created on
the system.</p>

<p>/proc/locks This file shows current file locks (flock(2)
and fcntl(2)) and leases (fcntl(2)).</p>

<p>/proc/malloc This file is only present if
CONFIGDEBUGMALLOC was defined dur- ing compilation.</p>

<p>/proc/meminfo This is used by free(1) to report the
amount of free and used memory (both physical and swap) on
the system as well as the shared memory and buffers used by
the kernel.</p>

<p>It is in the same format as free(1), except in bytes
rather than KB.</p>

<p>/proc/mounts This is a list of all the file systems
currently mounted on the system. The format of this file is
documented in fstab(5). Since kernel version 2.6.15, this
file is pollable: after open- ing the file for reading, a
change in this file (i.e., a file system mount or unmount)
causes select(2) to mark the file descriptor as readable,
and poll(2) and epoll_wait(2) mark the file as having an
error condition.</p>

<p>/proc/modules A text list of the modules that have been
loaded by the system. See also lsmod(8).</p>

<p>/proc/mtrr Memory Type Range Registers. See
/usr/share/doc/kernel- doc-2.6.18/Documentation/mtrr.txt for
details.</p>

<p>/proc/net various net pseudo-files, all of which give
the status of some part of the networking layer. These files
contain ASCII struc- tures and are, therefore, readable with
cat. However, the stan- dard netstat(8) suite provides much
cleaner access to these files.</p>

<p>/proc/net/arp This holds an ASCII readable dump of the
kernel ARP table used for address resolutions. It will show
both dynamically learned and pre-programmed ARP entries. The
format is:</p>

<p>IP address HW type Flags HW address Mask Device
192.168.0.50 0x1 0x2 00:50:BF:25:68:F3 * eth0 192.168.0.250
0x1 0xc 00:00:00:00:00:00 * eth0</p>

<p>Here IP address is the IPv4 address of the machine and
the HW type is the hardware type of the address from RFC
826. The flags are the internal flags of the ARP structure
(as defined in /usr/include/linux/if_arp.h) and the HW
address is the data link layer mapping for that IP address
if it is known.</p>

<p>/proc/net/dev The dev pseudo-file contains network
device status information. This gives the number of received
and sent packets, the number of errors and collisions and
other basic statistics. These are used by the ifconfig(8)
program to report device status. The format is:</p>

<p>Inter-| Receive | Transmit face |bytes packets errs drop
fifo frame compressed multicast|bytes packets errs drop fifo
colls carrier compressed lo: 2776770 11307 0 0 0 0 0 0

<p>/proc/net/dev_mcast Defined in
/usr/src/linux/net/core/dev_mcast.c: indx interface_name
dmi_u dmi_g dmi_address 2 eth0 1 0 01005e000001 3 eth1 1 0
01005e000001 4 eth2 1 0 01005e000001</p>

<p>/proc/net/igmp Internet Group Management Protocol.
Defined in /usr/src/linux/net/core/igmp.c.</p>

<p>/proc/net/rarp This file uses the same format as the arp
file and contains the current reverse mapping database used
to provide rarp(8) reverse address lookup services. If RARP
is not configured into the ker- nel, this file will not be
present.</p>

<p>/proc/net/raw Holds a dump of the RAW socket table. Much
of the information is not of use apart from debugging. The
sl value is the kernel hash slot for the socket, the local
address is the local address and protocol number
pair.&quot;St&quot; is the internal status of the socket.
The &quot;tx_queue&quot; and &quot;rx_queue&quot; are the
outgoing and incoming data queue in terms of kernel memory
usage. The &quot;tr&quot;, &quot;tm-&gt;when&quot;, and
&quot;rexmits&quot; fields are not used by RAW. The
&quot;uid&quot; field holds the effective UID of the creator
of the socket.</p>

<p>/proc/net/snmp This file holds the ASCII data needed for
the IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP management information bases for
an snmp agent.</p>

<p>/proc/net/tcp Holds a dump of the TCP socket table. Much
of the information is not of use apart from debugging. The
&quot;sl&quot; value is the kernel hash slot for the socket,
the &quot;local address&quot; is the local address and port
number pair. The &quot;remote address&quot; is the remote
address and port number pair (if connected). St is the
internal status of the socket. The tx_queue and rx_queue are
the outgoing and incoming data queue in terms of kernel mem-
ory usage. The &quot;tr&quot;, &quot;tm-&gt;when&quot;, and
&quot;rexmits&quot; fields hold internal information of the
kernel socket state and are only useful for debugging. The
&quot;uid&quot; field holds the effective UID of the creator
of the socket.</p>

<p>/proc/net/udp Holds a dump of the UDP socket table. Much
of the information is not of use apart from debugging. The
&quot;sl&quot; value is the kernel hash slot for the socket,
the &quot;local address&quot; is the local address and port
number pair. The &quot;remote address&quot; is the remote
address and port number pair (if connected). &quot;St&quot;
is the internal status of the socket. The
&quot;tx_queue&quot; and &quot;rx_queue&quot; are the
outgoing and incoming data queue in terms of kernel mem- ory
usage. The &quot;tr&quot;, &quot;tm-&gt;when&quot;, and
&quot;rexmits&quot; fields are not used by UDP. The
&quot;uid&quot; field holds the effective UID of the creator
of the socket. The format is:</p>

<p>sl local_address rem_address st tx_queue rx_queue tr
rexmits tm-&gt;when uid 1: 01642C89:0201 0C642C89:03FF 01
00000000:00000001 01:000071BA 00000000 0 1: 00000000:0801
00000000:0000 0A 00000000:00000000 00:00000000 6F000100 0 1:
00000000:0201 00000000:0000 0A 00000000:00000000 00:00000000
00000000 0</p>

<p>/proc/net/unix Lists the UNIX domain sockets present
within the system and their status. The format is: Num
RefCount Protocol Flags Type St Path 0: 00000002 00000000
00000000 0001 03 1: 00000001 00000000 00010000 0001 01
/dev/printer</p>

<p>Here Num is the kernel table slot number, RefCount is
the number of users of the socket, Protocol is currently
always 0, Flags represent the internal kernel flags holding
the status of the socket. Currently, type is always 1 (Unix
domain data- gram sockets are not yet supported in the
kernel). St is the internal state of the socket and Path is
the bound path (if any) of the socket.</p>

<p>/proc/partitions Contains major and minor numbers of
each partition as well as number of blocks and partition
name.</p>

<p>/proc/pci This is a listing of all PCI devices found
during kernel ini- tialization and their configuration.</p>

<p>/proc/scsi A directory with the scsi mid-level
pseudo-file and various SCSI lowlevel driver directories,
which contain a file for each SCSI host in this system, all
of which give the status of some part of the SCSI IO
subsystem. These files contain ASCII structures and are,
therefore, readable with cat.</p>

<p>You can also write to some of the files to reconfigure
the sub- system or switch certain features on or off.</p>

<p>/proc/scsi/scsi This is a listing of all SCSI devices
known to the kernel. The listing is similar to the one seen
during bootup. scsi cur- rently supports only the
add-single-device command which allows root to add a
hotplugged device to the list of known devices.</p>

<p>An echo scsi add-single-device 1 0 5 0 &gt;
/proc/scsi/scsi will cause host scsi1 to scan on SCSI
channel 0 for a device on ID 5 LUN 0. If there is already a
device known on this address or the address is invalid, an
error will be returned.</p>

<p>/proc/scsi/[drivername] [drivername] can currently be
NCR53c7xx, aha152x, aha1542, aha1740, aic7xxx, buslogic,
eata_dma, eata_pio, fdomain, in2000, pas16, qlogic,
scsi_debug, seagate, t128, u15-24f, ultrastore, or wd7000.
These directories show up for all drivers that reg- istered
at least one SCSI HBA. Every directory contains one file per
registered host. Every host-file is named after the number
the host was assigned during initialization.</p>

<p>Reading these files will usually show driver and host
configura- tion, statistics etc.</p>

<p>Writing to these files allows different things on
different hosts. For example, with the latency and nolatency
commands, root can switch on and off command latency
measurement code in the eata_dma driver. With the lockup and
unlock commands, root can control bus lockups simulated by
the scsi_debug driver.</p>

<p>/proc/self This directory refers to the process
accessing the /proc filesystem, and is identical to the
/proc directory named by the process ID of the same
process.</p>

<p>/proc/slabinfo Information about kernel caches. The
columns are: cache-name num-active-objs total-objs
object-size num-active-slabs total-slabs num-pages-per-slab
See slabinfo(5) for details.</p>

<p>/proc/stat kernel/system statistics. Varies with
architecture. Common entries include:</p>

<p>cpu 3357 0 4313 1362393 The amount of time, measured in
units of USER_HZ (1/100ths of a second on most
architectures), that the system spent in user mode, user
mode with low priority (nice), system mode, and the idle
task, respectively. The last value should be USER_HZ times
the second entry in the uptime pseudo-file.</p>

<p>In Linux 2.6 this line includes three additional
columns: iowait - time waiting for I/O to complete (since
2.5.41); irq - time servicing interrupts (since
2.6.0-test4); softirq - time servicing softirqs (since
2.6.0-test4).</p>

<p>page 5741 1808 The number of pages the system paged in
and the number that were paged out (from disk).</p>

<p>swap 1 0 The number of swap pages that have been brought
in and out.</p>

<p>intr 1462898 This line shows counts of interrupts
serviced since boot time, for each of the possible system
interrupts. The first column is the total of all interrupts
serviced; each subsequent column is the total for a
particular interrupt.</p>

<p>disk_io: (2,0):(31,30,5764,1,2) (3,0):...
(major,minor):(noinfo, read_io_ops, blks_read, write_io_ops,
blks_written) (Linux 2.4 only)</p>

<p>ctxt 115315 The number of context switches that the
system underwent.</p>

<p>btime 769041601 boot time, in seconds since the epoch
(January 1, 1970).</p>

<p>processes 86031 Number of forks since boot.</p>

<p>procs_running 6 Number of processes in runnable state.
(Linux 2.5.45 onwards.)</p>

<p>procs_blocked 2 Number of processes blocked waiting for
I/O to complete. (Linux 2.5.45 onwards.)</p>

<p>/proc/swaps Swap areas in use. See also swapon(8).</p>

<p>/proc/sys This directory (present since 1.3.57) contains
a number of files and subdirectories corresponding to kernel
variables. These variables can be read and sometimes
modified using the proc file system, and the sysctl(2)
system call. Presently, there are sub- directories abi,
debug, dev, fs, kernel, net, proc, rxrpc, sun- rpc and vm
that each contain more files and subdirectories.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/abi This directory may contain files with
application binary infor- mation. On some systems, it is not
present.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/debug This directory may be empty.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/dev This directory contains device specific
information (eg dev/cdrom/info). On some systems, it may be
empty.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs This contains the subdirectories
binfmt_misc, inotify, and mqueue, and files dentry-state,
dir-notify-enable, dquot-nr, file-max, file-nr, inode-max,
inode-nr, inode-state, lease- break-time, leases-enable,
overflowgid, overflowuid, suid_dumpable, super-max, and
super-nr.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc Documentation for files in this
directory can be found in the kernel sources in
Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/dentry-state This file contains six
numbers, nr_dentry, nr_unused, age_limit (age in seconds),
want_pages (pages requested by system) and two dummy values.
nr_dentry seems to be 0 all the time. nr_unused seems to be
the number of unused dentries. age_limit is the age in
seconds after which dcache entries can be reclaimed when
mem- ory is short and want_pages is non-zero when the kernel
has called shrink_dcache_pages() and the dcache isn t pruned
yet.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/dir-notify-enable This file can be used to
disable or enable the dnotify interface described in
fcntl(2) on a system-wide basis. A value of 0 in this file
disables the interface, and a value of 1 enables it.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/dquot-max This file shows the maximum
number of cached disk quota entries. On some (2.4) systems,
it is not present. If the number of free cached disk quota
entries is very low and you have some awesome number of
simultaneous system users, you might want to raise the
limit.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/dquot-nr This file shows the number of
allocated disk quota entries and the number of free disk
quota entries.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/file-max This file defines a system-wide
limit on the number of open files for all processes. This
limit is not applied to root. (See also setrlimit(2), which
can be used by a process to set the per-process limit,
RLIMIT_NOFILE, on the number of files it may open.) If you
get lots of error messages about running out of file
handles, try increasing this value:</p>

<p>echo 100000 &gt; /proc/sys/fs/file-max</p>

<p>The kernel constant NR_OPEN imposes an upper limit on
the value that may be placed in file-max.</p>

<p>If you increase /proc/sys/fs/file-max, be sure to
increase /proc/sys/fs/inode-max to 3-4 times the new value
of /proc/sys/fs/file-max, or you will run out of inodes.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/file-nr Historically, the three values in
file-nr denoted the number of allocated file handles, the
number of allocated but unused file handles, and the maximum
number of file handles. Linux 2.6 always reports 0 as the
number of free file handles -- this is not an error, it just
means that the number of allocated file handles exactly
matches the number of used file handles.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/inode-max This file contains the maximum
number of in-memory inodes. On some (2.4) systems, it may
not be present. This value should be 3-4 times larger than
the value in file-max, since stdin, stdout and network
sockets also need an inode to handle them. When you
regularly run out of inodes, you need to increase this
value.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/inode-nr This file contains the first two
values from inode-state.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/inode-state This file contains seven
numbers: nr_inodes, nr_free_inodes, preshrink and four dummy
values. nr_inodes is the number of inodes the system has
allocated. This can be slightly more than inode-max because
Linux allocates them one page full at a time. nr_free_inodes
represents the number of free inodes. preshrink is non-zero
when the nr_inodes &gt; inode-max and the system needs to
prune the inode list instead of allocating more.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/inotify (since Linux 2.6.13) This directory
contains files max_queued_events, max_user_instances, and
max_user_watches, that can be used to limit the amount of
kernel memory consumed by the inotify inter- face. For
further details, see inotify(7).</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/lease-break-time This file specifies the
grace period that the kernel grants to a process holding a
file lease (fcntl(2)) after it has sent a sig- nal to that
process notifying it that another process is waiting to open
the file. If the lease holder does not remove or down- grade
the lease within this grace period, the kernel forcibly
breaks the lease.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/leases-enable This file can be used to
enable or disable file leases (fcntl(2)) on a system-wide
basis. If this file contains the value 0, leases are
disabled. A non-zero value enables leases.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue (since Linux 2.6.6) This directory
contains files msg_max, msgsize_max, and queues_max,
controlling the resources used by POSIX message queues. See
mq_overview(7) for details.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/overflowgid and /proc/sys/fs/overflowuid
These files allow you to change the value of the fixed UID
and GID. The default is 65534. Some filesystems only support
16-bit UIDs and GIDs, although in Linux UIDs and GIDs are 32
bits. When one of these filesystems is mounted with writes
enabled, any UID or GID that would exceed 65535 is
translated to the overflow value before being written to
disk.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable (since Linux 2.6.13) The
value in this file determines whether core dump files are
produced for set-user-ID or otherwise protected/tainted
bina- ries. Three different integer values can be
specified:</p>

<p>0 (default) This provides the traditional (pre-Linux
2.6.13) behaviour. A core dump will not be produced for a
process which has changed credentials (by calling
seteuid(2), setgid(2), or similar, or by executing a
set-user-ID or set-group-ID program) or whose binary does
not have read permission enabled.</p>

<p>1 (&quot;debug&quot;) All processes dump core when
possible. The core dump is owned by the file system user ID
of the dumping process and no security is applied. This is
intended for system debug- ging situations only. Ptrace is
unchecked.</p>

<p>2 (&quot;suidsafe&quot;) Any binary which normally would
not be dumped (see &quot;0&quot; above) is dumped readable
by root only. This allows the user to remove the core dump
file but not to read it. For security reasons core dumps in
this mode will not overwrite one another or other files.
This mode is appropriate when adminis- trators are
attempting to debug problems in a normal environ- ment.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/super-max This file controls the maximum
number of superblocks, and thus the maximum number of
mounted filesystems the kernel can have. You only need to
increase super-max if you need to mount more filesystems
than the current value in super-max allows you to.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/super-nr This file contains the number of
filesystems currently mounted.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel This directory contains files acct,
cad_pid, cap-bound, core_pattern, core_uses_pid,
ctrl-alt-del, dentry-state, domain- name, hotplug, hostname,
htab-reclaim (PowerPC only), java- appletviewer
(binfmt_java, obsolete), java-interpreter (binfmt_java,
obsolete), l2cr (PowerPC only), modprobe, msgmax, msgmnb,
msgmni, osrelease, ostype, overflowgid, overflowuid, panic,
panic_on_oops, pid_max, powersave-nap (PowerPC only),
printk, pty, random, real-root-dev, reboot-cmd (SPARC only),
rtsig-max, rtsig-nr, sem, sg-big-buff, shmall, shmmax,
shmmni, sysrq, tainted, threads-max, version, and zero-paged
(PowerPC only).</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/acct This file contains three numbers:
highwater, lowwater and fre- quency. If BSD-style process
accounting is enabled these values control its behaviour. If
free space on filesystem where the log lives goes below
lowwater percent accounting suspends. If free space gets
above highwater percent accounting resumes. Fre- quency
determines how often the kernel checks the amount of free
space (value is in seconds). Default values are 4, 2 and 30.
That is, suspend accounting if &lt;= 2% of space is free;
resume it if &gt;= 4% of space is free; consider information
about amount of free space valid for 30 seconds.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound This file holds the value of
the kernel capability bounding set (expressed as a signed
decimal number). This set is ANDed against the capabilities
permitted to a process during exec().</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern See core(5).
/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid See core(5).</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/ctrl-alt-del This file controls the
handling of Ctrl-Alt-Del from the key- board. When the value
in this file is 0, Ctrl-Alt-Del is trapped and sent to the
init(1) program to handle a graceful restart. When the value
is &gt; 0, Linuxs reaction to a Vulcan Nerve Pinch (tm) will
be an immediate reboot, without even sync- ing its dirty
buffers. Note: when a program (like dosemu) has the keyboard
in raw mode, the ctrl-alt-del is intercepted by the program
before it ever reaches the kernel tty layer, and its up to
the program to decide what to do with it.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug This file contains the path for
the hotplug policy agent. The default value in this file
&quot;/sbin/hotplug&quot;.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/domainname and
/proc/sys/kernel/hostname can be used to set the NIS/YP
domainname and the hostname of your box in exactly the same
way as the commands domainname and hostname, i.e.:</p>

<p># echo &quot;darkstar&quot; &gt;
/proc/sys/kernel/hostname # echo &quot;mydomain&quot; &gt;
/proc/sys/kernel/domainname</p>

<p>has the same effect as</p>

<p># hostname &quot;darkstar&quot; # domainname
&quot;mydomain&quot;</p>

<p>Note, however, that the classic darkstar.frop.org has
the host- name &quot;darkstar&quot; and DNS (Internet Domain
Name Server) domainname &quot;frop.org&quot;, not to be
confused with the NIS (Network Information Service) or YP
(Yellow Pages) domainname. These two domain names are in
general different. For a detailed discussion see the
hostname(1) man page.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/htab-reclaim (PowerPC only) If this
file is set to a non-zero value, the Pow- erPC htab (see
kernel file Documentation/powerpc/ppc_htab.txt) is pruned
each time the system hits the idle loop.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/l2cr (PowerPC only) This file contains
a flag that controls the L2 cache of G3 processor boards. If
0, the cache is disabled. Enabled if non-zero.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe This file is described by the
kernel source file Documenta- tion/kmod.txt.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmax This file defines a system-wide
limit specifying the maximum number of bytes in a single
message written on a System V mes- sage queue.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmni This file defines the
system-wide limit on the number of message queue
identifiers. (This file is only present in Linux 2.4
onwards.)</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmnb This file defines a system-wide
parameter used to initialise the msg_qbytes setting for
subsequently created message queues. The msg_qbytes setting
specifies the maximum number of bytes that may be written to
the message queue.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/ostype and /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease
These files give substrings of /proc/version.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/overflowgid and
/proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid These files duplicate the files
/proc/sys/fs/overflowgid and /proc/sys/fs/overflowuid.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/panic gives read/write access to the
kernel variable panic_timeout. If this is zero, the kernel
will loop on a panic; if non-zero it indicates that the
kernel should autoreboot after this number of seconds. When
you use the software watchdog device driver, the recommended
setting is 60.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_oops This file (new in Linux
2.5) controls the kernel s behaviour when an oops or BUG is
encountered. If this file contains 0, then the system tries
to continue operation. If it contains 1, then the system
delays a few seconds (to give klogd time to record the oops
output) and then panics. If the /proc/sys/ker- nel/panic
file is also non-zero then the machine will be rebooted.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max This file (new in Linux 2.5)
specifies the value at which PIDs wrap around (i.e., the
value in this file is one greater than the maximum PID). The
default value for this file, 32768, results in the same
range of PIDs as on earlier kernels. On 32-bit platfroms,
32768 is the maximum value for pid_max. On 64-bit systems,
pid_max can be set to any value up to 2^22 (PID_MAX_LIMIT,
approximately 4 million).</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/powersave-nap (PowerPC only) This file
contains a flag. If set, Linux-PPC will use the nap mode of
powersaving, otherwise the doze mode will be used.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/printk The four values in this file are
console_loglevel, default_mes- sage_loglevel,
minimum_console_level and default_con- sole_loglevel. These
values influence printk() behavior when printing or logging
error messages. See syslog(2) for more info on the different
loglevels. Messages with a higher priority than
console_loglevel will be printed to the console. Messages
without an explicit priority will be printed with priority
default_message_level. minimum_console_loglevel is the
minimum (highest) value to which console_loglevel can be
set. default_console_loglevel is the default value for con-
sole_loglevel.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/pty (since Linux 2.6.4) This directory
contains two files relating to the number of Unix 98
pseudo-terminals (see pts(4)) on the system.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/pty/max This file defines the maximum
number of pseudo-terminals.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/pty/nr This read-only file indicates
how many pseudo-terminals are cur- rently in use.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/random This directory contains various
parameters controlling the oper- ation of the file
/dev/random. See random(4) for further infor- mation.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev This file is documented
in the kernel source file Documenta- tion/initrd.txt.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/reboot-cmd (Sparc only) This file seems
to be a way to give an argument to the SPARC ROM/Flash boot
loader. Maybe to tell it what to do after reboot- ing?</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-max (Only in kernels up to and
including 2.6.7; see setrlimit(2)) This file can be used to
tune the maximum number of POSIX real- time (queued) signals
that can be outstanding in the system.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-nr (Only in kernels up to and
including 2.6.7.) This file shows the number POSIX realtime
signals currently queued.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/sem (since Linux 2.4) This file
contains 4 numbers defining limits for System V IPC
semaphores. These fields are, in order:</p>

<p>SEMMSL The maximum semaphores per semaphore set.</p>

<p>SEMMNS A system-wide limit on the number of semaphores
in all semaphore sets.</p>

<p>SEMOPM The maximum number of operations that may be
specified in a semop(2) call.</p>

<p>SEMMNI A system-wide limit on the maximum number of
semaphore identifiers.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/sg-big-buff This file shows the size of
the generic SCSI device (sg) buffer. You cant tune it just
yet, but you could change it on compile time by editing
include/scsi/sg.h and changing the value of SG_BIG_BUFF.
However, there shouldnt be any reason to change this
value.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/shmall This file contains the
system-wide limit on the total number of pages of System V
shared memory.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax This file can be used to query
and set the run time limit on the maximum (System V IPC)
shared memory segment size that can be created. Shared
memory segments up to 1Gb are now supported in the kernel.
This value defaults to SHMMAX.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/shmmni (available in Linux 2.4 and
onwards) This file specifies the system-wide maximum number
of System V shared memory segments that can be created.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/version contains a string like:</p>

<p>#5 Wed Feb 25 21:49:24 MET 1998.TP</p>

<p>The #5 means that this is the fifth kernel built from
this source base and the date behind it indicates the time
the kernel was built.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/zero-paged (PowerPC only) This file
contains a flag. When enabled (non-zero), Linux-PPC will
pre-zero pages in the idle loop, possibly speeding up
get_free_pages.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/net This directory contains networking stuff.
Explanations for some of the files under this directory can
be found in tcp(7) and ip(7).</p>

<p>/proc/sys/proc This directory may be empty.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/sunrpc This directory supports Sun remote
procedure call for network file system (NFS). On some
systems, it is not present.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/vm This directory contains files for memory
management tuning, buffer and cache management.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches (since Linux 2.6.16) Writing to
this file causes the kernel to drop clean caches, dentries
and inodes from memory, causing that memory to become
free.</p>

<p>To free pagecache, use echo 1 &gt;
/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; to free dentries and inodes, use
echo 2 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; to free pagecache,
dentries and inodes, use echo 3 &gt;
/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches.</p>

<p>Because this is a non-destructive operation and dirty
objects are not freeable, the user should run sync(8)
first.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/vm/legacy_va_layout (since Linux 2.6.9) If
non-zero, this disable the new 32-bit memory-mapping layout;
the kernel will use the legacy (2.4) layout for all
processes.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory This file contains the
kernel virtual memory accounting mode. Values are: 0:
heuristic overcommit (this is the default) 1: always
overcommit, never check 2: always check, never overcommit In
mode 0, calls of mmap(2) with MAP_NORESERVE set are not
checked, and the default check is very weak, leading to the
risk of getting a process &quot;OOM-killed&quot;. Under
Linux 2.4 any non-zero value implies mode 1. In mode 2
(available since Linux 2.6), the total virtual address space
on the system is limited to (SS + RAM*(r/100)), where SS is
the size of the swap space, and RAM is the size of the
physical memory, and r is the contents of the file
/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio See the description of
/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory.</p>

<p>/proc/sysvipc Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files
msg, sem and shm. These files list the System V Interprocess
Communication (IPC) objects (respectively: message queues,
semaphores, and shared memory) that currently exist on the
system, providing similar information to that available via
ipcs(1). These files have headers and are formatted (one IPC
object per line) for easy understanding. svipc(7) provides
further background on the information shown by these
files.</p>

<p>/proc/tty Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files and
subdirectories for tty drivers and line disciplines.</p>

<p>/proc/uptime This file contains two numbers: the uptime
of the system (sec- onds), and the amount of time spent in
idle process (seconds).</p>

<p>/proc/version This string identifies the kernel version
that is currently run- ning. It includes the contents of
/proc/sys/ostype, /proc/sys/osrelease and /proc/sys/version.
For example: Linux version 1.0.9 (quinlan@phaze) #1 Sat May
14 01:51:54 EDT 1994</p>

<p>/proc/vmstat (since Linux 2.6) This file displays
various virtual memory statistics.</p>

<p>/proc/zoneinfo (since Linux 2.6.13) This file display
information about memory zones. This is use- ful for
analysing virtual memory behaviour.</p>

<p>CAVEATS Note that many strings (i.e., the environment
and command line) are in the internal format, with
sub-fields terminated by null bytes ( ), so you may find
that things are more readable if you use od -c or tr
&quot;000&quot; &quot;n&quot; to read them. Alternatively,
echo cat &lt;file&gt;_ works well.</p>

<p>This manual page is incomplete, possibly inaccurate, and
is the kind of thing that needs to be updated very
often.</p>

<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The material on /proc/sys/fs and
/proc/sys/kernel is closely based on kernel source
