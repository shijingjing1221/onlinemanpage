<p>NAME muttrc - Configuration file for the Mutt Mail User
Agent</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A mutt configuration file consists of a
series of commands. Each line of the file may contain one or
more commands. When multiple com- mands are used, they must
be separated by a semicolon (;).</p>

<p>The hash mark, or pound sign (#), is used as a comment
character. You can use it to annotate your initialization
file. All text after the comment character to the end of the
line is ignored.</p>

<p>Single quotes ) and double quotes (&quot;) can be used
to quote strings which contain spaces or other special
characters. The differ- ence between the two types of quotes
is similar to that of many popular shell programs, namely
that a single quote is used to specify a literal string (one
that is not interpreted for shell variables or quoting with
a backslash [see next paragraph]), while double quotes
indicate a string for which should be evaluated. For
example, backtics are evalu- ated inside of double quotes,
but not for single quotes.</p>

<p>quotes the next character, just as in shells such as
bash and zsh. For example, if want to put quotes (&quot;)
inside of a string, you can use to force the next character
to be a literal instead of inter- preted character.</p>

<p>r have \ means to insert a literal into the line. n and
their usual C meanings of linefeed and carriage-return,
respectively.</p>

<p>A at the end of a line can be used to split commands
over multiple lines, provided that the split points dont
appear in the middle of command names.</p>

<p>It is also possible to substitute the output of a Unix
command in an initialization file. This is accomplished by
enclosing the command in backquotes comman).</p>

<p>UNIX environments can be accessed like the way it is
done in shells like sh and bash: Prepend the name of the
environment by a dollar ) sign.</p>

<p>COMMANDS alias key address [, address [ ... ]] unalias [
* | key ]</p>

<p>alias defines an alias key for the given addresses.
unalias removes the alias corresponding to the given key or
all aliases when * is used as an argument.</p>

<p>alternative_order type[/subtype] [ ... ] This command
permits you to define an order of preference which is used
by mutt to determine which part of a multipart/alterna- tive
body to display. A subtype of * matches any subtype, as does
an empty subtype.</p>

<p>auto_view type[/subtype] [ ... ] This commands permits
you to specify that mutt should automati- cally convert the
given MIME types to text/plain when displaying messages. For
this to work, there must be a mailcap(5) entry for the given
MIME type with the copiousoutput flag set. A sub- type of *
matches any subtype, as does an empty subtype.</p>

<p>bind map key function This command binds the given key
for the given map to the given function.</p>

<p>Valid maps are: generic, alias, attach, browser, editor,
index, compose, pager, pgp, postpone, mix.</p>

<p>For more information on keys and functions, please
consult the Mutt Manual.</p>

<p>account-hook [!]regexp command This hook is executed
whenever you access a remote mailbox. Use- ful to adjust
configuration settings to different IMAP or POP servers.</p>

<p>charset-hook alias charset This command defines an alias
for a character set. This is use- ful to properly display
messages which are tagged with a charac- ter set name not
known to mutt.</p>

<p>iconv-hook charset local-charset This command defines a
system-specific name for a character set. This is useful
when your system s iconv(3) implementation does not
understand MIME character set names (such as iso-8859-1),
but instead insists on being fed with
implementation-specific character set names (such as
8859-1). In this specific case, youd put this into your
configuration file:</p>

<p>iconv-hook iso-8859-1 8859-1</p>

<p>message-hook [!]pattern command Before mutt displays (or
formats for replying or forwarding) a message which matches
the given pattern (or, when it is preceded by an exclamation
mark, does not match the pattern), the given command is
executed. When multiple message-hooks match, they are
executed in the order in which they occur in the configu-
ration file.</p>

<p>folder-hook [!]regexp command When mutt enters a folder
which matches regexp (or, when regexp is preceded by an
exclamation mark, does not match regexp), the given command
is executed.</p>

<p>When several folder-hooks match a given mail folder,
they are executed in the order given in the configuration
file.</p>

<p>macro map key sequence [ description ] This command
binds the given sequence of keys to the given key in the
given map. For valid maps, see bind.</p>

<p>color object foreground background [ regexp ] color
index foreground background [ pattern ] uncolor index
pattern [ pattern ... ]</p>

<p>If your terminal supports color, these commands can be
used to assign foreground/backgound combinations to certain
objects. Valid objects are: attachment, body, bold, header,
hdrdefault, index, indicator, markers, message, normal,
quoted, quotedN, search, signature, status, tilde, tree,
underline. The body and header objects allow you to restrict
the colorization to a regu- lar expression. The index object
permits you to select colored messages by pattern.</p>

<p>Valid colors include: white, black, green, magenta,
blue, cyan, yellow, red, default, colorN.</p>

<p>mono object attribute [ regexp ] mono index attribute [
pattern ]</p>

<p>For terminals which dont support color, you can still
assign attributes to objects. Valid attributes include:
none, bold, underline, reverse, and standout.</p>

<p>[un]ignore pattern [ pattern ... ] The ignore command
permits you to specify header fields which you usually don t
wish to see. Any header field whose tag begins with an
ignored pattern will be ignored.</p>

<p>The unignore command permits you to define exceptions
from the above mentioned list of ignored headers.</p>

<p>lists address [ address ... ] unlists address [ address
... ] subscribe address [ address ... ] unsubscribe address
[ address ... ]</p>

<p>Mutt maintains two lists of mailing list addresses, a
list of subscribed mailing lists, and a list of known
mailing lists. All subscribed mailing lists are known. A
mail address matches a mailing list if it begins with the
given address. For exam- ple, the lists pattern mutt- will
match mutt-dev@mutt.org and mutt-users@mutt.org.</p>

<p>The lists command adds a mailing list address to the
list of known mailing lists. The unlists command removes a
mailing list from the lists of known and subscribed mailing
lists. The sub- scribe command adds a mailing list to the
lists of known and subscribed mailing lists. The unsubscribe
command removes it from the list of subscribed mailing
lists.</p>

<p>mbox-hook [!]pattern mailbox When mutt changes to a mail
folder which matches pattern, mail- box will be used as the
mbox folder, i.e., read messages will be moved to that
folder when the mail folder is left.</p>

<p>The first matchig mbox-hook applies.</p>

<p>mailboxes filename [ filename ... ] This command
specifies folders which can receive mail and which will be
checked for new messages. When changing folders, press- ing
space will cycle through folders with new mail.</p>

<p>my_hdr string unmy_hdr field</p>

<p>Using my_hdr, you can define headers which will be added
to the messages you compose. unmy_hdr will remove the given
user- defined headers.</p>

<p>hdr_order header1 header2 [ ... ] With this command, you
can specify an order in which mutt will attempt to present
headers to you when viewing messages.</p>

<p>save-hook [!]pattern filename When a message matches
pattern, the default file name when sav- ing it will be the
given filename.</p>

<p>fcc-hook [!]pattern filename When an outgoing message
matches pattern, the default file name for storing a copy
(fcc) will be the given filename.</p>

<p>fcc-save-hook [!]pattern filename This command is an
abbreviation for identical fcc-hook and save- hook
commands.</p>

<p>send-hook [!]pattern command When composing a message
matching pattern, command is executed. When multiple
send-hooks match, they are executed in the order in which
they occur in the configuration file.</p>

<p>pgp-hook pattern key-id The pgp-hook command provides a
method by which you can specify the ID of the public key to
be used when encrypting messages to a certain recipient.</p>

<p>push string This command adds the named string to the
keyboard buffer.</p>

<p>set [no|inv]variable[=value] [ ... ] toggle variable [
... ] unset variable [ ... ] reset variable [ ... ]</p>

<p>These commands are used to set and manipulate
configuration varibles.</p>

<p>Mutt knows four basic types of variables: boolean,
number, string and quadoption. Boolean variables can be set
(true), unset (false), or toggled. Number variables can be
assigned a positive integer value.</p>

<p>String variables consist of any number of printable
characters. Strings must be enclosed in quotes if they
contain spaces or tabs. You may also use the C escape
sequences n ant for newline and tab, respectively.</p>

<p>Quadoption variables are used to control whether or not
to be prompted for certain actions, or to specify a default
action. A value of yes will cause the action to be carried
out automati- cally as if you had answered yes to the
question. Similarly, a value of no will cause the the action
to be carried out as if you had answered no. A value of
ask-yes will cause a prompt with a default answer of yes and
ask-no will provide a default answer of no.</p>

<p>The reset command resets all given variables to the
compile time defaults. If you reset the special variabe all,
all variables will reset to their system defaults.</p>

<p>source filename The given file will be evaluated as a
configuration file.</p>

<p>unhook [ * | hook-type ] This command will remove all
hooks of a given type, or all hooks when * is used as an
argument. hook-type can be any of the -hook commands
documented above.</p>

<p>PATTERNS In various places with mutt, including some of
the abovementioned hook commands, you can specify patterns
to match messages.</p>

<p>Constructing Patterns A simple pattern consists of an
operator of the form ~character, pos- sibly followed by a
parameter against which mutt is supposed to match the object
specified by this operator. (For a list of operators, see
below.)</p>

<p>With some of these operators, the object to be matched
consists of sev- eral e-mail addresses. In these cases, the
object is matched if at least one of these e-mail addresses
matches. You can prepend a hat (^) character to such a
pattern to indicate that all addresses must match in order
to match the object.</p>

<p>You can construct complex patterns by combining simple
patterns with logical operators. Logical AND is specified by
simply concatenating two simple patterns, for instance ~C
mutt-dev ~s bug. Logical OR is specified by inserting a
vertical bar ( | ) between two patterns, for instance ~C
mutt-dev | ~s bug. Additionally, you can negate a pat- tern
by prepending a bang ( ! ) character. For logical grouping,
use braces (()). Example: !(~t mutt|~c mutt) ~f elkins.</p>

<p>Simple Patterns Mutt understands the following simple
patterns:</p>

<p>~A all messages ~b EXPR messages which contain EXPR in
the message body ~B EXPR messages which contain EXPR in the
whole message ~c EXPR messages carbon-copied to EXPR ~C EXPR
message is either to: or cc: EXPR ~D deleted messages ~d
MIN-MAX messages with date-sent in a Date range ~E expired
messages ~e EXPR message which contains EXPR in the Sender
field ~F flagged messages ~f EXPR messages originating from
EXPR ~g PGP signed messages ~G PGP encrypted messages ~h
EXPR messages which contain EXPR in the message header ~k
message contains PGP key material ~i EXPR message which
match EXPR in the Message-ID field ~L EXPR message is either
originated or received by EXPR ~l message is addressed to a
known mailing list ~m MIN-MAX message in the range MIN to
MAX ~n MIN-MAX messages with a score in the range MIN to MAX
~N new messages ~O old messages ~p message is addressed to
you (consults $alternates) ~P message is from you (consults
$alternates) ~Q messages which have been replied to ~R read
messages ~r MIN-MAX messages with date-received in a Date
range ~S superseded messages ~s EXPR messages having EXPR in
the Subject field. ~T tagged messages ~t EXPR messages
addressed to EXPR ~U unread messages ~v message is part of a
collapsed thread. ~x EXPR messages which contain EXPR in the
References field ~z MIN-MAX messages with a size in the
range MIN to MAX ~= duplicated messages (see
$duplicate_threads)</p>

<p>In the above, EXPR is a regular expression.</p>

<p>With the ~m, ~n, and ~z operators, you can also specify
ranges in the forms &lt;MAX, &gt;MIN, MIN-, and -MAX.</p>

<p>Matching dates The ~d and ~r operators are used to match
date ranges, which are inter- preted to be given in your
local time zone.</p>

<p>A date is of the form DD[/MM[/[cc]YY]], that is, a
two-digit date, optionally followed by a two-digit month,
optionally followed by a year specifications. Omitted fields
default to the current month and year.</p>

<p>Mutt understands either two or four digit year
specifications. When given a two-digit year, mutt will
interpret values less than 70 as lying in the 21st century
(i.e., 38 means 2038 and not 1938, and 00 is interpreted as
2000), and values greater than or equal to 70 as lying in
the 20th century.</p>

<p>Note that this behaviour is Y2K compliant, but that mutt
does have a Y2.07K problem.</p>

<p>If a date range consists of a single date, the operator
in question will match that precise date. If the date range
consists of a dash (-), followed by a date, this range will
match any date before and up to the date given. Similarly, a
date followed by a dash matches the date given and any later
point of time. Two dates, separated by a dash, match any
date which lies in the given range of time.</p>

<p>You can also modify any absolute date by giving an error
range. An error range consists of one of the characters +,
-, *, followed by a positive number, followed by one of the
unit characters y, m, w, or d, specifying a unit of years,
months, weeks, or days. + increases the maximum date matched
by the given interval of time, - decreases the minimum date
matched by the given interval of time, and * increases the
maximum date and decreases the minimum date matched by the
given inter- val of time. It is possible to give multiple
error margins, which cumulate. Example:
1/1/2001-1w+2w*3d</p>

<p>You can also specify offsets relative to the current
date. An offset is specified as one of the characters &lt;,
&gt;, =, followed by a positive number, followed by one of
the unit characters y, m, w, or d. &gt; matches dates which
are older than the specified amount of time, an offset which
begins with the character &lt; matches dates which are more
recent than the specified amount of time, and an offset
which begins with the character = matches points of time
which are precisely the given amount of time ago.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION VARIABLES abort_nosubject Type: quadoption
Default: ask-yes</p>

<p>If set to yes, when composing messages and no subject is
given at the subject prompt, composition will be aborted. If
set to no, composing messages with no subject given at the
subject prompt will never be aborted.</p>

<p>abort_unmodified Type: quadoption Default: yes</p>

<p>If set to yes, composition will automatically abort
after edit- ing the message body if no changes are made to
the file (this check only happens after the first edit of
the file). When set to no, composition will never be
aborted.</p>

<p>alias_file Type: path Default: ~/.muttrc</p>

<p>The default file in which to save aliases created by the
cre- ate-alias function.</p>

<p>Note: Mutt will not automatically source this file; you
must explicitly use the source command for it to be
executed.</p>

<p>alias_format Type: string Default: %4n %2f %t %-10a
%r</p>

<p>Specifies the format of the data displayed for the alias
menu. The following printf(3)-style sequences are
available:</p>

<p>%a alias name</p>

<p>%f flags - currently, a d for an alias marked for
deletion</p>

<p>%n index number</p>

<p>%r address which alias expands to</p>

<p>%t character which indicates if the alias is tagged for
inclusion</p>

<p>allow_8bit Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>Controls whether 8-bit data is converted to 7-bit using
either Quoted- Printable or Base64 encoding when sending
mail.</p>

<p>allow_ansi Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>Controls whether ANSI color codes in messages (and color
tags in rich text messages) are to be interpreted. Messages
containing these codes are rare, but if this option is set,
their text will be colored accordingly. Note that this may
override your color choices, and even present a security
problem, since a message could include a line like [-- PGP
output follows ... and give it the same color as your
attachment color.</p>

<p>alternates Type: regular expression Default:</p>

<p>A regexp that allows you to specify alternate addresses
where you receive mail. This affects Mutts idea about
messages from you and addressed to you.</p>

<p>arrow_cursor Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, an arrow (-&gt;) will be used to indicate the
current entry in menus instead of hiliting the whole line.
On slow net- work or modem links this will make response
faster because there is less that has to be redrawn on the
screen when moving to the next or previous entries in the
menu.</p>

<p>ascii_chars Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, Mutt will use plain ASCII characters when
displaying thread and attachment trees, instead of the
default ACS charac- ters.</p>

<p>askbcc Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, Mutt will prompt you for blind-carbon-copy (Bcc)
recipi- ents before editing an outgoing message.</p>

<p>askcc Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, Mutt will prompt you for carbon-copy (Cc)
recipients before editing the body of an outgoing
message.</p>

<p>attach_format Type: string Default: %u%D%I %t%4n
%T%.40d%&gt; [%.7m/%.10M, %.6e%?C?, %C?, %s]</p>

<p>This variable describes the format of the attachment
menu. The following printf-style sequences are
understood:</p>

<p>%D deleted flag</p>

<p>%d description</p>

<p>%e MIME content-transfer-encoding</p>

<p>%f filename</p>

<p>%I disposition (I=inline, A=attachment)</p>

<p>%m major MIME type</p>

<p>%M MIME subtype</p>

<p>%n attachment number</p>

<p>%s size</p>

<p>%t tagged flag</p>

<p>%u unlink (=to delete) flag</p>

<p>%&gt;X right justify the rest of the string and pad with
charac- ter X</p>

<p>%|X pad to the end of the line with character X</p>

<p>attach_sep Type: string Default: 0 The separator to add
between attachments when operating (saving, printing,
piping, etc) on a list of tagged attachments.</p>

<p>attach_split Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>If this variable is unset, when operating (saving,
printing, piping, etc) on a list of tagged attachments, Mutt
will concate- nate the attachments and will operate on them
as a single attachment. The $attach_sep separator is added
after each attachment. When set, Mutt will operate on the
attachments one by one.</p>

<p>attribution Type: string Default: On %d, %n wrote:</p>

<p>This is the string that will precede a message which has
been included in a reply. For a full listing of defined
printf()-like sequences see the section on
$index_format.</p>

<p>autoedit Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set along with $edit_headers, Mutt will skip the
initial send-menu and allow you to immediately begin editing
the body of your message. The send-menu may still be
accessed once you have finished editing the body of your
message.</p>

<p>Also see $fast_reply.</p>

<p>auto_tag Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, functions in the index menu which affect a
message will be applied to all tagged messages (if there are
any). When unset, you must first use the tag-prefix function
(default: ;) to make the next function apply to all tagged
messages.</p>

<p>beep Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When this variable is set, mutt will beep when an error
occurs.</p>

<p>beep_new Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When this variable is set, mutt will beep whenever it
prints a message notifying you of new mail. This is
independent of the setting of the $beep variable.</p>

<p>bounce_delivered Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When this variable is set, mutt will include
Delivered-To head- ers when bouncing messages. Postfix users
may wish to unset this variable.</p>

<p>charset Type: string Default:</p>

<p>Character set your terminal uses to display and enter
textual data.</p>

<p>check_new Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>Note: this option only affects maildir and MH style
mailboxes.</p>

<p>When set, Mutt will check for new mail delivered while
the mail- box is open. Especially with MH mailboxes, this
operation can take quite some time since it involves
scanning the directory and checking each file to see if it
has already been looked at. If check_new is unset, no check
for new mail is performed while the mailbox is open.</p>

<p>collapse_unread Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When unset, Mutt will not collapse a thread if it
contains any unread messages.</p>

<p>uncollapse_jump Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, Mutt will jump to the next unread message, if
any, when the current thread is uncollapsed.</p>

<p>compose_format Type: string Default: -- Mutt: Compose
[Approx. msg size: %l Atts: %a]%&gt;-</p>

<p>Controls the format of the status line displayed in the
<tt>om- pose menu. This string is similar to $status_format,
but has its own set of printf()-like sequences:</tt></p>

<p><tt>%a total number of attachments</tt></p>

<p><tt>%h local hostname</tt></p>

<p><tt>%l approximate size (in bytes) of the current
message</tt></p>

<p><tt>%v Mutt version string</tt></p>

<p><tt>See the text describing the $status_format option
for more information on how to set $compose_format.</tt></p>

<p><tt>confirmappend Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, Mutt will prompt for confirmation when
appending mes- sages to an existing mailbox.</tt></p>

<p><tt>confirmcreate Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, Mutt will prompt for confirmation when
saving messages to a mailbox which does not yet exist before
creating it.</tt></p>

<p><tt>connect_timeout Type: number Default: 30</tt></p>

<p><tt>Causes Mutt to timeout a network connection (for
IMAP or POP) after this many seconds if the connection is
not able to be established. A negative value causes Mutt to
wait indefinitely for the connection to succeed.</tt></p>

<p><tt>copy Type: quadoption Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable controls whether or not copies of your
outgoing messages will be saved for later references. Also
see $record, $save_name, $force_name and fcc-hook.</tt></p>

<p><tt>date_format Type: string Default: !%a, %b %d, %Y at
%I:%M:%S%p %Z</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable controls the format of the date
printed by the %d sequence in $index_format. This is passed
to the strf- time call to process the date. See the man page
for strftime(3) for the proper syntax.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Unless the first character in the string is a bang
(!), the month and week day names are expanded according to
the locale specified in the variable $locale. If the first
character in the string is a bang, the bang is discarded,
and the month and week day names in the rest of the string
are expanded in the C locale (that is in US
English).</tt></p>

<p><tt>default_hook Type: string Default: ~f %s !~P | (~P
~C %s)</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable controls how send-hooks,
message-hooks, save- hooks, and fcc-hooks will be
interpreted if they are specified with only a simple regexp,
instead of a matching pattern. The hooks are expanded when
they are declared, so a hook will be interpreted according
to the value of this variable at the time the hook is
declared. The default value matches if the message is either
from a user matching the regular expression given, or if it
is from you (if the from address matches $alternates) and is
to or cced to a user matching the given regular expres-
sion.</tt></p>

<p><tt>delete Type: quadoption Default: ask-yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls whether or not messages are really deleted
when closing or synchronizing a mailbox. If set to yes,
messages marked for deleting will automatically be purged
without prompting. If set to no, messages marked for
deletion will be kept in the mailbox.</tt></p>

<p><tt>delete_untag Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>If this option is set, mutt will untag messages when
marking them for deletion. This applies when you either
explicitly delete a message, or when you save it to another
folder.</tt></p>

<p><tt>digest_collapse Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>If this option is set, mutts revattach menu will not
show the subparts of individual messages in a digest. To see
these sub- parts, press v on that menu.</tt></p>

<p><tt>display_filter Type: path Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, specifies a command used to filter
messages. When a message is viewed it is passed as standard
input to $dis- play_filter, and the filtered message is read
from the standard output.</tt></p>

<p><tt>dsn_notify Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>Note: you should not enable this unless you are
using Sendmail 8.8.x or greater.</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable sets the request for when notification
is returned. The string consists of a comma separated list
(no spaces!) of one or more of the following: never, to
never request notification, failure, to request notification
on trans- mission failure, delay, to be notified of message
delays, suc- cess, to be notified of successful
transmission.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Example: set dsn_notify=failure,delay</tt></p>

<p><tt>dsn_return Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>Note: you should not enable this unless you are
using Sendmail 8.8.x or greater.</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable controls how much of your message is
returned in DSN messages. It may be set to either hdrs to
return just the message header, or full to return the full
message.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Example: set dsn_return=hdrs</tt></p>

<p><tt>duplicate_threads Type: boolean Default:
yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable controls whether mutt, when sorting by
threads, threads messages with the same message-id together.
If it is set, it will indicate that it thinks they are
duplicates of each other with an equals sign in the thread
diagram.</tt></p>

<p><tt>edit_headers Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>This option allows you to edit the header of your
outgoing mes- sages along with the body of your
message.</tt></p>

<p><tt>editor Type: path Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable specifies which editor is used by
mutt. It defaults to the value of the VISUAL, or EDITOR,
environment variable, or to the string vi if neither of
those are set.</tt></p>

<p><tt>encode_from Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, mutt will quoted-printable encode messages
when they contain the string From in the beginning of a
line. Useful to avoid the tampering certain mail delivery
and transport agents tend to do with messages.</tt></p>

<p><tt>envelope_from Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, mutt will try to derive the messages
envelope sender from the From: header. Note that this
information is passed to sendmail command using the -f
command line switch, so dont set this option if you are
using that switch in $sendmail your- self, or if the
sendmail on your machine doesnt support that command line
switch.</tt></p>

<p><tt>escape Type: string Default: ~</tt></p>

<p><tt>Escape character to use for functions in the builtin
editor.</tt></p>

<p><tt>fast_reply Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, the initial prompt for recipients and
subject are skipped when replying to messages, and the
initial prompt for subject is skipped when forwarding
messages.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Note: this variable has no effect when the $autoedit
variable is set.</tt></p>

<p><tt>fcc_attach Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable controls whether or not attachments on
outgoing messages are saved along with the main body of your
message.</tt></p>

<p><tt>fcc_clear Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When this variable is set, FCCs will be stored
unencrypted and unsigned, even when the actual message is
encrypted and/or signed.</tt></p>

<p><tt>folder Type: path Default: ~/Mail</tt></p>

<p><tt>Specifies the default location of your mailboxes. A
+ or = at the beginning of a pathname will be expanded to
the value of this variable. Note that if you change this
variable from the default value you need to make sure that
the assignment occurs before you use + or = for any other
variables since expan- sion takes place during the set
command.</tt></p>

<p><tt>folder_format Type: string Default: %2C %t %N %F %2l
%-8.8u %-8.8g %8s %d %f</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable allows you to customize the file
browser display to your personal taste. This string is
similar to $index_for- mat , but has its own set of
printf()-like sequences:</tt></p>

<p><tt>%C current file number</tt></p>

<p><tt>%d date/time folder was last modified</tt></p>

<p><tt>%f filename</tt></p>

<p><tt>%F file permissions</tt></p>

<p><tt>%g group name (or numeric gid, if missing)</tt></p>

<p><tt>%l number of hard links</tt></p>

<p><tt>%N N if folder has new mail, blank
otherwise</tt></p>

<p><tt>%s size in bytes</tt></p>

<p><tt>%t * if the file is tagged, blank otherwise</tt></p>

<p><tt>%u owner name (or numeric uid, if missing)</tt></p>

<p><tt>%&gt;X right justify the rest of the string and pad
with charac- ter X</tt></p>

<p><tt>%|X pad to the end of the line with character
X</tt></p>

<p><tt>followup_to Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls whether or not the Mail-Followup-To header
field is generated when sending mail. When set, Mutt will
generate this field when you are replying to a known mailing
list, specified with the subscribe or lists
commands.</tt></p>

<p><tt>This field has two purposes. First, preventing you
from receiv- ing duplicate copies of replies to messages
which you send to mailing lists. Second, ensuring that you
do get a reply sepa- rately for any messages sent to known
lists to which you are not subscribed. The header will
contain only the lists address for subscribed lists, and
both the list address and your own email address for
unsubscribed lists. Without this header, a group reply to
your message sent to a subscribed list will be sent to both
the list and your address, resulting in two copies of the
same email for you.</tt></p>

<p><tt>force_name Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable is similar to $save_name, except that
Mutt will store a copy of your outgoing message by the
username of the address you are sending to even if that
mailbox does not exist.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Also see the $record variable.</tt></p>

<p><tt>forward_decode Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into
text/plain when forwarding a message. The message header is
also RFC2047 decoded. This variable is only used, if
$mime_forward is unset, otherwise $mime_forward_decode is
used instead.</tt></p>

<p><tt>forward_format Type: string Default: [%a:
%s]</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable controls the default subject when
forwarding a message. It uses the same format sequences as
the $index_for- mat variable.</tt></p>

<p><tt>forward_quote Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set forwarded messages included in the main
body of the message (when $mime_forward is unset) will be
quoted using $indent_string.</tt></p>

<p><tt>from Type: e-mail address Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, this variable contains a default from
address. It can be overridden using my_hdr (including from
send-hooks) and $reverse_name.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Defaults to the EMAIL environment variable s
content.</tt></p>

<p><tt>gecos_mask Type: regular expression Default:
^[^,]*</tt></p>

<p><tt>A regular expression used by mutt to parse the GECOS
field of a password entry when expanding the alias. By
default the regular expression is set to ^[^,]* which will
return the string up to the first , encountered. If the
GECOS field contains a string like lastname, firstname then
you should set the gecos_mask=.*.</tt></p>

<p><tt>This can be useful if you see the following
behavior: you address a e-mail to user ID stevef whose full
name is Steve Franklin. If mutt expands stevef to Franklin
stevef@foo.bar then you should set the gecos_mask to a
regular expression that will match the whole name so mutt
will expand Franklin to Franklin, Steve.</tt></p>

<p><tt>hdrs Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When unset, the header fields normally added by the
my_hdr command are not created. This variable must be unset
before composing a new message or replying in order to take
effect. If set, the user defined header fields are added to
every new mes- sage.</tt></p>

<p><tt>header Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, this variable causes Mutt to include the
header of the message you are replying to into the edit
buffer. The $weed setting applies.</tt></p>

<p><tt>help Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, help lines describing the bindings for the
major func- tions provided by each menu are displayed on the
first line of the screen.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Note: The binding will not be displayed correctly if
the func- tion is bound to a sequence rather than a single
keystroke. Also, the help line may not be updated if a
binding is changed while Mutt is running. Since this
variable is primarily aimed at new users, neither of these
should present a major problem.</tt></p>

<p><tt>hidden_host Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, mutt will skip the host name part of
$hostname vari- able when adding the domain part to
addresses. This variable does not affect the generation of
Message-IDs, and it will not lead to the cut-off of
first-level domains.</tt></p>

<p><tt>hide_limited Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, mutt will not show the presence of missing
messages in the thread tree.</tt></p>

<p><tt>hide_missing Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, mutt will not show the presence of
messages that are hidden by limiting, in the thread
tree.</tt></p>

<p><tt>hide_top_limited Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, mutt will not show the presence of missing
messages at the top of threads in the thread tree. Note that
when $hide_limited is set, this option will have no
effect.</tt></p>

<p><tt>hide_top_missing Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, mutt will not show the presence of
messages that are hidden by limiting, at the top of threads
in the thread tree.Note that when $hide_missing is set, this
option will have no effect.</tt></p>

<p><tt>history Type: number Default: 10</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable controls the size (in number of
strings remem- bered) of the string history buffer. The
buffer is cleared each time the variable is set.</tt></p>

<p><tt>honor_followup_to Type: quadoption Default:
yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable controls whether or not a
Mail-Followup-To header is honored when group-replying to a
message.</tt></p>

<p><tt>hostname Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>Specifies the hostname to use after the @ in local
e-mail addresses. This overrides the compile time definition
obtained from /etc/resolv.conf.</tt></p>

<p><tt>ignore_list_reply_to Type: boolean Default:
no</tt></p>

<p><tt>Affects the behaviour of the reply function when
replying to messages from mailing lists. When set, if the
Reply-To: field is set to the same value as the To: field,
Mutt assumes that the Reply-To: field was set by the mailing
list to automate responses to the list, and will ignore this
field. To direct a response to the mailing list when this
option is set, use the list-reply function; group-reply will
reply to both the sender and the list.</tt></p>

<p><tt>imap_authenticators Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This is a colon-delimited list of authentication
methods mutt may attempt to use to log in to an IMAP server,
in the order mutt should try them. Authentication methods
are either login or the right side of an IMAP AUTH=xxx
capability string, eg digest-md5 , parameter is unset (the
default) mutt will try all available methods, in order from
most-secure to least-secure.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Example: set imap_authenticators=
gssapi:cram-md5:login</tt></p>

<p><tt>Note: Mutt will only fall back to other
authentication methods if the previous methods are
unavailable. If a method is avail- able but authentication
fails, mutt will not connect to the IMAP server.</tt></p>

<p><tt>imap_delim_chars Type: string Default: /.</tt></p>

<p><tt>This contains the list of characters which you would
like to treat as folder separators for displaying IMAP
paths. In partic- ular it helps in using the = shortcut for
your folder vari- able.</tt></p>

<p><tt>imap_force_ssl Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If this variable is set, Mutt will always use SSL
when connect- ing to IMAP servers.</tt></p>

<p><tt>imap_home_namespace Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>You normally want to see your personal folders
alongside your INBOX in the IMAP browser. If you see
something else, you may set this variable to the IMAP path
to your folders.</tt></p>

<p><tt>imap_keepalive Type: number Default: 900</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable specifies the maximum amount of time
in seconds that mutt will wait before polling open IMAP
connections, to prevent the server from closing them before
mutt has finished with them. The default is well within the
RFC-specified minimum amount of time (30 minutes) before a
server is allowed to do this, but in practice the RFC does
get violated every now and then. Reduce this number if you
find yourself getting discon- nected from your IMAP server
due to inactivity.</tt></p>

<p><tt>imap_list_subscribed Type: boolean Default:
no</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable configures whether IMAP folder
browsing will look for only subscribed folders or all
folders. This can be toggled in the IMAP browser with the
toggle-subscribed function.</tt></p>

<p><tt>imap_pass Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>Specifies the password for your IMAP account. If
unset, Mutt will prompt you for your password when you
invoke the fetch-mail function. Warning: you should only use
this option when you are on a fairly secure machine, because
the superuser can read your muttrc even if you are the only
one who can read the file.</tt></p>

<p><tt>imap_passive Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, mutt will not open new IMAP connections to
check for new mail. Mutt will only check for new mail over
existing IMAP connections. This is useful if you dont want
to be prompted to user/password pairs on mutt invocation, or
if opening the con- nection is slow.</tt></p>

<p><tt>imap_peek Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, mutt will avoid implicitly marking your mail
as read whenever you fetch a message from the server. This
is generally a good thing, but can make closing an IMAP
folder somewhat slower. This option exists to appease speed
freaks.</tt></p>

<p><tt>imap_servernoise Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, mutt will display warning messages from
the IMAP server as error messages. Since these messages are
often harm- less, or generated due to configuration problems
on the server which are out of the users hands, you may wish
to suppress them at some point.</tt></p>

<p><tt>imap_user Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>Your login name on the IMAP server.</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable defaults to your user name on the
local machine.</tt></p>

<p><tt>implicit_autoview Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set to yes, mutt will look for a mailcap entry
with the copiousoutput flag set for every MIME attachment it
doesnt have an internal viewer defined for. If such an entry
is found, mutt will use the viewer defined in that entry to
convert the body part to text form.</tt></p>

<p><tt>include Type: quadoption Default: ask-yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls whether or not a copy of the message(s) you
are reply- ing to is included in your reply.</tt></p>

<p><tt>indent_string Type: string Default: &gt;</tt></p>

<p><tt>Specifies the string to prepend to each line of text
quoted in a message to which you are replying. You are
strongly encouraged not to change this value, as it tends to
agitate the more fanat- ical netizens.</tt></p>

<p><tt>index_format Type: string Default: %4C %Z %{%b %d}
%-15.15L (%4l) %s</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable allows you to customize the message
index display to your personal taste.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Format strings are similar to the strings used in
the C function printf to format output (see the man page for
more detail). The following sequences are defined in
Mutt:</tt></p>

<p><tt>%a address of the author</tt></p>

<p><tt>%b filename of the original message folder (think
mailBox)</tt></p>

<p><tt>%B the list to which the letter was sent, or else
the folder name (%b).</tt></p>

<p><tt>%c number of characters (bytes) in the
message</tt></p>

<p><tt>%C current message number</tt></p>

<p><tt>%d date and time of the message in the format
specified by date_format converted to senders time
zone</tt></p>

<p><tt>%D date and time of the message in the format
specified by date_format converted to the local time
zone</tt></p>

<p><tt>%e current message number in thread</tt></p>

<p><tt>%E number of messages in current thread</tt></p>

<p><tt>%f entire From: line (address + real name)</tt></p>

<p><tt>%F author name, or recipient name if the message is
from you</tt></p>

<p><tt>%i message-id of the current message</tt></p>

<p><tt>%l number of lines in the message</tt></p>

<p><tt>%L If an address in the To or CC header field
matches an address defined by the users lists command, this
dis- plays To &lt;list-name&gt;, otherwise the same as
%F.</tt></p>

<p><tt>%m total number of message in the mailbox</tt></p>

<p><tt>%M number of hidden messages if the thread is
collapsed.</tt></p>

<p><tt>%N message score</tt></p>

<p><tt>%n authors real name (or address if
missing)</tt></p>

<p><tt>%O (_O_riginal save folder) Where mutt would
formerly have stashed the message: list name or recipient
name if no list</tt></p>

<p><tt>%s subject of the message</tt></p>

<p><tt>%S status of the message (N/D/d/!/r/*)</tt></p>

<p><tt>%t to: field (recipients)</tt></p>

<p><tt>%T the appropriate character from the $to_chars
string</tt></p>

<p><tt>%u user (login) name of the author</tt></p>

<p><tt>%v first name of the author, or the recipient if the
message is from you</tt></p>

<p><tt>%y x-label: field, if present</tt></p>

<p><tt>%Y x-label field, if present, and (1) not at part of
a thread tree, (2) at the top of a thread, or (3) x-label is
different from preceding messages x-label .</tt></p>

<p><tt>%Z message status flags</tt></p>

<p><tt>%{fmt} the date and time of the message is converted
to senders time zone, and fmt is expanded by the library
function strftime; a leading bang disables locales</tt></p>

<p><tt>%[fmt] the date and time of the message is converted
to the local time zone, and fmt is expanded by the library
function strftime; a leading bang disables locales</tt></p>

<p><tt>%(fmt) the local date and time when the message was
received. fmt is expanded by the library function strftime;
a leading bang disables locales</tt></p>

<p><tt>%&lt;fmt&gt; the current local time. fmt is expanded
by the library function strftime; a leading bang disables
locales.</tt></p>

<p><tt>%&gt;X right justify the rest of the string and pad
with charac- ter X</tt></p>

<p><tt>%|X pad to the end of the line with character
X</tt></p>

<p><tt>See also: $to_chars.</tt></p>

<p><tt>ispell Type: path Default: ispell</tt></p>

<p><tt>How to invoke ispell (GNU s spell-checking
software).</tt></p>

<p><tt>keep_flagged Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, read messages marked as flagged will not be
moved from your spool mailbox to your $mbox mailbox, or as a
result of a mbox-hook command.</tt></p>

<p><tt>locale Type: string Default: C</tt></p>

<p><tt>The locale used by strftime(3) to format dates.
Legal values are the strings your system accepts for the
locale variable LC_TIME.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mail_check Type: number Default: 5</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable configures how often (in seconds) mutt
should look for new mail.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mailcap_path Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable specifies which files to consult when
attempting to display MIME bodies not directly supported by
Mutt.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mailcap_sanitize Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, mutt will restrict possible characters in
mailcap % expandos to a well-defined set of safe characters.
This is the safe setting, but we are not sure it doesnt
break some more advanced MIME stuff.</tt></p>

<p><tt>DOT CHANGE THIS SETTING UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY SURE
WHAT YOU ARE DOING!</tt></p>

<p><tt>maildir_trash Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, messages marked as deleted will be saved
with the maildir (T)rashed flag instead of unlinked. NOTE:
this only applies to maildir-style mailboxes. Setting it
will have no effect on other mailbox types.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mark_old Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls whether or not Mutt makes the distinction
between new messages and old unread messages. By default,
Mutt will mark new messages as old if you exit a mailbox
without reading them. The next time you start Mutt, the
messages will show up with an O next to them in the index
menu, indicating that they are old. In order to make Mutt
treat all unread messages as new only, you can unset this
variable.</tt></p>

<p><tt>markers Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls the display of wrapped lines in the
internal pager. If set, a + marker is displayed at the
beginning of wrapped lines. Also see the $smart_wrap
variable.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mask Type: regular expression Default:
!^.[^.]</tt></p>

<p><tt>A regular expression used in the file browser,
optionally pre- ceded by the not operator !. Only files
whose names match this mask will be shown. The match is
always case-sensitive.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mbox Type: path Default: ~/mbox</tt></p>

<p><tt>This specifies the folder into which read mail in
your $spoolfile folder will be appended.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mbox_type Type: folder magic Default: mbox</tt></p>

<p><tt>The default mailbox type used when creating new
folders. May be any of mbox, MMDF, MH and Maildir.</tt></p>

<p><tt>metoo Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If unset, Mutt will remove your address (see the
$alternates variable) from the list of recipients when
replying to a mes- sage.</tt></p>

<p><tt>menu_scroll Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, menus will be scrolled up or down one line
when you attempt to move across a screen boundary. If unset,
the screen is cleared and the next or previous page of the
menu is dis- played (useful for slow links to avoid many
redraws).</tt></p>

<p><tt>meta_key Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, forces Mutt to interpret keystrokes with the
high bit (bit 8) set as if the user had pressed the ESC key
and whatever key remains after having the high bit removed.
For example, if the key pressed has an ASCII value of 0xf4,
then this is treated as if the user had pressed ESC then x.
This is because the result of removing the high bit from
0xf4 is 0x74 , which is the ASCII character x.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mh_purge Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When unset, mutt will mimic mhs behaviour and rename
deleted messages to ,&lt;old file name&gt; in mh folders
instead of really deleting them. If the variable is set, the
message files will simply be deleted.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mh_seq_flagged Type: string Default:
flagged</tt></p>

<p><tt>The name of the MH sequence used for flagged
messages.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mh_seq_replied Type: string Default:
replied</tt></p>

<p><tt>The name of the MH sequence used to tag replied
messages.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mh_seq_unseen Type: string Default: unseen</tt></p>

<p><tt>The name of the MH sequence used for unseen
messages.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mime_forward Type: quadoption Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, the message you are forwarding will be
attached as a separate MIME part instead of included in the
main body of the message. This is useful for forwarding MIME
messages so the receiver can properly view the message as it
was delivered to you. If you like to switch between MIME and
not MIME from mail to mail, set this variable to ask-no or
ask-yes.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Also see $forward_decode and $mime_forward_decode
.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mime_forward_decode Type: boolean Default:
no</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into
text/plain when forwarding a message while $mime_forward is
set. Other- wise $forward_decode is used instead.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mime_forward_rest Type: quadoption Default:
yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When forwarding multiple attachments of a MIME
message from the recvattach menu, attachments which cannot
be decoded in a rea- sonable manner will be attached to the
newly composed message if this option is set.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mix_entry_format Type: string Default: %4n %c %-16s
%a</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable describes the format of a remailer
line on the mixmaster chain selection screen. The following
printf-like sequences are supported:</tt></p>

<p><tt>%n The running number on the menu.</tt></p>

<p><tt>%c Remailer capabilities.</tt></p>

<p><tt>%s The remailers short name.</tt></p>

<p><tt>%a The remailers e-mail address.</tt></p>

<p><tt>mixmaster Type: path Default: mixmaster</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable contains the path to the Mixmaster
binary on your system. It is used with various sets of
parameters to gather the list of known remailers, and to
finally send a message through the mixmaster chain.</tt></p>

<p><tt>move Type: quadoption Default: ask-no</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls whether you will be asked to confirm moving
read mes- sages from your spool mailbox to your $mbox
mailbox, or as a result of a mbox-hook command.</tt></p>

<p><tt>message_format Type: string Default: %s</tt></p>

<p><tt>This is the string displayed in the attachment menu
for attachments of type message/rfc822. For a full listing
of defined printf()-like sequences see the section on
$index_for- mat.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pager Type: path Default: builtin</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable specifies which pager you would like
to use to view messages. builtin means to use the builtin
pager, other- wise this variable should specify the pathname
of the external pager you would like to use.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Using an external pager may have some disadvantages:
Additional keystrokes are necessary because you can t call
mutt functions directly from the pager, and screen resizes
cause lines longer than the screen width to be badly
formatted in the help menu.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pager_context Type: number Default: 0</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable controls the number of lines of
context that are given when displaying the next or previous
page in the internal pager. By default, Mutt will display
the line after the last one on the screen at the top of the
next page (0 lines of con- text).</tt></p>

<p><tt>pager_format Type: string Default: -%Z- %C/%m:
%-20.20n %s</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable controls the format of the one-line
message sta- tus displayed before each message in either the
internal or an external pager. The valid sequences are
listed in the $index_format section.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pager_index_lines Type: number Default: 0</tt></p>

<p><tt>Determines the number of lines of a mini-index which
is shown when in the pager. The current message, unless near
the top or bottom of the folder, will be roughly one third
of the way down this mini-index, giving the reader the
context of a few messages before and after the message. This
is useful, for example, to determine how many messages
remain to be read in the current thread. One of the lines is
reserved for the status bar from the index, so a
pager_index_lines of 6 will only show 5 lines of the actual
index. A value of 0 results in no index being shown. If the
number of messages in the current folder is less than
pager_index_lines, then the index will only use as many
lines as it needs.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pager_stop Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, the internal-pager will not move to the
next message when you are at the end of a message and invoke
the next-page function.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_autosign Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always
attempt to PGP/MIME sign outgoing messages. This can be
overridden by use of the pgp- menu, when signing is not
required or encryption is requested as well.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_autoencrypt Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always
attempt to PGP/MIME encrypt outgoing messages. This is
probably only use- ful in connection to the send-hook
command. It can be overrid- den by use of the pgp-menu, when
encryption is not required or signing is requested as
well.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_ignore_subkeys Type: boolean Default:
yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Setting this variable will cause Mutt to ignore
OpenPGP subkeys. Instead, the principal key will inherit the
subkeys capabili- ties. Unset this if you want to play
interesting key selection games.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_entry_format Type: string Default: %4n %t%f
%4l/0x%k %-4a %2c %u</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable allows you to customize the PGP key
selection menu to your personal taste. This string is
similar to $index_for- mat , but has its own set of
printf()-like sequences:</tt></p>

<p><tt>%n number</tt></p>

<p><tt>%k key id</tt></p>

<p><tt>%u user id</tt></p>

<p><tt>%a algorithm</tt></p>

<p><tt>%l key length</tt></p>

<p><tt>%f flags</tt></p>

<p><tt>%c capabilities</tt></p>

<p><tt>%t trust/validity of the key-uid
association</tt></p>

<p><tt>%[&lt;s&gt;] date of the key where &lt;s&gt; is an
strftime(3) expression</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_good_sign Type: regular expression
Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>If you assign a text to this variable, then a PGP
signature is only considered verified if the output from
$pgp_verify_command contains the text. Use this variable if
the exit code from the command is 0 even for bad
signatures.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_long_ids Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, use 64 bit PGP key IDs. Unset uses the
normal 32 bit Key IDs.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_replyencrypt Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, automatically PGP encrypt replies to
messages which are encrypted.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_replysign Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, automatically PGP sign replies to messages
which are signed.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Note: this does not work on messages that are
encrypted and signed!</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_replysignencrypted Type: boolean Default:
no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, automatically PGP sign replies to messages
which are encrypted. This makes sense in combination with
$pgp_replyen- crypt, because it allows you to sign all
messages which are automatically encrypted. This works
around the problem noted in $pgp_replysign, that mutt is not
able to find out whether an encrypted message is also
signed.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_retainable_sigs Type: boolean Default:
no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, signed and encrypted messages will consist
of nested multipart/signed and multipart/encrypted body
parts.</tt></p>

<p><tt>This is useful for applications like encrypted and
signed mail- ing lists, where the outer layer
(multipart/encrypted) can be easily removed, while the inner
multipart/signed part is retained.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_show_unusable Type: boolean Default:
yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, mutt will display non-usable keys on the PGP
key selec- tion menu. This includes keys which have been
revoked, have expired, or have been marked as disabled by
the user.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_sign_as Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>If you have more than one key pair, this option
allows you to specify which of your private keys to use. It
is recommended that you use the keyid form to specify your
key (e.g., 0x00112233).</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_strict_enc Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, Mutt will automatically encode PGP/MIME
signed messages as quoted-printable. Please note that
unsetting this variable may lead to problems with
non-verifyable PGP signatures, so only change this if you
know what you are doing.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_timeout Type: number Default: 300</tt></p>

<p><tt>The number of seconds after which a cached
passphrase will expire if not used.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_verify_sig Type: quadoption Default:
yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>If yes, always attempt to verify PGP/MIME
signatures. If ask-yes or ask-no , ask whether or not to
verify the signa- ture. If no, never attempt to verify
PGP/MIME signatures.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_sort_keys Type: sort order Default:
address</tt></p>

<p><tt>Specifies how the entries in the pgp keys menu are
sorted. The following are legal values:</tt></p>

<p><tt>address sort alphabetically by user id</tt></p>

<p><tt>keyid sort alphabetically by key id</tt></p>

<p><tt>date sort by key creation date</tt></p>

<p><tt>trust sort by the trust of the key</tt></p>

<p><tt>If you prefer reverse order of the above values,
prefix it with reverse-.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_create_traditional Type: quadoption Default:
no</tt></p>

<p><tt>This option controls whether Mutt generates
old-style PGP encrypted or signed messages under certain
circumstances.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Note that PGP/MIME will be used automatically for
messages which have a character set different from us-ascii,
or which consist of more than a single MIME part.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Also note that using the old-style PGP message
format is strongly deprecated.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_decode_command Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This format strings specifies a command which is
used to decode application/pgp attachments.</tt></p>

<p><tt>The PGP command formats have their own set of
printf-like sequences:</tt></p>

<p><tt>%p Expands to PGPPASSFD=0 when a pass phrase is
needed, to an empty string otherwise. Note: This may be used
with a %? construct.</tt></p>

<p><tt>%f Expands to the name of a file containing a
message.</tt></p>

<p><tt>%s Expands to the name of a file containing the
signature part of a multipart/signed attachment when verify-
ing it.</tt></p>

<p><tt>%a The value of $pgp_sign_as.</tt></p>

<p><tt>%r One or more key IDs.</tt></p>

<p><tt>For examples on how to configure these formats for
the various versions of PGP which are floating around, see
the pgp*.rc and gpg.rc files in the samples/ subdirectory
which has been installed on your system alongside the
documentation.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_getkeys_command Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This command is invoked whenever mutt will need
public key information. %r is the only printf-like sequence
used with this format.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_verify_command Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This command is used to verify PGP/MIME
signatures.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_decrypt_command Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This command is used to decrypt a PGP/MIME encrypted
message.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_clearsign_command Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This format is used to create a clearsigned
old-style PGP attachment. Note that the use of this format
is strongly depre- cated.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_sign_command Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This command is used to create the detached PGP
signature for a multipart/signed PGP/MIME body
part.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_encrypt_sign_command Type: string
Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This command is used to combinedly sign/encrypt a
body part.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_encrypt_only_command Type: string
Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This command is used to encrypt a body part without
signing it.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_import_command Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This command is used to import a key from a message
into the users public key ring.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_export_command Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This command is used to export a public key from the
users key ring.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_verify_key_command Type: string
Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This command is used to verify key information from
the key selection menu.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_list_secring_command Type: string
Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This command is used to list the secret key rings
contents. The output format must be analogous to the one
used by gpg --list-keys --with-colons.</tt></p>

<p><tt>This format is also generated by the pgpring utility
which comes with mutt.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pgp_list_pubring_command Type: string
Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This command is used to list the public key ring s
contents. The output format must be analogous to the one
used by gpg --list-keys --with-colons.</tt></p>

<p><tt>This format is also generated by the pgpring utility
which comes with mutt.</tt></p>

<p><tt>forward_decrypt Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls the handling of encrypted messages when
forwarding a message. When set, the outer layer of
encryption is stripped off. This variable is only used if
$mime_forward is set and $mime_forward_decode is
unset.</tt></p>

<p><tt>ssl_starttls Type: quadoption Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set (the default), mutt will attempt to use
STARTTLS on servers advertising the capability. When unset,
mutt will not attempt to use STARTTLS regardless of the
server s capabilities.</tt></p>

<p><tt>certificate_file Type: path Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable specifies the file where the
certificates you trust are saved. When an unknown
certificate is encountered, you are asked if you accept it
or not. If you accept it, the cer- tificate can also be
saved in this file and further connections are automatically
accepted.</tt></p>

<p><tt>You can also manually add CA certificates in this
file. Any server certificate that is signed with one of
these CA certifi- cates are also automatically
accepted.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Example: set
certificate_file=~/.mutt/certificates</tt></p>

<p><tt>ssl_usesystemcerts Type: boolean Default:
yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set to yes, mutt will use CA certificates in the
system-wide certificate store when checking if server
certificate is signed by a trusted CA.</tt></p>

<p><tt>entropy_file Type: path Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>The file which includes random data that is used to
initalize SSL library functions.</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variables specifies whether to attempt to use
SSLv3 in the SSL authentication process.</tt></p>

<p><tt>ssl_use_tlsv1 Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variables specifies whether to attempt to use
TLSv1 in the SSL authentication process.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pipe_split Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>Used in connection with the pipe-message command and
the tag- prefix operator. If this variable is unset, when
piping a list of tagged messages Mutt will concatenate the
messages and will pipe them as a single folder. When set,
Mutt will pipe the mes- sages one by one. In both cases the
messages are piped in the current sorted order, and the
$pipe_sep separator is added after each message.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pipe_decode Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>Used in connection with the pipe-message command.
When unset, Mutt will pipe the messages without any
preprocessing. When set, Mutt will weed headers and will
attempt to PGP/MIME decode the messages first.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pipe_sep Type: string Default: 0 The separator to
add between messages when piping a list of tagged messages
to an external Unix command.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pop_authenticators Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This is a colon-delimited list of authentication
methods mutt may attempt to use to log in to an POP server,
in the order mutt should try them. Authentication methods
are either user, apop or any SASL mechanism, eg digest-md5 ,
gssapi or cram-md5 . This parameter is case-insensitive. If
this parame- ter is unset (the default) mutt will try all
available methods, in order from most-secure to
least-secure.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Example: set pop_authenticators=
digest-md5:apop:user</tt></p>

<p><tt>pop_auth_try_all Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, Mutt will try all available methods. When
unset, Mutt will only fall back to other authentication
methods if the pre- vious methods are unavailable. If a
method is available but authentication fails, Mutt will not
connect to the POP server.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pop_checkinterval Type: number Default: 60</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable configures how often (in seconds) POP
should look for new mail.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pop_delete Type: quadoption Default: ask-no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, Mutt will delete successfully downloaded
messages from the POP server when using the fetch-mail
function. When unset, Mutt will download messages but also
leave them on the POP server.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pop_host Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>The name of your POP server for the fetch-mail
function. You can also specify an alternative port, username
and password, ie:</tt></p>


<p><tt>[pop[s]://][username[:password]@]popserver[:port]</tt></p>

<p><tt>pop_last Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If this variable is set, mutt will try to use the
LAST POP command for retrieving only unread messages from
the POP server when using the fetch-mail function.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pop_reconnect Type: quadoption Default:
ask-yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls whether or not Mutt will try to reconnect
to POP server when connection lost.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pop_user Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>Your login name on the POP server.</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable defaults to your user name on the
local machine.</tt></p>

<p><tt>pop_pass Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>Specifies the password for your POP account. If
unset, Mutt will prompt you for your password when you open
POP mailbox. Warning: you should only use this option when
you are on a fairly secure machine, because the superuser
can read your mut- trc even if you are the only one who can
read the file.</tt></p>

<p><tt>post_indent_string Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>Similar to the $attribution variable, Mutt will
append this string after the inclusion of a message which is
being replied to.</tt></p>

<p><tt>postpone Type: quadoption Default: ask-yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls whether or not messages are saved in the
$postponed mailbox when you elect not to send
immediately.</tt></p>

<p><tt>postponed Type: path Default: ~/postponed</tt></p>

<p><tt>Mutt allows you to indefinitely postpone sending a
message which you are editing. When you choose to postpone a
message, Mutt saves it in the mailbox specified by this
variable. Also see the $postpone variable.</tt></p>

<p><tt>preconnect Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, a shell command to be executed if mutt fails
to estab- lish a connection to the server. This is useful
for setting up secure connections, e.g. with ssh(1). If the
command returns a nonzero status, mutt gives up opening the
server. Example:</tt></p>

<p><tt>preconnect= ssh -f -q -L 1234:mailhost.net:143
mailhost.net sleep 20 &lt; /dev/null &gt; /dev/null</tt></p>

<p><tt>Mailbox foo on mailhost.net can now be reached as
{local- host:1234}foo.</tt></p>

<p><tt>NOTE: For this example to work, you must be able to
log in to the remote machine without having to enter a
password.</tt></p>

<p><tt>print Type: quadoption Default: ask-no</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls whether or not Mutt asks for confirmation
before print- ing. This is useful for people (like me) who
accidentally hit p often.</tt></p>

<p><tt>print_command Type: path Default: lpr</tt></p>

<p><tt>This specifies the command pipe that should be used
to print messages.</tt></p>

<p><tt>print_decode Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Used in connection with the print-message command.
If this option is set, the message is decoded before it is
passed to the external command specified by $print_command.
If this option is unset, no processing will be applied to
the message when print- ing it. The latter setting may be
useful if you are using some advanced printer filter which
is able to properly format e-mail messages for
printing.</tt></p>

<p><tt>print_split Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>Used in connection with the print-message command.
If this option is set, the command sepcified by
$print_command is exe- cuted once for each message which is
to be printed. If this option is unset, the command
specified by $print_command is exe- cuted only once, and all
the messages are concatenated, with a form feed as the
message separator.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Those who use the enscript(1) program s
mail-printing mode will most likely want to set this
option.</tt></p>

<p><tt>prompt_after Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>If you use an external $pager , setting this
variable will cause Mutt to prompt you for a command when
the pager exits rather than returning to the index menu. If
unset, Mutt will return to the index menu when the external
pager exits.</tt></p>

<p><tt>query_command Type: path Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This specifies the command that mutt will use to
make external address queries. The string should contain a
%s, which will be substituted with the query string the user
types. See query for more information.</tt></p>

<p><tt>quit Type: quadoption Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable controls whether quit and exit
actually quit from mutt. If it set to yes, they do quit, if
it is set to no, they have no effect, and if it is set to
ask-yes or ask-no, you are prompted for confirmation when
you try to quit.</tt></p>

<p><tt>quote_regexp Type: regular expression Default: ^([
]*[|&gt;:}#])+</tt></p>

<p><tt>A regular expression used in the internal-pager to
determine quoted sections of text in the body of a
message.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Note: In order to use the quotedx patterns in the
internal pager, you need to set this to a regular expression
that matches exactly the quote characters at the beginning
of quoted lines.</tt></p>

<p><tt>read_inc Type: number Default: 10</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set to a value greater than 0, Mutt will display
which mes- sage it is currently on when reading a mailbox.
The message is printed after read_inc messages have been
read (e.g., if set to 25, Mutt will print a message when it
reads message 25, and then again when it gets to message
50). This variable is meant to indicate progress when
reading large mailboxes which may take some time. When set
to 0, only a single message will appear before the reading
the mailbox.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Also see the $write_inc variable.</tt></p>

<p><tt>read_only Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, all folders are opened in read-only
mode.</tt></p>

<p><tt>realname Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable specifies what real or personal name
should be used when sending messages.</tt></p>

<p><tt>By default, this is the GCOS field from /etc/passwd.
Note that this variable will not be used when the user has
set a real name in the $from variable.</tt></p>

<p><tt>recall Type: quadoption Default: ask-yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls whether or not you are prompted to recall
postponed messages when composing a new message. Also see
$postponed.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Setting this variable to yes is not generally
useful, and thus not recommended.</tt></p>

<p><tt>record Type: path Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This specifies the file into which your outgoing
messages should be appended. (This is meant as the primary
method for saving a copy of your messages, but another way
to do this is using the my_hdr command to create a Bcc:
field with your email address in it.)</tt></p>

<p><tt>The value of $record is overridden by the
$force_name and $save_name variables, and the fcc-hook
command.</tt></p>

<p><tt>reply_regexp Type: regular expression Default:
^(re([+])*|aw):[ ]*</tt></p>

<p><tt>A regular expression used to recognize reply
messages when threading and replying. The default value
corresponds to the English Re: and the German Aw:.</tt></p>

<p><tt>reply_self Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If unset and you are replying to a message sent by
you, Mutt will assume that you want to reply to the
recipients of that message rather than to yourself.</tt></p>

<p><tt>reply_to Type: quadoption Default: ask-yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, Mutt will ask you if you want to use the
address listed in the Reply-To: header field when replying
to a message. If you answer no, it will use the address in
the From: header field instead. This option is useful for
reading a mailing list that sets the Reply-To: header field
to the list address and you want to send a private message
to the author of a message.</tt></p>

<p><tt>resolve Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, the cursor will be automatically advanced
to the next (possibly undeleted) message whenever a command
that modifies the current message is executed.</tt></p>

<p><tt>reverse_alias Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable controls whether or not Mutt will
display the personal name from your aliases in the index
menu if it finds an alias that matches the messages sender.
For example, if you have the following alias:</tt></p>

<p><tt>alias juser abd30425@somewhere.net (Joe
User)</tt></p>

<p><tt>and then you receive mail which contains the
following header:</tt></p>

<p><tt>From: abd30425@somewhere.net</tt></p>

<p><tt>It would be displayed in the index menu as Joe User
instead of abd30425@somewhere.net. This is useful when the
persons e- mail address is not human friendly (like
CompuServe addresses).</tt></p>

<p><tt>reverse_name Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>It may sometimes arrive that you receive mail to a
certain machine, move the messages to another machine, and
reply to some the messages from there. If this variable is
set, the default From: line of the reply messages is built
using the address where you received the messages you are
replying to. If the variable is unset, the From: line will
use your address on the current machine.</tt></p>

<p><tt>reverse_realname Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable fine-tunes the behaviour of the
reverse_name fea- ture. When it is set, mutt will use the
address from incoming messages as-is, possibly including
eventual real names. When it is unset, mutt will override
any such realnames with the setting of the realname
variable.</tt></p>

<p><tt>rfc2047_parameters Type: boolean Default:
no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When this variable is set, Mutt will decode
RFC-2047-encoded MIME parameters. You want to set this
variable when mutt sug- gests you to save attachments to
files named like this:
=?iso-8859-1?Q?file=5F=E4=5F991116=2Ezip?=</tt></p>

<p><tt>When this variable is set interactively, the change
doesnt have the desired effect before you have changed
folders.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Note that this use of RFC 2047 s encoding is
explicitly, prohib- ited by the standard, but nevertheless
encountered in the wild. Also note that setting this
parameter will not have the effect that mutt generates this
kind of encoding. Instead, mutt will unconditionally use the
encoding specified in RFC 2231.</tt></p>

<p><tt>save_address Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, mutt will take the sender s full address
when choosing a default folder for saving a mail. If
$save_name or $force_name is set too, the selection of the
fcc folder will be changed as well.</tt></p>

<p><tt>save_empty Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When unset, mailboxes which contain no saved
messages will be removed when closed (the exception is
$spoolfile which is never removed). If set, mailboxes are
never removed.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Note: This only applies to mbox and MMDF folders,
Mutt does not delete MH and Maildir directories.</tt></p>

<p><tt>save_name Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable controls how copies of outgoing
messages are saved. When set, a check is made to see if a
mailbox specified by the recipient address exists (this is
done by searching for a mailbox in the $folder directory
with the username part of the recipient address). If the
mailbox exists, the outgoing message will be saved to that
mailbox, otherwise the message is saved to the $record
mailbox.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Also see the $force_name variable.</tt></p>

<p><tt>score Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When this variable is unset, scoring is turned off.
This can be useful to selectively disable scoring for
certain folders when the $score_threshold_delete variable
and friends are used.</tt></p>

<p><tt>score_threshold_delete Type: number Default:
-1</tt></p>

<p><tt>Messages which have been assigned a score equal to
or lower than the value of this variable are automatically
marked for deletion by mutt. Since mutt scores are always
greater than or equal to zero, the default setting of this
variable will never mark a message for deletion.</tt></p>

<p><tt>score_threshold_flag Type: number Default:
9999</tt></p>

<p><tt>Messages wich have been assigned a score greater
than or equal to this variable s value are automatically
marked flagged.</tt></p>

<p><tt>score_threshold_read Type: number Default:
-1</tt></p>

<p><tt>Messages which have been assigned a score equal to
or lower than the value of this variable are automatically
marked as read by mutt. Since mutt scores are always greater
than or equal to zero, the default setting of this variable
will never mark a message read.</tt></p>

<p><tt>send_charset Type: string Default:
us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8</tt></p>

<p><tt>A list of character sets for outgoing messages. Mutt
will use the first character set into which the text can be
converted exactly. If your $charset is not iso-8859-1 and
recipients may not understand UTF-8, it is advisable to
include in the list an appropriate widely used standard
character set (such as iso-8859-2, koi8-r or iso-2022-jp)
either instead of or after iso-8859-1.</tt></p>

<p><tt>sendmail Type: path Default: /usr/sbin/sendmail -oem
-oi</tt></p>

<p><tt>Specifies the program and arguments used to deliver
mail sent by Mutt. Mutt expects that the specified program
interprets addi- tional arguments as recipient
addresses.</tt></p>

<p><tt>sendmail_wait Type: number Default: 0</tt></p>

<p><tt>Specifies the number of seconds to wait for the
$sendmail pro- cess to finish before giving up and putting
delivery in the background.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Mutt interprets the value of this variable as
follows:</tt></p>

<p><tt>&gt;0 number of seconds to wait for sendmail to
finish before continuing</tt></p>

<p><tt>0 wait forever for sendmail to finish</tt></p>

<p><tt>&lt;0 always put sendmail in the background without
waiting</tt></p>

<p><tt>Note that if you specify a value other than 0, the
output of the child process will be put in a temporary file.
If there is some error, you will be informed as to where to
find the output.</tt></p>

<p><tt>shell Type: path Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>Command to use when spawning a subshell. By default,
the users login shell from /etc/passwd is used.</tt></p>

<p><tt>sig_dashes Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, a line containing -- will be inserted before
your $signature. It is strongly recommended that you not
unset this variable unless your signature contains just your
name. The reason for this is because many software packages
use -- to detect your signature. For example, Mutt has the
ability 0 to highlight the signature in a different color in
the builtin pager.</tt></p>

<p><tt>sig_on_top Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, the signature will be included before any
quoted or for- warded text. It is strongly recommended that
you do not set this variable unless you really know what you
are doing, and are prepared to take some heat from
netiquette guardians.</tt></p>

<p><tt>signature Type: path Default: ~/.signature</tt></p>

<p><tt>Specifies the filename of your signature, which is
appended to all outgoing messages. If the filename ends with
a pipe (|), it is assumed that filename is a shell command
and input should be read from its stdout.</tt></p>

<p><tt>simple_search Type: string Default: ~f %s | ~s
%s</tt></p>

<p><tt>Specifies how Mutt should expand a simple search
into a real search pattern. A simple search is one that does
not contain any of the ~ operators. See patterns for more
information on search patterns.</tt></p>

<p><tt>For example, if you simply type joe at a search or
limit prompt, Mutt will automatically expand it to the value
specified by this variable. For the default value it would
be:</tt></p>

<p><tt>~f joe | ~s joe</tt></p>

<p><tt>smart_wrap Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls the display of lines longer then the screen
width in the internal pager. If set, long lines are wrapped
at a word boundary. If unset, lines are simply wrapped at
the screen edge. Also see the $markers variable.</tt></p>

<p><tt>smileys Type: regular expression Default: (&gt;From
)|(:[-^]?[][)(&gt;&lt;}{|/DP])</tt></p>

<p><tt>The pager uses this variable to catch some common
false posi- tives of $quote_regexp, most notably smileys in
the beginning of a line</tt></p>

<p><tt>sleep_time Type: number Default: 1</tt></p>

<p><tt>Specifies time, in seconds, to pause while
displaying certain informational messages, while moving from
folder to folder and after expunging messages from the
current folder. The default is to pause one second, so a
value of zero for this option sup- presses the
pause.</tt></p>

<p><tt>sort Type: sort order Default: date</tt></p>

<p><tt>Specifies how to sort messages in the index menu.
Valid values are:</tt></p>

<p><tt>date or date-sent date-received from mailbox-order
(unsorted) score size subject threads to</tt></p>

<p><tt>You may optionally use the reverse- prefix to
specify reverse sorting order (example: set
sort=reverse-date-sent).</tt></p>

<p><tt>sort_alias Type: sort order Default: alias</tt></p>

<p><tt>Specifies how the entries in the alias menu are
sorted. The following are legal values:</tt></p>

<p><tt>address (sort alphabetically by email address) alias
(sort alphabetically by alias name) unsorted (leave in order
specified in .muttrc)</tt></p>

<p><tt>sort_aux Type: sort order Default: date</tt></p>

<p><tt>When sorting by threads, this variable controls how
threads are sorted in relation to other threads, and how the
branches of the thread trees are sorted. This can be set to
any value that $sort can, except threads (in that case, mutt
will just use date-sent). You can also specify the last-
prefix in addition to the reverse- prefix, but last- must
come after reverse-. The last- prefix causes messages to be
sorted against its siblings by which has the last
descendant, using the rest of sort_aux as an ordering. For
instance, set sort_aux=last- date-received would mean that
if a new message is received in a thread, that thread
becomes the last one displayed (or the first, if you have
set sort=reverse-threads.) Note: For reversed $sort order
$sort_aux is reversed again (which is not the right thing to
do, but kept to not break any existing configuration
setting).</tt></p>

<p><tt>sort_browser Type: sort order Default:
subject</tt></p>

<p><tt>Specifies how to sort entries in the file browser.
By default, the entries are sorted alphabetically. Valid
values:</tt></p>

<p><tt>alpha (alphabetically) date size unsorted</tt></p>

<p><tt>You may optionally use the reverse- prefix to
specify reverse sorting order (example: set
sort_browser=reverse-date).</tt></p>

<p><tt>sort_re Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable is only useful when sorting by threads
with $strict_threads unset. In that case, it changes the
heuristic mutt uses to thread messages by subject. With
sort_re set, mutt will only attach a message as the child of
another message by subject if the subject of the child
message starts with a sub- string matching the setting of
$reply_regexp . With sort_re unset, mutt will attach the
message whether or not this is the case, as long as the non-
$reply_regexp parts of both messages are identical.</tt></p>

<p><tt>spoolfile Type: path Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>If your spool mailbox is in a non-default place
where Mutt can- not find it, you can specify its location
with this variable. Mutt will automatically set this
variable to the value of the environment variable $MAIL if
it is not set.</tt></p>

<p><tt>status_chars Type: string Default: -*%A</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls the characters used by the %r indicator in
$sta- tus_format . The first character is used when the
mailbox is unchanged. The second is used when the mailbox
has been changed, and it needs to be resynchronized. The
third is used if the mailbox is in read-only mode, or if the
mailbox will not be written when exiting that mailbox (You
can toggle whether to write changes to a mailbox with the
toggle-write operation, bound by default to %). The fourth
is used to indicate that the current folder has been opened
in attach- message mode (Cer- tain operations like composing
a new mail, replying, forwarding, etc. are not permitted in
this mode).</tt></p>

<p><tt>status_format Type: string Default: -%r-Mutt: %f
[Msgs:%?M?%M/?%m%?n? New:%n?%?o? Old:%o?%?d? Del:%d?%?F?
Flag:%F?%?t? Tag:%t?%?p? Post:%p?%?b? Inc:%b?%?l?
%l?]---(%s/%S)-%&gt;-(%P)---</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls the format of the status line displayed in
the index menu. This string is similar to $index_format, but
has its own set of printf()-like sequences:</tt></p>

<p><tt>%b number of mailboxes with new mail *</tt></p>

<p><tt>%d number of deleted messages *</tt></p>

<p><tt>%h local hostname</tt></p>

<p><tt>%f the full pathname of the current mailbox</tt></p>

<p><tt>%F number of flagged messages *</tt></p>

<p><tt>%l size (in bytes) of the current mailbox *</tt></p>

<p><tt>%L size (in bytes) of the messages shown (i.e.,
which match the current limit) *</tt></p>

<p><tt>%m the number of messages in the mailbox *</tt></p>

<p><tt>%M the number of messages shown (i.e., which match
the cur- rent limit) *</tt></p>

<p><tt>%n number of new messages in the mailbox *</tt></p>

<p><tt>%o number of old unread messages</tt></p>

<p><tt>%p number of postponed messages *</tt></p>

<p><tt>%P percentage of the way through the index</tt></p>

<p><tt>%r modified/read-only/wont-write/attach-message
indicator, according to $status_chars</tt></p>

<p><tt>%s current sorting mode ($sort)</tt></p>

<p><tt>%S current aux sorting method ($sort_aux)</tt></p>

<p><tt>%t number of tagged messages *</tt></p>

<p><tt>%u number of unread messages *</tt></p>

<p><tt>%v Mutt version string</tt></p>

<p><tt>%V currently active limit pattern, if any *</tt></p>

<p><tt>%&gt;X right justify the rest of the string and pad
with X</tt></p>

<p><tt>%|X pad to the end of the line with X</tt></p>

<p><tt>* = can be optionally printed if nonzero</tt></p>

<p><tt>Some of the above sequences can be used to
optionally print a string if their value is nonzero. For
example, you may only want to see the number of flagged
messages if such messages exist, since zero is not
particularly meaningful. To optionally print a string based
upon one of the above sequences, the fol- lowing construct
is used</tt></p>


<p><tt>%?&lt;sequence_char&gt;?&lt;optional_string&gt;?</tt></p>

<p><tt>where sequence_char is a character from the table
above, and optional_string is the string you would like
printed if sta- tus_char is nonzero. optional_string may
contain other sequence as well as normal text, but you may
not nest optional strings.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Here is an example illustrating how to optionally
print the num- ber of new messages in a mailbox: %?n?%n new
messages.?</tt></p>

<p><tt>Additionally you can switch between two strings, the
first one, if a value is zero, the second one, if the value
is nonzero, by using the following construct:
%?&lt;sequence_char&gt;?&lt;if_string&gt;&amp;&lt;else_string&gt;?</tt></p>

<p><tt>You can additionally force the result of any
printf-like sequence to be lowercase by prefixing the
sequence character with an underscore (_) sign. For example,
if you want to dis- play the local hostname in lowercase,
you would use: %_h</tt></p>

<p><tt>status_on_top Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>Setting this variable causes the status bar to be
displayed on the first line of the screen rather than near
the bottom.</tt></p>

<p><tt>strict_threads Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>If set, threading will only make use of the
In-Reply-To and References fields when you $sort by message
threads. By default, messages with the same subject are
grouped together in pseudo threads. This may not always be
desirable, such as in a personal mailbox where you might
have several unrelated mes- sages with the subject hi which
will get grouped together.</tt></p>

<p><tt>suspend Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When unset, mutt wont stop when the user presses the
terminals susp key, usually control-Z. This is useful if you
run mutt inside an xterm using a command like xterm -e
mutt.</tt></p>

<p><tt>text_flowed Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, mutt will generate text/plain;
format=flowed attach- ments. This format is easier to handle
for some mailing soft- ware, and generally just looks like
ordinary text. To actually make use of this format s
features, you ll need support in your editor.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Note that $indent_string is ignored when this option
is set.</tt></p>

<p><tt>thread_received Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, mutt uses the date received rather than
the date sent to thread messages by subject.</tt></p>

<p><tt>thorough_search Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>Affects the ~b and ~h search operations described in
section patterns above. If set, the headers and attachments
of mes- sages to be searched are decoded before searching.
If unset, messages are searched as they appear in the
folder.</tt></p>

<p><tt>tilde Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, the internal-pager will pad blank lines to
the bottom of the screen with a tilde (~).</tt></p>

<p><tt>timeout Type: number Default: 600</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable controls the number of seconds Mutt
will wait for a key to be pressed in the main menu before
timing out and checking for new mail. A value of zero or
less will cause Mutt not to ever time out.</tt></p>

<p><tt>tmpdir Type: path Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>This variable allows you to specify where Mutt will
place its temporary files needed for displaying and
composing messages.</tt></p>

<p><tt>to_chars Type: string Default: +TCFL</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls the character used to indicate mail
addressed to you. The first character is the one used when
the mail is NOT addressed to your address (default: space).
The second is used when you are the only recipient of the
message (default: +). The third is when your address appears
in the TO header field, but you are not the only recipient
of the message (default: T). The fourth character is used
when your address is specified in the CC header field, but
you are not the only recipient. The fifth character is used
to indicate mail that was sent by you. The sixth character
is used to indicate when a mail was sent to a mailing-list
you subscribe to (default: L).</tt></p>

<p><tt>tunnel Type: string Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>Setting this variable will cause mutt to open a pipe
to a com- mand instead of a raw socket. You may be able to
use this to set up preauthenticated connections to your
IMAP/POP3 server. Example:</tt></p>

<p><tt>tunnel=ssh -q mailhost.net
/usr/local/libexec/imapd</tt></p>

<p><tt>NOTE: For this example to work you must be able to
log in to the remote machine without having to enter a
password.</tt></p>

<p><tt>use_8bitmime Type: boolean Default: no</tt></p>

<p><tt>Warning: do not set this variable unless you are
using a version of sendmail which supports the -B8BITMIME
flag (such as sendmail 8.8.x) or you may not be able to send
mail.</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, Mutt will invoke $sendmail with the
-B8BITMIME flag when sending 8-bit messages to enable ESMTP
negotiation.</tt></p>

<p><tt>use_domain Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, Mutt will qualify all local addresses
(ones without the @host portion) with the value of $hostname
. If unset, no addresses will be qualified.</tt></p>

<p><tt>use_from Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, Mutt will generate the From: header field
when send- ing messages. If unset, no From: header field
will be gener- ated unless the user explicitly sets one
using the my_hdr com- mand.</tt></p>

<p><tt>use_ipv6 Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, Mutt will look for IPv6 addresses of hosts
it tries to contact. If this option is unset, Mutt will
restrict itself to IPv4 addresses. Normally, the default
should work.</tt></p>

<p><tt>user_agent Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, mutt will add a User-Agent header to
outgoing mes- sages, indicating which version of mutt was
used for composing them.</tt></p>

<p><tt>visual Type: path Default:</tt></p>

<p><tt>Specifies the visual editor to invoke when the ~v
command is given in the builtin editor.</tt></p>

<p><tt>wait_key Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls whether Mutt will ask you to press a key
after shell- escape, pipe-message, pipe-entry,
print-message, and print-entry commands.</tt></p>

<p><tt>It is also used when viewing attachments with
auto_view, pro- vided that the corresponding mailcap entry
has a needsterminal flag, and the external program is
interactive.</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, Mutt will always ask for a key. When
unset, Mutt will wait for a key only if the external command
returned a non-zero status.</tt></p>

<p><tt>weed Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, mutt will weed headers when when
displaying, forward- ing, printing, or replying to
messages.</tt></p>

<p><tt>wrap_search Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls whether searches wrap around the end of the
mailbox.</tt></p>

<p><tt>When set, searches will wrap around the first (or
last) message. When unset, searches will not wrap.</tt></p>

<p><tt>wrapmargin Type: number Default: 0</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls the margin left at the right side of the
terminal when mutts pager does smart wrapping.</tt></p>

<p><tt>write_inc Type: number Default: 10</tt></p>

<p><tt>When writing a mailbox, a message will be printed
every write_inc messages to indicate progress. If set to 0,
only a single message will be displayed before writing a
mailbox.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Also see the $read_inc variable.</tt></p>

<p><tt>write_bcc Type: boolean Default: yes</tt></p>

<p><tt>Controls whether mutt writes out the Bcc header when
preparing messages to be sent. Exim users may wish to use
this.</tt></p>
