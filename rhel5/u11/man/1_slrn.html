<p>NAME slrn - An easy to use NNTP / spool based
newsreader.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS slrn [-aCdknmw] [-C-] [-Dname] [-f newsrc-file]
[-i config-file] [-k0] [--create] [-create] [--debug file]
[--help] [--inews] [--kill-log file] [--nntp [-h server] [-p
port]] [--spool] [--version]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION slrn is an easy to use but powerful NNTP /
spool based newsreader.</p>

<p>It is highly customizable, supports scoring, free key
bindings and can be extended using the s-lang macro
language.</p>

<p>To use slrn, you either need to set the NNTPSERVER
environment variable to the server you want to read news
from or specify a server on the command line. A newsrc file
is needed, too. In case you do not yet have one, you can
create it using slrn -f ~/.jnewsrc --create.</p>

<p>Inside slrn, online help is available via the ? key.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options can be used when calling
slrn from the command line. They override both environment
variables and settings in private and global configuration
files.</p>

<p>-a Read active file when checking for new news.</p>

<p>-C Use colors without checking if the terminal supports
it.</p>

<p>-C- Dont use colors, even if the terminal supports
it.</p>

<p>-d Get group descriptions (taglines) from the news
server. Please note that this may cause a download of
several hundred kilobytes and thus can take a long time. The
output is saved to a local file, so you only need to do this
once. May not be specified in combination with --create.</p>

<p>-Dname Add name to the list of predefined preprocessing
tokens, which can be used in your slrnrc file to have
conditionally inter- preted lines. See the slrn reference
manual for details.</p>

<p>-f newsrc-file Use file as the newsrc file for this
session. This is perma- nently set via the server
configuration command.</p>

<p>-h host[:port] Connect to the NNTP server on host,
overriding the $NNTPSERVER environment variable. If no port
is given, the default NNTP port (119) will be used. This
option is only accepted after --nntp or when NNTP is the
default mode.</p>

<p>-i config-file Read file as the initialization (slrnrc)
file. The default is to use .slrnrc (or slrn.rc on VMS, OS/2
and Windows) in your home directory.</p>

<p>-k Dont read the score file.</p>

<p>-k0 Read the score file, but inhibit expensive scoring.
A scoring rule is expensive if it contains header lines that
are not included in the servers overview files. This makes
applying them slow.</p>

<p>-m Force mouse support (without checking if it works on
the current terminal).</p>

<p>-n Do not check for new groups (usually resulting in a
faster startup).</p>

<p>-p N Use port N to connect to the NNTP server.</p>

<p>-w Wait for a key before switching to full screen mode,
allowing the user to read startup messages.</p>

<p>--create Read the active file (the list of all groups)
from the news server to create an initial newsrc file.</p>

<p>-create Obsolete version of --create.</p>

<p>--debug file Write debugging output to file.</p>

<p>--help Show help for command line switches.</p>

<p>--inews Use an external inews program to post
articles.</p>

<p>--kill-log file Keep a log of all articles that were
killed by the scorefile in file.</p>

<p>--nntp Use builtin NNTP support for reading and posting
(an external program is used to post if slrn was compiled
with --enable- force-inews).</p>

<p>--pull Spool outgoing articles locally for slrnpull to
send.</p>

<p>--spool Read directly from spool.</p>

<p>--version Print version and some compile time
settings.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT slrn uses the following list of environment
variables. Note: environ- ment variables can be overridden
by configuration files or command line switches.</p>

<p>COLORTERM If this variable is set, slrn will assume that
your terminal supports ANSI color sequences. It also enables
a workaround for a problem with the mouse reporting when
running slrn inside of an rxvt.</p>

<p>DISPLAY If set, slrn assumes that X11 is running.</p>

<p>EDITOR See $SLRN_EDITOR.</p>

<p>HOME See $SLRNHOME.</p>

<p>HOSTNAME If no hostname is given, the value of this
environment variable is used.</p>

<p>LOGNAME See $USER.</p>

<p>NAME Set it to your realname, if slrn cant determine it
otherwise.</p>

<p>NNTPSERVER You can use this variable to tell slrn which
NNTP server to con- nect to. It can be overridden by the
command line option -h.</p>

<p>ORGANIZATION The name of your organization.</p>

<p>PRINTER On unix systems, slrn pipes the current article
to lpr -P $PRINTER to print it.</p>

<p>PWD This variable is only used on unix systems that dont
support getcwd(3). In these cases, it should be set to the
current directory at the time slrn is invoked. This is
usually done by the shell and nothing the user has to worry
about.</p>

<p>REPLYTO The value of this variable is used as the
default if you do not set replyto in your slrnrc file.</p>

<p>SLANG_EDITOR See $SLRN_EDITOR.</p>

<p>SLRNHELP You can set this variable to a file slrn should
read its online help from. This is only needed when the
default key bindings have been changed and you want the help
function to reflect this. If unset, slrn looks for help.txt
in the configuration directory.</p>

<p>SLRNHOME When interpreting filenames as relative to your
home directory, slrn uses this variable to find out what
your home directory is. If $SLRNHOME is unset, $HOME is used
instead.</p>

<p>SLRN_EDITOR The editor to start for editing articles. If
this variable is unset, slrn subsequently looks at
$SLANG_EDITOR, $EDITOR and $VISUAL.</p>

<p>TMP Indicates the directory in which slrn should save
temporary files.</p>

<p>TMPDIR See $TMP.</p>

<p>USER Your username, if slrn can t get it from the system
by other means.</p>

<p>VISUAL See $SLRN_EDITOR.</p>

<p>FILES $HOME/.slrnrc User-specific configuration
file.</p>

<p>config_dir/slrn.rc System-wide configuration file.
config_dir is set at compile time (/usr/local/etc by
default).</p>

<p>$HOME/.jnewsrc default newsrc file for slrn.</p>

<p>$HOME/.jnewsrc.dsc Per user newsgroups descriptions.</p>

<p>share_dir/newsgroups.dsc Global newsgroup descriptions.
share_dir is set at compile time (/usr/local/share/slrn by
default).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO The documentation that comes with slrn,
especially manual.txt, FAQ and score.txt. If you consider
writing s-lang macros, also look at README.macros and
slrnfuns.txt.</p>

<p>Recent versions of the slrn manual and the FAQ as well
as additional information can also be found on slrns
official home page: http://slrn.sourceforge.net/</p>

<p>Questions about slrn that are not covered by existing
documentation may be posted to the newsgroup
news.software.readers where they will be answered by
knowledgeable users or the author of the program. In addi-
tion, announcements of new versions of slrn are posted
there.</p>

<p>The latest version of slrn is available from
http://prdownloads.source- forge.net/slrn/</p>
