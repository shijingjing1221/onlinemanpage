<p>EPOLL_WAIT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
EPOLL_WAIT(2)</p>

<p>NAME epoll_wait - wait for an I/O event on an epoll file
descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/epoll.h&gt;</p>

<p>int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event * events,
int maxevents, int timeout);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Wait for events on the epoll file descriptor
epfd for a maximum time of timeout milliseconds. The memory
area pointed to by events will contain the events that will
be available for the caller. Up to maxevents are returned by
epoll_wait(2). The maxevents parameter must be greater than
zero. Specifying a timeout of -1 makes epoll_wait(2) wait
indefi- nitely, while specifying a timeout equal to zero
makes epoll_wait(2) to return immediately even if no events
are available (return code equal to zero). The struct
epoll_event is defined as :</p>

<p>typedef union epoll_data { void *ptr; int fd; __uint32_t
u32; __uint64_t u64; } epoll_data_t;</p>

<p>struct epoll_event { __uint32_t events; /* Epoll events
*/ epoll_data_t data; /* User data variable */ };</p>

<p>The data of each returned structure will contain the
same data the user set with a epoll_ctl(2)
(EPOLL_CTL_ADD,EPOLL_CTL_MOD) while the events member will
contain the returned event bit field.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE When successful, epoll_wait(2) returns the
number of file descriptors ready for the requested I/O, or
zero if no file descriptor became ready during the requested
timeout milliseconds. When an error occurs, epoll_wait(2)
returns -1 and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF epfd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>EFAULT The memory area pointed to by events is not
accessible with write permissions.</p>

<p>EINTR The call was interrupted by a signal handler
before any of the requested events occurred or the timeout
expired.</p>

<p>EINVAL epfd is not an epoll file descriptor, or
maxevents is less than or equal to zero.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO epoll_wait(2) is a new API introduced in
Linux kernel 2.5.44. The interface should be finalized by
Linux kernel 2.5.66.</p>
