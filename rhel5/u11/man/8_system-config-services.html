<p>NAME system-config-services - Service Configuration
Utility</p>

<p>SYNTAX system-config-services</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is a graphical tool for enabling and
disabling services (including xinetd services).
Functionality to start, stop, and restart services is also
included.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None</p>

<p>FILES /usr/bin/system-config-services
/usr/share/serviceconf/*</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To run this program simply type:</p>

<p>system-config-services</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS This utility currently execs chkconfig
--add/--del &lt;servicename&gt; when enabling and disabling
services. This means that it does not have the same default
behaviour as ntsysv.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO chkconfig(8) ntsysv(8)</p>

<p>BUGS - Some services will not start or stop properly if
started anywhere but the console (system-config-services
will appear to hang in these instances). This is not a bug
in system-config-services, but in the individual
services.</p>

<p>- Some services are incredibly hard to detect if they
are running or not. Starting, stopping and restarting
initscripts may give mixed results (ie. may fail if you are
stopping a service thats already stopped, etc). This will be
fixed; until then its a bug.</p>
