<p>REMAP_FILE_PAGES(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
REMAP_FILE_PAGES(2)</p>

<p>NAME remap_file_pages - create a non-linear file
mapping</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</p>

<p>int remap_file_pages(void *start, size_t size, int prot,
ssize_t pgoff, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The remap_file_pages() system call is used
to create a non-linear map- ping, that is, a mapping in
which the pages of the file are mapped into a non-sequential
order in memory. The advantage of using remap_file_pages()
over using repeated calls to mmap(2) is that the former
approach does not require the kernel to create additional
VMA (Virtual Memory Area) data structures.</p>

<p>To create a non-linear mapping we perform the following
steps:</p>

<p>1. Use mmap() to create a mapping (which is initially
linear). This mapping must be created with the MAP_SHARED
flag.</p>

<p>2. Use one or more calls to remap_file_pages() to
rearrange the correspondence between the pages of the
mapping and the pages of the file. It is possible to map the
same page of a file into multiple locations within the
mapped region.</p>

<p>The pgoff and size arguments specify the region of the
file that is to be relocated within the mapping: pgoff is a
file offset in units of the system page size; size is the
length of the region in bytes.</p>

<p>The start argument serves two purposes. First, it
identifies the map- ping whose pages we want to rearrange.
Thus, start must be an address that falls within a region
previously mapped by a call to mmap(). Sec- ond, start
specifies the address at which the file pages identified by
pgoff and size will be placed.</p>

<p>The values specified in start and size should be
multiples of the sys- tem page size. If they are not, then
the kernel rounds both values down to the nearest multiple
of the page size.</p>

<p>The prot argument must be specified as 0.</p>

<p>The flags argument has the same meaning as for mmap(),
but all flags other than MAP_NONBLOCK are ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, remap_file_pages() returns 0.
On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>NOTES The remap_file_pages() system call appeared in
Linux 2.5.46.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL start does not refer to a valid mapping
created with the MAP_SHARED flag.</p>

<p>EINVAL start, size, prot, or pgoff is invalid.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The remap_file_pages() system call is
Linux specific.</p>
