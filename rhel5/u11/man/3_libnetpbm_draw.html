<p>NAME libnetpbm_draw - Libnetpbm PPM Drawing Function
Manual</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This reference manual covers functions in
the libnetpbm library for drawing images, using the PPM
image format and the libnetpbm in-memory image formats.</p>

<p>We actually have very little information here; this is
mainly a frame- work for adding documentation later if
someone becomes interested in this facility.</p>

<p>The Functions The functions are all declared in the
ppmdraw.h header file.</p>

<p>ppmd_point_drawproc ppmd_setlinetype ppmd_setlineclip
ppmd_line ppmd_spline3 ppmd_polyspline ppmd_circle
ppmd_filledrectangle ppmd_fill_drawproc ppmd_fill ppmd_text
ppmd_text_box Fonts The ppmd_text and ppmd_text_box
functions use fonts. You control the fonts using functions
described in this section. There is one font that comes with
Netpbm, called standard. It is built into the func- tion
library and is the default font. You can create additional
fonts and use them instead.</p>

<p>In a program that uses Netpbm drawing facilities, there
is a current font. all drawing of text uses the current
font. When the program starts, the current font is standard;
you can change it after that by calling the ppmd_set_font
function.</p>

<p>Other than a built-in font, a font lives in file in a
format special to Netpbm called Ppmdfont. The file typically
has a name that ends in .ppmdfont.</p>

<p>Use the ppmddumpfont program to dump the contents of a
Ppmdfont file in human readable format.</p>

<p>Use the ppmdmkfont program to generate the standard font
as a Ppmd- font file. You dont normally need to do this,
becuase standard is built into libnetpbm.</p>

<p>Use the ppmdcfont program to turn a Ppmdfont file into a
C source file that you can compile into a program as a
built-in font. Though we don t give full instructions here
on how to do that, libnetpbms built- in standard font is a
good example. In Netpbm source code, you will find the C
source file standardppmdfont.c, which was generated from the
file standard.ppmdfont by ppmdcfont. You simply use a
pointer to the structure that the C file defines as a font
handle, just like one you would get from ppmd_read_font.</p>

<p>Font File Format The font file starts with the
characters ppmdfont (without the quota- tion marks) in
ASCII.</p>

<p>The rest of the format is not yet documented, but it
generally describes, for each code point, a sequence of
straight line plotting commands to form the glyph for the
indicated character. I.e. it is a vector, not raster,
font.</p>

<p>Font Control Functions These functions are declared in
the header file ppmdfont.h.</p>

<p>ppmd_read_font This function associates a Ppmdfont file,
which you identify by naming the Ppmdfont file, with a
handle that you can use to identify the font to other
functions. Technically, this function reads the font into
memory.</p>

<p>ppmd_free_font This function releases the handle that
you get from ppmd_read_font. It frees resources associated
with it; you cant use the handle after this.</p>

<p>ppmd_get_font This function returns the handle of the
currently selected font.</p>

<p>ppmd_set_font This function sets the currently selected
font. You identify the font to which to set it with a handle
such as you get from ppmd_read_font or ppmd_get_font.</p>
