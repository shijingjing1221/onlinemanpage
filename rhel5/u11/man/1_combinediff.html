<p>NAME combinediff - create a cumulative unified patch
from two incremental patches</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS combinediff [-p n] [-U n] [-d PAT] [-Bbiqwz]
[[--interpolate] [--combine]] diff1 diff2</p>

<p>combinediff {[--help] [--version]}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION combinediff creates a unified diff that
expresses the sum of two diffs. The diff files must be
listed in the order that they are to be applied. For best
results, the diffs must have at least three lines of
context.</p>

<p>Since combinediff doesnt have the advantage of being
able to look at the files that are to be modified, it has
stricter requirements on the input format than patch(1)
does. The output of GNU diff will be okay, even with
extensions, but if you intend to use a hand-edited patch it
might be wise to clean up the offsets and counts using
recountdiff(1) first.</p>

<p>Note, however, that the two patches must be in strict
incremental order. In other words, the second patch must be
relative to the state of the original set of files after the
first patch was applied.</p>

<p>The diffs may be in context format. The output, however,
will be in unified format.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p n When comparing filenames, ignore the first
n pathname components from both patches. (This is similar to
the -p option to GNU patch(1).)</p>

<p>-q Quieter output. Dont emit rationale lines at the
beginning of each patch.</p>

<p>-U n Attempt to display n lines of context (requires at
least n lines of context in both input files). (This is
similar to the -U option to GNU diff(1).)</p>

<p>-d pattern Don t display any context on files that match
the shell wildcard pattern. This option can be given
multiple times.</p>

<p>Note that the interpretation of the shell wildcard
pattern does not count slash characters or periods as
special (in other words, no flags are given to fnmatch).
This is so that */basename -type patterns can be given
without limiting the number of pathname components.</p>

<p>-i Consider upper- and lower-case to be the same.</p>

<p>-w Ignore whitespace changes in patches.</p>

<p>-b Ignore changes in the amount of whitespace.</p>

<p>-B Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.</p>

<p>-z Decompress files with extensions .gz and .bz2.</p>

<p>--interpolate Run as interdiff . See interdiff(1) for
more information about how the behaviour is altered in this
mode.</p>

<p>--combine Run as combinediff. This is the default.</p>

<p>--help Display a short usage message.</p>

<p>--version Display the version number of combinediff.</p>

<p>BUGS The -U option is a bit erratic: it can control the
amount of context displayed for files that are modified in
both patches, but not for files that only appear in one
patch (which appear with the same amount of context in the
output as in the input).</p>
