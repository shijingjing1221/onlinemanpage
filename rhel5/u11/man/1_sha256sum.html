<p>NAME sha256sum - compute and check SHA256 message
digest</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sha256sum [OPTION] [FILE]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Print or check SHA256 (256-bit) checksums.
With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.</p>

<p>-b, --binary read in binary mode</p>

<p>-c, --check read SHA256 sums from the FILEs and check
them</p>

<p>-t, --text read in text mode (default)</p>

<p>The following two options are useful only when verifying
checksums: --status dont output anything, status code shows
success</p>

<p>-w, --warn warn about improperly formatted checksum
lines</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>The sums are computed as described in FIPS-180-2. When
checking, the input should be a former output of this
program. The default mode is to print a line with checksum,
a character indicating type (* for binary, for text), and
name for each FILE.</p>
