<p>RPCINFO(8) BSD System Manager s Manual RPCINFO(8)</p>

<p>NAME rpcinfo - report RPC information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rpcinfo -p [host] rpcinfo [-n portnum] -u host
program [version] rpcinfo [-n portnum] -t host program
[version] rpcinfo -b program version rpcinfo -d program
version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rpcinfo makes an RPC call to an RPC server
and reports what it finds.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p Probe the portmapper on host, and print a
list of all registered RPC programs. If host is not
specified, it defaults to the value returned by
hostname(1).</p>

<p>-u Make an RPC call to procedure 0 of program on the
specified host using UDP, and report whether a response was
received.</p>

<p>-t Make an RPC call to procedure 0 of program on the
specified host using TCP, and report whether a response was
received.</p>

<p>-n Use portnum as the port number for the -t and -u
options instead of the port number given by the
portmapper.</p>

<p>-b Make an RPC broadcast to procedure 0 of the specified
program and version using UDP and report all hosts that
respond.</p>

<p>-d Delete registration for the RPC service of the
specified program and version. This option can be exercised
only by the super- user.</p>

<p>The program argument can be either a name or a
number.</p>

<p>If a version is specified, rpcinfo attempts to call that
version of the specified program. Otherwise, rpcinfo
attempts to find all the regis- tered version numbers for
the specified program by calling version 0 (which is
presumed not to exist; if it does exist, rpcinfo attempts to
obtain this information by calling an extremely high version
number instead) and attempts to call each registered
version. Note: the version number is required for -b and -d
options.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To show all of the RPC services registered on
the local machine use:</p>

<p>example% rpcinfo -p</p>

<p>To show all of the RPC services registered on the
machine named klaxon use:</p>

<p>example% rpcinfo -p klaxon</p>

<p>To show all machines on the local net that are running
the Yellow Pages service use:</p>

<p>example% rpcinfo -b ypserv version | uniq</p>

<p>where version is the current Yellow Pages version
obtained from the results of the -p switch above.</p>

<p>To delete the registration for version 1 of the walld
service use:</p>

<p>example% rpcinfo -d walld 1</p>

<p>BUGS In releases prior to SunOS 3.0, the Network File
System (NFS) did not register itself with the portmapper;
rpcinfo cannot be used to make RPC calls to the NFS server
on hosts running such releases.</p>
