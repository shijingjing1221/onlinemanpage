<p>GETHOSTNAME(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
GETHOSTNAME(2)</p>

<p>NAME gethostname, sethostname - get/set host name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int gethostname(char *name, size_t len); int
sethostname(const char *name, size_t len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These system calls are used to access or to
change the host name of the current processor. The
gethostname() system call returns a null-termi- nated
hostname (set earlier by sethostname()) in the array name
that has a length of len bytes. In case the null-terminated
hostname does not fit, no error is returned, but the
hostname is truncated. It is unspecified whether the
truncated hostname will be null-terminated.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT name is an invalid address.</p>

<p>EINVAL len is negative or, for sethostname(), len is
larger than the maximum allowed size, or, for gethostname()
on Linux/i386, len is smaller than the actual size. (In this
last case glibc 2.1 uses ENAMETOOLONG.)</p>

<p>EPERM For sethostname(), the caller did not have the
CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.4BSD (this interfaces first
appeared in 4.2BSD). POSIX.1-2001 specifies gethostname()
but not sethostname().</p>

<p>NOTES SUSv2 guarantees that Host names are limited to
255 bytes. POSIX.1-2001 guarantees that Host names (not
including the terminating null byte) are limited to
HOST_NAME_MAX bytes.</p>

<p>GLIBC NOTES The GNU C library implements gethostname()
as a library function that calls uname(2) and copies up to
len bytes from the returned nodename field into name. Having
performed the copy, the function then checks if the length
of the nodename was greater than or equal to len, and if it
is, then the function returns -1 with errno set to
ENAMETOOLONG. Versions of glibc before 2.2 handle the case
where the length of the nodename was greater than or equal
to len differently: nothing is copied into name and the
function returns -1 with errno set to ENAME- TOOLONG.</p>
