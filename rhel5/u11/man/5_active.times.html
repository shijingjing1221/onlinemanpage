ACTIVE.TIMES(5)</p>

<p>NAME active.times - List of local creation times of
newsgroups</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file pathdb/active.times provides a
chronological record of when newsgruops were created on the
local server. This file is normally updated by innd whenever
a newgroup control message is processed or a &quot;ctlinnd
newgroup&quot; command is issued, and is used by nnrpd to
answer NEWGROUPS requests.</p>

<p>Each line consists of three fields:</p>

<p>&lt;name&gt; &lt;time&gt; &lt;creator&gt;</p>

<p>The first field is the name of the newsgroup. The second
field is the time it was created, expressed as the number of
seconds since the epoch. The third field is the e-mail
addrses of the person who created the group, as specified in
the control message or on the ctlinnd com- mand line, or the
newsmaster specified at configure time if no creator
argument was given to ctlinnd.</p>
