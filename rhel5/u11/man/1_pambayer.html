<p>NAME pambayer - interpret Bayer patterns</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pambayer -type={1|2|3|4} [pamfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pambayer reads a Bayer pattern in a 1-deep Netpbm image
and produces a color image in PAM RGB format as output.</p>

<p>A Bayer pattern is what you get from the optical sensor
in some digital cameras. Such a camera doesnt have a red,
green, and blue sensor in the exact same place for an
individual pixel. Instead, it has red, green, and blue
sensors laid out in a two dimensional array. The pat- tern
in which they are laid out is the Bayer pattern. The input
to pambayer is one sample value for each of those sensors,
so some samples are red, some are green, and some are
blue.</p>

<p>The input image is a PNM image or PAM image of arbitrary
tuple type. pambayer looks at only the first plane of the
input.</p>

<p>The output image is a PAM image of tuple type RGB, i.e.
a standard color image. You can convert this to PPM with
pamtopnm(1).</p>

<p>If you re interested in just one of the primary colors,
use pamchannel on the output of pambayer to extract it.</p>

<p>OPTIONS type=n This tells which Bayer pattern the input
is:</p>

<p>1 GBG/RGR/GBG matrix</p>

<p>2 RGR/GBG/RGR matrix</p>

<p>3 BGB/GRG/BGB matrix</p>

<p>4 GRG/BGB/GRG matrix</p>

<p>This option is mandatory.</p>
