<p>NAME perlre - Perl regular expressions</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This page describes the syntax of regular
expressions in Perl.</p>

<p>If you haven t used regular expressions before, a
quick-start introduc- tion is available in perlrequick, and
a longer tutorial introduction is available in
perlretut.</p>

<p>For reference on how regular expressions are used in
matching opera- tions, plus various examples of the same,
see discussions of &quot;m//&quot;, &quot;s///&quot;,
&quot;qr//&quot; and &quot;??&quot; in &quot;Regexp
Quote-Like Operators&quot; in perlop.</p>

<p>Matching operations can have various modifiers.
Modifiers that relate to the interpretation of the regular
expression inside are listed below. Modifiers that alter the
way a regular expression is used by Perl are detailed in
&quot;Regexp Quote-Like Operators&quot; in perlop and
&quot;Gory details of parsing quoted constructs&quot; in
perlop.</p>

<p>i Do case-insensitive pattern matching.</p>

<p>If &quot;use locale&quot; is in effect, the case map is
taken from the cur- rent locale. See perllocale.</p>

<p>m Treat string as multiple lines. That is, change
&quot;^&quot; and &quot;$&quot; from matching the start or
end of the string to matching the start or end of any line
anywhere within the string.</p>

<p>s Treat string as single line. That is, change
&quot;.&quot; to match any character whatsoever, even a
newline, which normally it would not match.</p>

<p>The &quot;/s&quot; and &quot;/m&quot; modifiers both
override the $* setting. That is, no matter what $*
contains, &quot;/s&quot; without &quot;/m&quot; will force
&quot;^&quot; to match only at the beginning of the string
and &quot;$&quot; to match only at the end (or just before a
newline at the end) of the string. Together, as /ms, they
let the &quot;.&quot; match any character whatsoever, while
still allowing &quot;^&quot; and &quot;$&quot; to match,
respectively, just after and just before newlines within the
string.</p>

<p>x Extend your pattern s legibility by permitting
whitespace and com- ments.</p>

<p>These are usually written as &quot;the &quot;/x&quot;
modifier&quot;, even though the delimiter in question might
not really be a slash. Any of these modi- fiers may also be
embedded within the regular expression itself using the
&quot;(?...)&quot; construct. See below.</p>

<p>The &quot;/x&quot; modifier itself needs a little more
explanation. It tells the regular expression parser to
ignore whitespace that is neither back- slashed nor within a
character class. You can use this to break up your regular
expression into (slightly) more readable parts. The
&quot;#&quot; character is also treated as a metacharacter
introducing a comment, just as in ordinary Perl code. This
also means that if you want real whitespace or &quot;#&quot;
characters in the pattern (outside a character class, where
they are unaffected by &quot;/x&quot;), that youll either
have to escape them or encode them using octal or hex
escapes. Taken together, these features go a long way
towards making Perl s regular expressions more readable.
Note that you have to be careful not to include the pattern
delimiter in the comment--perl has no way of knowing you did
not intend to close the pattern early. See the C-comment
deletion code in perlop.</p>

<p>Regular Expressions</p>

<p>The patterns used in Perl pattern matching derive from
supplied in the Version 8 regex routines. (The routines are
derived (distantly) from Henry Spencers freely
redistributable reimplementation of the V8 rou- tines.) See
&quot;Version 8 Regular Expressions&quot; for details.</p>

<p>In particular the following metacharacters have their
standard egrep-ish meanings:</p>

<p>Quote the next metacharacter ^ Match the beginning of
the line . Match any character (except newline) $ Match the
end of the line (or before newline at the end) Alternation
() Grouping [] Character class</p>

<p>By default, the &quot;^&quot; character is guaranteed to
match only the beginning of the string, the &quot;$&quot;
character only the end (or before the newline at the end),
and Perl does certain optimizations with the assumption that
the string contains only one line. Embedded newlines will
not be matched by &quot;^&quot; or &quot;$&quot;. You may,
however, wish to treat a string as a multi-line buffer, such
that the &quot;^&quot; will match after any newline within
the string, and &quot;$&quot; will match before any newline.
At the cost of a little more overhead, you can do this by
using the /m modifier on the pattern match operator. (Older
programs did this by setting $*, but this practice is now
deprecated.)</p>

<p>To simplify multi-line substitutions, the &quot;.&quot;
character never matches a newline unless you use the
&quot;/s&quot; modifier, which in effect tells Perl to
pretend the string is a single line--even if it isnt. The
&quot;/s&quot; modi- fier also overrides the setting of $*,
in case you have some (badly behaved) older code that sets
it in another module.</p>

<p>The following standard quantifiers are recognized:</p>

<p>* Match 0 or more times + Match 1 or more times ? Match
1 or 0 times {n} Match exactly n times {n,} Match at least n
times {n,m} Match at least n but not more than m times</p>

<p>(If a curly bracket occurs in any other context, it is
treated as a regular character. In particular, the lower
bound is not optional.) The &quot;*&quot; modifier is
equivalent to &quot;{0,}&quot;, the &quot;+&quot; modifier
to &quot;{1,}&quot;, and the &quot;?&quot; modifier to
&quot;{0,1}&quot;. n and m are limited to integral val- ues
less than a preset limit defined when perl is built. This is
usu- ally 32766 on the most common platforms. The actual
limit can be seen in the error message generated by code
such as this:</p>

<p>$_ **= $_ , / {$_} / for 2 .. 42;</p>

<p>By default, a quantified subpattern is
&quot;greedy&quot;, that is, it will match as many times as
possible (given a particular starting location) while still
allowing the rest of the pattern to match. If you want it to
match the minimum number of times possible, follow the
quantifier with a &quot;?&quot;. Note that the meanings dont
change, just the &quot;greediness&quot;:</p>

<p>*? Match 0 or more times +? Match 1 or more times ??
Match 0 or 1 time {n}? Match exactly n times {n,}? Match at
least n times {n,m}? Match at least n but not more than m
times</p>

<p>Because patterns are processed as double quoted strings,
the following also work:</p>

<p>tab (HT, TAB) newline (LF, NL)return (CR) form feed (FF)
alarm (bell) (BEL) \ escape (think troff) (ESC) 33 octal
char (think of a PDP-11) B hex char } wide hex char (Unicode
SMILEY) ame} named char lowercase next char (think vi)
uppercase next char (think vi) lowercase till (think vi) U
uppercase till (think vi) end case modification (think vi) Q
quote (disable) pattern metacharacters till If &quot;use
locale&quot; is in effect, the case map used by &quot;
&quot; &quot;&quot; and &quot;U&quot; is taken from the
current locale. See perllocale. For documenta- tion of
&quot;ame}&quot;, see charnames.</p>

<p>You cannot include a literal &quot;$&quot; or
&quot;@&quot; within a &quot;Q&quot; sequence. An unescaped
&quot;$&quot; or &quot;@&quot; interpolates the
corresponding variable, while escaping will cause the
literal string &quot; to be matched. Youll need to write
something like &quot;m/Quser\@Qhost/&quot;.</p>

<p>In addition, Perl defines the following:</p>

<p>0Match a &quot;word&quot; character (alphanumeric plus
&quot;_&quot;) W Match a non-&quot;word&quot; character
Match a whitespace character Match a non-whitespace
character Match a digit character Match a non-digit
character P Match P, named property. Use {Prop} for longer
names. PP Match non-P eXtended Unicode &quot;combining
character sequence&quot;, equivalent to (?:PMM*) Match a
single C char (octet) even under Unicode. NOTE: breaks up
characters into their UTF-8 bytes, so you may end up with
malformed pieces of UTF-8. Unsupported in lookbehind.</p>

<p>A &quot;1512 ter, or a decimal digit) or &quot;_&quot;,
not a whole word. Use &quot;240 a string of Perl-identifier
characters (which isn t the same as match- ing an English
word). If &quot;use locale&quot; is in effect, the list of
alpha- betic characters generated by &quot;816 See
perllocale. You may use &quot;48W&quot;, &quot; &quot;
&quot;&quot;, and &quot; range, that s not a range, the
&quot;-&quot; is understood literally. If Unicode is in
effect, &quot;atches also &quot;&quot;, &quot;, and
&quot;&quot;, see perlunicode for more details about
&quot;P&quot;, &quot;PP&quot;, and &quot; luniintro about
Unicode in general. You can define your own &quot;&quot; and
&quot;P&quot; properties, see perlunicode.</p>

<p>The POSIX character class syntax</p>

<p>[:class:]</p>

<p>is also available. The available classes and their
backslash equiva- lents (if available) are as follows:</p>

<p>alpha alnum ascii blank [1] cntrl digit graph lower
print punct space [2] upper word 0 [3] xdigit</p>

<p>[1] A GNU extension equivalent to &quot;[ ]&quot;,
&quot;all horizontal whitespace&quot;.</p>

<p>[2] Not exactly equivalent to &quot;ince the
&quot;[[:space:]]&quot; includes also the (very rare)
&quot;vertical tabulator&quot;, &quot; [3] A Perl extension,
see above.</p>

<p>For example use &quot;[:upper:]&quot; to match all the
uppercase characters. Note that the &quot;[]&quot; are part
of the &quot;[::]&quot; construct, not part of the whole
character class. For example:</p>

<p>[01[:alpha:]%]</p>

<p>matches zero, one, any alphabetic character, and the
percentage sign.</p>

<p>The following equivalences to Unicode {} constructs and
equivalent backslash character classes (if available), will
hold:</p>

<p>[:...:] {...} backslash</p>

<p>alpha IsAlpha alnum IsAlnum ascii IsASCII blank IsSpace
cntrl IsCntrl digit IsDigit graph IsGraph lower IsLower
print IsPrint punct IsPunct space IsSpace IsSpacePerl upper
IsUpper word IsWord xdigit IsXDigit</p>

<p>For example &quot;[:lower:]&quot; and
&quot;{IsLower}&quot; are equivalent.</p>

<p>If the &quot;utf8&quot; pragma is not used but the
&quot;locale&quot; pragma is, the classes correlate with the
usual isalpha(3) interface (except for &quot;word&quot; and
&quot;blank&quot;).</p>

<p>The assumedly non-obviously named classes are:</p>

<p>cntrl Any control character. Usually characters that
dont produce out- put as such but instead control the
terminal somehow: for example newline and backspace are
control characters. All characters with ord() less than 32
are most often classified as control characters (assuming
ASCII, the ISO Latin character sets, and Unicode), as is the
character with the ord() value of 127 (&quot;DEL&quot;).</p>

<p>graph Any alphanumeric or punctuation (special)
character.</p>

<p>print Any alphanumeric or punctuation (special)
character or the space character.</p>

<p>punct Any punctuation (special) character.</p>

<p>xdigit Any hexadecimal digit. Though this may feel silly
([0-9A-Fa-f] would work just fine) it is included for
completeness.</p>

<p>You can negate the [::] character classes by prefixing
the class name with a ^. This is a Perl extension. For
example:</p>

<p>POSIX traditional Unicode</p>

<p>[:^digit:] P{IsDigit} [:^space:] P{IsSpace} [:^word:] W
P{IsWord}</p>

<p>Perl respects the POSIX standard in that POSIX character
classes are only supported within a character class. The
POSIX character classes [.cc.] and [=cc=] are recognized but
not supported and trying to use them will cause an
error.</p>

<p>Perl defines the following zero-width assertions:</p>

<p>Match a word boundary 0 Match a non-(word boundary)
0Match only at beginning of string Match only at end of
string, or before newline at the end Match only at end of
string G Match only at pos() (e.g. at the end-of-match
position of prior m//g)</p>

<p>) i s a s p o t b e t w e e n t w o A word boundary
(&quot;c0 h a r a c t e r s t h a t h a s a on one side of
it and a &quot;W&quot; on the other side of it (in either
order), counting the imaginary characters off the beginning
and end of the r e p r e string as matching a &quot;W&quot;.
(Within character classes &quot;s e n t s backspace rather
than a word boundary, just as it normally does in any
double-quoted string.) The &quot;0
areandjust&quot;$&quot;,lik^&quot; except that they wont
match multiple times when the &quot;/m&quot; modifier is
used, while &quot;^&quot; and &quot;$&quot; will match at
every internal line boundary. To match the actual end of the
string and not ignore an optional trailing newline, use
&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;G&quot; assertion can be used to chain global
matches (using &quot;m//g&quot;), as described in
&quot;Regexp Quote-Like Operators&quot; in perlop. It is
also useful when writing &quot;lex&quot;-like scanners, when
you have several patterns that you want to match against
consequent substrings of your string, see the previous
reference. The actual location where &quot;G&quot; will
match can also be influenced by using &quot;pos()&quot; as
an lvalue: see &quot;pos&quot; in perlfunc. Currently
&quot;G&quot; is only fully supported when anchored to the
start of the pattern; while it is permitted to use it
elsewhere, as in &quot;/(?&lt;=G..)./g&quot;, some such uses
(&quot;/.G/g&quot;, for example) currently cause problems,
and it is recommended that you avoid such usage for now.</p>

<p>The bracketing construct &quot;( ... )&quot; creates
capture buffers. To refer to the digit th buffer use
&lt;digit&gt; within the match. Outside the match use
&quot;$&quot; instead of &quot; circumstances outside the
match. See the warning below about 1 vs $1 for details.)
Referring back to another part of the match is called a
backreference.</p>

<p>There is no limit to the number of captured substrings
that you may use. However Perl also uses 10, 11, etc. as
aliases for 10, 11, etc. (Recall that 0 means octal, so 11
is the character at number 9 in your coded character set;
which would be the 10th character, a hori- zontal tab under
ASCII.) Perl resolves this ambiguity by interpreting 10 as a
backreference only if at least 10 left parentheses have
opened before it. Likewise 11 is a backreference only if at
least 11 left parentheses have opened before it. And so on.
1 through 9 are always interpreted as backreferences.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>s/^([^ ]*) *([^ ]*)/$2 $1/; # swap first two words</p>

<p>if (/(.)1/) { # find first doubled char print &quot;$1
is the first doubled character0; }</p>

<p>if (/Time: (..):(..):(..)/) { # parse out values $hours
= $1; $minutes = $2; $seconds = $3; }</p>

<p>Several special variables also refer back to portions of
the previous match. $+ returns whatever the last bracket
match matched. $&amp; returns the entire matched string. (At
one point $0 did also, but now it returns the name of the
program.) $&lsquo; returns everything before the matched
string. $&rsquo; returns everything after the matched
string. And $^N contains whatever was matched by the
most-recently closed group (submatch). $^N can be used in
extended patterns (see below), for exam- ple to assign a
submatch to a variable.</p>

<p>The numbered match variables ($1, $2, $3, etc.) and the
related punctu- ation set ($+, $&amp;, $&lsquo;, $&rsquo;,
and $^N) are all dynamically scoped until the end of the
enclosing block or until the next successful match,
whichever comes first. (See &quot;Compound Statements&quot;
in perlsyn.)</p>

<p>NOTE: failed matches in Perl do not reset the match
variables, which makes it easier to write code that tests
for a series of more specific cases and remembers the best
match.</p>

<p>WARNING: Once Perl sees that you need one of $&amp;,
$&lsquo;, or $&rsquo; anywhere in the program, it has to
provide them for every pattern match. This may substantially
slow your program. Perl uses the same mechanism to pro- duce
$1, $2, etc, so you also pay a price for each pattern that
con- tains capturing parentheses. (To avoid this cost while
retaining the grouping behaviour, use the extended regular
expression &quot;(?: ... )&quot; instead.) But if you never
use $&amp;, $&lsquo; or $&rsquo;, then patterns without
capturing parentheses will not be penalized. So avoid
$&amp;, $&rsquo;, and $&lsquo; if you can, but if you cant
(and some algorithms really appreciate them), once you ve
used them once, use them at will, because youve already paid
the price. As of 5.005, $&amp; is not so costly as the other
two.</p>

<p>Backslashed metacharacters in Perl are alphanumeric,
such as &quot;, &quot;480. Unlike some other regular
expression languages, there are no backslashed symbols that
aren t alphanumeric. So anything that looks like \, , &lt;,
&gt;, , or is always interpreted as a literal character, not
a metacharacter. This was once used in a common idiom to
disable or quote the special meanings of regular expression
metacharacters in a string that you want to use for a
pattern. Simply quote all non-&quot;word&quot;
characters:</p>

<p>$pattern =~ s/(W)/\$1/g;</p>

<p>(If &quot;use locale&quot; is set, then this depends on
the current locale.) Today it is more common to use the
quotemeta() function or the &quot;Q&quot; metaquoting escape
sequence to disable all metacharacters special meanings like
this:</p>

<p>/$unquotedQ$quotednquoted/</p>

<p>Beware that if you put literal backslashes (those not
inside interpo- lated variables) between &quot;Q&quot; and
&quot; polation may lead to confusing results. If you need
to use literal backslashes within &quot;Q...
constructs&quot; in perlop.</p>

<p>Extended Patterns</p>

<p>Perl also defines a consistent extension syntax for
features not found in standard tools like awk and lex. The
syntax is a pair of parenthe- ses with a question mark as
the first thing within the parentheses. The character after
the question mark indicates the extension.</p>

<p>The stability of these extensions varies widely. Some
have been part of the core language for many years. Others
are experimental and may change without warning or be
completely removed. Check the documenta- tion on an
individual feature to verify its current status.</p>

<p>A question mark was chosen for this and for the
minimal-matching con- struct because 1) question marks are
rare in older regular expressions, and 2) whenever you see
one, you should stop and &quot;question&quot; exactly what
is going on. Thats psychology...</p>

<p>&quot;(?#text)&quot; A comment. The text is ignored. If
the &quot;/x&quot; modifier enables whitespace formatting, a
simple &quot;#&quot; will suffice. Note that Perl closes the
comment as soon as it sees a &quot;)&quot;, so there is no
way to put a literal &quot;)&quot; in the comment.</p>

<p>&quot;(?imsx-imsx)&quot; One or more embedded
pattern-match modifiers, to be turned on (or turned off, if
preceded by &quot;-&quot;) for the remainder of the pattern
or the remainder of the enclosing pattern group (if any).
This is particularly useful for dynamic patterns, such as
those read in from a configuration file, read in as an
argument, are specified in a table somewhere, etc. Consider
the case that some of which want to be case sensitive and
some do not. The case insensitive ones need to include
merely &quot;(?i)&quot; at the front of the pattern. For
example:</p>

<p>$pattern = &quot;foobar&quot;; if ( /$pattern/i ) {
}</p>

<p># more flexible:</p>

<p>$pattern = &quot;(?i)foobar&quot;; if ( /$pattern/ ) {
}</p>

<p>These modifiers are restored at the end of the enclosing
group. For example,</p>

<p>( (?i) blah ) 1</p>

<p>will match a repeated (including the case!) word
&quot;blah&quot; in any case, assuming &quot;x&quot;
modifier, and no &quot;i&quot; modifier outside this
group.</p>

<p>&quot;(?:pattern)&quot; &quot;(?imsx-imsx:pattern)&quot;
This is for clustering, not capturing; it groups subexpres-
sions like &quot;()&quot;, but doesnt make backreferences as
&quot;()&quot; does. So</p>

<p>? : a @fields = split(/b c )</p>

<p>is like</p>

<p>a b @fields = split(/c )</p>

<p>but doesn t spit out extra fields. Its also cheaper not
to capture characters if you dont need to.</p>

<p>Any letters between &quot;?&quot; and &quot;:&quot; act
as flags modifiers as with &quot;(?imsx-imsx)&quot;. For
example,</p>

<p>/(?s-i:more.*than).*million/i</p>

<p>is equivalent to the more verbose</p>

<p>/(?:(?s-i)more.*than).*million/i</p>

<p>&quot;(?=pattern)&quot; A zero-width positive look-ahead
assertion. For example, &quot;/1152 including the tab in
$&amp;.</p>

<p>&quot;(?!pattern)&quot; A zero-width negative look-ahead
assertion. For example &quot;/foo(?!bar)/&quot; matches any
occurrence of &quot;foo&quot; that isnt followed by
&quot;bar&quot;. Note however that look-ahead and look-
behind are NOT the same thing. You cannot use this for
look-behind.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a &quot;bar&quot; that isn t
preceded by a &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;/(?!foo)bar/&quot; will
not do what you want. Thats because the &quot;(?!foo)&quot;
is just saying that the next thing can- not be
&quot;foo&quot;--and it s not, its a &quot;bar&quot;, so
&quot;foobar&quot; will match. You would have to do
something like &quot;/(?!foo)...bar/&quot; for that. We say
&quot;like&quot; because theres the case of your
&quot;bar&quot; not having three characters before it. You
could cover that this way: &quot;/(?:(?!foo)...
^.{0,2})bar/&quot;. Sometimes its still easier just to
say:</p>

<p>if (/bar/ &amp;&amp; $ !~ /foo$/)</p>

<p>For look-behind see below.</p>

<p>&quot;(?&lt;=pattern)&quot; A zero-width positive
look-behind assertion. For example, &quot;/(?&lt;=)1080
including the tab in $&amp;. Works only for fixed-width
look-behind.</p>

<p>&quot;(?&lt;!pattern)&quot; A zero-width negative
look-behind assertion. For example
&quot;/(?&lt;!bar)foo/&quot; matches any occurrence of
&quot;foo&quot; that does not follow &quot;bar&quot;. Works
only for fixed-width look-behind.</p>

<p>&quot;(?{ code })&quot; WARNING: This extended regular
expression feature is consid- ered highly experimental, and
may be changed or deleted without notice.</p>

<p>This zero-width assertion evaluates any embedded Perl
code. It always succeeds, and its &quot;code&quot; is not
interpolated. Cur- rently, the rules to determine where the
&quot;code&quot; ends are somewhat convoluted.</p>

<p>This feature can be used together with the special
variable $^N to capture the results of submatches in
variables without having to keep track of the number of
nested parentheses. For example:</p>

<p>$_ = &quot;The brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot;;
/the ()(?{ $color = $^N }) ()(?{ $animal = $^N })/i; print
&quot;color = $color, animal = $animal0;</p>

<p>Inside the &quot;(?{...})&quot; block, $_ refers to the
string the reg- ular expression is matching against. You can
also use &quot;pos()&quot; to know what is the current
position of matching within this string.</p>

<p>The &quot;code&quot; is properly scoped in the following
sense: If the assertion is backtracked (compare
&quot;Backtracking&quot;), all changes introduced after
&quot;local&quot;ization are undone, so that</p>

<p>$_ = a x 8; m&lt; (?{ $cnt = 0 }) # Initialize $cnt. ( a
(?{ local $cnt = $cnt + 1; # Update $cnt, backtracking-safe.
}) )* aaaa (?{ $res = $cnt }) # On success copy to
non-localized # location. &gt;x;</p>

<p>will set &quot;$res = 4&quot;. Note that after the
match, $cnt returns to the globally introduced value,
because the scopes that restrict &quot;local&quot; operators
are unwound.</p>

<p>This assertion may be used as a
&quot;(?(condition)yes-pat- tern no-pattern)&quot; switch.
If not used in this way, the result of evaluation of
&quot;code&quot; is put into the special vari- able $^R.
This happens immediately, so $^R can be used from other
&quot;(?{ code })&quot; assertions inside the same regular
expression.</p>

<p>The assignment to $^R above is properly localized, so
the old value of $^R is restored if the assertion is
backtracked; compare &quot;Backtracking&quot;.</p>

<p>For reasons of security, this construct is forbidden if
the regular expression involves run-time interpolation of
vari- ables, unless the perilous &quot;use re
&rsquo;eval&rsquo;&quot; pragma has been used (see re), or
the variables contain results of &quot;qr//&quot; operator
(see &quot;qr/STRING/imosx&quot; in perlop).</p>

<p>This restriction is because of the wide-spread and
remarkably convenient custom of using run-time determined
strings as patterns. For example:</p>

<p>$re = &lt;&gt;; chomp $re; $string =~ /$re/;</p>

<p>Before Perl knew how to execute interpolated code within
a pattern, this operation was completely safe from a
security point of view, although it could raise an exception
from an illegal pattern. If you turn on the &quot;use re
&rsquo;eval&rsquo;&quot;, though, it is no longer secure, so
you should only do so if you are also using taint checking.
Better yet, use the carefully constrained evaluation within
a Safe compartment. See perlsec for details about both these
mechanisms.</p>

<p>&quot;(??{ code })&quot; WARNING: This extended regular
expression feature is consid- ered highly experimental, and
may be changed or deleted with- out notice. A simplified
version of the syntax may be intro- duced for commonly used
idioms.</p>

<p>This is a &quot;postponed&quot; regular subexpression.
The &quot;code&quot; is evaluated at run time, at the moment

<p>The &quot;code&quot; is not interpolated. As before, the
rules to determine where the &quot;code&quot; ends are
currently somewhat convo- luted.</p>

&quot;pattern&quot; would match if anchored at the given
position, and it matches nothing other than this substring.
This construct is useful for optimizations of what would
otherwise be &quot;eternal&quot; matches, because it will
not backtrack (see &quot;Backtracking&quot;). It may also be
useful in places where the &quot;grab all you can, and do
not give anything back&quot; semantic is desirable.</p>

<p>For example: &quot;^(?&gt;a*)ab&quot; will never match,
since &quot;(?&gt;a*)&quot; (anchored at the beginning of
string, as above) will match all characters &quot;a&quot; at
the beginning of string, leaving no &quot;a&quot; for
&quot;ab&quot; to match. In contrast, &quot;a*ab&quot; will
match the same as &quot;a+b&quot;, since the match of the
subgroup &quot;a*&quot; is influenced by the following group
&quot;ab&quot; (see &quot;Backtracking&quot;). In partic-
ular, &quot;a*&quot; inside &quot;a*ab&quot; will match
fewer characters than a standalone &quot;a*&quot;, since
this makes the tail match.</p>

<p>An effect similar to &quot;(?&gt;pattern)&quot; may be
achieved by writing &quot;(?=(pattern))1&quot;. This matches
the same substring as a standalone &quot;a+&quot;, and the
following &quot;1&quot; eats the matched string; it
therefore makes a zero-length assertion into an analogue of
&quot;(?&gt;...)&quot;. (The difference between these two
constructs is that the second one uses a capturing group,
thus shifting ordinals of backreferences in the rest of a
regular expression.)</p>

<p>Consider this pattern:</p>

<p>m{ ( [^()]+ # x+ [^()]* )+ }x</p>

<p>That will efficiently match a nonempty group with
matching parentheses two levels deep or less. However, if
there is no such group, it will take virtually forever on a
long string. Thats because there are so many different ways
to split a long string into several substrings. This is what
&quot;(.+)+&quot; is doing, and &quot;(.+)+&quot; is similar
to a subpattern of the above pattern. Consider how the
pattern above detects no-match on
&quot;((()aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&quot; in several seconds, but
that each extra letter doubles this time. This exponential
performance will make it appear that your program has hung.
However, a tiny change to this pattern</p>

<p>m{ ( (?&gt; [^()]+ ) # change x+ above to (?&gt; x+ )
[^()]* )+ }x</p>

<p>which uses &quot;(?&gt;...)&quot; matches exactly when
the one above does (verifying this yourself would be a
productive exercise), but finishes in a fourth the time when
used on a similar string with 1000000 &quot;a&quot;s. Be
aware, however, that this pattern cur- rently triggers a
warning message under the &quot;use warnings&quot; pragma or
-w switch saying it &quot;matches null string many times in
regex&quot;.</p>

<p>On simple groups, such as the pattern &quot;(?&gt;
[^()]+ )&quot;, a com- parable effect may be achieved by
negative look-ahead, as in &quot;[^()]+ (?! [^()] )&quot;.
This was only 4 times slower on a string with 1000000
&quot;a&quot;s.</p>

<p>The &quot;grab all you can, and do not give anything
back&quot; seman- tic is desirable in many situations where
on the first sight a simple &quot;()*&quot; looks like the
correct solution. Suppose we parse text with comments being
delimited by &quot;#&quot; followed by some optional
(horizontal) whitespace. Contrary to its appearance,
&quot;#[ ]*&quot; is not the correct subexpression to match
the comment delimiter, because it may &quot;give up&quot;
some whitespace if the remainder of the pattern can be made
to match that way. The correct answer is either one of
these:</p>

<p>(?&gt;#[ ]*) #[ ]*(?![ ])</p>

<p>For example, to grab non-empty comments into $1, one
should use either one of these:</p>

<p>/ (?&gt; / Which one you pick depends on which of these
expressions bet- ter reflects the above specification of
comments.</p>

&quot;(?(condition)yes-pattern)&quot; WARNING: This extended
regular expression feature is consid- ered highly
experimental, and may be changed or deleted with- out
notice.</p>

<p>Conditional expression. &quot;(condition)&quot; should
be either an integer in parentheses (which is valid if the
corresponding pair of parentheses matched), or
look-ahead/look-behind/eval- uate zero-width assertion.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>m{ ( )? [^()]+ (?(1) ) }x</p>

<p>matches a chunk of non-parentheses, possibly included in
parentheses themselves.</p>

<p>Backtracking</p>

<p>NOTE: This section presents an abstract approximation of
regular expression behavior. For a more rigorous (and
complicated) view of the rules involved in selecting a match
among possible alternatives, see &quot;Combining pieces
together&quot;.</p>

<p>A fundamental feature of regular expression matching
involves the notion called backtracking, which is currently
used (when needed) by all regular expression quantifiers,
namely &quot;*&quot;, &quot;*?&quot;, &quot;+&quot;,
&quot;+?&quot;, &quot;{n,m}&quot;, and &quot;{n,m}?&quot;.
Backtracking is often optimized internally, but the general
principle outlined here is valid.</p>

<p>For a regular expression to match, the entire regular
expression must match, not just part of it. So if the
beginning of a pattern contain- ing a quantifier succeeds in
a way that causes later parts in the pat- tern to fail, the
matching engine backs up and recalculates the begin- ning
part--thats why its called backtracking.</p>

<p>Here is an example of backtracking: Lets say you want to
find the word following &quot;foo&quot; in the string
&quot;Food is on the foo table.&quot;:</p>

<p>$_ = &quot;Food is on the foo table.&quot;; f o if ( /o
<big><big><big><big>8</big></big></big></big> <sup>)
<big><big><big><big>print &quot;$2 follows $1.0;
}</big></big></big></big></sup></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>When the match runs, the first part
of the regular expression (&quot; e h t f o g n i n n i g e
b e h t t a t h g i r h c t a m e l b i s s o p a s d n i f
) &quot; ) o o f string, and loads up $1 with
&quot;Foo&quot;. However, as soon as the matching engine
sees that there s no whitespace following the
&quot;Foo&quot; that it had saved in $1, it realizes its
mistake and starts over again one charac- ter after where it
had the tentative match. This time it goes all the way until
the next occurrence of &quot;foo&quot;. The complete regular
expression matches this time, and you get the expected
output of &quot;table follows
foo.&quot;</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Sometimes minimal matching can help
a lot. Imagine youd like to match everything between
&quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;. Initially, you write
something like this:</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>$_ = &quot;The food is under the bar
in the barn.&quot;; if ( /foo(.*)bar/ ) { print &quot;got
&lt;$1&gt;0; }</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Which perhaps unexpectedly
yields:</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>got &lt;d is under the bar in the
&gt;</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>That s because &quot;.*&quot; was
greedy, so you get everything between the _first
&quot;foo&quot; and the _last &quot;bar&quot;. Here it s
more effective to use minimal matching to make sure you get
the text between a &quot;foo&quot; and the first
&quot;bar&quot; thereafter.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>if ( /foo(.*?)bar/ ) { print
&quot;got &lt;$1&gt;0 } got &lt;d is under the
&gt;</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Here s another example: lets say you
d like to match a number at the end of a string, and you
also want to keep the preceding part of the match. So you
write this:</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>$_ = &quot;I have 2 numbers:
53147&quot;; if ( /(.*)( *)/ ) {# Wrong! print
&quot;Beginning is &lt;$1&gt;, number is &lt;$2&gt;.0;
}</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>That won t work at all, because
&quot;.*&quot; was greedy and gobbled up the whole string.
As &quot; *&quot; canmatch on an empty string the complete
regu- lar expression matched
successfully.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Beginning is &lt;I have 2 numbers:
53147&gt;, number is &lt;&gt;.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Here are some variants, most of
which dont work:</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>$_ = &quot;I have 2 numbers:
53147&quot;; @pats = qw{ (.*)( *)(.*)( +)(.*?)( *)(.*?)(
+)(.*)( +)$(.*?)( +)$(.*) $ ) + (.*$
};</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>for $pat (@pats) { printf
&quot;%-12s &quot;, $pat; if ( /$pat/ ) { print
&quot;&lt;$1&gt; &lt;$2&gt;0; } else { print &quot;FAIL0; }
}</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>That will print
out:</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>(.*)( *) &lt;I have 2numbers:
53147&gt; &lt;&gt; (.*)( +) &lt;I have 2numbers: 5314&gt;
&lt;7&gt; (.*?)( *) &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;(.*?)( +) &lt;I have
&gt;&lt;2&gt; (.*)( +)$ &lt;I have 2numbers: 5314&gt;
&lt;7&gt; (.*?)( +)$ &lt;I have 2numbers: &gt; &lt;53147&gt;
(.*) &gt; 7 4 1 3 5 &lt; &gt; : s r e b m u n 2 e v a h I
&lt; $ ) + (.*$ &lt;I have 2 numbers: &gt;
&lt;53147&gt;</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>As you see, this can be a bit
tricky. It s important to realize that a regular expression
is merely a set of assertions that gives a defini- tion of
success. There may be 0, 1, or several different ways that
the definition might succeed against a particular string.
And if there are multiple ways it might succeed, you need to
understand backtracking to know which variety of success you
will achieve.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>When using look-ahead assertions and
negations, this can all get even trickier. Imagine you d
like to find a sequence of non-digits not fol- lowed by
&quot;123&quot;. You might try to write that
as</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>$_ = &quot;ABC123&quot;; if ( /^
print &quot;Yup, no 123 in $_0;
}</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>But that isn t going to match; at
least, not the way you re hoping. It claims that there is no
123 in the string. Here s a clearer picture of why that
pattern matches, contrary to popular
expectations:</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>$x = ABC123; $y =
ABC445;</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>print &quot;1: got $10 if $x =~
/^(ABC)(?!123)/; print &quot;2: got $10 if $y =~
/^(ABC)(?!123)/;</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>print &quot;3: got $10 if $x =~ /^(
print &quot;4: got $10 if $y =~ /^( This
prints</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>2: got ABC 3: got AB 4: got
ABC</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>You might have expected test 3 to
fail because it seems to a more gen- eral purpose version of
test 1. The important difference between them is that test 3
contains a quantifier (&quot; ing, whereas test 1 will not.
What s happening is that youve asked &quot;Is it true that
at the start of $x, following 0 or more non-digits, you have
something thats not 123?&quot; If the pattern matcher had
let &quot; fail.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>The search engine will initially
match &quot; try to match &quot;(?!123&quot; with
&quot;123&quot;, which fails. But because a quanti- fier
(&quot; can backtrack and retry the match differently in the
hope of matching the complete regular
expression.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>The pattern really, really wants to
succeed, so it uses the standard pattern back-off-and-retry
and lets &quot; time. Now there s indeed something following
&quot;AB&quot; that is not &quot;123&quot;. It s
&quot;C123&quot;, which
suffices.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>We can deal with this by using both
an assertion and a negation. Well say that the first part in
$1 must be followed both by a digit and by something that s
not &quot;123&quot;. Remember that the look-aheads are zero-
width expressions--they only look, but don t consume any of
the string in their match. So rewriting this way produces
what youd expect; that is, case 5 will fail, but case 6
succeeds:</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>print &quot;5: got $10 if $x =~ /^(
print &quot;6: got $10 if $y =~ /^( 6: got
ABC</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>In other words, the two zero-width
assertions next to each other work as though they re ANDed
together, just as you d use any built-in asser- tions:
&quot;/^$/&quot; matches only if you re at the beginning of
the line AND the end of the line simultaneously. The deeper
underlying truth is that juxtaposition in regular
expressions always means AND, except when you write an
explicit OR using the vertical bar. &quot;/ab/&quot; means
match &quot;a&quot; AND (then) match &quot;b&quot;, although
the attempted matches are made at different positions
because &quot;a&quot; is not a zero-width assertion, but a
one-width assertion.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>WARNING: particularly complicated
regular expressions can take exponen- tial time to solve
because of the immense number of possible ways they can use
backtracking to try match. For example, without internal
opti- mizations done by the regular expression engine, this
will take a painfully long time to
run:</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>aaaaaaaaaaaa =~
/((a{0,5}){0,5})*[c]/</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>And if you used &quot;*&quot; s in
the internal groups instead of limiting them to 0 through 5
matches, then it would take forever--or until you ran out of
stack space. Moreover, these internal optimizations are not
always applicable. For example, if you put &quot;{0,5}&quot;
instead of &quot;*&quot; on the external group, no current
optimization is applicable, and the match takes a long time
to finish.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>A powerful tool for optimizing such
beasts is what is known as an &quot;independent group&quot;,
which does not backtrack (see
&quot;&quot;(?&gt;pattern)&quot;&quot;). Note also that
zero-length look-ahead/look-behind assertions will not
backtrack to make the tail match, since they are in
&quot;logical&quot; context: only whether they match is
considered relevant. For an example where side-effects of
look-ahead _might have influenced the following match, see
&quot;&quot;(?&gt;pattern)&quot;&quot;.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Version 8 Regular
Expressions</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>In case you re not familiar with the
&quot;regular&quot; Version 8 regex rou- tines, here are the
pattern-matching rules not described
above.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Any single character matches itself,
unless it is a metacharacter with a special meaning
described here or above. You can cause characters that
normally function as metacharacters to be interpreted
literally by prefixing them with a &quot; &quot;\&quot;
matches a &quot; characters in the target string, so the
pattern &quot;blurfl&quot; would match &quot;blurfl&quot; in
the target string.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>You can specify a character class,
by enclosing a list of characters in &quot;[]&quot;, which
will match any one character from the list. If the first
character after the &quot;[&quot; is &quot;^&quot;, the
class matches any character not in the list. Within a list,
the &quot;-&quot; character specifies a range, so that
&quot;a-z&quot; represents all characters between
&quot;a&quot; and &quot;z&quot;, inclusive. If you want
either &quot;-&quot; or &quot;]&quot; itself to be a member
of a class, put it at the start of the list (possibly after
a &quot;^&quot;), or escape it with a back- slash.
&quot;-&quot; is also taken literally when it is at the end
of the list, just before the closing &quot;]&quot;. (The
following all specify the same class of three characters:
&quot;[-az]&quot;, &quot;[az-]&quot;, and
&quot;[a&minus;z]&quot;. All are different from
&quot;[a-z]&quot;, which specifies a class containing
twenty-six characters, even on EBCDIC based coded character
sets.) Also, if you try to use the character classes
&quot;96W&quot;, &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;, or &quot;
pointsof a range, that s not a range, the &quot;-&quot; is
understood literally.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Note also that the whole range idea
is rather unportable between char- acter sets--and even
within character sets they may cause results you probably
didnt expect. A sound principle is to use only ranges that
begin from and end at either alphabets of equal case ([a-e],
[A-E]), or digits ([0-9]). Anything else is unsafe. If in
doubt, spell out the character sets in
full.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Characters may be specified using a
metacharacter syntax much like that used in C: &quot;0
matches a newline, &quot;&quot; a tab, &quot; &quot; a
carriage return, &quot; a form feed, etc. More generally,
n_nn, where _nnn is a string of octal digits, matches the
character whose coded character set value is nnn. Similarly,
n_n, where _nn are hexadecimal digits, matches the character
whose numeric value is _nn. The expression character
control-_ x. Finally, the &quot;.&quot; metacharacter
matches any char- acter except &quot;0 (unless you use
&quot;/s&quot;).</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>You can specify a series of
alternatives for a pattern using &quot;&quot; to separate
them, so that &quot;fee fie foe&quot; will match any of
&quot;fee&quot;, &quot;fie&quot;, or &quot;foe&quot; in the
target string (as would &quot;f(e i o)e&quot;). The first
alterna- tive includes everything from the last pattern
delimiter (&quot;(&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, or the beginning of
the pattern) up to the first &quot;&quot;, and the last
alter- native contains everything from the last &quot;
&quot; to the next pattern delim- iter. That s why it s
common practice to include alternatives in parentheses: to
minimize confusion about where they start and
end.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Alternatives are tried from left to
right, so the first alternative found for which the entire
expression matches, is the one that is cho- sen. This means
that alternatives are not necessarily greedy. For exam- ple:
when matching &quot;foo foot&quot; against
&quot;barefoot&quot;, only the &quot;foo&quot; part will
match, as that is the first alternative tried, and it
successfully matches the target string. (This might not seem
important, but it is important when you are capturing
matched text using parentheses.)</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Also remember that &quot;&quot; is
interpreted as a literal within square brack- ets, so if you
write &quot;[feefiefoe]&quot; you re really only matching
&quot;[feio]&quot;.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Within a pattern, you may designate
subpatterns for later reference by enclosing them in
parentheses, and you may refer back to the _nth sub- pattern
later in the pattern using the metacharacter n. Subpatterns
are numbered based on the left to right order of their
opening paren- thesis. A backreference matches whatever
actually matched the subpat- tern in the string being
examined, not the rules for that subpattern. Therefore,
&quot;(00x) **&quot; willmatch &quot;0x1234 0x4321&quot;,
but not &quot;0x1234 01234&quot;, because subpattern 1
matched &quot;0x&quot;, even though the rule &quot;0
0x&quot; could potentially match the leading 0 in the second
number.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Warning on1 vs
$1</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Some people get too used to writing
things like:</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>$pattern =~
s/(W)/\1/g;</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>This is grandfathered for the RHS of
a substitute to avoid shocking the sed addicts, but it s a
dirty habit to get into. Thats because in PerlThink, the
righthand side of an &quot;s///&quot; is a double-quoted
string. &quot;1&quot; in the usual double-quoted string
means a control-A. The custom- ary Unix meaning of
&quot;1&quot; is kludged in for &quot;s///&quot;. However,
if you get into the habit of doing that, you get yourself
into trouble if you then add an &quot;/e&quot;
modifier.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>s/( +)/ 1 + 1 /eg;# causes warning
under -w</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Or if you try to
do</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>s/(
+)/1000/;</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>You can t disambiguate that by
saying &quot;1}000&quot;, whereas you can fix it with
&quot;${1}000&quot;. The operation of interpolation should
not be confused with the operation of matching a
backreference. Certainly they mean two different things on
the left side of the
&quot;s///&quot;.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Repeated patterns matching
zero-length substring</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>WARNING: Difficult material (and
prose) ahead. This section needs a
rewrite.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Regular expressions provide a terse
and powerful programming language. As with most other power
tools, power comes together with the ability to wreak
havoc.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>A common abuse of this power stems
from the ability to make infinite loops using regular
expressions, with something as innocuous
as:</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>foo =~ m{ ( o? )*
}x;</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>The &quot;o?&quot; can match at the
beginning of &rsquo;foo&rsquo;, and since the position in
the string is not moved by the match, &quot;o?&quot; would
match again and again because of the &quot;*&quot; modifier.
Another common way to create a similar cycle is with the
looping modifier
&quot;//g&quot;:</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>@matches = ( foo =~ m{ o? }xg
);</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>or</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>print &quot;match: &lt;$&amp;&gt;0
while foo =~ m{ o? }xg;</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>or the loop implied by
split().</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>However, long experience has shown
that many programming tasks may be significantly simplified
by using repeated subexpressions that may match zero-length
substrings. Here s a simple example
being:</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>@chars = split //, $string; # // is
not magic in split ($whitewashed = $string) =~ s/()/ /g; #
parens avoid magic s// /</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Thus Perl allows such constructs, by
_forcefully breaking the infinite loop. The rules for this
are different for lower-level loops given by the greedy
modifiers &quot;*+{}&quot;, and for higher-level ones like
the &quot;/g&quot; modifier or _split()
operator.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>The lower-level loops are
interrupted (that is, the loop is broken) when Perl detects
that a repeated expression matched a zero-length sub-
string. Thus</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>m{ (?: NON_ZERO_LENGTH ZERO_LENGTH
)* }x;</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>is made equivalent
to</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>m{ (?: NON_ZERO_LENGTH )* (?:
ZERO_LENGTH )? }x;</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>The higher level-loops preserve an
additional state between iterations: whether the last match
was zero-length. To break the loop, the follow- ing match
after a zero-length match is prohibited to have a length of
zero. This prohibition interacts with backtracking (see
&quot;Backtrack- ing&quot;), and so the _ second best match
is chosen if the _ best match is of zero
length.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>For
example:</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>$_ = bar;
s/0/&lt;$&amp;&gt;/g;</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>results in
&quot;&lt;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;r&gt;&lt;&gt;&quot;.
At each position of the string the best match given by
non-greedy &quot;??&quot; is the zero-length match, and the
second best match is what is matched by &quot;1296 alternate
with one-character-long matches.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Similarly, for repeated
&quot;m/()/g&quot; the second-best match is the match at the
position one notch further in the
string.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>The additional state of being
_matched with zero-length is associated with the matched
string, and is reset by each assignment to pos().
Zero-length matches at the end of the previous match are
ignored during
&quot;split&quot;.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Combining pieces
together</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Each of the elementary pieces of
regular expressions which were described before (such as
&quot;ab&quot; or &quot;) could match at atmosttheone
substring given position of the input string. However, in a
typi- cal regular expression these elementary pieces are
combined into more complicated patterns using combining
operators &quot;ST&quot;, &quot;ST&quot;, &quot;S*&quot; etc
(in these examples &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are
regular subexpressions).</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Such combinations can include
alternatives, leading to a problem of choice: if we match a
regular expression &quot;aab&quot; against &quot;abc&quot;,
will it match substring &quot;a&quot; or &quot;ab&quot;? One
way to describe which substring is actually matched is the
concept of backtracking (see &quot;Backtracking&quot;).
However, this description is too low-level and makes you
think in terms of a particular
implementation.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Another description starts with
notions of &quot;better&quot;/&quot;worse&quot;. All the
substrings which may be matched by the given regular
expression can be sorted from the &quot;best&quot; match to
the &quot;worst&quot; match, and it is the &quot;best&quot;
match which is chosen. This substitutes the question of
&quot;what is cho- sen?&quot; by the question of &quot;which
matches are better, and which are
worse?&quot;.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Again, for elementary pieces there
is no such question, since at most one match at a given
position is possible. This section describes the notion of
better/worse for combining operators. In the description
below &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are regular
subexpressions.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>&quot;ST&quot; Consider two possible
matches, &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;A&rsquo;B&rsquo;&quot;,
&quot;A&quot; and &quot;A&rsquo;&quot; are substrings which
can be matched by &quot;S&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and
&quot;B&rsquo;&quot; are substrings which can be matched by
&quot;T&quot;.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>If &quot;A&quot; is better match for
&quot;S&quot; than &quot;A&rsquo;&quot;, &quot;AB&quot; is a
better match than
&quot;A&rsquo;B&rsquo;&quot;.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>If &quot;A&quot; and
&quot;A&rsquo;&quot; coincide: &quot;AB&quot; is a better
match than &quot;AB&rsquo;&quot; if &quot;B&quot; is better
match for &quot;T&quot; than
&quot;B&rsquo;&quot;.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>&quot;ST&quot; When &quot;S&quot;
can match, it is a better match than when only &quot;T&quot;
can match.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Ordering of two matches for
&quot;S&quot; is the same as for &quot;S&quot;. Similar for
two matches for &quot;T&quot;.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>&quot;S{REPEAT_COUNT}&quot; Matches
as &quot;SSS...S&quot; (repeated as many times as
necessary).</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>&quot;S{min,max}&quot; Matches as
&quot;S{max}
S{max-1}...S{min+1}S{min}&quot;.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>&quot;S{min,max}?&quot; Matches as
&quot;S{min}
S{min+1}...S{max-1}S{max}&quot;.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>&quot;S?&quot;, &quot;S*&quot;,
&quot;S+&quot; Same as &quot;S{0,1}&quot;,
&quot;S{0,BIG_NUMBER}&quot;, &quot;S{1,BIG_NUMBER}&quot;
respec- tively.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>&quot;S??&quot;, &quot;S*?&quot;,
&quot;S+?&quot; Same as &quot;S{0,1}?&quot;,
&quot;S{0,BIG_NUMBER}?&quot;, &quot;S{1,BIG_NUMBER}?&quot;
respec- tively.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>&quot;(?&gt;S)&quot; Matches the
best match for &quot;S&quot; and only
that.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>&quot;(?=S)&quot;,
&quot;(?&lt;=S)&quot; Only the best match for &quot;S&quot;
is considered. (This is important only if &quot;S&quot; has
capturing parentheses, and backreferences are used some-
where else in the whole regular
expression.)</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>&quot;(?!S)&quot;,
&quot;(?&lt;!S)&quot; For this grouping operator there is no
need to describe the order- ing, since only whether or not
&quot;S&quot; can match is
important.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>&quot;(??{ EXPR })&quot; The
ordering is the same as for the regular expression which is
the result of EXPR.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>&quot;(?(condition)yes-pattern
no-pattern)&quot; Recall that which of
&quot;yes-pattern&quot; or &quot;no-pattern&quot; actually
matches is already determined. The ordering of the matches
is the same as for the chosen
subexpression.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>The above recipes describe the
ordering of matches at a given position. One more rule is
needed to understand how a match is determined for the whole
regular expression: a match at an earlier position is always
bet- ter than a match at a later
position.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Creating custom RE
engines</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Overloaded constants (see overload)
provide a simple way to extend the functionality of the RE
engine.</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Suppose that we want to enable a new
RE escape-sequence &quot; matches at boundary between
whitespace characters and non-whitespace characters. Note
that &quot;(?=(?&lt;!(?!(?&lt;=&quot; matches exactly at
these positions, so we want to have complicated each &quot;
version. We can create a module &quot;customre&quot; to do
this:</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>package customre; use
overload;</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>sub import { shift; die &quot;No
argument to customre::import allowed&quot; if @_;
overload::constant qr =&gt; convert;
}</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>sub invalid { die &quot;/$_[0]/:
invalid escape \$_[1] &quot;}</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big># We must also take care of not
escaping the legitimate \Y # sequence, hence the presence of
\ in the conversion rules. my %rules = ( \ =&gt; \\ , Y
=&gt; qr/(?=(?&lt;!(?!(?&lt;=/ ); sub convert { my $re =
shift; $re =~ s{ \ ( \ Y . ) } { $rules{$1} or
invalid($re,$1) }sgex; return $re;
}</big></big></big></big></p>

<p><big><big><big><big>Now &quot;use customre&quot; enables
the new escape in constant regular expres- sions, i.e.,
those without any runtime variable interpolations. As
documented in overload, this conversion will work only over
literal parts of regular expressions. this For regular
&quot; expression needs to be converted explicitly (but only
if the special meaning of &quot; use customre; $re =
&lt;&gt;; chomp $re; $re = customre::convert $re; BUGS /
