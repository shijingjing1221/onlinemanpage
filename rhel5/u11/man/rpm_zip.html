<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) ZIP(1L) ZIP(1L)</p>

<p>NAME zip, zipcloak, zipnote, zipsplit - package and
compress (archive) files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS zip [-aABcdDeEfFghjklLmoqrRSTuvVwXyz!@$] [-b
path] [-n suffixes] [-t mmddyyyy] [-tt mmddyyyy] [ zipfile [
file1 file2 ...]] [-xi list]</p>

<p>zipcloak [-dhL] [-b path] zipfile</p>

<p>zipnote [-hwL] [-b path] zipfile</p>

<p>zipsplit [-hiLpst] [-n size] [-b path] zipfile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION zip is a compression and file packaging
utility for Unix, VMS, MSDOS, OS/2, Windows NT, Minix, Atari
and Macintosh, Amiga and Acorn RISC OS.</p>

<p>It is analogous to a combination of the UNIX commands
tar(1) and com- press(1) and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil
Katzs ZIP for MSDOS sys- tems).</p>

<p>A companion program (unzip(1L)), unpacks zip archives.
The zip and unzip(1L) programs can work with archives
produced by PKZIP, and PKZIP and PKUNZIP can work with
archives produced by zip. zip version 2.31 is compatible
with PKZIP 2.04. Note that PKUNZIP 1.10 cannot extract files
produced by PKZIP 2.04 or zip 2.31. You must use PKUNZIP
2.04g or unzip 5.0p1 (or later versions) to extract
them.</p>

<p>For a brief help on zip and unzip, run each without
specifying any parameters on the command line.</p>

<p>The program is useful for packaging a set of files for
distribution; for archiving files; and for saving disk space
by temporarily compress- ing unused files or
directories.</p>

<p>The zip program puts one or more compressed files into a
single zip archive, along with information about the files
(name, path, date, time of last modification, protection,
and check information to verify file integrity). An entire
directory structure can be packed into a zip archive with a
single command. Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 are common
for text files. zip has one compression method (deflation)
and can also store files without compression. zip
automatically chooses the better of the two for each file to
be compressed.</p>

<p>When given the name of an existing zip archive, zip will
replace iden- tically named entries in the zip archive or
add entries for new names. For example, if foo.zip exists
and contains foo/file1 and foo/file2, and the directory foo
contains the files foo/file1 and foo/file3, then:</p>

<p>zip -r foo foo</p>

<p>will replace foo/file1 in foo.zip and add foo/file3 to
foo.zip. After this, foo.zip contains foo/file1, foo/file2,
and foo/file3, with foo/file2 unchanged from before.</p>

<p>If the file list is specified as -@, [Not on MacOS] zip
takes the list of input files from standard input. Under
UNIX, this option can be used to powerful effect in
conjunction with the find(1) command. For example, to
archive all the C source files in the current directory and
its subdirectories:</p>

<p>find . -name &quot;*.[ch]&quot; -print | zip source
-@</p>

<p>(note that the pattern must be quoted to keep the shell
from expanding it). zip will also accept a single dash
(&quot;-&quot;) as the zip file name, in which case it will
write the zip file to standard output, allowing the output
to be piped to another program. For example:</p>

<p>zip -r - . | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k</p>

<p>would write the zip output directly to a tape with the
specified block size for the purpose of backing up the
current directory.</p>

<p>zip also accepts a single dash (&quot;-&quot;) as the
name of a file to be com- pressed, in which case it will
read the file from standard input, allowing zip to take
input from another program. For example:</p>

<p>tar cf - . | zip backup -</p>

<p>would compress the output of the tar command for the
purpose of backing up the current directory. This generally
produces better compression than the previous example using
the -r option, because zip can take advantage of redundancy
between files. The backup can be restored using the
command</p>

<p>unzip -p backup | tar xf -</p>

<p>When no zip file name is given and stdout is not a
terminal, zip acts as a filter, compressing standard input
to standard output. For exam- ple,</p>

<p>tar cf - . | zip | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k</p>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<p>tar cf - . | zip - - | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k</p>

<p>zip archives created in this manner can be extracted
with the program funzip which is provided in the unzip
package, or by gunzip which is provided in the gzip package.
For example:</p>

<p>dd if=/dev/nrst0 ibs=16k | funzip | tar xvf -</p>

<p>When changing an existing zip archive, zip will write a
temporary file with the new contents, and only replace the
old one when the process of creating the new version has
been completed without error.</p>

<p>If the name of the zip archive does not contain an
extension, the extension .zip is added. If the name already
contains an extension other than .zip the existing extension
is kept unchanged.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a [Systems using EBCDIC] Translate file to
ASCII format.</p>

<p>-A Adjust self-extracting executable archive. A
self-extracting executable archive is created by prepending
the SFX stub to an existing archive. The -A option tells zip
to adjust the entry offsets stored in the archive to take
into account this &quot;pream- ble&quot; data.</p>

<p>Note: self-extracting archives for the Amiga are a
special case. At present, only the Amiga port of Zip is
capable of adjusting or updating these without corrupting
them. -J can be used to remove the SFX stub if other updates
need to be made.</p>

<p>-B [VM/CMS and MVS] force file to be read binary
(default is text).</p>

<p>-Bn [TANDEM] set Edit/Enscribe formatting options with n
defined as bit 0: Dont add delimiter (Edit/Enscribe) bit 1:
Use LF rather than CR/LF as delimiter (Edit/Enscribe) bit 2:
Space fill record to maximum record length (Enscribe) bit 3:
Trim trailing space (Enscribe) bit 8: Force 30K (Expand)
large read for unstructured files</p>

<p>-b path Use the specified path for the temporary zip
archive. For exam- ple:</p>

<p>zip -b /tmp stuff *</p>

<p>will put the temporary zip archive in the directory
/tmp, copy- ing over stuff.zip to the current directory when
done. This option is only useful when updating an existing
archive, and the file system containing this old archive
does not have enough space to hold both old and new archives
at the same time.</p>

<p>-c Add one-line comments for each file. File operations
(adding, updating) are done first, and the user is then
prompted for a one-line comment for each file. Enter the
comment followed by return, or just return for no
comment.</p>

<p>-d Remove (delete) entries from a zip archive. For
example:</p>

<p>zip -d foo foo/tom/junk foo/harry/o</p>

<p>will remove the entry foo/tom/junk, all of the files
that start with foo/harry/, and all of the files that end
with .o (in any path). Note that shell pathname expansion
has been inhibited with backslashes, so that zip can see the
asterisks, enabling zip to match on the contents of the zip
archive instead of the contents of the current
directory.</p>

<p>Under systems where the shell does not expand wildcards,
such as MSDOS, the backslashes are not needed. The above
would then be</p>

<p>zip -d foo foo/tom/junk foo/harry/* *.o</p>

<p>Under MSDOS, -d is case sensitive when it matches names
in the zip archive. This requires that file names be entered
in upper case if they were zipped by PKZIP on an MSDOS
system.</p>

<p>-df [MacOS] Include only data-fork of files zipped into
the archive. Good for exporting files to foreign
operating-systems. Resource-forks will be ignored at
all.</p>

<p>-D Do not create entries in the zip archive for
directories. Directory entries are created by default so
that their attributes can be saved in the zip archive. The
environment variable ZIPOPT can be used to change the
default options. For example under Unix with sh:</p>

<p>ZIPOPT=&quot;-D&quot;; export ZIPOPT</p>

<p>(The variable ZIPOPT can be used for any option except
-i and -x and can include several options.) The option -D is
a shorthand for -x &quot;*/&quot; but the latter cannot be
set as default in the ZIPOPT environment variable.</p>

<p>-e Encrypt the contents of the zip archive using a
password which is entered on the terminal in response to a
prompt (this will not be echoed; if standard error is not a
tty, zip will exit with an error). The password prompt is
repeated to save the user from typing errors.</p>

<p>-E [OS/2] Use the .LONGNAME Extended Attribute (if
found) as file- name.</p>

<p>-f Replace (freshen) an existing entry in the zip
archive only if it has been modified more recently than the
version already in the zip archive; unlike the update option
(-u) this will not add files that are not already in the zip
archive. For example:</p>

<p>zip -f foo</p>

<p>This command should be run from the same directory from
which the original zip command was run, since paths stored
in zip archives are always relative.</p>

<p>Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be
set according to the local timezone in order for the -f , -u
and -o options to work correctly.</p>

<p>The reasons behind this are somewhat subtle but have to
do with the differences between the Unix-format file times
(always in GMT) and most of the other operating systems
(always local time) and the necessity to compare the two. A
typical TZ value is MET-1MEST (Middle European time with
automatic adjustment for summertime or Daylight Savings
Time).</p>

<p>-F Fix the zip archive. This option can be used if some
portions of the archive are missing. It is not guaranteed to
work, so you MUST make a backup of the original archive
first.</p>

<p>When doubled as in -FF the compressed sizes given inside
the damaged archive are not trusted and zip scans for
special signa- tures to identify the limits between the
archive members. The single -F is more reliable if the
archive is not too much dam- aged, for example if it has
only been truncated, so try this option first.</p>

<p>Neither option will recover archives that have been
incorrectly transferred in ascii mode instead of binary.
After the repair, the -t option of unzip may show that some
files have a bad CRC. Such files cannot be recovered; you
can remove them from the archive using the -d option of
zip.</p>

<p>-g Grow (append to) the specified zip archive, instead
of creating a new one. If this operation fails, zip attempts
to restore the archive to its original state. If the
restoration fails, the archive might become corrupted. This
option is ignored when there s no existing archive or when
at least one archive member must be updated or deleted.</p>

<p>-h Display the zip help information (this also appears
if zip is run with no arguments).</p>

<p>-i files Include only the specified files, as in:</p>

<p>zip -r foo . -i c</p>

<p>which will include only the files that end in .c in the
current directory and its subdirectories. (Note for PKZIP
users: the equivalent command is</p>

<p>pkzip -rP foo *.c</p>

<p>PKZIP does not allow recursion in directories other than
the current one.) The backslash avoids the shell filename
substitu- tion, so that the name matching is performed by
zip at all directory levels. Not escaping wildcards on
shells that do wildcard substitution before zip gets the
command line may seem to work but files in subdirectories
matching the pattern will never be checked and so not
matched. For shells, such as Win32 command prompts, that do
not replace file patterns containing wildcards with the
respective file names, zip will do the recur- sion and
escaping the wildcards is not needed.</p>

<p>Also possible:</p>

<p>zip -r foo . -i@include.lst</p>

<p>which will only include the files in the current
directory and its subdirectories that match the patterns in
the file include.lst.</p>

<p>-I [Acorn RISC OS] Don t scan through Image files. When
used, zip will not consider Image files (eg. DOS partitions
or Spark archives when SparkFS is loaded) as directories but
will store them as single files.</p>

<p>For example, if you have SparkFS loaded, zipping a Spark
archive will result in a zipfile containing a directory (and
its con- tent) while using the I option will result in a
zipfile con- taining a Spark archive. Obviously this second
case will also be obtained (without the I option) if SparkFS
isnt loaded.</p>

<p>-j Store just the name of a saved file (junk the path),
and do not store directory names. By default, zip will store
the full path (relative to the current path).</p>

<p>-jj [MacOS] record Fullpath (+ Volname). The complete
path including volume will be stored. By default the
relative path will be stored.</p>

<p>-J Strip any prepended data (e.g. a SFX stub) from the
archive.</p>

<p>-k Attempt to convert the names and paths to conform to
MSDOS, store only the MSDOS attribute (just the user write
attribute from UNIX), and mark the entry as made under MSDOS
(even though it was not); for compatibility with PKUNZIP
under MSDOS which cannot handle certain names such as those
with two dots.</p>

<p>-l Translate the Unix end-of-line character LF into the
MSDOS con- vention CR LF. This option should not be used on
binary files. This option can be used on Unix if the zip
file is intended for PKUNZIP under MSDOS. If the input files
already contain CR LF, this option adds an extra CR. This
ensures that unzip -a on Unix will get back an exact copy of
the original file, to undo the effect of zip -l. See the
note on binary detection for -ll below.</p>

<p>-ll Translate the MSDOS end-of-line CR LF into Unix LF.
This option should not be used on binary files and a warning
will be issued when a file is converted that later is
detected to be binary. This option can be used on MSDOS if
the zip file is intended for unzip under Unix.</p>

<p>In Zip 2.31 binary detection has been changed from a
simple per- centage of binary characters being considered
binary to a more selective method that should consider files
in many character sets, including UTF-8, that only include
text characters in that character set to be text. This
allows unzip -a to convert these files.</p>

<p>-L Display the zip license.</p>

<p>-m Move the specified files into the zip archive;
actually, this deletes the target directories/files after
making the specified zip archive. If a directory becomes
empty after removal of the files, the directory is also
removed. No deletions are done until zip has created the
archive without error. This is useful for conserving disk
space, but is potentially dangerous so it is recommended to
use it in combination with -T to test the archive before
removing all input files.</p>

<p>-n suffixes Do not attempt to compress files named with
the given suffixes. Such files are simply stored (0%
compression) in the output zip file, so that zip doesnt
waste its time trying to compress them. The suffixes are
separated by either colons or semi- colons. For example:</p>

<p>zip -rn .Z:.zip:.tiff:.gif:.snd foo foo</p>

<p>will copy everything from foo into foo.zip, but will
store any files that end in .Z, .zip, .tiff, .gif, or .snd
without trying to compress them (image and sound files often
have their own specialized compression methods). By default,
zip does not com- press files with extensions in the list
.Z:.zip:.zoo:.arc:.lzh:.arj. Such files are stored directly
in the output archive. The environment variable ZIPOPT can
be used to change the default options. For example under
Unix with csh:</p>

<p>setenv ZIPOPT &quot;-n .gif:.zip&quot;</p>

<p>To attempt compression on all files, use:</p>

<p>zip -n : foo</p>

<p>The maximum compression option -9 also attempts
compression on all files regardless of extension.</p>

<p>On Acorn RISC OS systems the suffixes are actually
filetypes (3 hex digit format). By default, zip does not
compress files with filetypes in the list DDC:D96:68E (i.e.
Archives, CFS files and PackDir files).</p>

<p>-N [Amiga, MacOS] Save Amiga or MacOS filenotes as
zipfile com- ments. They can be restored by using the -N
option of unzip. If -c is used also, you are prompted for
comments only for those files that do not have
filenotes.</p>

<p>-o Set the &quot;last modified&quot; time of the zip
archive to the latest (oldest) &quot;last modified&quot;
time found among the entries in the zip archive. This can be
used without any other operations, if desired. For
example:</p>

<p>zip -o foo</p>

<p>will change the last modified time of foo.zip to the
latest time of the entries in foo.zip.</p>

<p>-P password use password to encrypt zipfile entries (if
any). THIS IS INSE- CURE! Many multi-user operating systems
provide ways for any user to see the current command line of
any other user; even on stand-alone systems there is always
the threat of over-the- shoulder peeking. Storing the
plaintext password as part of a command line in an automated
script is even worse. Whenever possible, use the
non-echoing, interactive prompt to enter pass- words. (And
where security is truly important, use strong encryption
such as Pretty Good Privacy instead of the relatively weak
encryption provided by standard zipfile utilities.)</p>

<p>-q Quiet mode; eliminate informational messages and
comment prompts. (Useful, for example, in shell scripts and
background tasks).</p>

<p>-Qn [QDOS] store information about the file in the file
header with n defined as bit 0: Dont add headers for any
file bit 1: Add headers for all files bit 2: Dont wait for
interactive key press on exit</p>

<p>-r Travel the directory structure recursively; for
example:</p>

<p>zip -r foo foo</p>

<p>In this case, all the files and directories in foo are
saved in a zip archive named foo.zip, including files with
names starting with &quot;.&quot;, since the recursion does
not use the shells file-name substitution mechanism. If you
wish to include only a specific subset of the files in
directory foo and its subdirectories, use the -i option to
specify the pattern of files to be included. You should not
use -r with the name &quot;.*&quot;, since that matches
&quot;..&quot; which will attempt to zip up the parent
directory (proba- bly not what was intended).</p>

<p>-R Travel the directory structure recursively starting
at the cur- rent directory; for example:</p>

<p>zip -R foo *.c</p>

<p>In this case, all the files matching *.c in the tree
starting at the current directory are stored into a zip
archive named foo.zip. Note for PKZIP users: the equivalent
command is</p>

<p>pkzip -rP foo *.c</p>

<p>-S [MSDOS, OS/2, WIN32 and ATARI] Include system and
hidden files. [MacOS] Includes finder invisible files, which
are ignored oth- erwise.</p>

<p>-t mmddyyyy Do not operate on files modified prior to
the specified date, where mm is the month (0-12), dd is the
day of the month (1-31), and yyyy is the year. The ISO 8601
date format yyyy-mm-dd is also accepted. For example:</p>

<p>zip -rt 12071991 infamy foo</p>

<p>zip -rt 1991-12-07 infamy foo</p>

<p>will add all the files in foo and its subdirectories
that were last modified on or after 7 December 1991, to the
zip archive infamy.zip.</p>

<p>-tt mmddyyyy Do not operate on files modified after or
at the specified date, where mm is the month (0-12), dd is
the day of the month (1-31), and yyyy is the year. The ISO
8601 date format yyyy-mm-dd is also accepted. For
example:</p>

<p>zip -rtt 11301995 infamy foo</p>

<p>zip -rtt 1995-11-30 infamy foo</p>

<p>will add all the files in foo and its subdirectories
that were last modified before the 30 November 1995, to the
zip archive infamy.zip.</p>

<p>-T Test the integrity of the new zip file. If the check
fails, the old zip file is unchanged and (with the -m
option) no input files are removed.</p>

<p>-u Replace (update) an existing entry in the zip archive
only if it has been modified more recently than the version
already in the zip archive. For example:</p>

<p>zip -u stuff *</p>

<p>will add any new files in the current directory, and
update any files which have been modified since the zip
archive stuff.zip was last created/modified (note that zip
will not try to pack stuff.zip into itself when you do
this).</p>

<p>Note that the -u option with no arguments acts like the
-f (freshen) option.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode or print diagnostic version info.</p>

<p>Normally, when applied to real operations, this option
enables the display of a progress indicator during
compression and requests verbose diagnostic info about
zipfile structure oddi- ties.</p>

<p>When -v is the only command line argument, and either
stdin or stdout is not redirected to a file, a diagnostic
screen is printed. In addition to the help screen header
with program name, version, and release date, some pointers
to the Info-ZIP home and distribution sites are given. Then,
it shows informa- tion about the target environment
(compiler type and version, OS version, compilation date and
the enabled optional features used to create the zip
executable.</p>

<p>-V [VMS] Save VMS file attributes and use portable form.
zip archives created with this option are truncated at EOF
but still may not be usable on other systems depending on
the file types being zipped.</p>

<p>-VV [VMS] Save VMS file attributes. zip archives created
with this option include the entire file and should be able
to recreate most VMS files on VMS systems but these archives
will generally not be usable on other systems.</p>

<p>-w [VMS] Append the version number of the files to the
name, including multiple versions of files. (default: use
only the most recent version of a specified file).</p>

<p>-x files Explicitly exclude the specified files, as
in:</p>

<p>zip -r foo foo -x o</p>

<p>which will include the contents of foo in foo.zip while
exclud- ing all the files that end in .o. The backslash
avoids the shell filename substitution, so that the name
matching is per- formed by zip at all directory levels. If
you do not escape wildcards in patterns it may seem to work
but files in subdirec- tories will not be checked for
matches.</p>

<p>Also possible:</p>

<p>zip -r foo foo -x@exclude.lst</p>

<p>which will include the contents of foo in foo.zip while
exclud- ing all the files that match the patterns in the
file exclude.lst (each file pattern on a separate line).</p>

<p>-X Do not save extra file attributes (Extended
Attributes on OS/2, uid/gid and file times on Unix).</p>

<p>-y Store symbolic links as such in the zip archive,
instead of com- pressing and storing the file referred to by
the link (UNIX only).</p>

<p>-z Prompt for a multi-line comment for the entire zip
archive. The comment is ended by a line containing just a
period, or an end of file condition (^D on UNIX, ^Z on
MSDOS, OS/2, and VAX/VMS). The comment can be taken from a
file:</p>

<p>zip -z foo &lt; foowhat</p>

<p>-# Regulate the speed of compression using the specified
digit #, where -0 indicates no compression (store all
files), -1 indi- cates the fastest compression method (less
compression) and -9 indicates the slowest compression method
(optimal compression, ignores the suffix list). The default
compression level is -6.</p>

<p>-! [WIN32] Use priviliges (if granted) to obtain all
aspects of WinNT security.</p>

<p>-@ Take the list of input files from standard input.
Only one file- name per line.</p>

<p>-$ [MSDOS, OS/2, WIN32] Include the volume label for the
drive holding the first file to be compressed. If you want
to include only the volume label or to force a specific
drive, use the drive name as first file name, as in:</p>

<p>zip -$ foo a: c:bar</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The simplest example:</p>

<p>zip stuff *</p>

<p>creates the archive stuff.zip (assuming it does not
exist) and puts all the files in the current directory in
it, in compressed form (the .zip suffix is added
automatically, unless that archive name given contains a dot
already; this allows the explicit specification of other
suf- fixes).</p>

<p>Because of the way the shell does filename substitution,
files starting with &quot;.&quot; are not included; to
include these as well:</p>

<p>zip stuff .* *</p>

<p>Even this will not include any subdirectories from the
current direc- tory.</p>

<p>To zip up an entire directory, the command:</p>

<p>zip -r foo foo</p>

<p>creates the archive foo.zip, containing all the files
and directories in the directory foo that is contained
within the current directory.</p>

<p>You may want to make a zip archive that contains the
files in foo, without recording the directory name, foo. You
can use the -j option to leave off the paths, as in:</p>

<p>zip -j foo foo/*</p>

<p>If you are short on disk space, you might not have
enough room to hold both the original directory and the
corresponding compressed zip archive. In this case, you can
create the archive in steps using the -m option. If foo
contains the subdirectories tom, dick, and harry, you
can:</p>

<p>zip -rm foo foo/tom zip -rm foo foo/dick zip -rm foo
foo/harry</p>

<p>where the first command creates foo.zip, and the next
two add to it. At the completion of each zip command, the
last created archive is deleted, making room for the next
zip command to function.</p>

<p>PATTERN MATCHING This section applies only to UNIX,
though the ?, *, and [] special characters are implemented
on other systems including MSDOS and Win32. Watch this space
for details on MSDOS and VMS operation.</p>

<p>The UNIX shells (sh(1) and csh(1)) do filename
substitution on command arguments. The special characters
are:</p>

<p>? match any single character</p>

<p>* match any number of characters (including none)</p>

<p>[] match any character in the range indicated within the
brackets (example: [a-f], [0-9]).</p>

<p>When these characters are encountered (without being
escaped with a backslash or quotes), the shell will look for
files relative to the current path that match the pattern,
and replace the argument with a list of the names that
matched.</p>

<p>The zip program can do the same matching on names that
are in the zip archive being modified or, in the case of the
-x (exclude) or -i (include) options, on the list of files
to be operated on, by using backslashes or quotes to tell
the shell not to do the name expansion. In general, when zip
encounters a name in the list of files to do, it first looks
for the name in the file system. If it finds it, it then
adds it to the list of files to do. If it does not find it,
it looks for the name in the zip archive being modified (if
it exists), using the pattern matching characters described
above, if present. For each match, it will add that name to
the list of files to be processed, unless this name matches
one given with the -x option, or does not match any name
given with the -i option.</p>

<p>The pattern matching includes the path, and so patterns
like o match names that end in &quot;.o&quot;, no matter
what the path prefix is. Note that the backslash must
precede every special character (i.e. ?*[]), or the entire
argument must be enclosed in double quotes
(&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p>In general, use backslash to make zip do the pattern
matching with the -f (freshen) and -d (delete) options, and
sometimes after the -x (exclude) option when used with an
appropriate operation (add, -u, -f, or -d).</p>

<p>VMS interprets standard Unix (or PC) return values as
other, scarier- looking things, so zip instead maps them
into VMS-style status codes. The current mapping is as
follows: 1 (success) for normal exit, and (0x7fff000? +
16*normal_zip_exit_status) for all errors, where the ? is 0
(warning) for zip value 12, 2 (error) for the zip values 3,
6, 7, 9, 13, 16, 18, and 4 (fatal error) for the remaining
ones.</p>

<p>BUGS zip 2.31 is not compatible with PKUNZIP 1.10. Use
zip 1.1 to produce zip files which can be extracted by
PKUNZIP 1.10.</p>

<p>zip files produced by zip 2.31 must not be updated by
zip 1.1 or PKZIP 1.10, if they contain encrypted members or
if they have been produced in a pipe or on a non-seekable
device. The old versions of zip or PKZIP would create an
archive with an incorrect format. The old versions can list
the contents of the zip file but cannot extract it anyway
(because of the new compression algorithm). If you do not
use encryption and use regular disk files, you do not have
to care about this problem.</p>

<p>Under VMS, not all of the odd file formats are treated
properly. Only stream-LF format zip files are expected to
work with zip. Others can be converted using Rahul Dhesi s
BILF program. This version of zip handles some of the
conversion internally. When using Kermit to trans- fer zip
files from Vax to MSDOS, type &quot;set file type
block&quot; on the Vax. When transfering from MSDOS to Vax,
type &quot;set file type fixed&quot; on the Vax. In both
cases, type &quot;set file type binary&quot; on MSDOS.</p>

<p>Under VMS, zip hangs for file specification that uses
DECnet syntax foo::*.*.</p>

<p>On OS/2, zip cannot match some names, such as those
including an excla- mation mark or a hash sign. This is a
bug in OS/2 itself: the 32-bit DosFindFirst/Next dont find
such names. Other programs such as GNU tar are also affected
by this bug.</p>

<p>Under OS/2, the amount of Extended Attributes displayed
by DIR is (for compatibility) the amount returned by the
16-bit version of DosQuery- PathInfo(). Otherwise OS/2 1.3
and 2.0 would report different EA sizes when DIRing a file.
However, the structure layout returned by the 32-bit
DosQueryPathInfo() is a bit different, it uses extra padding
bytes and link pointers (its a linked list) to have all
fields on 4-byte boundaries for portability to future RISC
OS/2 versions. There- fore the value reported by zip (which
uses this 32-bit-mode size) dif- fers from that reported by
DIR. zip stores the 32-bit format for portability, even the
16-bit MS-C-compiled version running on OS/2 1.3, so even
this one shows the 32-bit-mode size.</p>

<p>Development of Zip 3.0 is underway. See that source
distribution for many new features and the latest bug
fixes.</p>

<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Thanks to R. P. Byrne for his
Shrink.Pas program, which inspired this project, and from
which the shrink algorithm was stolen; to Phil Katz for
placing in the public domain the zip file format,
compression for- mat, and .ZIP filename extension, and for
accepting minor changes to the file format; to Steve Burg
for clarifications on the deflate for- mat; to Haruhiko
Okumura and Leonid Broukhis for providing some useful ideas
for the compression algorithm; to Keith Petersen, Rich
Wales, Hunter Goatley and Mark Adler for providing a mailing
list and ftp site for the Info-ZIP group to use; and most
importantly, to the Info-ZIP group itself (listed in the
file infozip.who) without whose tireless testing and
bug-fixing efforts a portable zip would not have been pos-
sible. Finally we should thank (blame) the first Info-ZIP
moderator, David Kirschbaum, for getting us into this mess
in the first place. The manual page was rewritten for UNIX
by R. P. C. Rodgers.</p>
