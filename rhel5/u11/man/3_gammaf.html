<p>GAMMA(3) libc math functions GAMMA(3)</p>

<p>NAME gamma, gammaf, gammal - (logarithm of the) gamma
function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double gamma(double x); float gammaf(float x); long
double gammal(long double x);</p>

<p>Link with -lm.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For the definition of the Gamma function,
see tgamma(3).</p>

<p>*BSD version 4.4BSD and FreeBSD libm have a gamma()
function that computes the Gamma function, as one would
expect.</p>

<p>glibc version Glibc has a gamma() function that is
equivalent to lgamma() and com- putes the natural logarithm
of the Gamma function. (This is for com- patibility reasons
only. Dont use this function.)</p>

<p>HISTORY 4.2BSD had a gamma() that computed
ln(|Gamma(|x|)|), leaving the sign of Gamma(|x|) in the
external integer signgam. In 4.3BSD the name was changed to
lgamma(), and the man page promises</p>

<p>&quot;At some time in the future the name gamma will be
rehabilitated and used for the Gamma function&quot;</p>

<p>This did indeed happen in 4.4BSD, where gamma() computes
the Gamma function (with no effect on signgam). However,
this came too late, and we now have tgamma(), the &quot;true
gamma&quot; function.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.2BSD. Compatible with previous
mistakes.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO lgamma(3), signgam(3), tgamma(3)</p>
