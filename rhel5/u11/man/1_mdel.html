<p>mdel(1) mdel(1)</p>

<p>Name mdel - delete an MSDOS file mdeltree - recursively
delete an MSDOS directory and its contents</p>

<p>Note of warning This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation, and may not be
entirely accurate or complete. See the end of this man page
for details.</p>

<p>Description The mdel command is used to delete an MS-DOS
file. Its syntax is:</p>

<p>mdel [-v] msdosfile [ msdosfiles ... ]</p>

<p>Mdel deletes files on an MS-DOS filesystem.</p>

<p>Mdel asks for verification prior to removing a read-only
file.</p>

<p>See Also Mtools texinfo doc</p>

<p>Viewing the texi doc This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation. However, this
process is only approximative, and some items, such as
crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate
represen- tation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all
information has been translated into the manpage version.
Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.
See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the
texinfo doc.</p>

<p>* To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run
the fol- lowing commands:</p>

<p>./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi</p>

<p>* To generate a html copy, run:</p>

<p>./configure; make html</p>

<p>A premade html can be found at: http://mtools.linux.lu
and also at: http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/mtools</p>

<p>* To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs info
mode), run:</p>

<p>./configure; make info</p>

<p>The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as
html. Indeed, in the info version certain examples are
difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in
info.</p>
