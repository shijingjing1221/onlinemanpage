<p>NAME vbetool - run real-mode video BIOS code to alter
hardware state</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vbetool [[vbestate save|restore]|[vbemode
set|get]|[vgamode]|[dpms
on|off|standby|suspend|reduced]|[post]|[vgastate
on|off]|[vbefp pan-
elid|panelsize|getbrightness|setbrightness|invert]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vbetool uses lrmi in order to run code from
the video BIOS. Currently, it is able to alter DPMS states,
save/restore video card state and attempt to initialize the
video card from scratch.</p>

<p>OPTIONS vbetool takes the following options:</p>

<p>vbestate vbetool will use the VESA 0x4f0f extensions to
save or restore hardware state. This will be sent to or read
from stdin. This information is highly hardware specific -
do not attempt to restore state saved from a different
machine. This command will not work unless you are at a text
console, as it interferes badly with X.</p>

<p>dpms vbetool will use the VESA 0x4f10 extensions to
alter the power management state of your screen.
&quot;On&quot;, &quot;off&quot;, &quot;standby&quot;,
&quot;sus- pend&quot; and &quot;reduced&quot; are acceptable
further options and determine which state will be
activated.</p>

<p>vbemode vbetool will get or set the current VESA mode.
&quot;get&quot; will return the current mode number on
stdout - &quot;set&quot; will set the mode to the next
argument.</p>

<p>vgamode vbetool will set the legacy VGA mode to the
following numeric argument.</p>

<p>post vbetool will attempt to run BIOS code located at
c000:0003. This is the code run by the system BIOS at boot
in order to intialise the video hardware. Note that on some
machines (especially lap- tops), not all of this code is
present after system boot - as a result, executing this
command may result in undefined behaviour. This command must
be run from a text console, as it will otherwise interfere
with the operation of X.</p>

<p>vgastate vbetool will enable or disable the current
video card. On most hardware, disabling will cause the
hardware to stop responding until it is reenabled. You
probably dont want to do this if youre using a
framebuffer.</p>

<p>vbefp vbetool will execute a VESA flat panel interface
call.</p>

<p>panelid will provide information about the panel</p>

<p>panelsize will provide the size of the panel</p>

<p>getbrightness will provide the current screen brightness
as an integer</p>

<p>setbrightness accepts an integer as an argument and will
set the screen brightness to that</p>

<p>invert will invert the colours of the screen</p>

<p>BUGS Switching dpms modes may interact badly with X on
some systems.</p>

<p>The vbestate command may behave in strange ways.</p>

<p>The post command may result in the execution of
arbitrary code that happens to be lying around in the area
where chunks of your video BIOS used to be.</p>

<p>The VESA specification does not require that
&quot;vbemode get&quot; provides the correct mode if the
current mode was set via some means other than the VESA BIOS
extensions.</p>

<p>The VESA flat panel interface ceased development at the
proposal stage. panelid and panelsize will work on many
machines, but the other argu- ments are unlikely to be
implemented on available hardware.</p>
