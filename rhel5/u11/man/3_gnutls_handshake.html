<p>gnutls_handshake(3) gnutls gnutls_handshake(3)</p>

<p>NAME gnutls_handshake - This is the main function in the
handshake protocol.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>int gnutls_handshake(gnutls_session_t session);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a gnutls_session_t
structure.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function does the handshake of the
TLS/SSL protocol, and initial- izes the TLS connection.</p>

<p>This function will fail if any problem is encountered,
and will return a negative error code. In case of a client,
if the client has asked to resume a session, but the server
couldnt, then a full handshake will be performed.</p>

<p>The non-fatal errors such as GNUTLS_E_AGAIN and
GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED interrupt the handshake procedure,
which should be later be resumed. Call this function again,
until it returns 0; cf. gnutls_record_get_direction() and
gnutls_error_is_fatal().</p>

<p>If this function is called by a server after a
rehandshake request then GNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA or
GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED may be returned. Note that
these are non fatal errors, only in the specific case of a
rehandshake. Their meaning is that the client rejected the
rehandshake request.</p>
