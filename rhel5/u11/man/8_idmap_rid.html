<p>NAME idmap_rid - Sambas idmap_rid Backend for
Winbind</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The idmap_rid backend provides a way to use
an algorithmic mapping scheme to map UIDs/GIDs and SIDs. No
database is required in this case as the mapping is
deterministic.</p>

<p>IDMAP OPTIONS range = low - high Defines the available
matching uid and gid range for which the backend is
authoritative. Note that the range acts as a filter. If
algorithmically determined UID or GID fall outside the
range, they are ignored and the corresponding map is
discarded. It is intended as a way to avoid accidental
UID/GID overlaps between local and remotely defined IDs.</p>

<p>base_rid = INTEGER Defines the base integer used to
build SIDs out of an UID or a GID, and to rebase the UID or
GID to be obtained from a SID. User RIDs by default start at
1000 (512 hexadecimal), this means a good value for base_rid
can be 1000 as the resulting ID is calculated this way: ID =
RID - BASE_RID + LOW RANGE ID.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This example shows how to configure 2 domains
with idmap_rid</p>

<p>[global] idmap domains = MAIN TRUSTED1</p>

<p>idmap config MAIN:backend = rid idmap config
MAIN:base_rid = 0 idmap config MAIN:range = 10000 -
49999</p>

<p>idmap config TRUSTED1:backend = rid idmap config
TRUSTED1:base_rid = 1000 idmap config TRUSTED1:range = 50000
- 99999</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
