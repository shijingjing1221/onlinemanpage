<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) DNSMASQ(8)
DNSMASQ(8)</p>

<p>NAME dnsmasq - A lightweight DHCP and caching DNS
server.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dnsmasq [OPTION]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dnsmasq is a lightweight DNS, TFTP and DHCP
server. It is intended to provide coupled DNS and DHCP
service to a LAN.</p>

<p>Dnsmasq accepts DNS queries and either answers them from
a small, local, cache or forwards them to a real, recursive,
DNS server. It loads the contents of /etc/hosts so that
local hostnames which do not appear in the global DNS can be
resolved and also answers DNS queries for DHCP configured
hosts.</p>

<p>The dnsmasq DHCP server supports static address
assignments, multiple networks, DHCP-relay and RFC3011
subnet specifiers. It automatically sends a sensible default
set of DHCP options, and can be configured to send any
desired set of DHCP options, including vendor-encapsulated
options. It includes a secure, read-only, TFTP server to
allow net/PXE boot of DHCP hosts and also supports
BOOTP.</p>

<p>Dnsmasq supports IPv6 for DNS, but not DHCP.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Note that in general missing parameters are
allowed and switch off functions, for instance
&quot;--pid-file&quot; disables writing a PID file. On BSD,
unless the GNU getopt library is linked, the long form of
the options does not work on the command line; it is still
recognised in the configuration file.</p>

<p>-h, --no-hosts Dont read the hostnames in
/etc/hosts.</p>

<p>-H, --addn-hosts=&lt;file&gt; Additional hosts file.
Read the specified file as well as /etc/hosts. If -h is
given, read only the specified file. This option may be
repeated for more than one additional hosts file.</p>

<p>-E, --expand-hosts Add the domain to simple names
(without a period) in /etc/hosts in the same way as for
DHCP-derived names.</p>

<p>-T, --local-ttl=&lt;time&gt; When replying with
information from /etc/hosts or the DHCP leases file dnsmasq
by default sets the time-to-live field to zero, meaning that
the requestor should not itself cache the information. This
is the correct thing to do in almost all situ- ations. This
option allows a time-to-live (in seconds) to be given for
these replies. This will reduce the load on the server at
the expense of clients using stale data under some circum-
stances.</p>

<p>--neg-ttl=&lt;time&gt; Negative replies from upstream
servers normally contain time-to- live information in SOA
records which dnsmasq uses for caching. If the replies from
upstream servers omit this information, dns- masq does not
cache the reply. This option gives a default value for
time-to-live (in seconds) which dnsmasq uses to cache nega-
tive replies even in the absence of an SOA record.</p>

<p>-k, --keep-in-foreground Do not go into the background
at startup but otherwise run as normal. This is intended for
use when dnsmasq is run under dae- montools or launchd.</p>

<p>-d, --no-daemon Debug mode: dont fork to the background,
dont write a pid file, dont change user id, generate a
complete cache dump on receipt on SIGUSR1, log to stderr as
well as syslog, dont fork new processes to handle TCP
queries.</p>

<p>-q, --log-queries Log the results of DNS queries handled
by dnsmasq. Enable a full cache dump on receipt of
SIGUSR1.</p>

<p>-8, --log-facility=&lt;facility&gt; Set the facility to
which dnsmasq will send syslog entries, this defaults to
DAEMON, and to LOCAL0 when debug mode is in opera- tion. If
the facility given contains at least one / character, it is
taken to be a filename, and dnsmasq logs to the given file,
instead of syslog. (Errors whilst reading configuration will
still go to syslog, but all output from a successful
startup, and all output whilst running, will go exclusively
to the file.) When logging to a file, dnsmasq will close and
reopen the file when it receives SIGUSR2. This allows the
log file to be rotated without stopping dnsmasq.</p>

<p>--log-async[=&lt;lines&gt;] Enable asynchronous logging
and optionally set the limit on the number of lines which
will be queued by dnsmasq when writing to the syslog is
slow. Dnsmasq can log asynchronously: this allows it to
continue functioning without being blocked by syslog, and
allows syslog to use dnsmasq for DNS queries without risking
deadlock. If the queue of log-lines becomes full, dnsmasq
will log the overflow, and the number of messages lost. The
default queue length is 5, a sane value would be 5-25, and a
maximum limit of 100 is imposed.</p>

<p>-x, --pid-file=&lt;path&gt; Specify an alternate path
for dnsmasq to record its process-id in. Normally
/var/run/dnsmasq.pid.</p>

<p>-u, --user=&lt;username&gt; Specify the userid to which
dnsmasq will change after startup. Dnsmasq must normally be
started as root, but it will drop root privileges after
startup by changing id to another user. Nor- mally this user
is &quot;nobody&quot; but that can be over-ridden with this
switch.</p>

<p>-g, --group=&lt;groupname&gt; Specify the group which
dnsmasq will run as. The defaults to &quot;dip&quot;, if
available, to facilitate access to /etc/ppp/resolv.conf
which is not normally world readable.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print the version number.</p>

<p>-p, --port=&lt;port&gt; Listen on &lt;port&gt; instead
of the standard DNS port (53). Setting this to zero
completely disables DNS function, leaving only DHCP and/or
TFTP.</p>

<p>-P, --edns-packet-max=&lt;size&gt; Specify the largest
EDNS.0 UDP packet which is supported by the DNS forwarder.
Defaults to 1280, which is the RFC2671-recom- mended maximum
for ethernet.</p>

<p>-Q, --query-port=&lt;query_port&gt; Send outbound DNS
queries from, and listen for their replies on, the specific
UDP port &lt;query_port&gt; instead of using random ports.
NOTE that using this option will make dnsmasq less secure
against DNS spoofing attacks but it may be faster and use
less resources. Setting this option to zero makes dnsmasq
use a sin- gle port allocated to it by the OS: this was the
default behaviour in versions prior to 2.43.</p>

<p>--min-port=&lt;port&gt; Do not use ports less than that
given as source for outbound DNS queries. Dnsmasq picks
random ports as source for outbound queries: when this
option is given, the ports used will always to larger than
that specified. Useful for systems behind fire- walls.</p>

<p>-i, --interface=&lt;interface name&gt; Listen only on
the specified interface(s). Dnsmasq automatically adds the
loopback (local) interface to the list of interfaces to use
when the --interface option is used. If no --interface or
--listen-address options are given dnsmasq listens on all
avail- able interfaces except any given in
--except-interface options. IP alias interfaces (eg
&quot;eth1:0&quot;) cannot be used with --inter- face or
--except-interface options, use --listen-address
instead.</p>

<p>-I, --except-interface=&lt;interface name&gt; Do not
listen on the specified interface. Note that the order of
--listen-address --interface and --except-interface options
does not matter and that --except-interface options always
override the others.</p>

<p>-2, --no-dhcp-interface=&lt;interface name&gt; Do not
provide DHCP or TFTP on the specified interface, but do
provide DNS service.</p>

<p>-a, --listen-address=&lt;ipaddr&gt; Listen on the given
IP address(es). Both --interface and --lis- ten-address
options may be given, in which case the set of both
interfaces and addresses is used. Note that if no
--interface option is given, but --listen-address is,
dnsmasq will not auto- matically listen on the loopback
interface. To achieve this, its IP address, 127.0.0.1, must
be explicitly given as a --listen- address option.</p>

<p>-z, --bind-interfaces On systems which support it,
dnsmasq binds the wildcard address, even when it is
listening on only some interfaces. It then dis- cards
requests that it shouldnt reply to. This has the advan- tage
of working even when interfaces come and go and change
address. This option forces dnsmasq to really bind only the
interfaces it is listening on. About the only time when this
is useful is when running another nameserver (or another
instance of dnsmasq) on the same machine. Setting this
option also enables multiple instances of dnsmasq which
provide DHCP service to run in the same machine.</p>

<p>-y, --localise-queries Return answers to DNS queries
from /etc/hosts which depend on the interface over which the
query was received. If a name in /etc/hosts has more than
one address associated with it, and at least one of those
addresses is on the same subnet as the inter- face to which
the query was sent, then return only the address(es) on that
subnet. This allows for a server to have multiple addresses
in /etc/hosts corresponding to each of its interfaces, and
hosts will get the correct address based on which network
they are attached to. Currently this facility is limited to
IPv4.</p>

<p>-b, --bogus-priv Bogus private reverse lookups. All
reverse lookups for private IP ranges (ie 192.168.x.x, etc)
which are not found in /etc/hosts or the DHCP leases file
are answered with &quot;no such domain&quot; rather than
being forwarded upstream.</p>

<p>-V, --alias=&lt;old-ip&gt;,&lt;new-ip&gt;[,&lt;mask&gt;]
Modify IPv4 addresses returned from upstream nameservers;
old-ip is replaced by new-ip. If the optional mask is given
then any address which matches the masked old-ip will be
re-written. So, for instance
--alias=1.2.3.0,6.7.8.0,255.255.255.0 will map 1.2.3.56 to
6.7.8.56 and 1.2.3.67 to 6.7.8.67. This is what Cisco PIX
routers call &quot;DNS doctoring&quot;.</p>

<p>-B, --bogus-nxdomain=&lt;ipaddr&gt; Transform replies
which contain the IP address given into &quot;No such
domain&quot; replies. This is intended to counteract a
devious move made by Verisign in September 2003 when they
started returning the address of an advertising web page in
response to queries for unregistered names, instead of the
correct NXDOMAIN response. This option tells dnsmasq to fake
the correct response when it sees this behaviour. As at Sept
2003 the IP address being returned by Verisign is
64.94.110.11</p>

<p>-f, --filterwin2k Later versions of windows make
periodic DNS requests which dont get sensible answers from
the public DNS and can cause problems by triggering
dial-on-demand links. This flag turns on an option to filter
such requests. The requests blocked are for records of types
SOA and SRV, and type ANY where the requested name has
underscores, to catch LDAP requests.</p>

<p>-r, --resolv-file=&lt;file&gt; Read the IP addresses of
the upstream nameservers from &lt;file&gt;, instead of
/etc/resolv.conf. For the format of this file see
resolv.conf(5) the only lines relevant to dnsmasq are
nameserver ones. Dnsmasq can be told to poll more than one
resolv.conf file, the first file name specified overrides
the default, sub- sequent ones add to the list. This is only
allowed when polling; the file with the currently latest
modification time is the one used.</p>

<p>-R, --no-resolv Dont read /etc/resolv.conf. Get upstream
servers only from the command line or the dnsmasq
configuration file.</p>

<p>-1, --enable-dbus Allow dnsmasq configuration to be
updated via DBus method calls. The configuration which can
be changed is upstream DNS servers (and corresponding
domains) and cache clear. Requires that dns- masq has been
built with DBus support.</p>

<p>-o, --strict-order By default, dnsmasq will send queries
to any of the upstream servers it knows about and tries to
favour servers that are known to be up. Setting this flag
forces dnsmasq to try each query with each server strictly
in the order they appear in /etc/resolv.conf</p>

<p>--all-servers By default, when dnsmasq has more than one
upstream server available, it will send queries to just one
server. Setting this flag forces dnsmasq to send all queries
to all available servers. The reply from the server which
answers first will be returned to the original
requestor.</p>

<p>--stop-dns-rebind Reject (and log) addresses from
upstream nameservers which are in the private IP ranges.
This blocks an attack where a browser behind a firewall is
used to probe machines on the local net- work.</p>

<p>-n, --no-poll Dont poll /etc/resolv.conf for
changes.</p>

<p>--clear-on-reload Whenever /etc/resolv.conf is re-read,
clear the DNS cache. This is useful when new nameservers may
have different data than that held in cache.</p>

<p>-D, --domain-needed Tells dnsmasq to never forward
queries for plain names, without dots or domain parts, to
upstream nameservers. If the name is not known from
/etc/hosts or DHCP then a &quot;not found&quot; answer is
returned.</p>

<p>-S, --local,
--server=[/[&lt;domain&gt;]/[domain/]][&lt;ipaddr&gt;[#&lt;port&gt;][@&lt;source-ip&gt;|&lt;inter-
face&gt;[#&lt;port&gt;]] Specify IP address of upstream
servers directly. Setting this flag does not suppress
reading of /etc/resolv.conf, use -R to do that. If one or
more optional domains are given, that server is used only
for those domains and they are queried only using the
specified server. This is intended for private nameservers:
if you have a nameserver on your network which deals with
names of the form xxx.internal.thekelleys.org.uk at
192.168.1.1 then giv- ing the flag -S
/internal.thekelleys.org.uk/192.168.1.1 will send all
queries for internal machines to that nameserver, everything
else will go to the servers in /etc/resolv.conf. An empty
domain specification, // has the special meaning of
&quot;unqualified names only&quot; ie names without any dots
in them. A non-standard port may be specified as part of the
IP address using a # character. More than one -S flag is
allowed, with repeated domain or ipaddr parts as
required.</p>

<p>Also permitted is a -S flag which gives a domain but no
IP address; this tells dnsmasq that a domain is local and it
may answer queries from /etc/hosts or DHCP but should never
forward queries on that domain to any upstream servers.
local is a syn- onym for server to make configuration files
clearer in this case.</p>

<p>The optional string after the @ character tells dnsmasq
how to set the source of the queries to this nameserver. It
should be an ip-address, which should belong to the machine
on which dns- masq is running otherwise this server line
will be logged and then ignored, or an interface name. If an
interface name is given, then queries to the server will be
forced via that inter- face; if an ip-address is given then
the source address of the queries will be set to that
address. The query-port flag is ignored for any servers
which have a source address specified but the port may be
specified directly as part of the source address. Forcing
queries to an interface is not implemented on all platforms
supported by dnsmasq.</p>

<p>-A, --address=/&lt;domain&gt;/[domain/]&lt;ipaddr&gt;
Specify an IP address to return for any host in the given
domains. Queries in the domains are never forwarded and
always replied to with the specified IP address which may be
IPv4 or IPv6. To give both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for a
domain, use repeated -A flags. Note that /etc/hosts and DHCP
leases over- ride this for individual names. A common use of
this is to redi- rect the entire doubleclick.net domain to
some friendly local web server to avoid banner ads. The
domain specification works in the same was as for --server,
with the additional facility that /#/ matches any domain.
Thus --address=/#/1.2.3.4 will always return 1.2.3.4 for any
query not answered from /etc/hosts or DHCP and not sent to
an upstream nameserver by a more spe- cific --server
directive.</p>

<p>-m, --mx-host=&lt;mx
name&gt;[[,&lt;hostname&gt;],&lt;preference&gt;] Return an
MX record named &lt;mx name&gt; pointing to the given host-
name (if given), or the host specified in the --mx-target
switch or, if that switch is not given, the host on which
dnsmasq is running. The default is useful for directing mail
from systems on a LAN to a central server. The preference
value is optional, and defaults to 1 if not given. More than
one MX record may be given for a host.</p>

<p>-t, --mx-target=&lt;hostname&gt; Specify the default
target for the MX record returned by dns- masq. See
--mx-host. If --mx-target is given, but not --mx- host, then
dnsmasq returns a MX record containing the MX target for MX
queries on the hostname of the machine on which dnsmasq is
running.</p>

<p>-e, --selfmx Return an MX record pointing to itself for
each local machine. Local machines are those in /etc/hosts
or with DHCP leases.</p>

<p>-L, --localmx Return an MX record pointing to the host
given by mx-target (or the machine on which dnsmasq is
running) for each local machine. Local machines are those in
/etc/hosts or with DHCP leases.</p>

<p>-W,
--srv-host=&lt;_service&gt;.&lt;_prot&gt;.[&lt;domain&gt;],[&lt;target&gt;[,&lt;port&gt;[,&lt;prior-
ity&gt;[,&lt;weight&gt;]]]] Return a SRV DNS record. See
RFC2782 for details. If not sup- plied, the domain defaults
to that given by --domain. The default for the target domain
is empty, and the default for port is one and the defaults
for weight and priority are zero. Be careful if transposing
data from BIND zone files: the port, weight and priority
numbers are in a different order. More than one SRV record
for a given service/domain is allowed, all that match are
returned.</p>

<p>-Y,
--txt-record=&lt;name&gt;[[,&lt;text&gt;],&lt;text&gt;]
Return a TXT DNS record. The value of TXT record is a set of
strings, so any number may be included, split by commas.</p>

<p>--ptr-record=&lt;name&gt;[,&lt;target&gt;] Return a PTR
DNS record.</p>


<p>--naptr-record=&lt;name&gt;,&lt;order&gt;,&lt;preference&gt;,&lt;flags&gt;,&lt;service&gt;,&lt;reg-
exp&gt;[,&lt;replacement&gt;] Return an NAPTR DNS record, as
specified in RFC3403.</p>

<p>--interface-name=&lt;name&gt;,&lt;interface&gt; Return a
DNS record associating the name with the primary address on
the given interface. This flag specifies an A record for the
given name in the same way as an /etc/hosts line, except
that the address is not constant, but taken from the given
interface. If the interface is down, not configured or
non-exis- tent, an empty record is returned. The matching
PTR record is also created, mapping the interface address to
the name. More than one name may be associated with an
interface address by repeating the flag; in that case the
first instance is used for the reverse address-to-name
mapping.</p>

<p>-c, --cache-size=&lt;cachesize&gt; Set the size of
dnsmasqs cache. The default is 150 names. Set- ting the
cache size to zero disables caching.</p>

<p>-N, --no-negcache Disable negative caching. Negative
caching allows dnsmasq to remember &quot;no such
domain&quot; answers from upstream nameservers and answer
identical queries without forwarding them again.</p>

<p>-0, --dns-forward-max=&lt;queries&gt; Set the maximum
number of concurrent DNS queries. The default value is 150,
which should be fine for most setups. The only known
situation where this needs to be increased is when using
web-server log file resolvers, which can generate large
numbers of concurrent queries.</p>

<p>-F,
--dhcp-range=[[net:]network-id,]&lt;start-addr&gt;,&lt;end-addr&gt;[[,&lt;net-
mask&gt;],&lt;broadcast&gt;][,&lt;default lease time&gt;]
Enable the DHCP server. Addresses will be given out from the
range &lt;start-addr&gt; to &lt;end-addr&gt; and from
statically defined addresses given in dhcp-host options. If
the lease time is given, then leases will be given for that
length of time. The lease time is in seconds, or minutes (eg
45m) or hours (eg 1h) or the literal &quot;infinite&quot;.
The minimum lease time is two min- utes. This option may be
repeated, with different addresses, to enable DHCP service
to more than one network. For directly con- nected networks
(ie, networks on which the machine running dns- masq has an
interface) the netmask is optional. It is, however, required
for networks which receive DHCP service via a relay agent.
The broadcast address is always optional. On some broken
systems, dnsmasq can listen on only one interface when using
DHCP, and the name of that interface must be given using the
interface option. This limitation currently affects OpenBSD
before version 4.0. It is always allowed to have more than
one dhcp-range in a single subnet. The optional network-id
is a alphanumeric label which marks this network so that
dhcp options may be specified on a per-network basis. When
it is prefixed with net: then its meaning changes from
setting a tag to matching it. Only one tag may be set, but
more than one tag may be matched. The end address may be
replaced by the keyword static which tells dnsmasq to enable
DHCP for the network speci- fied, but not to dynamically
allocate IP addresses. Only hosts which have static
addresses given via dhcp-host or from /etc/ethers will be
served.</p>

<p>-G, --dhcp-
host=[&lt;hwaddr&gt;][,id:&lt;client_id&gt;|*][,net:&lt;netid&gt;][,&lt;ipaddr&gt;][,&lt;host-
name&gt;][,&lt;lease_time&gt;][,ignore] Specify per host
parameters for the DHCP server. This allows a machine with a
particular hardware address to be always allo- cated the
same hostname, IP address and lease time. A hostname
specified like this overrides any supplied by the DHCP
client on the machine. It is also allowable to ommit the
hardware address and include the hostname, in which case the
IP address and lease times will apply to any machine
claiming that name. For example
--dhcp-host=00:20:e0:3b:13:af,wap,infinite tells dnsmasq to
give the machine with hardware address 00:20:e0:3b:13:af the
name wap, and an infinite DHCP lease.
--dhcp-host=lap,192.168.0.199 tells dnsmasq to always
allocate the machine lap the IP address 192.168.0.199.
Addresses allocated like this are not constrained to be in
the range given by the --dhcp-range option, but they must be
on the network being served by the DHCP server. It is
allowed to use client identifiers rather than hardware
addresses to identify hosts by prefixing with id: . Thus:
--dhcp- host=id:01:02:03:04,..... refers to the host with
client iden- tifier 01:02:03:04. It is also allowed to
specify the client ID as text, like this:
--dhcp-host=id:clientidastext,..... The special option id:*
means &quot;ignore any client-id and use MAC addresses
only.&quot; This is useful when a client presents a client-
id sometimes but not others. If a name appears in
/etc/hosts, the associated address can be allocated to a
DHCP lease, but only if a --dhcp-host option specifying the
name also exists. The special keyword &quot;ignore&quot;
tells dnsmasq to never offer a DHCP lease to a machine. The
machine can be specified by hardware address, client ID or
hostname, for instance --dhcp- host=00:20:e0:3b:13:af,ignore
This is useful when there is another DHCP server on the
network which should be used by some machines. The
net:&lt;network-id&gt; sets the network-id tag whenever this
dhcp-host directive is in use.This can be used to selec-
tively send DHCP options just for this host. When a host
matches any dhcp-host directive (or one implied by
/etc/ethers) then the special network-id tag
&quot;known&quot; is set. This allows dnsmasq to be
configured to ignore requests from unknown machines using
--dhcp-ignore=#known Ethernet addresses (but not client-ids)
may have wildcard bytes, so for example --dhcp-
host=00:20:e0:3b:13:*,ignore will cause dnsmasq to ignore a
range of hardware addresses. Note that the &quot;*&quot;
will need to be escaped or quoted on a command line, but not
in the configura- tion file. Hardware addresses normally
match any network (ARP) type, but it is possible to restrict
them to a single ARP type by preceding them with the
ARP-type (in HEX) and &quot;-&quot;. so --dhcp-
host=06-00:20:e0:3b:13:af,1.2.3.4 will only match a
Token-Ring hardware address, since the ARP-address type for
token ring is 6.</p>

<p>--dhcp-hostsfile=&lt;file&gt; Read DHCP host information
from the specified file. The file contains information about
one host per line. The format of a line is the same as text
to the right of = in --dhcp-host. The advantage of storing
DHCP host information in this file is that it can be changed
without re-starting dnsmasq: the file will be re-read when
dnsmasq receives SIGHUP.</p>

<p>--dhcp-optsfile=&lt;file&gt; Read DHCP option
information from the specified file. The advan- tage of
using this option is the same as for --dhcp-hostsfile: the
dhcp-optsfile will be re-read when dnsmasq receives
SIGHUP.</p>

<p>-Z, --read-ethers Read /etc/ethers for information about
hosts for the DHCP server. The format of /etc/ethers is a
hardware address, fol- lowed by either a hostname or
dotted-quad IP address. When read by dnsmasq these lines
have exactly the same effect as --dhcp- host options
containing the same information. /etc/ethers is re- read
when dnsmasq receives SIGHUP.</p>

<p>-O,
--dhcp-option=[&lt;network-id&gt;,[&lt;network-id&gt;,]][vendor:[&lt;vendor-
class&gt;],][&lt;opt&gt;|option:&lt;opt-name&gt;],[&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;value&gt;]]
Specify different or extra options to DHCP clients. By
default, dnsmasq sends some standard options to DHCP
clients, the netmask and broadcast address are set to the
same as the host running dnsmasq, and the DNS server and
default route are set to the address of the machine running
dnsmasq. If the domain name option has been set, that is
sent. This configuration allows these defaults to be
overridden, or other options specified. The option, to be
sent may be given as a decimal number or as
&quot;option:&lt;option-name&gt;&quot; The option numbers
are specified in RFC2132 and subsequent RFCs. The set of
option-names known by dnsmasq can be discovered by running
&quot;dnsmasq --help dhcp&quot;. For example, to set the
default route option to 192.168.4.4, do
--dhcp-option=3,192.168.4.4 or --dhcp-option =
option:router, 192.168.4.4 and to set the time-server
address to 192.168.0.4, do --dhcp-option = 42,192.168.0.4 or
--dhcp-option = option:ntp- server, 192.168.0.4 The special
address 0.0.0.0 is taken to mean &quot;the address of the
machine running dnsmasq&quot;. Data types allowed are comma
separated dotted-quad IP addresses, a decimal number,
colon-separated hex digits and a text string. If the
optional network-ids are given then this option is only sent
when all the network-ids are matched.</p>

<p>Special processing is done on a text argument for option
119, to conform with RFC 3397. Text or dotted-quad IP
addresses as argu- ments to option 120 are handled as per
RFC 3361. Dotted-quad IP addresses which are followed by a
slash and then a netmask size are encoded as described in
RFC 3442.</p>

<p>Be careful: no checking is done that the correct type of
data for the option number is sent, it is quite possible to
persuade dnsmasq to generate illegal DHCP packets with
injudicious use of this flag. When the value is a decimal
number, dnsmasq must determine how large the data item is.
It does this by examining the option number and/or the
value, but can be overridden by appending a single letter
flag as follows: b = one byte, s = two bytes, i = four
bytes. This is mainly useful with encapsulated vendor class
options (see below) where dnsmasq cannot determine data size
from the option number. Option data which consists solely of
periods and digits will be interpreted by dnsmasq as an IP
address, and inserted into an option as such. To force a
literal string, use quotes. For instance when using option
66 to send a literal IP address as TFTP server name, it is
necessary to do --dhcp-option=66,&quot;1.2.3.4&quot;</p>

<p>Encapsulated Vendor-class options may also be specified
using --dhcp-option: for instance --dhcp-option=vendor:PXE-
Client,1,0.0.0.0 sends the encapsulated vendor
class-specific option &quot;mftp-address=0.0.0.0&quot; to
any client whose vendor-class matches &quot;PXEClient&quot;.
The vendor-class matching is substring based (see
--dhcp-vendorclass for details). If a vendor-class option
(number 60) is sent by dnsmasq, then that is used for
selecting encapsulated options in preference to any sent by
the client. It is possible to omit the vendorclass
completely; --dhcp-option=vendor:,1,0.0.0.0 in which case
the encapsulated option is always sent. The address 0.0.0.0
is not treated spe- cially in encapsulated vendor class
options.</p>


<p>--dhcp-option-force=[&lt;network-id&gt;,[&lt;network-id&gt;,]][vendor:[&lt;vendor-
class&gt;],]&lt;opt&gt;,[&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;value&gt;]] This
works in exactly the same way as --dhcp-option except that
the option will always be sent, even if the client does not
ask for it in the parameter request list. This is sometimes
needed, for example when sending options to PXELinux.</p>

<p>--dhcp-no-override Disable re-use of the DHCP servername
and filename fields as extra option space. If it can,
dnsmasq moves the boot server and filename information (from
dhcp-boot) out of their dedicated fields into DHCP options.
This make extra space available in the DHCP packet for
options but can, rarely, confuse old or broken clients. This
flag forces &quot;simple and safe&quot; behaviour to avoid
problems in such a case.</p>

<p>-U,
--dhcp-vendorclass=&lt;network-id&gt;,&lt;vendor-class&gt;
Map from a vendor-class string to a network id tag. Most
DHCP clients provide a &quot;vendor class&quot; which
represents, in some sense, the type of host. This option
maps vendor classes to tags, so that DHCP options may be
selectively delivered to dif- ferent classes of hosts. For
example dhcp-vendorclass=print- ers,Hewlett-Packard
JetDirect will allow options to be set only for HP printers
like so: --dhcp-option=printers,3,192.168.4.4 The
vendor-class string is substring matched against the vendor-
class supplied by the client, to allow fuzzy matching.</p>

<p>-j,
--dhcp-userclass=&lt;network-id&gt;,&lt;user-class&gt; Map
from a user-class string to a network id tag (with substring
matching, like vendor classes). Most DHCP clients provide a
&quot;user class&quot; which is configurable. This option
maps user classes to tags, so that DHCP options may be
selectively deliv- ered to different classes of hosts. It is
possible, for instance to use this to set a different
printer server for hosts in the class &quot;accounts&quot;
than for hosts in the class &quot;engineering&quot;.</p>

<p>-4, --dhcp-mac=&lt;network-id&gt;,&lt;MAC address&gt;
Map from a MAC address to a network-id tag. The MAC address
may include wildcards. For example
--dhcp-mac=3com,01:34:23:*:*:* will set the tag
&quot;3com&quot; for any host whose MAC address matches the
pattern.</p>

<p>--dhcp-circuitid=&lt;network-id&gt;,&lt;circuit-id&gt;,
--dhcp-remoteid=&lt;network- id&gt;,&lt;remote-id&gt; Map
from RFC3046 relay agent options to network-id tags. This
data may be provided by DHCP relay agents. The circuit-id or
remote-id is normally given as colon-separated hex, but is
also allowed to be a simple string. If an exact match is
achieved between the circuit or agent ID and one provided by
a relay agent, the network-id tag is set.</p>


<p>--dhcp-subscrid=&lt;network-id&gt;,&lt;subscriber-id&gt;
Map from RFC3993 subscriber-id relay agent options to
network-id tags.</p>

<p>--dhcp-match=&lt;network-id&gt;,&lt;option number&gt;
Set the network-id tag if the client sends a DHCP option of
the given number. This can be used to identify particular
clients which send information using private option
numbers.</p>

<p>-J,
--dhcp-ignore=&lt;network-id&gt;[,&lt;network-id&gt;] When
all the given network-ids match the set of network-ids
derived from the net, host, vendor and user classes, ignore
the host and do not allocate it a DHCP lease.</p>


<p>--dhcp-ignore-names[=&lt;network-id&gt;[,&lt;network-id&gt;]]
When all the given network-ids match the set of network-ids
derived from the net, host, vendor and user classes, ignore
any hostname provided by the host. Note that, unlike
dhcp-ignore, it is permissible to supply no netid tags, in
which case DHCP- client supplied hostnames are always
ignored, and DHCP hosts are added to the DNS using only
dhcp-host configuration in dnsmasq and the contents of
/etc/hosts and /etc/ethers.</p>


<p>--dhcp-broadcast=&lt;network-id&gt;[,&lt;network-id&gt;]
When all the given network-ids match the set of network-ids
derived from the net, host, vendor and user classes, always
use broadcast to communicate with the host when it is
unconfigured. Most DHCP clients which need broadcast replies
set a flag in their requests so that this happens
automatically, some old BOOTP clients do not.</p>

<p>-M,
--dhcp-boot=[net:&lt;network-id&gt;,]&lt;filename&gt;,[&lt;servername&gt;[,&lt;server
address&gt;]] Set BOOTP options to be returned by the DHCP
server. Server name and address are optional: if not
provided, the name is left empty, and the address set to the
address of the machine running dnsmasq. If dnsmasq is
providing a TFTP service (see --enable- tftp ) then only the
filename is required here to enable network booting. If the
optional network-id(s) are given, they must match for this
configuration to be sent. Note that network-ids are prefixed
by &quot;net:&quot; to distinguish them.</p>

<p>-X, --dhcp-lease-max=&lt;number&gt; Limits dnsmasq to
the specified maximum number of DHCP leases. The default is
150. This limit is to prevent DoS attacks from hosts which
create thousands of leases and use lots of memory in the
dnsmasq process.</p>

<p>-K, --dhcp-authoritative Should be set when dnsmasq is
definitely the only DHCP server on a network. It changes the
behaviour from strict RFC compliance so that DHCP requests
on unknown leases from unknown hosts are not ignored. This
allows new hosts to get a lease without a tedious timeout
under all circumstances. It also allows dnsmasq to rebuild
its lease database without each client needing to reacquire
a lease, if the database is lost.</p>

<p>--dhcp-alternate-port[=&lt;server port&gt;[,&lt;client
port&gt;]] Change the ports used for DHCP from the default.
If this option is given alone, without arguments, it changes
the ports used for DHCP from 67 and 68 to 1067 and 1068. If
a single argument is given, that port number is used for the
server and the port num- ber plus one used for the client.
Finally, two port numbers allows arbitrary specification of
both server and client ports for DHCP.</p>

<p>-3, --bootp-dynamic Enable dynamic allocation of IP
addresses to BOOTP clients. Use this with care, since each
address allocated to a BOOTP client is leased forever, and
therefore becomes permanently unavailable for re-use by
other hosts.</p>

<p>-5, --no-ping By default, the DHCP server will attempt
to ensure that an address in not in use before allocating it
to a host. It does this by sending an ICMP echo request (aka
&quot;ping&quot;) to the address in question. If it gets a
reply, then the address must already be in use, and another
is tried. This flag disables this check. Use with
caution.</p>

<p>--log-dhcp Extra logging for DHCP: log all the options
sent to DHCP clients and the netid tags used to determine
them.</p>

<p>-l, --dhcp-leasefile=&lt;path&gt; Use the specified file
to store DHCP lease information. If this option is given but
no dhcp-range option is given then dnsmasq version 1
behaviour is activated. The file given is assumed to be an
ISC dhcpd lease file and parsed for leases which are then
added to the DNS system if they have a hostname. This
function- ality may have been excluded from dnsmasq at
compile time, in which case an error will occur. In any case
note that ISC lease- file integration is a deprecated
feature. It should not be used in new installations, and
will be removed in a future release.</p>

<p>-6 --dhcp-script=&lt;path&gt; Whenever a new DHCP lease
is created, or an old one destroyed, the binary specified by
this option is run. The arguments to the process are
&quot;add&quot;, &quot;old&quot; or &quot;del&quot;, the MAC
address of the host (or &quot;&lt;null&gt;&quot;), the IP
address, and the hostname, if known. &quot;add&quot; means a
lease has been created, &quot;del&quot; means it has been
destroyed, &quot;old&quot; is a notification of an existing
lease when dnsmasq starts or a change to MAC address or
hostname of an existing lease (also, lease length or expiry
and client-id, if leasefile-ro is set). The process is run
as root (assuming that dnsmasq was originally run as root)
even if dnsmasq is config- ured to change UID to an
unprivileged user. The environment is inherited from the
invoker of dnsmasq, and if the host provided a client-id,
this is stored in the environment variable DNS-
MASQ_CLIENT_ID. If the client provides vendor-class or user-
class information, these are provided in
DNSMASQ_VENDOR_CLASS and
DNSMASQ_USER_CLASS0..DNSMASQ_USER_CLASSn variables, but only
for &quot;add&quot; actions or &quot;old&quot; actions when
a host resumes an exist- ing lease, since these data are not
held in dnsmasqs lease database. If dnsmasq was compiled
with HAVE_BROKEN_RTC, then the length of the lease (in
seconds) is stored in DNS- MASQ_LEASE_LENGTH, otherwise the
time of lease expiry is stored in DNSMASQ_LEASE_EXPIRES. The
number of seconds until lease expiry is always stored in
DNSMASQ_TIME_REMAINING. If a lease used to have a hostname,
which is removed, an &quot;old&quot; event is generated with
the new state of the lease, ie no name, and the former name
is provided in the environment variable DNS-
MASQ_OLD_HOSTNAME. DNSMASQ_INTERFACE stores the name of the
interface on which the request arrived; this is not set for
&quot;old&quot; actions when dnsmasq restarts. All file
descriptors are closed except stdin, stdout and stderr which
are open to /dev/null (except in debug mode). The script is
not invoked concurrently: if subsequent lease changes occur,
the script is not invoked again until any existing
invocation exits. At dns- masq startup, the script will be
invoked for all existing leases as they are read from the
lease file. Expired leases will be called with
&quot;del&quot; and others with &quot;old&quot;.
&lt;path&gt; must be an abso- lute pathname, no PATH search
occurs. When dnsmasq receives a HUP signal, the script will
be invoked for existing leases with an &quot;old &quot;
event.</p>

<p>--dhcp-scriptuser Specify the user as which to run the
lease-change script. This defaults to root, but can be
changed to another user using this flag.</p>

<p>-9, --leasefile-ro Completely suppress use of the lease
database file. The file will not be created, read, or
written. Change the way the lease- change script (if one is
provided) is called, so that the lease database may be
maintained in external storage by the script. In addition to
the invocations given in --dhcp-script the lease- change
script is called once, at dnsmasq startup, with the sin- gle
argument &quot;init&quot;. When called like this the script
should write the saved state of the lease database, in
dnsmasq lease- file format, to stdout and exit with zero
exit code. Setting this option also forces the leasechange
script to be called on changes to the client-id and lease
length and expiry time.</p>


<p>--bridge-interface=&lt;interface&gt;,&lt;alias&gt;[,&lt;alias&gt;]
Treat DHCP request packets arriving at any of the
&lt;alias&gt; inter- faces as if they had arrived at
&lt;interface&gt;. This option is only available on BSD
platforms, and is necessary when using &quot;old style&quot;
bridging, since packets arrive at tap interfaces which dont
have an IP address.</p>

<p>-s, --domain=&lt;domain&gt; Specifies the domain for the
DHCP server. This has two effects; firstly it causes the
DHCP server to return the domain to any hosts which request
it, and secondly it sets the domain which it is legal for
DHCP-configured hosts to claim. The intention is to
constrain hostnames so that an untrusted host on the LAN
cannot advertise its name via dhcp as e.g.
&quot;microsoft.com&quot; and capture traffic not meant for
it. If no domain suffix is specified, then any DHCP hostname
with a domain part (ie with a period) will be disallowed and
logged. If suffix is specified, then hostnames with a domain
part are allowed, provided the domain part matches the
suffix. In addition, when a suffix is set then hostnames
without a domain part have the suffix added as an optional
domain part. Eg on my network I can set --domain=thekel-
leys.org.uk and have a machine whose DHCP hostname is
&quot;laptop&quot;. The IP address for that machine is
available from dnsmasq both as &quot;laptop&quot; and
&quot;laptop.thekelleys.org.uk&quot;. If the domain is given
as &quot;#&quot; then the domain is read from the first
&quot;search&quot; directive in /etc/resolv.conf (or
equivalent).</p>

<p>--enable-tftp Enable the TFTP server function. This is
deliberately limited to that needed to net-boot a client.
Only reading is allowed; the tsize and blksize extensions
are supported (tsize is only sup- ported in octet mode).</p>

<p>--tftp-root=&lt;directory&gt; Look for files to transfer
using TFTP relative to the given directory. When this is
set, TFTP paths which include &quot;..&quot; are rejected,
to stop clients getting outside the specified root. Absolute
paths (starting with /) are allowed, but they must be within
the tftp-root.</p>

<p>--tftp-unique-root Add the IP address of the TFTP client
as a path component on the end of the TFTP-root (in standard
dotted-quad format). Only valid if a tftp-root is set and
the directory exists. For instance, if tftp-root is
&quot;/tftp&quot; and client 1.2.3.4 requests file
&quot;myfile&quot; then the effective path will be
&quot;/tftp/1.2.3.4/myfile&quot; if /tftp/1.2.3.4 exists or
/tftp/myfile otherwise.</p>

<p>--tftp-secure Enable TFTP secure mode: without this, any
file which is read- able by the dnsmasq process under normal
unix access-control rules is available via TFTP. When the
--tftp-secure flag is given, only files owned by the user
running the dnsmasq process are accessible. If dnsmasq is
being run as root, different rules apply: --tftp-secure has
no effect, but only files which have the world-readable bit
set are accessible. It is not recommended to run dnsmasq as
root with TFTP enabled, and certainly not without specifying
--tftp-root. Doing so can expose any world- readable file on
the server to any host on the net.</p>

<p>--tftp-max=&lt;connections&gt; Set the maximum number of
concurrent TFTP connections allowed. This defaults to 50.
When serving a large number of TFTP connec- tions,
per-process file descriptor limits may be encountered.
Dnsmasq needs one file descriptor for each concurrent TFTP
con- nection and one file descriptor per unique file (plus a
few oth- ers). So serving the same file simultaneously to n
clients will use require about n + 10 file descriptors,
serving different files simultaneously to n clients will
require about (2*n) + 10 descriptors. If --tftp-port-range
is given, that can affect the number of concurrent
connections.</p>

<p>--tftp-no-blocksize Stop the TFTP server from
negotiating the &quot;blocksize&quot; option with a client.
Some buggy clients request this option but then behave badly
when it is granted.</p>

<p>--tftp-port-range=&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt; A TFTP
server listens on a well-known port (69) for connection
initiation, but it also uses a dynamically-allocated port
for each connection. Normally these are allocated by the OS,
but this option specifies a range of ports for use by TFTP
trans- fers. This can be useful when TFTP has to traverse a
firewall. The start of the range cannot be lower than 1025
unless dnsmasq is running as root. The number of concurrent
TFTP connections is limited by the size of the port
range.</p>

<p>-C, --conf-file=&lt;file&gt; Specify a different
configuration file. The conf-file option is also allowed in
configuration files, to include multiple config- uration
files.</p>

<p>-7, --conf-dir=&lt;directory&gt; Read all the files in
the given directory as configuration files. Files whose
names end in ~ or start with . or start and end with # are
skipped. This flag may be given on the command line or in a
configuration file.</p>

<p>CONFIG FILE At startup, dnsmasq reads /etc/dnsmasq.conf,
if it exists. (On FreeBSD, the file is
/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf ) (but see the -C and -7
options.) The format of this file consists of one option per
line, exactly as the long options detailed in the OPTIONS
section but without the leading &quot;--&quot;. Lines
starting with # are comments and ignored. For options which
may only be specified once, the configuration file over-
rides the command line. Quoting is allowed in a config file:
between &quot; quotes the special meanings of ,:. and # are
removed and the following escapes are allowed: \ to tab,
escape, backspace, return and newline.</p>

<p>NOTES When it receives a SIGHUP, dnsmasq clears its
cache and then re-loads /etc/hosts and /etc/ethers and any
file given by --dhcp-hostsfile, --dhcp-optsfile or
--addn-hosts. The dhcp lease change script is called for all
existing DHCP leases. If --no-poll is set SIGHUP also
re-reads /etc/resolv.conf. SIGHUP does NOT re-read the
configuration file.</p>

<p>When it receives a SIGUSR1, dnsmasq writes statistics to
the system log. It writes the cache size, the number of
names which have had to removed from the cache before they
expired in order to make room for new names and the total
number of names that have been inserted into the cache. For
each upstream server it gives the number of queries sent,
and the number which resulted in an error. In --no-daemon
mode or when full logging is enabled (-q), a complete dump
of the contents of the cache is made.</p>

<p>When it receives SIGUSR2 and it is logging direct to a
file (see --log- facility ) dnsmasq will close and reopen
the log file. Note that during this operation, dnsmasq will
not be running as root. When it first cre- ates the logfile
dnsmasq changes the ownership of the file to the non- root
user it will run as. Logrotate should be configured to
create a new log file with the ownership which matches the
existing one before sending SIGUSR2. If TCP DNS queries are
in progress, the old logfile will remain open in child
processes which are handling TCP queries and may continue to
be written. There is a limit of 150 seconds, after which all
existing TCP processes will have expired: for this reason,
it is not wise to configure logfile compression for logfiles
which have just been rotated. Using logrotate, the required
options are create and delaycompress.</p>

<p>Dnsmasq is a DNS query forwarder: it it not capable of
recursively answering arbitrary queries starting from the
root servers but forwards such queries to a fully recursive
upstream DNS server which is typi- cally provided by an ISP.
By default, dnsmasq reads /etc/resolv.conf to discover the
IP addresses of the upstream nameservers it should use,
since the information is typically stored there. Unless
--no-poll is used, dnsmasq checks the modification time of
/etc/resolv.conf (or equivalent if --resolv-file is used)
and re-reads it if it changes. This allows the DNS servers
to be set dynamically by PPP or DHCP since both protocols
provide the information. Absence of /etc/resolv.conf is not
an error since it may not have been created before a PPP
connection exists. Dnsmasq simply keeps checking in case
/etc/resolv.conf is cre- ated at any time. Dnsmasq can be
told to parse more than one resolv.conf file. This is useful
on a laptop, where both PPP and DHCP may be used: dnsmasq
can be set to poll both /etc/ppp/resolv.conf and
/etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf and will use the contents of
whichever changed last, giving automatic switching between
DNS servers.</p>

<p>Upstream servers may also be specified on the command
line or in the configuration file. These server
specifications optionally take a domain name which tells
dnsmasq to use that server only to find names in that
particular domain.</p>

<p>In order to configure dnsmasq to act as cache for the
host on which it is running, put &quot;nameserver
127.0.0.1&quot; in /etc/resolv.conf to force local processes
to send queries to dnsmasq. Then either specify the upstream
servers directly to dnsmasq using --server options or put
their addresses real in another file, say
/etc/resolv.dnsmasq and run dnsmasq with the -r
/etc/resolv.dnsmasq option. This second technique allows for
dynamic update of the server addresses by PPP or DHCP.</p>

<p>Addresses in /etc/hosts will &quot;shadow&quot;
different addresses for the same names in the upstream DNS,
so &quot;mycompany.com 1.2.3.4&quot; in /etc/hosts will
ensure that queries for &quot;mycompany.com&quot; always
return 1.2.3.4 even if queries in the upstream DNS would
otherwise return a different address. There is one exception
to this: if the upstream DNS contains a CNAME which points
to a shadowed name, then looking up the CNAME through
dnsmasq will result in the unshadowed address associated
with the target of the CNAME. To work around this, add the
CNAME to /etc/hosts so that the CNAME is shadowed too.</p>

<p>The network-id system works as follows: For each DHCP
request, dnsmasq collects a set of valid network-id tags,
one from the dhcp-range used to allocate the address, one
from any matching dhcp-host and possibly many from matching
vendor classes and user classes sent by the DHCP client. Any
dhcp-option which has network-id tags will be used in pref-
erence to an untagged dhcp-option, provided that _all_ the
tags match somewhere in the set collected as described
above. The prefix # on a tag means not so
--dhcp=option=#purple,3,1.2.3.4 sends the option when the
network-id tag purple is not in the set of valid tags.</p>

<p>If the network-id in a dhcp-range is prefixed with net:
then its meaning changes from setting a tag to matching it.
Thus if there is more than dhcp-range on a subnet, and one
is tagged with a network-id which is set (for instance from
a vendorclass option) then hosts which set the netid tag
will be allocated addresses in the tagged range.</p>

<p>The DHCP server in dnsmasq will function as a BOOTP
server also, pro- vided that the MAC address and IP address
for clients are given, either using dhcp-host configurations
or in /etc/ethers , and a dhcp-range configuration option is
present to activate the DHCP server on a par- ticular
network. (Setting --bootp-dynamic removes the need for
static address mappings.) The filename parameter in a BOOTP
request is matched against netids in dhcp-option
configurations, as is the tag &quot;bootp&quot;, allowing
some control over the options returned to different classes
of hosts.</p>

<p>EXIT CODES 0 - Dnsmasq successfully forked into the
background, or terminated nor- mally if backgrounding is not
enabled.</p>

<p>1 - A problem with configuration was detected.</p>

<p>2 - A problem with network access occurred (address in
use, attempt to use privileged ports without
permission).</p>

<p>3 - A problem occurred with a filesystem operation
(missing file/direc- tory, permissions).</p>

<p>4 - Memory allocation failure.</p>

<p>5 - Other miscellaneous problem.</p>

<p>11 or greater - a non zero return code was received from
the lease- script process &quot;init&quot; call. The exit
code from dnsmasq is the scripts exit code with 10
added.</p>

<p>LIMITS The default values for resource limits in dnsmasq
are generally conser- vative, and appropriate for embedded
router type devices with slow pro- cessors and limited
memory. On more capable hardware, it is possible to increase
the limits, and handle many more clients. The following
applies to dnsmasq-2.37: earlier versions did not scale as
well.</p>

<p>Dnsmasq is capable of handling DNS and DHCP for at least
a thousand clients. Clearly to do this the value of
--dhcp-lease-max must be increased, and lease times should
not be very short (less than one hour). The value of
--dns-forward-max can be increased: start with it equal to
the number of clients and increase if DNS seems slow. Note
that DNS performance depends too on the performance of the
upstream nameservers. The size of the DNS cache may be
increased: the hard limit is 10000 names and the default
(150) is very low. Sending SIGUSR1 to dnsmasq makes it log
information which is useful for tuning the cache size. See
the NOTES section for details.</p>

<p>The built-in TFTP server is capable of many simultaneous
file trans- fers: the absolute limit is related to the
number of file-handles allowed to a process and the ability
of the select() system call to cope with large numbers of
file handles. If the limit is set too high using --tftp-max
it will be scaled down and the actual limit logged at
start-up. Note that more transfers are possible when the
same file is being sent than when each transfer sends a
different file.</p>

<p>It is possible to use dnsmasq to block Web advertising
by using a list of known banner-ad servers, all resolving to
127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0, in /etc/hosts or an additional hosts
file. The list can be very long, dns- masq has been tested
successfully with one million names. That size file needs a
1GHz processor and about 60Mb of RAM.</p>
