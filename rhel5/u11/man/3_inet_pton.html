<p>NAME inet_pton - Create a network address structure</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/socket.h&gt; #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;</p>

<p>int inet_pton(int af, const char *src, void *dst);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function converts the character string
src into a network address structure in the af address
family, then copies the network address structure to
dst.</p>

<p>inet_pton(3) extends the inet_addr(3) function to
support multiple address families, inet_addr(3) is now
considered to be deprecated in favor of inet_pton(3). The
following address families are currently supported:</p>

<p>AF_INET src points to a character string containing an
IPv4 network address in the dotted-quad format,
&quot;ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd&quot;. The address is converted to a
struct in_addr and copied to dst, which must be
sizeof(struct in_addr) bytes long.</p>

<p>AF_INET6 src points to a character string containing an
IPv6 network address in any allowed IPv6 address format. The
address is con- verted to a struct in6_addr and copied to
dst, which must be sizeof(struct in6_addr) bytes long.</p>

<p>Certain legacy hex and octal formats of AF_INET
addresses are not sup- ported by inet_pton(), which rejects
them.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE inet_pton() returns a negative value and
sets errno to EAFNOSUPPORT if af does not contain a valid
address family. 0 is returned if src does not contain a
character string representing a valid network address in the
specified address family. A positive value is returned if
the net- work address was successfully converted.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO inet_ntop(3)</p>

<p>BUGS AF_INET6 does not recognize IPv4 addresses. An
explicit IPv6-mapped IPv4 address must be supplied in src
instead.</p>
