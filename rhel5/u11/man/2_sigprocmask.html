<p>SIGPROCMASK(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SIGPROCMASK(2)</p>

<p>NAME sigprocmask - examine and change blocked
signals</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sigprocmask(int how, const sigset_t *set, sigset_t
*oldset);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sigprocmask() is used to change the signal
mask, the set of currently blocked signals. The behaviour of
the call is dependent on the value of how, as follows.</p>

<p>SIG_BLOCK The set of blocked signals is the union of the
current set and the set argument.</p>

<p>SIG_UNBLOCK The signals in set are removed from the
current set of blocked signals. It is legal to attempt to
unblock a signal which is not blocked.</p>

<p>SIG_SETMASK The set of blocked signals is set to the
argument set.</p>

<p>If oldset is non-null, the previous value of the signal
mask is stored in oldset.</p>

<p>If set is NULL, then the signal mask is unchanged (i.e.,
how is ignored), but the current value of the signal mask is
nevertheless returned in oldset (it is not NULL).</p>

<p>The use of sigprocmask() is unspecified in a
multithreaded process; see pthread_sigmask(3).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE sigprocmask() returns 0 on success and -1
on error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL The value specified in how was
invalid.</p>

<p>NOTES It is not possible to block SIGKILL or SIGSTOP.
Attempts to do so are silently ignored.</p>

<p>If SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, or SIGSEGV are generated
while they are blocked, the result is undefined, unless the
signal was generated by the kill(2), sigqueue(2), or
raise(3).</p>

<p>See sigsetops(3) for details on manipulating signal
sets.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>
