<p>LOCKF(3) Linux Programmer s Manual LOCKF(3)</p>

<p>NAME lockf - apply, test or remove a POSIX lock on an
open file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int lockf(int fd, int cmd, off_t len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Apply, test or remove a POSIX lock on a
section of an open file. The file is specified by fd, a file
descriptor open for writing, the action by cmd, and the
section consists of byte positions pos..pos+len-1 if len is
positive, and pos-len..pos-1 if len is negative, where pos
is the current file position, and if len is zero, the
section extends from the current file position to infinity,
encompassing the present and future end-of-file positions.
In all cases, the section may extend past current
end-of-file.</p>

<p>On Linux, this call is just an interface for fcntl(2).
(In general, the relation between lockf() and fcntl() is
unspecified.)</p>

<p>Valid operations are given below:</p>

<p>F_LOCK Set an exclusive lock on the specified section of
the file. If (part of) this section is already locked, the
call blocks until the previous lock is released. If this
section overlaps an ear- lier locked section, both are
merged. File locks are released as soon as the process
holding the locks closes some file descriptor for the file.
A child process does not inherit these locks.</p>

<p>F_TLOCK Same as F_LOCK but the call never blocks and
returns an error instead if the file is already locked.</p>

<p>F_ULOCK Unlock the indicated section of the file. This
may cause a locked section to be split into two locked
sections.</p>

<p>F_TEST Test the lock: return 0 if the specified section
is unlocked or locked by this process; return -1, set errno
to EAGAIN (EACCES on some other systems), if another process
holds a lock.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES or EAGAIN The file is locked and F_TLOCK
or F_TEST was specified, or the operation is prohibited
because the file has been memory-mapped by another
process.</p>

<p>EBADF fd is not an open file descriptor.</p>

<p>EDEADLK The command was T_LOCK and this lock operation
would cause a deadlock.</p>

<p>EINVAL An invalid operation was specified in fd.</p>

<p>ENOLCK Too many segment locks open, lock table is
full.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001</p>

<p>SEE ALSO fcntl(2), flock(2) There are also locks.txt and
mandatory.txt in /usr/share/doc/kernel-
doc-2.6.18/Documentation.</p>
