<p>DESCRIPTION The GNU objcopy utility copies the contents
of an object file to another. objcopy uses the GNU BFD
Library to read and write the object files. It can write the
destination object file in a format different from that of
the source object file. The exact behavior of objcopy is
controlled by command-line options. Note that objcopy should
be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats.
However, copying a relocatable object file between any two
formats may not work as expected.</p>

<p>objcopy creates temporary files to do its translations
and deletes them afterward. objcopy uses BFD to do all its
translation work; it has access to all the formats described
in BFD and thus is able to recog- nize most formats without
being told explicitly.</p>

<p>objcopy can be used to generate S-records by using an
output target of srec (e.g., use -O srec).</p>

<p>objcopy can be used to generate a raw binary file by
using an output target of binary (e.g., use -O binary). When
objcopy generates a raw binary file, it will essentially
produce a memory dump of the contents of the input object
file. All symbols and relocation information will be
discarded. The memory dump will start at the load address of
the lowest section copied into the output file.</p>

<p>When generating an S-record or a raw binary file, it may
be helpful to use -S to remove sections containing debugging
information. In some cases -R will be useful to remove
sections which contain information that is not needed by the
binary file.</p>

<p>Note---objcopy is not able to change the endianness of
its input files. If the input format has an endianness (some
formats do not), objcopy can only copy the inputs into file
formats that have the same endian- ness or which have no
endianness (e.g., srec).</p>

<p>OPTIONS infile outfile The input and output files,
respectively. If you do not specify outfile, objcopy creates
a temporary file and destructively renames the result with
the name of infile.</p>

<p>-I bfdname --input-target=bfdname Consider the source
files object format to be bfdname, rather than attempting to
deduce it.</p>

<p>-O bfdname --output-target=bfdname Write the output file
using the object format bfdname.</p>

<p>-F bfdname --target=bfdname Use bfdname as the object
format for both the input and the output file; i.e., simply
transfer data from source to destination with no
translation.</p>

<p>-B bfdarch --binary-architecture=bfdarch Useful when
transforming a raw binary input file into an object file. In
this case the output architecture can be set to bfdarch.
This option will be ignored if the input file has a known
bfdarch. You can access this binary data inside a program by
referencing the special symbols that are created by the
conversion process. These symbols are called
_binary_objfile_start, _binary_objfile_end and
_binary_objfile_size. e.g. you can transform a picture file
into an object file and then access it in your code using
these symbols.</p>

<p>-j sectionname --only-section=sectionname Copy only the
named section from the input file to the output file. This
option may be given more than once. Note that using this
option inappropriately may make the output file
unusable.</p>

<p>-R sectionname --remove-section=sectionname Remove any
section named sectionname from the output file. This option
may be given more than once. Note that using this option
inappropriately may make the output file unusable.</p>

<p>-S --strip-all Do not copy relocation and symbol
information from the source file.</p>

<p>-g --strip-debug Do not copy debugging symbols or
sections from the source file.</p>

<p>--strip-unneeded Strip all symbols that are not needed
for relocation processing.</p>

<p>-K symbolname --keep-symbol=symbolname When stripping
symbols, keep symbol symbolname even if it would normally be
stripped. This option may be given more than once.</p>

<p>-N symbolname --strip-symbol=symbolname Do not copy
symbol symbolname from the source file. This option may be
given more than once.</p>

<p>--strip-unneeded-symbol=symbolname Do not copy symbol
symbolname from the source file unless it is needed by a
relocation. This option may be given more than once.</p>

<p>-G symbolname --keep-global-symbol=symbolname Keep only
symbol symbolname global. Make all other symbols local to
the file, so that they are not visible externally. This
option may be given more than once.</p>

<p>--localize-hidden In an ELF object, mark all symbols
that have hidden or internal visibility as local. This
option applies on top of symbol-specific localization
options such as -L.</p>

<p>-L symbolname --localize-symbol=symbolname Make symbol
symbolname local to the file, so that it is not visible
externally. This option may be given more than once.</p>

<p>-W symbolname --weaken-symbol=symbolname Make symbol
symbolname weak. This option may be given more than
once.</p>

<p>--globalize-symbol=symbolname Give symbol symbolname
global scoping so that it is visible outside of the file in
which it is defined. This option may be given more than
once.</p>

<p>-w --wildcard Permit regular expressions in symbolnames
used in other command line options. The question mark (?),
asterisk (*), backslash ( and square brackets ([]) operators
can be used anywhere in the sym- bol name. If the first
character of the symbol name is the excla- mation point (!)
then the sense of the switch is reversed for that symbol.
For example:</p>

<p>-w -W !foo -W fo*</p>

<p>would cause objcopy to weaken all symbols that start
with &quot;fo&quot; except for the symbol
&quot;foo&quot;.</p>

<p>-x --discard-all Do not copy non-global symbols from the
source file.</p>

<p>-X --discard-locals Do not copy compiler-generated local
symbols. (These usually start with L or ..)</p>

<p>-b byte --byte=byte Keep only every byteth byte of the
input file (header data is not affected). byte can be in the
range from 0 to interleave-1, where interleave is given by
the -i or --interleave option, or the default of 4. This
option is useful for creating files to program ROM. It is
typically used with an &quot;srec&quot; output target.</p>

<p>-i interleave --interleave=interleave Only copy one out
of every interleave bytes. Select which byte to copy with
the -b or --byte option. The default is 4. objcopy ignores
this option if you do not specify either -b or --byte.</p>

<p>-p --preserve-dates Set the access and modification
dates of the output file to be the same as those of the
input file.</p>

<p>--debugging Convert debugging information, if possible.
This is not the default because only certain debugging
formats are supported, and the conversion process can be
time consuming.</p>

<p>--gap-fill val Fill gaps between sections with val. This
operation applies to the load address (LMA) of the sections.
It is done by increasing the size of the section with the
lower address, and filling in the extra space created with
val.</p>

<p>--pad-to address Pad the output file up to the load
address address. This is done by increasing the size of the
last section. The extra space is filled in with the value
specified by --gap-fill (default zero).</p>

<p>--set-start val Set the start address of the new file to
val. Not all object file formats support setting the start
address.</p>

<p>--change-start incr --adjust-start incr Change the start
address by adding incr. Not all object file for- mats
support setting the start address.</p>

<p>--change-addresses incr --adjust-vma incr Change the VMA
and LMA addresses of all sections, as well as the start
address, by adding incr. Some object file formats do not
permit section addresses to be changed arbitrarily. Note
that this does not relocate the sections; if the program
expects sections to be loaded at a certain address, and this
option is used to change the sections such that they are
loaded at a different address, the program may fail.</p>

<p>--change-section-address section{=,+,-}val
--adjust-section-vma section{=,+,-}val Set or change both
the VMA address and the LMA address of the named section. If
= is used, the section address is set to val. Other- wise,
val is added to or subtracted from the section address. See
the comments under --change-addresses, above. If section
does not exist in the input file, a warning will be issued,
unless --no-change-warnings is used.</p>

<p>--change-section-lma section{=,+,-}val Set or change the
LMA address of the named section. The LMA address is the
address where the section will be loaded into memory at
program load time. Normally this is the same as the VMA
address, which is the address of the section at program run
time, but on some systems, especially those where a program
is held in ROM, the two can be different. If = is used, the
section address is set to val. Otherwise, val is added to or
subtracted from the section address. See the comments under
--change-addresses, above. If section does not exist in the
input file, a warning will be issued, unless
--no-change-warnings is used.</p>

<p>--change-section-vma section{=,+,-}val Set or change the
VMA address of the named section. The VMA address is the
address where the section will be located once the program
has started executing. Normally this is the same as the LMA
address, which is the address where the section will be
loaded into memory, but on some systems, especially those
where a program is held in ROM, the two can be different. If
= is used, the sec- tion address is set to val. Otherwise,
val is added to or sub- tracted from the section address.
See the comments under --change-addresses, above. If section
does not exist in the input file, a warning will be issued,
unless --no-change-warnings is used.</p>

<p>--change-warnings --adjust-warnings If
--change-section-address or --change-section-lma or
--change-section-vma is used, and the named section does not
exist, issue a warning. This is the default.</p>

<p>--no-change-warnings --no-adjust-warnings Do not issue a
warning if --change-section-address or --adjust-sec-
tion-lma or --adjust-section-vma is used, even if the named
section does not exist.</p>

<p>--set-section-flags section=flags Set the flags for the
named section. The flags argument is a comma separated
string of flag names. The recognized names are alloc,
contents, load, noload, readonly, code, data, rom, share,
and debug. You can set the contents flag for a section which
does not have contents, but it is not meaningful to clear
the contents flag of a section which does have
contents--just remove the section instead. Not all flags are
meaningful for all object file formats.</p>

<p>--add-section sectionname=filename Add a new section
named sectionname while copying the file. The contents of
the new section are taken from the file filename. The size
of the section will be the size of the file. This option
only works on file formats which can support sections with
arbitrary names.</p>

<p>--rename-section oldname=newname[,flags] Rename a
section from oldname to newname, optionally changing the
sections flags to flags in the process. This has the
advantage over usng a linker script to perform the rename in
that the output stays as an object file and does not become
a linked executable.</p>

<p>This option is particularly helpful when the input
format is binary, since this will always create a section
called .data. If for example, you wanted instead to create a
section called .rodata containing binary data you could use
the following command line to achieve it:</p>

<p>objcopy -I binary -O &lt;output_format&gt; -B
&lt;architecture&gt; --rename-section
.data=.rodata,alloc,load,readonly,data,contents
&lt;input_binary_file&gt; &lt;output_object_file&gt;</p>

<p>--change-leading-char Some object file formats use
special characters at the start of symbols. The most common
such character is underscore, which com- pilers often add
before every symbol. This option tells objcopy to change the
leading character of every symbol when it converts between
object file formats. If the object file formats use the same
leading character, this option has no effect. Otherwise, it
will add a character, or remove a character, or change a
character, as appropriate.</p>

<p>--remove-leading-char If the first character of a global
symbol is a special symbol lead- ing character used by the
object file format, remove the character. The most common
symbol leading character is underscore. This option will
remove a leading underscore from all global symbols. This
can be useful if you want to link together objects of
differ- ent file formats with different conventions for
symbol names. This is different from --change-leading-char
because it always changes the symbol name when appropriate,
regardless of the object file format of the output file.</p>

<p>--srec-len=ival Meaningful only for srec output. Set the
maximum length of the Srecords being produced to ival. This
length covers both address, data and crc fields.</p>

<p>--srec-forceS3 Meaningful only for srec output. Avoid
generation of S1/S2 records, creating S3-only record
format.</p>

<p>--redefine-sym old=new Change the name of a symbol old,
to new. This can be useful when one is trying link two
things together for which you have no source, and there are
name collisions.</p>

<p>--redefine-syms=filename Apply --redefine-sym to each
symbol pair &quot;old new&quot; listed in the file filename.
filename is simply a flat file, with one symbol pair per
line. Line comments may be introduced by the hash charac-
ter. This option may be given more than once.</p>

<p>--weaken Change all global symbols in the file to be
weak. This can be use- ful when building an object which
will be linked against other objects using the -R option to
the linker. This option is only effective when using an
object file format which supports weak sym- bols.</p>

<p>--keep-symbols=filename Apply --keep-symbol option to
each symbol listed in the file file- name. filename is
simply a flat file, with one symbol name per line. Line
comments may be introduced by the hash character. This
option may be given more than once.</p>

<p>--strip-symbols=filename Apply --strip-symbol option to
each symbol listed in the file file- name. filename is
simply a flat file, with one symbol name per line. Line
comments may be introduced by the hash character. This
option may be given more than once.</p>

<p>--strip-unneeded-symbols=filename Apply
--strip-unneeded-symbol option to each symbol listed in the
file filename. filename is simply a flat file, with one
symbol name per line. Line comments may be introduced by the
hash charac- ter. This option may be given more than
once.</p>

<p>--keep-global-symbols=filename Apply
--keep-global-symbol option to each symbol listed in the
file filename. filename is simply a flat file, with one
symbol name per line. Line comments may be introduced by the
hash character. This option may be given more than once.</p>

<p>--localize-symbols=filename Apply --localize-symbol
option to each symbol listed in the file filename. filename
is simply a flat file, with one symbol name per line. Line
comments may be introduced by the hash character. This
option may be given more than once.</p>

<p>--globalize-symbols=filename Apply --globalize-symbol
option to each symbol listed in the file filename. filename
is simply a flat file, with one symbol name per line. Line
comments may be introduced by the hash character. This
option may be given more than once.</p>

<p>--weaken-symbols=filename Apply --weaken-symbol option
to each symbol listed in the file filename. filename is
simply a flat file, with one symbol name per line. Line
comments may be introduced by the hash character. This
option may be given more than once.</p>

<p>--alt-machine-code=index If the output architecture has
alternate machine codes, use the indexth code instead of the
default one. This is useful in case a machine is assigned an
official code and the tool-chain adopts the new code, but
other applications still depend on the original code being
used. For ELF based architectures if the index alternative
does not exist then the value is treated as an absolute
number to be stored in the e_machine field of the ELF
header.</p>

<p>--writable-text Mark the output text as writable. This
option isn t meaningful for all object file formats.</p>

<p>--readonly-text Make the output text write protected.
This option isn t meaningful for all object file
formats.</p>

<p>--pure Mark the output file as demand paged. This option
isn t meaningful for all object file formats.</p>

<p>--impure Mark the output file as impure. This option
isnt meaningful for all object file formats.</p>

<p>--prefix-symbols=string Prefix all symbols in the output
file with string.</p>

<p>--prefix-sections=string Prefix all section names in the
output file with string.</p>

<p>--prefix-alloc-sections=string Prefix all the names of
all allocated sections in the output file with string.</p>

<p>--add-gnu-debuglink=path-to-file Creates a
.gnu_debuglink section which contains a reference to
path-to-file and adds it to the output file.</p>

<p>--keep-file-symbols When stripping a file, perhaps with
--strip-debug or --strip-unneeded, retain any symbols
specifying source file names, which would otherwise get
stripped.</p>

<p>--only-keep-debug Strip a file, removing contents of any
sections that would not be stripped by --strip-debug and
leaving the debugging sections intact.</p>

<p>The intention is that this option will be used in
conjunction with --add-gnu-debuglink to create a two part
executable. One a stripped binary which will occupy less
space in RAM and in a dis- tribution and the second a
debugging information file which is only needed if debugging
abilities are required. The suggested proce- dure to create
these files is as follows:</p>

<p>1.&lt;Link the executable as normal. Assuming that is is
called&gt; &quot;foo&quot; then...</p>

<p>1.&lt;Run &quot;objcopy --only-keep-debug foo
foo.dbg&quot; to&gt; create a file containing the debugging
info.</p>

<p>1.&lt;Run &quot;objcopy --strip-debug foo&quot; to
create a&gt; stripped executable.</p>

<p>1.&lt;Run &quot;objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.dbg
foo&quot;&gt; to add a link to the debugging info into the
stripped exe- cutable.</p>

<p>Note - the choice of &quot;.dbg&quot; as an extension
for the debug info file is arbitrary. Also the
&quot;--only-keep-debug&quot; step is optional. You could
instead do this:</p>

<p>1.&lt;Link the executable as normal.&gt; 1.&lt;Copy
&quot;foo&quot; to &quot;foo.full&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;Run
&quot;objcopy --strip-debug foo&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;Run
&quot;objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.full foo&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>i.e., the file pointed to by the --add-gnu-debuglink can
be the full executable. It does not have to be a file
created by the --only-keep-debug switch.</p>

<p>Note - this switch is only intended for use on fully
linked files. It does not make sense to use it on object
files where the debug- ging information may be incomplete.
Besides the gnu_debuglink fea- ture currently only supports
the presence of one filename contain- ing debugging
information, not multiple filenames on a one-per-
object-file basis.</p>

<p>-V --version Show the version number of objcopy.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Verbose output: list all object files
modified. In the case of archives, objcopy -V lists all
members of the archive.</p>

<p>--help Show a summary of the options to objcopy.</p>

<p>--info Display a list showing all architectures and
object formats avail- able.</p>

<p>@file Read command-line options from file. The options
read are inserted in place of the original @file option. If
file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will
be treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p>Options in file are separated by whitespace. A
whitespace charac- ter may be included in an option by
surrounding the entire option in either single or double
quotes. Any character (including a backslash) may be
included by prefixing the character to be included with a
backslash. The file may itself contain additional @file
options; any such options will be processed recursively.</p>
