<p>IO_CANCEL(2) Linux Programmer s Manual IO_CANCEL(2)</p>

<p>NAME io_cancel - Cancel an outstanding asynchronous I/O
operation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;libaio.h&gt;</p>

<p>long io_cancel (aio_context_t ctx_id, struct iocb *iocb,
struct io_event *result);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION io_cancel() attempts to cancel an
asynchronous I/O operation previously submitted with the
io_submit system call. ctx_id is the AIO context ID of the
operation to be cancelled. If the AIO context is found, the
event will be cancelled and then copied into the memory
pointed to by result without being placed into the
completion queue.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE io_cancel() returns 0 on success;
otherwise, it returns one of the er- rors listed in the
&quot;Errors&quot; section.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL The AIO context specified by ctx_id is
invalid.</p>

<p>EFAULT One of the data structures points to invalid
data.</p>

<p>EAGAIN The iocb specified was not cancelled.</p>

<p>ENOSYS io_cancel() is not implemented on this
architecture.</p>

<p>VERSIONS The asynchronous I/O system calls first
appeared in Linux 2.5, August 2002.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO io_cancel() is Linux specific and should
not be used in programs that are intended to be
portable.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO io_setup(2), io_destroy(2), io_getevents(2),
io_submit(2).</p>

<p>NOTES The asynchronous I/O system calls were written by
Benjamin LaHaise.</p>
