<p>NAME man - macros to format man pages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groff -Tascii -man file ...</p>

<p>groff -Tps -man file ...</p>

<p>man [section] title</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page explains the groff tmac.an
macro package (often called the man macro package) and
related conventions for creating manual (man) pages. This
macro package should be used by developers when writing or
porting man pages for Linux. It is fairly compatible with
other versions of this macro package, so porting man pages
should not be a major problem (exceptions include the NET-2
BSD release, which uses a totally different macro package
called mdoc; see mdoc(7)).</p>

<p>Note that NET-2 BSD mdoc man pages can be used with
groff simply by specifying the -mdoc option instead of the
-man option. Using the -mandoc option is, however,
recommended, since this will automatically detect which
macro package is in use.</p>

<p>PREAMBLE The first command in a man page (after comment
lines) should be</p>

<p>.TH title section date source manual,</p>

<p>where:</p>

<p>title The title of the man page (e.g., MAN).</p>

<p>section The section number the man page should be placed
in (e.g., 7).</p>

<p>date The date of the last revisionremember to change
this every time a change is made to the man page, since this
is the most general way of doing version control.</p>

<p>source The source of the command.</p>

<p>For binaries, use something like: GNU, NET-2, SLS Dis-
tribution, MCC Distribution.</p>

<p>For system calls, use the version of the kernel that you
are currently looking at: Linux 0.99.11.</p>

<p>For library calls, use the source of the function: GNU,
4.3BSD, Linux DLL 4.4.1.</p>

<p>manual The title of the manual (e.g., Linux Programmers
Man- ual).</p>

<p>Note that BSD mdoc-formatted pages begin with the Dd
command, not the TH command.</p>

<p>The manual sections are traditionally defined as
follows:</p>

<p>1 Commands Those commands that can be executed by the
user from within a shell.</p>

<p>2 System calls Those functions which must be performed
by the kernel.</p>

<p>3 Library calls Most of the libc functions, such as
qsort(3).</p>

<p>4 Special files Files found in /dev.</p>

<p>5 File formats and conventions The format for
/etc/passwd and other human-readable files.</p>

<p>6 Games</p>

<p>7 Conventions and miscellaneous A description of the
standard file system layout, net- work protocols, ASCII and
other character codes, this man page, and other things.</p>

<p>8 System management commands Commands like mount(8),
many of which only root can execute.</p>

<p>9 Kernel routines This is an obsolete manual section.
Once it was thought a good idea to document the Linux kernel
here, but in fact very little has been documented, and the
documentation that exists is outdated already. There are
better sources of information for kernel develop- ers.</p>

<p>SECTIONS Sections are started with .SH followed by the
heading name. If the name contains spaces and appears on the
same line as .SH, then place the heading in double quotes.
Traditional or suggested headings include: NAME, SYNOPSIS,
DESCRIPTION, RETURN VALUE, EXIT STATUS, ERROR HANDLING,
ERRORS, OPTIONS, USAGE, EXAMPLES, FILES, ENVIRONMENT, DIAG-
NOSTICS, SECURITY, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, AUTHOR, and
SEE ALSO. Where a traditional heading would apply, please
use it; this kind of consistency can make the information
easier to understand. However, feel free to create your own
headings if they make things easier to understand. The only
required heading is NAME, which should be the first section
and be followed on the next line by a one line descrip- tion
of the program:</p>

<p>.SH NAME chess &minus; the game of chess</p>

<p>It is extremely important that this format is followed,
and that there is a backslash before the single dash which
follows the command name. This syntax is used by the
makewhatis(8) program to create a database of short command
descriptions for the whatis(1) and apropos(1) com-
mands.</p>

<p>Some other traditional sections have the following
contents:</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS briefly describes the command or function s
interface. For commands, this shows the syntax of the
command and its arguments (including options); boldface is
used for as-is text and italics are used to indicate
replaceable arguments. Brackets ([]) surround optional
arguments, vertical bars (|) separate choices, and ellipses
(...) can be repeated. For functions, it shows any required
data declarations or #include directives, followed by the
function declaration.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gives an explanation of what the command,
function, or format does. Discuss how it interacts with
files and standard input, and what it produces on standard
output or standard error. Omit internals and implementation
details unless they re critical for understanding the
interface. Describe the usual case; for information on
options use the OPTIONS section. If there is some kind of
input grammar or complex set of subcommands, consider
describing them in a separate USAGE section (and just place
an overview in the DESCRIPTION section).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE gives a list of the values the library
routine will return to the caller and the conditions that
cause these values to be returned.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS lists the possible exit status values or a
program and the conditions that cause these values to be
returned.</p>

<p>OPTIONS describes the options accepted by the program
and how they change its behavior.</p>

<p>USAGE describes the grammar of any sublanguage this
implements.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES provides one or more examples describing how
this func- tion, file or command is used.</p>

<p>FILES lists the files the program or function uses, such
as configuration files, startup files, and files the program
directly operates on. Give the full pathname of these files,
and use the installation process to modify the directory
part to match user preferences. For many pro- grams, the
default installation location is in /usr/local, so your base
manual page should use /usr/local as the base.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT lists all environment variables that affect
your program or function and how they affect it.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS gives an overview of the most common error
messages and how to cope with them. You dont need to explain
system error messages or fatal signals that can appear
during execution of any program unless theyre special in
some way to your program.</p>

<p>SECURITY discusses security issues and implications.
Warn about configurations or environments that should be
avoided, commands that may have security implications, and
so on, especially if they aren t obvious. Discussing
security in a separate section isnt necessary; if its easier
to understand, place security information in the other sec-
tions (such as the DESCRIPTION or USAGE section). How- ever,
please include security information somewhere!</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO describes any standards or conventions
this implements.</p>

<p>NOTES provides miscellaneous notes.</p>

<p>BUGS lists limitations, known defects or inconveniences,
and other questionable activities.</p>

<p>AUTHOR lists authors of the documentation or program so
you can mail in bug reports.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO lists related man pages in alphabetical order,
possibly followed by other related pages or documents.
Conventionally this is the last section.</p>

<p>FONTS Although there are many arbitrary conventions for
man pages in the UNIX world, the existence of several
hundred Linux-specific man pages defines our font
standards:</p>

<p>For functions, the arguments are always specified using
italics, even in the SYNOPSIS section, where the rest of the
function is specified in bold: int myfunction(int argc, char
**argv);</p>

<p>Filenames are always in italics (e.g.,
/usr/include/stdio.h), except in the SYNOPSIS section, where
included files are in bold (e.g., #include
&lt;stdio.h&gt;).</p>

<p>Special macros, which are usually in upper case, are in
bold (e.g., MAXINT).</p>

<p>When enumerating a list of error codes, the codes are in
bold (this list usually uses the .TP macro).</p>

<p>Any reference to another man page (or to the subject of
the cur- rent man page) is in bold. If the manual section
number is given, it is given in Roman (normal) font, without
any spaces (e.g., man(7)).</p>

<p>The commands to select the type face are:</p>

<p>.B Bold</p>

<p>.BI Bold alternating with italics (especially useful for
function spec- ifications)</p>

<p>.BR Bold alternating with Roman (especially useful for
referring to other manual pages)</p>

<p>.I Italics</p>

<p>.IB Italics alternating with bold</p>

<p>.IR Italics alternating with Roman</p>

<p>.RB Roman alternating with bold</p>

<p>.RI Roman alternating with italics</p>

<p>.SB Small alternating with bold</p>

<p>.SM Small (useful for acronyms)</p>

<p>Traditionally, each command can have up to six
arguments, but the GNU implementation removes this
limitation (you might still want to limit yourself to 6
arguments for portabilitys sake). Arguments are delim- ited
by spaces. Double quotes can be used to specify an argument
which contains spaces. All of the arguments will be printed
next to each other without intervening spaces, so that the
.BR command can be used to specify a word in bold followed
by a mark of punctuation in Roman. If no arguments are
given, the command is applied to the following line of
text.</p>

<p>OTHER MACROS AND STRINGS Below are other relevant macros
and predefined strings. Unless noted otherwise, all macros
cause a break (end the current line of text). Many of these
macros set or use the &quot;prevailing indent.&quot; The
&quot;prevail- ing indent&quot; value is set by any macro
with the parameter i below; macros may omit i in which case
the current prevailing indent will be used. As a result,
successive indented paragraphs can use the same indent
without re-specifying the indent value. A normal
(non-indented) paragraph resets the prevailing indent value
to its default value (0.5 inches). By default a given indent
is measured in ens; try to use ens or ems as units for
indents, since these will automatically adjust to font size
changes. The other key macro definitions are:</p>

<p>Normal Paragraphs .LP Same as .PP (begin a new
paragraph).</p>

<p>.P Same as .PP (begin a new paragraph).</p>

<p>.PP Begin a new paragraph and reset prevailing
indent.</p>

<p>Relative Margin Indent .RS i Start relative margin
indent: moves the left margin i to the right (if i is
omitted, the prevailing indent value is used). A new
prevailing indent is set to 0.5 inches. As a result, all
following paragraph(s) will be indented until the corre-
sponding .RE.</p>

<p>.RE End relative margin indent and restores the previous
value of the prevailing indent.</p>

<p>Indented Paragraph Macros .HP i Begin paragraph with a
hanging indent (the first line of the paragraph is at the
left margin of normal paragraphs, and the rest of the
paragraphs lines are indented).</p>

<p>.IP x i Indented paragraph with optional hanging tag. If
the tag x is omitted, the entire following paragraph is
indented by i. If the tag x is provided, it is hung at the
left margin before the following indented paragraph (this is
just like .TP except the tag is included with the command
instead of being on the following line). If the tag is too
long, the text after the tag will be moved down to the next
line (text will not be lost or garbled). For bulleted lists,
use this macro with &bull; (bullet) or &mdash; (em dash) as
the tag, and for numbered lists, use the number or letter
followed by a period as the tag; this simplifies translation
to other formats.</p>

<p>.TP i Begin paragraph with hanging tag. The tag is given
on the next line, but its results are like those of the .IP
command.</p>

<p>Hypertext Link Macros (Feature supported with groff
only.) In order to use hypertext link macros, it is
necessary to load the www.tmac macro package. Use the
request .mso www.tmac to do this.</p>

<p>.URL url link trailer Inserts a hypertext link to the
URI (URL) url, with link as the text of the link. The
trailer will be printed immediately afterwards. When
generating HTML this should translate into the HTML command
&lt;A HREF=&quot;url&quot;&gt;link&lt;/A&gt;trailer.</p>

<p>This and other related macros are new, and many tools
wont do anything with them, but since many tools (including
troff) will simply ignore undefined macros (or at worst
insert their text) these are safe to insert.</p>

<p>It can be useful to define your own URL macro in manual
pages for the benefit of those viewing it with a roff viewer
other than groff. That way, the URL, link text, and trailer
text (if any) are still visible.</p>

<p>Heres an example: .de URL \$2 &lang;URL: \$1 &rang;\$3
.. .if 1 .mso www.tmac .TH ... (later in the page) This
software comes from the .URL &quot;http://www.gnu.org/&quot;
&quot;GNU Project&quot; &quot; of the&quot; .URL
&quot;http://www.fsf.org/&quot; &quot;Free Software
Foundation&quot; .</p>

<p>In the above, if groff is being used, the www.tmac macro
pack- ages definition of the URL macro will supersede the
locally defined one.</p>

<p>A number of other link macros are available. See
groff_www(7) for more details.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Macros .DT Reset tabs to default tab
values (every 0.5 inches); does not cause a break.</p>

<p>.PD d Set inter-paragraph vertical distance to d (if
omitted, d=0.4v); does not cause a break.</p>

<p>.SS t Subheading t (like .SH, but used for a subsection
inside a section).</p>

<p>Predefined Strings The man package has the following
predefined strings:</p>

<p>Registration Symbol: &reg;</p>

<p>Change to default font size</p>

<p>Trademark Symbol:</p>

<p>Left angled doublequote:</p>

<p>Right angled doublequote:</p>

<p>SAFE SUBSET Although technically man is a troff macro
package, in reality a large number of other tools process
man page files that don t implement all of troff s
abilities. Thus, its best to avoid some of troffs more
exotic abilities where possible to permit these other tools
to work correctly. Avoid using the various troff
preprocessors (if you must, go ahead and use tbl(1), but try
to use the IP and TP commands instead for two-column
tables). Avoid using computations; most other tools cant
process them. Use simple commands that are easy to translate
to other formats. The following troff macros are believed to
be safe (though in many cases they will be ignored by
translators): bp, br, ce, de, ds, el, ie, if, fi, ft, hy,
ig, in, na, ne, nf, nh, ps, so, sp, ti, tr.</p>

<p>You may also use many troff escape sequences (those
sequences beginning with . When you need to include the
backslash character as normal text, use \. Other sequences
you may use, where x or xx are any char- acters and N is any
digit, include,-,., (xx, $N, nx, n(xx, fx, and f(xx. Avoid
using the escape sequences for drawing graphics.</p>

<p>Do not use the optional parameter for bp (break page).
Use only posi- tive values for sp (vertical space). Dont
define a macro (de) with the same name as a macro in this or
the mdoc macro package with a dif- ferent meaning; its
likely that such redefinitions will be ignored. Every
positive indent (in) should be paired with a matching
negative indent (although you should be using the RS and RE
macros instead). The condition test (if,ie) should only have
t or n as the condition. Only translations (tr) that can be
ignored should be used. Font changes (ft and thef escape
sequence) should only have the val- ues 1, 2, 3, 4, R, I, B,
P, or CW (the ft command may also have no parameters).</p>

<p>If you use capabilities beyond these, check the results
carefully on several tools. Once youve confirmed that the
additional capability is safe, let the maintainer of this
document know about the safe command or sequence that should
be added to this list.</p>

<p>NOTES By all means include full URLs (or URIs) in the
text itself; some tools such as man2html(1) can
automatically turn them into hypertext links. You can also
use the new URL macro to identify links to related infor-
mation. If you include URLs, use the full URL (e.g.,
&lt;http://www.ker- nelnotes.org&gt;) to ensure that tools
can automatically find the URLs.</p>

<p>Tools processing these files should open the file and
examine the first non-whitespace character. A period (.) or
single quote () at the beginning of a line indicates a
troff-based file (such as man or mdoc). A left angle bracket
(&lt;) indicates an SGML/XML-based file (such as HTML or
Docbook). Anything else suggests simple ASCII text (e.g., a
&quot;catman&quot; result).</p>

<p>Many man pages begin with ters, indicating how the page
is to be preprocessed. For portabilitys sake to non-troff
translators we recommend that you avoid using any- thing
other than tbl(1), and Linux can detect that automatically.
How- ever, you might want to include this information so
your man page can be handled by other (less capable)
systems. Here are the definitions of the preprocessors
invoked by these characters:</p>

<p>e eqn(1)</p>

<p>g grap(1)</p>

<p>p pic(1)</p>

<p>r refer(1)</p>

<p>t tbl(1)</p>

<p>v vgrind(1)</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/groff/[*/]tmac/tmac.an
/usr/man/whatis</p>

<p>BUGS Most of the macros describe formatting (e.g., font
type and spacing) instead of marking semantic content (e.g.,
this text is a reference to another page), compared to
formats like mdoc and DocBook (even HTML has more semantic
markings). This situation makes it harder to vary the man
format for different media, to make the formatting
consistent for a given media, and to automatically insert
cross-references. By sticking to the safe subset described
above, it should be easier to automate transitioning to a
different reference page format in the future.</p>
