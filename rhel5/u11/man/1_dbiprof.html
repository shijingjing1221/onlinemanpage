<p>NAME dbiprof - command-line client for
DBI::ProfileData</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS See a report of the ten queries with the
longest total runtime in the profile dump file
prof1.out:</p>

<p>dbiprof prof1.out</p>

<p>See the top 10 most frequently run queries in the
profile file dbi.prof (the default):</p>

<p>dbiprof --sort count</p>

<p>See the same report with 15 entries:</p>

<p>dbiprof --sort count --number 15</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool is a command-line client for the
DBI::ProfileData. It allows you to analyze the profile data
file produced by DBI::ProfileDumper and produce various
useful reports.</p>

<p>OPTIONS This program accepts the following options:</p>

<p>--number N Produce this many items in the report.
Defaults to 10. If set to &quot;all&quot; then all results
are shown.</p>

<p>--sort field Sort results by the given field. The
available sort fields are:</p>

<p>total Sorts by total time run time across all runs. This
is the default sort.</p>

<p>longest Sorts by the longest single run.</p>

<p>count Sorts by total number of runs.</p>

<p>first Sorts by the time taken in the first run.</p>

<p>shortest Sorts by the shortest single run.</p>

<p>--reverse Reverses the selected sort. For example, to
see a report of the shortest overall time:</p>

<p>dbiprof --sort total --reverse</p>

<p>--match keyN=value Consider only items where the
specified key matches the given value. Keys are numbered
from 1. For example, lets say you used a DBI::Profile Path
of:</p>

<p>[ DBIprofile_Statement, DBIprofile_Methodname ]</p>

<p>And called dbiprof as in:</p>

<p>dbiprof --match key2=execute</p>

<p>Your report would only show execute queries, leaving out
prepares, fetches, etc.</p>

<p>If the value given starts and ends with slashes
(&quot;/&quot;) then it will be treated as a regular
expression. For example, to only include SELECT queries
where key1 is the statement:</p>

<p>dbiprof --match key1=/^SELECT/</p>

<p>By default the match expression is matched
case-insensitively, but this can be changed with the
--case-sensitive option.</p>

<p>--exclude keyN=value Remove items for where the
specified key matches the given value. For example, to
exclude all prepare entries where key2 is the method
name:</p>

<p>dbiprof --exclude key2=prepare</p>

<p>Like &quot;--match&quot;, If the value given starts and
ends with slashes (&quot;/&quot;) then it will be treated as
a regular expression. For exam- ple, to exclude UPDATE
queries where key1 is the statement:</p>

<p>dbiprof --match key1=/^UPDATE/</p>

<p>By default the exclude expression is matched
case-insensitively, but this can be changed with the
--case-sensitive option.</p>

<p>--case-sensitive Using this option causes --match and
--exclude to work case-sensi- tively. Defaults to off.</p>

<p>--version Print the dbiprof version number and exit.</p>
