<p>NAME ld86 - Linker for as86(1)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ld86 [-03MNdimrstyz[-]] [-llib_extension] [-o
outfile] [-Ccrtfile] [-Llibdir] [-Olibfile] [-Ttextaddr]
[-Hheapsize] [-Ddataaddr] infile...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This linker understands only the object
files produced by the as86 assembler, it can link them into
either an impure or a separate I&amp;D executable.</p>

<p>The linking defaults are everything off or none except
for -0 and the output file is a.out. There is not a standard
library location defined in the linker.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -0 produce header with 16-bit magic</p>

<p>-3 produce header with 32-bit magic</p>

<p>-d delete the header from the output file, used for
MSDOS COM files. As a side effect this also includes -s as
theres nowhere to put a symbol table.</p>

<p>-Cx add file libdir-from-search/crtx.o to list of files
linked</p>

<p>-D data base address follows (in format suitable for
strtoul)</p>

<p>-H the top of heap (initial stack) address (in format
suitable for strtoul)</p>

<p>-Lx add dir name x to the head of the list of library
dirs searched</p>

<p>-M print symbols linked on stdout</p>

<p>-N Create a native Linux OMAGIC output file. If the
contents are i386 code the binary can be either linked by
GCC or executed by linux. If the -z option is also included
the linker can generate a QMAGIC executable.</p>

<p>-Ox add library or object file libdir-from-search/x to
list of files linked</p>

<p>-T text base address follows (in format suitable for
strtoul)</p>

<p>-i separate I&amp;D output</p>

<p>-lx add library libdir-from-search/libx.a to list of
files linked</p>

<p>-m print modules linked on stdout</p>

<p>-o output file name follows</p>

<p>-s strip symbols</p>

<p>-r Generate a relocatable object from one source object,
if the linker is given the -N option also the output format
will be the hosts native format if possible.</p>

<p>-t trace modules being looked at on stdout</p>

<p>-y Alter the symbol tables to add label extensions so
that labels with more than 8 characters can be stored in
elks executables.</p>

<p>-z produce &quot;unmapped zero page&quot; or
&quot;QMAGIC&quot; executables</p>

<p>All the options not taking an argument may be turned off
by following the option letter by a -, as for cc1.</p>

<p>PREDEFINED LABELS The linker predefines several labels
that can be imported into user programs.</p>

<p>__etext Standard C variable for the end of the text
segment.</p>

<p>__edata Standard C variable for the end of the
initilised data.</p>

<p>__end Standard C variable for the end of the bss
area.</p>

<p>__segoff The offset within the executable file between
the start of the text segment and the start of the data
segment in 16 byte paragraphs . Note this is zero for impure
(tiny model) executables and is adjusted for executables
that dont start at offset 0 within the segment.</p>

<p>__segXDL The lowest address with data in segment X. (eg
__seg0DL is for segment zero or the text segment, __seg3DL
is for the data segment) The value X is a hex digit.</p>

<p>__segXDH The top of segment Xs data area.</p>

<p>__segXCL The bottom of segment X s common data or
unitilised data area. Each segment has both an initilised
and unitilised data area.</p>

<p>__segXCH The top of segment Xs common area.</p>

<p>__segXSO This is the adjusted offset from segment 0 of
the start of segment X in paragraphs.</p>

<p>HISTORY The 6809 version does not support -i.</p>

<p>The previous versions of the linker could produce an
8086 executable with segments of a size &gt;64k, now only
i386 executables may have segments this large.</p>

<p>BUGS The linker cannot deal with reverse seeks caused by
org instructions in the object file. Unlike previous
versions the current one traps the error rather than trying
to fill up the hard disk.</p>

<p>The linker produces a broken a.out object file if given
one input and the -r option this is so it is compatible with
pre-dev86 versions.</p>
