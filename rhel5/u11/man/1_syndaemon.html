<p>syndaemon(1) syndaemon(1)</p>

<p>NAME syndaemon - a program that monitors keyboard
activity and disables the touchpad when the keyboard is
being used.</p>

<p>SYNTAX syndaemon [-i idle-time] [-d] [-p pid-file] [-t]
[-k] [-K]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Disabling the touchpad while typing avoids
unwanted movements of the pointer that could lead to giving
focus to the wrong window. This pro- gram needs SHMConfig
&quot;on&quot; in your XOrg/XFree86 Synaptics Touchpad con-
figuration.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -i &lt;idle-time&gt; How many seconds to wait
after the last key press before enabling the touchpad.
(default is 2.0s).</p>

<p>-d Start as a daemon, ie in the background.</p>

<p>-p &lt;pid-file&gt; Create a pid file with the specified
filename. A pid file will only be created if the program is
started in daemon mode.</p>

<p>-t Only disable tapping and scrolling, not mouse
movements, in response to keyboard activity.</p>

<p>-k Ignore modifier keys when monitoring keyboard
activity.</p>

<p>-K Like -k but also ignore Modifier+Key combos.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES DISPLAY Specifies the X server to
contact.</p>

<p>CAVEATS It doesnt make much sense to connect to a remote
X server, because the daemon will then monitor the remote
server for keyboard activity, but will disable the touchpad
on the local machine.</p>
