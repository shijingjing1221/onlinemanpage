<p>NAME intel - Intel integrated graphics chipsets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;intel&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION intel is an Xorg driver for Intel integrated
graphics chipsets. The driver supports depths 8, 15, 16 and
24. All visual types are sup- ported in depth 8. For the
i810/i815 other depths support the True- Color and
DirectColor visuals. For the i830M and later, only the True-
Color visual is supported for depths greater than 8. The
driver sup- ports hardware accelerated 3D via the Direct
Rendering Infrastructure (DRI), but only in depth 16 for the
i810/i815 and depths 16 and 24 for the 830M and later.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE intel supports the i810, i810-DC100,
i810e, i815, i830M, 845G, 852GM, 855GM, 865G, 915G, 915GM,
945G, 945GM, 965G, 965Q, 946GZ, 965GM, 945GME, G33, Q33, and
Q35 chipsets.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5x) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The Intel 8xx and 9xx families of integrated graphics
chipsets have a unified memory architecture and uses system
memory for video ram. For the i810 and i815 family of
chipset, operating system support for allo- cating system
memory for video use is required in order to use this
driver. For the 830M and later, this is required in order
for the driver to use more video ram than has been
pre-allocated at boot time by the BIOS. This is usually
achieved with an &quot;agpgart&quot; or &quot;agp&quot; ker-
nel driver. Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and Solaris
have such kernel drivers available.</p>

<p>By default, the i810 will use 8 megabytes of system
memory for graph- ics. For the 830M and later, the driver
will automatically size its memory allocation according to
the features it will support. The Vide- oRam option, which
in the past had been necessary to allow more than some small
amount of memory to be allocated, is now ignored.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable acceleration. Default: acceleration is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable software cursor. Default: software cursor is
disable and a hardware cursor is used for configurations
where the hardware cursor is available.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ColorKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
sets the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay key.
Default: undefined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CacheLines&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
allows the user to change the amount of graphics memory used
for 2D acceleration and video when XAA acceleration is
enabled. Decreasing this amount leaves more for 3D textures.
Increasing it can improve 2D performance at the expense of
3D performance. Default: depends on the resolution, depth,
and available video memory. The driver attempts to allocate
space for at 3 screenfuls of pixmaps plus an HD-sized XV
video. The default used for a specific configuration can be
found by exam- ining the Xorg log file.</p>

<p>Option &quot;FramebufferCompression&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; This option controls whether the
framebuffer compression feature is enabled. If possible, the
front buffer will be allocated in a tiled format and
compressed periodically to save memory band- width and
power. This option is only available on mobile chipsets.
Default: enabled on supported configurations.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Tiling&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
option controls whether memory buffers are allocated in
tiled mode. In many cases (especially for complex
rendering), tiling can improve performance. Default:
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DRI&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable or
enable DRI support. Default: DRI is enabled for con-
figurations where it is supported.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported for the i810
and i815 chipsets:</p>

<p>Option &quot;DDC&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable or
enable DDC support. Default: enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Dac6Bit&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable or
disable 6-bits per RGB for 8-bit modes. Default: 8-bits per
RGB for 8-bit modes.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XvMCSurfaces&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
option enables XvMC. The integer parameter specifies the
number of surfaces to use. Valid values are 6 and 7.
Default: XvMC is disabled.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported for the 830M
and later chipsets:</p>

<p>Option &quot;VideoKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This is
the same as the &quot;ColorKey&quot; option described above.
It is provided for compatibility with most other
drivers.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XVideo&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable or
enable XVideo support. Default: XVideo is enabled for
configurations where it is supported.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Legacy3D&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
support for the legacy i915_dri.so 3D driver. This will,
among other things, make the 2D driver tell libGL to load
the 3D driver i915_dri.so instead of the newer
i915tex_dri.so. This option is only used for chipsets in the
range i830-i945. Default for i830-i945 series: Enabled.
Default for i810: The option is not used. Default for i965:
The option is always true.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AperTexSize&quot; &quot;integer&quot; Give
the size in kiB of the AGP aperture area that is reserved
for the DRM memory manager present in i915 drm from version
1.7.0 and upwards, and that is used with the 3D driver in
Mesa from version 6.5.2 and upwards. If the size is set too
high to make room for pre-allocated VideoRam, the driver
will try to reduce it automatically. If you use only older
Mesa or DRM versions, you may set this value to zero, and
activate the legacy texture pool (see Option
&quot;Legacy3D&quot; ). If you run 3D pro- grams with large
texture memory requirements, you might gain some performance
by increasing this value. Default: 32768.</p>

<p>Option &quot;PageFlip&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
support for page flipping. This should improve 3D perfor-
mance at the potential cost of worse performance with mixed
2D/3D. Also note that this gives no benefit without
correspond- ing support in the Mesa 3D driver and may not
give the full ben- efit without triple buffering (see Option
&quot;TripleBuffer&quot; ). Default for i810: The option is
not used. Default for i830 and above: Disabled (This option
is currently unstable).</p>

<p>Option &quot;TripleBuffer&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable support for triple buffering. This should improve 3D
per- formance at the potential cost of worse performance
with mixed 2D/3D. Also note that this gives no benefit
without correspond- ing support in the Mesa 3D driver and
may not give any benefit without page flipping either (see
Option &quot;PageFlip&quot; ). Default for i810: The option
is not used. Default for i830 and above: Disabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;string&quot; Choose
acceleration architecture, either &quot;XAA&quot; or
&quot;EXA&quot;. XAA is the old XFree86 based acceleration
architecture. EXA is a newer and simpler acceleration
architecture designed to better accel- erate the X Render
extension. Default: &quot;EXA&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ModeDebug&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
printing of additional debugging information about mode-
setting to the server log.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ForceEnablePipeA&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Force the driver to leave pipe A enabled. May be necessary
in configurations where the BIOS accesses pipe registers
during display hotswitch or lid close, causing a crash. If
you find that your platform needs this option, please file a
bug against xf86-video-intel at http://bugs.freedesktop.org
which includes the output of lspci -v and lspci -vn.</p>

<p>OUTPUT CONFIGURATION On 830M and better chipsets, the
driver supports runtime configuration of detected outputs.
You can use the xrandr tool to control outputs on the
command line. Each output listed below may have one or more
prop- erties associated with it (like a binary EDID block if
one is found). Some outputs have unique properties which are
described below.</p>

<p>VGA VGA output port (typically exposed via an HD15
connector).</p>

<p>LVDS Low Voltage Differential Signalling output
(typically a laptop LCD panel). Available properties:</p>

<p>BACKLIGHT - current backlight level (adjustable)</p>

<p>By adjusting the BACKLIGHT property, the brightness on
the LVDS output can be adjusted. In some cases, this
property may be unavailable (for example if your platform
uses an external microcontroller to control the
backlight).</p>

<p>BACKLIGHT_CONTROL - method used to control backlight</p>

<p>The driver will attempt to automatically detect the
backlight control method for your platform. If this fails
however, you can select another method which may allow you
to control your backlight. Avail- able methods include:</p>

<p>NATIVE</p>

<p>Intel chipsets include backlight control registers,
which on some plat- forms may be wired to control the
backlight directly. This method uses those registers.</p>

<p>LEGACY</p>

<p>The legacy backlight control registers exist in PCI
configuration space, and have fewer available backlight
levels than the native regis- ters. However, some platforms
are wired this way and so need to use this method.</p>

<p>COMBO</p>

<p>This method attempts to use the native registers where
possible, resorting to the legacy, configuration space
registers only to enable the backlight if needed. On
platforms that have both wired this can be a good choice as
it allows the fine grained backlight control of the native
interface.</p>

<p>KERNEL</p>

<p>On some system, the kernel may provide a backlight
control driver. In that case, using the kernel interfaces is
preferable, as the same driver may respond to hotkey events
or external APIs.</p>

<p>TV Integrated TV output. Available properties
include:</p>

<p>BOTTOM, RIGHT, TOP, LEFT - margins</p>

<p>Adjusting these properties allows you to control the
placement of your TV output buffer on the screen.</p>

<p>TV_FORMAT - output standard</p>

<p>This property allows you to control the output standard
used on your TV output port. You can select between NTSC-M,
NTSC-443, NTSC-J, PAL-M, PAL-N, and PAL.</p>

<p>TMDS-1 First DVI SDVO output</p>

<p>TMDS-2 Second DVI SDVO output</p>

<p>SDVO and DVO TV outputs are not supported by the driver
at this time.</p>

<p>See xorg.conf(5x) for information on associating Monitor
sections with these outputs for configuration. Associating
Monitor sections with each output can be helpful if you need
to ignore a specific output, for example, or statically
configure an extended desktop monitor layout.</p>
