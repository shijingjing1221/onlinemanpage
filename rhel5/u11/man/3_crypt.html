<p>CRYPT(3) Library functions CRYPT(3)</p>

<p>NAME crypt - password and data encryption</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _XOPEN_SOURCE #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *crypt(const char *key, const char *salt);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION crypt() is the password encryption function.
It is based on the Data Encryption Standard algorithm with
variations intended (among other things) to discourage use
of hardware implementations of a key search.</p>

<p>key is a users typed password.</p>

<p>salt is a two-character string chosen from the set
[azAZ0 9./]. This string is used to perturb the algorithm in
one of 4096 different ways.</p>

<p>By taking the lowest 7 bits of each of the first eight
characters of the key, a 56-bit key is obtained. This 56-bit
key is used to encrypt repeatedly a constant string (usually
a string consisting of all zeros). The returned value points
to the encrypted password, a series of 13 printable ASCII
characters (the first two characters represent the salt
itself). The return value points to static data whose
content is overwritten by each call.</p>

<p>Warning: The key space consists of 2**56 equal 7.2e16
possible values. Exhaustive searches of this key space are
possible using massively par- allel computers. Software,
such as crack(1), is available which will search the portion
of this key space that is generally used by humans for
passwords. Hence, password selection should, at minimum,
avoid common words and names. The use of a passwd(1) program
that checks for crackable passwords during the selection
process is recommended.</p>

<p>The DES algorithm itself has a few quirks which make the
use of the crypt(3) interface a very poor choice for
anything other than password authentication. If you are
planning on using the crypt(3) interface for a cryptography
project, dont do it: get a good book on encryption and one
of the widely available DES libraries.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE A pointer to the encrypted password is
returned. On error, NULL is returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS ENOSYS The crypt() function was not implemented,
probably because of U.S.A. export restrictions.</p>

<p>GNU EXTENSION The glibc2 version of this function has
the following additional fea- tures. If salt is a character
string starting with the three charac- ters &quot;$1$&quot;
followed by at most eight characters, and optionally termi-
nated by &quot;$&quot;, then instead of using the DES
machine, the glibc crypt function uses an MD5-based
algorithm, and outputs up to 34 bytes, namely
&quot;$1$&lt;string&gt;$&quot;, where
&quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot; stands for the up to 8 charac-
ters following &quot;$1$&quot; in the salt, followed by 22
bytes chosen from the set [a zA Z0 9./]. The entire key is
significant here (instead of only the first 8 bytes).</p>

<p>Programs using this function must be linked with
-lcrypt.</p>
