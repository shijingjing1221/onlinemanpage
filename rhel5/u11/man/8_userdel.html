<p>USERDEL(8) System Management Commands USERDEL(8)</p>

<p>NAME userdel - delete a user account and related
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS userdel [options] LOGIN</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The userdel command modifies the system
account files, deleting all entries that refer to
login_name. The named user must exist.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options which apply to the userdel command
are:</p>

<p>-f, --force This option forces the removal of the user,
even if she is still logged in. It also forces userdel to
remove the users home directory or her mail spool, even if
another user uses the same home directory or if the mail
spool is not owned by the specified user. If USERGROUPS_ENAB
is defined to yes in /etc/login.defs and if a group exists
with the same name as the deleted user, then this group will
be removed, even if it is still the primary group of another
user.</p>

<p>Note: This option is dangerous and may leave your system
in an inconsistent state.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display help message and exit.</p>

<p>-r, --remove Files in the users home directory will be
removed along with the home directory itself and the users
mail spool. Files located in other file systems will have to
be searched for and deleted manually.</p>

<p>The mail spool is defined by the MAIL_DIR variable in
the login.defs file.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/login.defs Shadow password suite configuration.</p>

<p>/etc/passwd User account information.</p>

<p>/etc/shadow Secure user account information.</p>

<p>EXIT VALUES The userdel command exits with the following
values:</p>

<p>0 success</p>

<p>1 cant update password file</p>

<p>2 invalid command syntax</p>

<p>6 specified user doesnt exist</p>

<p>8 user currently logged in</p>

<p>10 cant update group file</p>

<p>12 cant remove home directory</p>

<p>CAVEATS userdel will not allow you to remove an account
if the user is currently logged in. You must kill any
running processes which belong to an account that you are
deleting.</p>

<p>You may not remove any NIS attributes on a NIS client.
This must be performed on the NIS server.</p>

<p>If USERGROUPS_ENAB is defined to yes in /etc/login.defs,
userdel will delete the group with the same name as the
user. To avoid inconsistencies in the passwd and group
databases, userdel will check that this group is not used as
a primary group for another user, and will just warn without
deleting the user otherwise. The -f option can force the
deletion of this group.</p>
