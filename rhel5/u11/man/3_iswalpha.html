<p>NAME iswalpha - test for alphabetic wide character</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;</p>

<p>int iswalpha(wint_t wc);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The iswalpha() function is the
wide-character equivalent of the isal- pha() function. It
tests whether wc is a wide character belonging to the wide
character class &quot;alpha&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide character class &quot;alpha&quot; is a subclass
of the wide character class &quot;alnum&quot;, and therefore
also a subclass of the wide character class
&quot;graph&quot; and of the wide character class
&quot;print&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a subclass of the wide character class
&quot;print&quot;, the wide charac- ter class
&quot;alpha&quot; is disjoint from the wide character class
&quot;cntrl&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a subclass of the wide character class
&quot;graph&quot;, the wide charac- ter class
&quot;alpha&quot; is disjoint from the wide character class
&quot;space&quot; and its subclass &quot;blank&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a subclass of the wide character class
&quot;alnum&quot;, the wide charac- ter class
&quot;alpha&quot; is disjoint from the wide character class
&quot;punct&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide character class &quot;alpha&quot; is disjoint
from the wide character class &quot;digit&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide character class &quot;alpha&quot; contains the
wide character classes &quot;upper&quot; and
&quot;lower&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide character class &quot;alpha&quot; always
contains at least the letters A to Z and a to z.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The iswalpha() function returns non-zero if
wc is a wide character belonging to the wide character class
&quot;alpha&quot;. Otherwise it returns zero.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO isalpha(3), iswctype(3)</p>

<p>NOTES The behaviour of iswalpha() depends on the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.</p>
