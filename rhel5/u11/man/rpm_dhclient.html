<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>NAME dhclient - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
Client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dhclient [ -p port ] [ -d ] [ -e VAR=value ] [
-q ] [ -1 ] [ -r ] [ -lf lease-file ] [ -pf pid-file ] [ -cf
config-file ] [ -sf script-file ] [ -s server ] [ -g relay ]

...ifN ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Client,
dhclient, provides a means for configuring one or more
network interfaces using the Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol, BOOTP protocol, or if these protocols fail, by
statically assigning an address.</p>

<p>OPERATION The DHCP protocol allows a host to contact a
central server which main- tains a list of IP addresses
which may be assigned on one or more sub- nets. A DHCP
client may request an address from this pool, and then use
it on a temporary basis for communication on network. The
DHCP protocol also provides a mechanism whereby a client can
learn important details about the network to which it is
attached, such as the location of a default router, the
location of a name server, and so on.</p>

<p>On startup, dhclient reads the dhclient.conf for
configuration instruc- tions. It then gets a list of all the
network interfaces that are configured in the current
system. For each interface, it attempts to configure the
interface using the DHCP protocol.</p>

<p>In order to keep track of leases across system reboots
and server restarts, dhclient keeps a list of leases it has
been assigned in the dhclient.leases(5) file. On startup,
after reading the dhclient.conf file, dhclient reads the
dhclient.leases file to refresh its memory about what leases
it has been assigned.</p>

<p>When a new lease is acquired, it is appended to the end
of the dhclient.leases file. In order to prevent the file
from becoming arbitrarily large, from time to time dhclient
creates a new dhclient.leases file from its in-core lease
database. The old version of the dhclient.leases file is
retained under the name dhclient.leases~ until the next time
dhclient rewrites the database.</p>

<p>Old leases are kept around in case the DHCP server is
unavailable when dhclient is first invoked (generally during
the initial system boot process). In that event, old leases
from the dhclient.leases file which have not yet expired are
tested, and if they are determined to be valid, they are
used until either they expire or the DHCP server becomes
available.</p>

<p>A mobile host which may sometimes need to access a
network on which no DHCP server exists may be preloaded with
a lease for a fixed address on that network. When all
attempts to contact a DHCP server have failed, dhclient will
try to validate the static lease, and if it succeeds, will
use that lease until it is restarted.</p>

<p>A mobile host may also travel to some networks on which
DHCP is not available but BOOTP is. In that case, it may be
advantageous to arrange with the network administrator for
an entry on the BOOTP database, so that the host can boot
quickly on that network rather than cycling through the list
of old leases.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE The names of the network interfaces that
dhclient should attempt to configure may be specified on the
command line. If no interface names are specified on the
command line dhclient will normally identify all network
interfaces, eliminating non-broadcast interfaces if
possible, and attempt to configure each interface.</p>

<p>It is also possible to specify interfaces by name in the
dhclient.conf(5) file. If interfaces are specified in this
way, then the client will only configure interfaces that are
either specified in the configuration file or on the command
line, and will ignore all other interfaces.</p>

<p>If the DHCP client should listen and transmit on a port
other than the standard (port 68), the -p flag may used. It
should be followed by the udp port number that dhclient
should use. This is mostly useful for debugging purposes. If
a different port is specified for the client to listen on
and transmit on, the client will also use a different desti-
nation port - one greater than the specified destination
port.</p>

<p>The DHCP client normally transmits any protocol messages
it sends before acquiring an IP address to, 255.255.255.255,
the IP limited broadcast address. For debugging purposes, it
may be useful to have the server transmit these messages to
some other address. This can be specified with the -s flag,
followed by the IP address or domain name of the
destination.</p>

<p>For testing purposes, the giaddr field of all packets
that the client sends can be set using the -g flag, followed
by the IP address to send. This is only useful for testing,
and should not be expected to work in any consistent or
useful way.</p>

<p>The DHCP client will normally run in the foreground
until it has con- figured an interface, and then will revert
to running in the back- ground. To run force dhclient to
always run as a foreground process, the -d flag should be
specified. This is useful when running the client under a
debugger, or when running it out of inittab on System V
systems.</p>

<p>The dhclient daemon creates its own environment when
executing the dhclient-script to do the grunt work of
interface configuration. To define extra environment
variables and their values, use the -e flag, followed by the
environment variable name and value assignment, just as one
would assign a variable in a shell. Eg: -e IF_METRIC=1</p>

<p>The client normally prints a startup message and
displays the protocol sequence to the standard error
descriptor until it has acquired an address, and then only
logs messages using the syslog (3) facility. The -q flag
prevents any messages other than errors from being printed
to the standard error descriptor.</p>

<p>The client normally doesnt release the current lease as
it is not required by the DHCP protocol. Some cable ISPs
require their clients to notify the server if they wish to
release an assigned IP address. The -r flag explicitly
releases the current lease, and once the lease has been
released, the client exits.</p>

<p>The -1 flag cause dhclient to try once to get a lease.
If it fails, dhclient exits with exit code two.</p>

<p>The DHCP client normally gets its configuration
information from /etc/dhclient.conf, its lease database from
/var/lib/dhcpd/dhclient.leases, stores its process ID in a
file called /var/run/dhclient.pid, and configures the
network interface using /sbin/dhclient-script To specify
different names and/or locations for these files, use the
-cf, -lf, -pf and -sf flags, respectively, followed by the
name of the file. This can be particularly useful if, for
example, /var/lib/dhcpd or /var/run has not yet been mounted
when the DHCP client is started.</p>

<p>The DHCP client normally exits if it isnt able to
identify any network interfaces to configure. On laptop
computers and other computers with hot-swappable I/O buses,
it is possible that a broadcast interface may be added after
system startup. The -w flag can be used to cause the client
not to exit when it doesn t find any such interfaces. The
omshell (1) program can then be used to notify the client
when a net- work interface has been added or removed, so
that the client can attempt to configure an IP address on
that interface.</p>

<p>The DHCP client can be directed not to attempt to
configure any inter- faces using the -n flag. This is most
likely to be useful in combina- tion with the -w flag.</p>

<p>The client can also be instructed to become a daemon
immediately, rather than waiting until it has acquired an IP
address. This can be done by supplying the -nw flag.</p>

<p>The -x argument enables extended option information to
be created in the -s dhclient-script environment, which
would allow applications run- ning in that environment to
handle options they do not know about in advance - this is a
Red Hat extension to support dhcdbd and NetworkMan-
ager.</p>

<p>The -I &lt;id&gt; argument allows you to specify the
dhcp-client-identifier string, &lt;id&gt;, to be sent to the
dhcp server on the command line. It is equivalent to the top
level dhclient.conf statement: send dhcp-client-identifier
&quot;&lt;id&gt;&quot;; The -I &lt;id&gt; command line
option will override any top level dhclient.conf send
dhcp-client-identifier statement, but more specific
per-inter- face interface &quot;X&quot; { send
dhcp-client-identifier...; } statements in dhclient.conf
will override the -I &lt;id&gt; command line option for
inter- face &quot;X&quot;. This option is provided as a Red
Hat extension to enable dhclient to work on IBM zSeries z/OS
Linux guests.</p>

<p>The -B option instructs dhclient to set the bootp
broadcast flag in request packets, so that servers will
always broadcast replies. This is equivalent to specifying
the bootp-broadcast-always option in dhclient.conf, and has
the same effect as specifying always-broadcast in the
servers dhcpd.conf. This option is provided as a Red Hat
extension to enable dhclient to work on IBM zSeries z/OS
Linux guests.</p>

<p>The -H &lt;host-name&gt; option allows you to specify
the DHCP host-name option to send to the server on the
dhclient command line. It is equiv- alent to the top level
dhclient.conf statement: send host-name
&quot;&lt;host-name&gt;&quot;; The -H &lt;host-name&gt;
option will override any top level dhclient.conf send
host-name statement, but more specific per-interface
interface &quot;X&quot; { send host-name...; statements in
dhclient.conf will override the -H &lt;host-name&gt; command
line option for interface &quot;X&quot;. The host-name
option only specifies the clients host name prefix, to which
the server will append the ddns-domainname or domain-name
options, if any, to derive the fully qualified domain name
of the client host. The -H &lt;host-name&gt; option cannot
be used with the -F &lt;fqdn.fqdn&gt; option. Only one -H
&lt;host-name&gt; option may be specified. The -H
&lt;host-name&gt; option is provided as a Red Hat extension
to simplify con- figuration of clients of DHCP servers that
require the host-name option to be sent (eg. some modern
cable modems), and for dynamic DNS updates (DDNS).</p>

<p>The -F &lt;fqdn.fqdn&gt; option allows you to specify
the DHCP fqdn.fqdn option to send to the server on the
dhclient command line. It is equiv- alent to the top level
dhclient.conf statement: send fqdn.fqdn
&quot;&lt;domain-name&gt;&quot;; The -F &lt;fqdn.fqdn&gt;
option will override any top level dhclient.conf send
fqdn.fqdn statement, but more specific per-interface
interface &quot;X&quot; { send fqdn.fqdn...; statements in
dhclient.conf will override the -F &lt;fqdn.fqdn&gt; command
line option for interface &quot;X&quot;. This option cannot
be used with the -H &lt;host-name&gt; option. The DHCP
fqdn.fqdn option must specify the complete domain name of
the client host, which the server may use for dynamic DNS
updates. Only one -F &lt;fqdn.fqdn&gt; option may be
specified. The -F &lt;fqdn.fqdn&gt; option is pro- vided as
a Red Hat extension to simplify configuration of DDNS.</p>

<p>The -T &lt;timeout&gt; option allows you to specify the
time after which the dhclient will decide that no DHCP
servers can be contacted when no responses have been
received. It is equivalent to the timeout &lt;integer&gt;;
dhclient.conf statement, and will override any such
statements in dhclient.conf. This option is provided as a
Red Hat extension.</p>

<p>The -V &lt;vendor-class-identifier&gt; option allows you
to specify the DHCP vendor-class-identifier option to send
to the server on the dhclient command line. It is equivalent
to the top level dhclient.conf state- ment: send
vendor-class-identifier
&quot;&lt;vendor-class-identifier&gt;&quot;; The -V
&lt;vendor-class-identifier&gt; option will override any top
level dhclient.conf send vendor-class-identifier statement,
but more specific per-inter- face interface &quot;X&quot; {
send vendor-class-identifier...; statements in dhclient.conf
will override the -V &lt;vendor-class-identifier&gt; command
line option for interface &quot;X&quot;. The -V
&lt;vendor-class-identifier&gt; option is provided as a Red
Hat extension to simplify configuration of clients of DHCP
servers that require the vendor-class-identifier option to
be sent.</p>

<p>The -R &lt;request option list&gt; option allows you to
specify the list of options the client is to request from
the server on the dhclient com- mand line. The option list
must be a single string, consisting of option names
separated by at least one comma and optional space charac-
ters. The default option list is : subnet-mask,
broadcast-address, time-offset, routers, domain-name,
domain-name-servers, host-name, nis-domain, nis-servers,
ntp-servers, interface-mtu You can specify a different list
of options to request with the -R &lt;option list&gt;
argument. This is equivalent to the dhclient.conf state-
ment: request &lt;option list&gt; ; The -R argument is
provided as a Red Hat extension to ISC dhclient to
facilitate requesting a list of options from the server
different to the default.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The syntax of the dhclient.conf(5) file is
discussed separately.</p>

<p>OMAPI The DHCP client provides some ability to control
it while it is run- ning, without stopping it. This
capability is provided using OMAPI, an API for manipulating
remote objects. OMAPI clients connect to the client using
TCP/IP, authenticate, and can then examine the clients
current status and make changes to it.</p>

<p>Rather than implementing the underlying OMAPI protocol
directly, user programs should use the dhcpctl API or OMAPI
itself. Dhcpctl is a wrapper that handles some of the
housekeeping chores that OMAPI does not do automatically.
Dhcpctl and OMAPI are documented in dhcpctl(3) and omapi(3).
Most things youd want to do with the client can be done
directly using the omshell(1) command, rather than having to
write a special program.</p>

<p>THE CONTROL OBJECT The control object allows you to shut
the client down, releasing all leases that it holds and
deleting any DNS records it may have added. It also allows
you to pause the client - this unconfigures any inter- faces
the client is using. You can then restart it, which causes
it to reconfigure those interfaces. You would normally pause
the client prior to going into hibernation or sleep on a
laptop computer. You would then resume it after the power
comes back. This allows PC cards to be shut down while the
computer is hibernating or sleeping, and then reinitialized
to their previous state once the computer comes out of
hibernation or sleep.</p>

<p>The control object has one attribute - the state
attribute. To shut the client down, set its state attribute
to 2. It will automatically do a DHCPRELEASE. To pause it,
set its state attribute to 3. To resume it, set its state
attribute to 4.</p>

<p>AUTHOR dhclient(8) has been written for Internet Systems
Consortium by Ted Lemon in cooperation with Vixie
Enterprises. To learn more about Internet Systems
Consortium, see http://www.isc.org To learn more about Vixie

<p>This client was substantially modified and enhanced by
Elliot Poger for use on Linux while he was working on the
MosquitoNet project at Stan- ford.</p>

<p>The current version owes much to Elliot s Linux
enhancements, but was substantially reorganized and
partially rewritten by Ted Lemon so as to use the same
networking framework that the Internet Systems Consortium
DHCP server uses. Much system-specific configuration code
was moved into a shell script so that as support for more
operating systems is added, it will not be necessary to port
and maintain system-specific configuration code to these
operating systems - instead, the shell script can invoke the
native tools to accomplish the same purpose.</p>
