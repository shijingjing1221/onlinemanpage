<p>GETLIST(1) GETLIST(1)</p>

<p>NAME getlist - get a list from an NNTP server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS getlist [ -A ] [ -h host ] [ list [ pattern [
types ] ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getlist program obtains a list from an
NNTP server and sends it to standard output.</p>

<p>The list may be one of active, active.times,
distributions, or news- groups. These values request the
active, active.times, &lt;pathetc in
inn.conf&gt;/distributions. or &lt;pathdb in
inn.conf&gt;/news- groups files, respectively.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A If the -A flag is used, then the program
tries to authenti- cate as per passwd.nntp before issuing
LIST command.</p>

<p>-h If the -h flag is used, then the program connects to
the server on the specified host. The default is to connect
to the server specified in the inn.conf file.</p>

<p>If the list parameter is active, then the pattern and
types parameters may be used to limit the output. When
pattern is used, only active lines with groups that match
according to uwildmat(3) are printed. When types is also
given, only active lines that have a fourth field starting
with a character found in types are printed.</p>

<p>For example, the following command will obtain the
one-line descrip- tions of all newsgroups found on UUNET:
getlist -h news.uu.net newsgroups</p>

<p>The following line lists all groups where local postings
are permitted, are moderated or aliased: getlist active *
ym=</p>

<p>Note that the listing files other than the active file
is a common extension to the NNTP protocol and may not be
available on all servers.</p>
