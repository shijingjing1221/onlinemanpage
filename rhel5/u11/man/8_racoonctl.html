<p>RACOONCTL(8) BSD System Manager s Manual
RACOONCTL(8)</p>

<p>NAME racoonctl - racoon administrative control tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS racoonctl reload-config racoonctl show-schedule
racoonctl [-l [-l]] show-sa [isakmp|esp|ah|ipsec] racoonctl
flush-sa [isakmp|esp|ah|ipsec] racoonctl delete-sa saopts
racoonctl establish-sa [-u identity] saopts racoonctl
vpn-connect [-u -identity] vpn_gateway racoonctl
vpn-disconnect vpn_gateway racoonctl show-event [-l]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION racoonctl is used to control racoon(8)
operation, if ipsec-tools was con- figured with adminport
support. Communication between racoonctl and racoon(8) is
done through a UNIX socket. By changing the default mode and
ownership of the socket, you can allow non-root users to
alter racoon(8) behavior, so do that with caution.</p>

<p>The following commands are available:</p>

<p>reload-config This should cause racoon(8) to reload its
configuration file. This seems completely broken at the time
this man page is writ- ten.</p>

<p>show-schedule Unknown command.</p>

<p>show-sa [isakmp|esp|ah|ipsec] Dump the SA: All the SAs
if no SA class is provided, or either ISAKMP SAs, IPsec ESP
SAs, IPsec AH SAs, or all IPsec SAs. Use -l to increase
verbosity.</p>

<p>flush-sa [isakmp|esp|ah|ipsec] is used to flush all SAs
if no SA class is provided, or a class of SAs, either ISAKMP
SAs, IPsec ESP SAs, IPsec AH SAs, or all IPsec SAs.</p>

<p>establish-sa [-u username] saopts Establish an SA,
either an ISAKMP SA, IPsec ESP SA, or IPsec AH SA. The
optional -u username can be used when establishing an ISAKMP
SA while hybrid auth is in use. racoonctl will prompt you
for the password associated with username and these
credentials will be used in the Xauth exchange.</p>

<p>saopts has the following format:</p>

<p>isakmp {inet|inet6} src dst</p>

<p>{esp|ah} {inet|inet6} src/prefixlen/port
dst/prefixlen/port {icmp|tcp|udp|any}</p>

<p>vpn-connect [-u username] vpn_gateway This is a
particular case of the previous command. It will establish
an ISAKMP SA with vpn_gateway.</p>

<p>delete-sa saopts Delete an SA, either an ISAKMP SA,
IPsec ESP SA, or IPsec AH SA.</p>

<p>vpn-disconnect vpn_gateway This is a particular case of
the previous command. It will kill all SAs associated with
vpn_gateway.</p>

<p>show-event [-l] Dump all events reported by racoon(8),
then quit. The -l flag causes racoonctl to not stop once all
the events have been read, but rather to loop awaiting and
reporting new events.</p>

<p>Command shortcuts are available: rc reload-config ss
show-sa sc show-schedule fs flush-sa ds delete-sa es
establish-sa vc vpn-connect vd vpn-disconnect se
show-event</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES The command should exit with 0 on success,
and non-zero on errors.</p>

<p>FILES /var/racoon/racoon.sock or /var/run/racoon.sock
racoon(8) control socket.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ipsec(4), racoon(8)</p>

<p>HISTORY Once was kmpstat in the KAME project. It turned
into racoonctl but remained undocumented for a while.
