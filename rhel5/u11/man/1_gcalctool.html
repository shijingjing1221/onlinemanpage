<p>NAME gcalctool - a desktop calculator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gcalctool [ -D ] [ -E ] [ -a accuracy ] [ -v ]
[ -? ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gcalctool is a desktop calculator. It has
been designed to be used with either the mouse or the
keyboard. It is visually similar to a lot of hand-held
calculators. There are basic, financial and scientific
modes. Some of the calculator keys have menu marks. This
indicates that there is a menu associated with that key.
Each key is discussed in more detail below.</p>

<p>One of the most important things to remember about
gcalctool is that calculations are performed from left to
right, with no arithmetic precedence. If you need arithmetic
precedence, then you should use parentheses (see below).</p>

<p>Internal arithmetic is now done with multi-precision
floating point numbers. Accuracy can be adjusted from zero
to nine numeric places in fixed notation, but numbers can be
displayed in engineering and scien- tific notation as well.
There is also an option to show or remove trailing zeroes
after the numeric point. The calculator reverts to
scientific notation when the number is larger than the
display would allow in fixed notation. In the scientific
mode, the base of operation can be changed between binary,
octal, decimal and hexadecimal. Numbers are initially
displayed in fixed notation to nine numeric places, with
trailing zeroes removed, in the decimal base.</p>

<p>You can use the Copy and Paste functions in conjunction
with the numeric display to store or retrieve characters
from the clipboard. You can also remove the last digit
entered, completely clear the displayed entry and totally
reset the calculator.</p>

<p>There are ten memory registers. Numbers can be stored or
retrieved in these locations, and arithmetic can be
performed upon register con- tents.</p>

<p>On startup, gcalctool will use several configuration
resources stored in a gconf database. These are listed in
detail in the resources sec- tion of these manual pages. Any
constants or function definitions that the user defines are
also stored in this database.</p>

<p>Context sensitive help is also available. Control-F1
toggles whether tooltip help is displayed for the item which
currently has focus.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -D Turning on gcalctool debugging.</p>

<p>-E Turning on debugging in the multiple precision
arithmetic pack- age.</p>

<p>-a accuracy Initial number of digits displayed after the
numeric point. This value must be in the range 0 to 9. The
default is nine numeric places.</p>

<p>-v Show the version number and the usage message of this
release of the gcalctool program.</p>

<p>-? Show the version number and the usage message of this
release of the gcalctool program. Note that the ? character
must be escaped if using csh(1).</p>

describes the calculator keys present in the main gcalctool
window. gcalctool has three modes; basic, financial and sci-
entific. The keys associated with each of these modes are
described in separate sections below.</p>

<p>Keyboard equivalents appear in the square brackets. Note
that Alt fol- lowed by a letter indicates that the Alt key
and this key should be pressed together.</p>

<p>BASIC MODE Numerical Keys [ 0-9 . = &lt;Return&gt; ].
Enter a digit (decimal digits 0-9) into the display. The .
character acts as the numeric point, and = (or Return) is
used to complete numerical entry.</p>

<p>Upto forty digits may be entered.</p>

<p>Arithmetical Operations [ + - x * / ]. Perform an
arithmetical operation using the previous entry and the next
entry as operands. Addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division are denoted by the characters +, -, * and /
respectively (x is also synonymous with multiplication).</p>

<p>Number Manipulation Operators. Int [ i ] Return the
integer portion of the current entry. Frac [ : ] Return the
fractional portion of the current entry. Abs [ u ] Return
the absolute value of the current entry. +/- [ c ] Change
the arithmetic sign of the current entry. 1/x [ r ] Return
the value of 1 divided by the current entry. x^2 [ @ ]
Return the square of the current entry. % [ % ] Perform a
percentage calculation using the last entry and the next
entry. Sqrt [ s ] Perform a square root operation on the
current entry.</p>

<p>Menu Operations. Each of these operations has a popup
menu associated with it. It is also possible to use just the
keyboard to achieve the same results. The first keyboard
value selects the menu operation; the second key- board
character selects the new value for this operation. Unlike
the menu facility available with the mouse, there is no
visual feedback on what choices are available to you, so the
user has to know what item they wish to select. Acc [ a ]
Set the display accuracy. Between 0 and 9 [ 0-9 ]
significant digits can be displayed. Rcl [ R ] Retrieve
memory register value. There are ten memory registers [ 0-9
]. Sto [ S ] Store value in memory register. There are ten
memory registers [ 0-9 ]. The register number may be pre-
ceded by an arithmetic operation (addition, subtrac- tion,
multiplication or division), in which case the specified
operation is carried out between the dis- played entry and
the value currently in the selected memory register, and the
result is placed in the mem- ory register. Exch [ X ]
Exchange the current display with the contents of a memory
register. There are ten memory registers [ 0-9 ]. Other
Operations. Clr [ Delete ] Clear the display, and reset the
calculator. CE [ Control-Back Space or Escape ] Clear the
display. Bksp [ Back Space ] Remove the rightmost character
of the current entry, and recalculate the displayed
value.</p>

<p>FINANCIAL MODE An example of how to use each of these
financial calculations, is available via the tooltip help
facility. Ctrm [ m ] Compounding term. Computes the number
of compounding periods it will take an investment of present
value pv to grow to a future value of fv, earning a fixed
interest rate int per compounding period. Memory register
usage: Register 0 int (periodic interest rate). Register 1
fv (future value). Register 2 pv (present value).</p>

<p>Ddb [ d ] Double-declining depreciation. Computes the
deprecia- tion allowance on an asset for a specified period
of time, using the double-declining balance method. Memory
register usage: Register 0 cost (amount paid for asset).
Register 1 salvage (value of asset at end of life). Register
2 life (useful life of the asset). Register 3 period (time
period for deprecia- tion allowance).</p>

<p>Fv [ v ] Future value. This calculation determines the
future value of an investment. It computes the future value
based on a series of equal payments, each of amount pmt,
earning periodic interest rate int, over the number of
payment periods in term. Memory register usage: Register 0
pmt (periodic payment). Register 1 int (periodic interest
rate). Register 2 n (number of periods).</p>

<p>Pmt [ P ] Periodic payment. Computes the amount of the
periodic payment of a loan. Most installment loans are com-
puted like ordinary annuities, in that payments are made at
the end of each payment period. Memory register usage:
Register 0 prin (principal). Register 1 int (periodic
interest rate). Register 2 n (term).</p>

<p>Pv [ p ] Present value. Determines the present value of
an investment. It computes the present value based on a
series of equal payments, each of amount pmt, dis- counted
at periodic interest rate int, over the num- ber of periods
in term. Memory register usage: Register 0 pmt (periodic
payment). Register 1 int (periodic interest rate). Register
2 n (term).</p>

<p>Rate [ T ] Periodic interest rate. Returns the periodic
interest necessary for a present value of pv to grow to a
future value of fv over the number of compounding periods in
term. Memory register usage: Register 0 fv (future value).
Register 1 pv (present value). Register 2 n (term).</p>

<p>Sln [ l ] Straight-line depreciation. Computes the
straight- line depreciation of an asset for one period. The
straight-line method of depreciation divides the depreciable
cost (cost - salvage) evenly over the useful life of an
asset. The useful life is the num- ber of periods (typically
years) over which an asset is depreciated. Memory register
usage: Register 0 cost (cost of the asset). Register 1
salvage (salvage value of the asset). Register 2 life
(useful life of the asset).</p>

<p>Syd [ Y ] Sum-of-the-years-digits depreciation. The
sum-of-the- years -digits method of depreciation accelerates
the rate of depreciation, so that more depreciation expense
occurs in earlier periods than in later ones. The
depreciable cost is the actual cost minus salvage value. The
useful life is the number of periods (typ- ically years)
over which an asset is depreciated. Memory register usage:
Register 0 cost (cost of the asset). Register 1 salvage
(salvage value of the asset). Register 2 life (useful life
of the asset). Register 3 period (period for which
depreciation is computed).</p>

<p>Term [ t ] Payment period. Returns the number of payment
periods in the term of an ordinary annuity necessary to
accu- mulate a future value of fv, earning a periodic
interest rate of int. Each payment is equal to amount pmt.
Memory register usage: Register 0 pmt (periodic payment).
Register 1 fv (future value). Register 2 int (periodic
interest rate).</p>

<p>SCIENTIFIC MODE This section describes the functionality
available in the calculators scientific mode. This also
includes a special mode panel used for set- ting various
options.</p>

or ounces 8 0.948 kilojoules or British thermals 9 0.0610
cubic centimeters or cubic inches Fun [ f ] Retrieve and
execute a function expression. There can be upto ten
functions expression defined by the user [0 - 9]. There are
no default function values.</p>

<p>Scientific buttons. &lt; [ &lt; ] Shift the current
entry to the left. The shift can be between 1 and 15 places
[ 1-9, A-F ]. This calculator key has a popup menu
associated with it. &gt; [ &gt; ] Shift the current entry to
the right. The shift can be between 1 and 15 places [ 1-9,
A-F ]. This calcu- lator key has a popup menu associated
with it. &amp;16 [ ] ] Truncate the current entry to a 16
bit unsigned inte- ger. &amp;32 [ [ ] Truncate the current
entry to a 32 bit unsigned inte- ger. ( and ) [ ( and ) ]
Parentheses. Allow precedence with arithmetic calcu-
lations. Note that parentheses can be nested to any level,
and gcalctool provides a visual feedback of what is being
typed in, in the calculator display. The calculation doesn t
take place until the last parenthesis is matched, then the
display is updated with the new result. Exp [ e ] This is
used to allow numbers to be entered in scien- tific
notation. The mantissa should be initially entered, then the
Exp key selected. The exponent is then entered. If no
numerical input had occurred when the Exp key was selected,
then a mantissa of 1.0 is assumed. e^x [ { ] Returns e
raised to the power of the current entry. 10^x [ } ] Returns
10 raised to the power of the current entry. y^x [ y ] Take
the last entry and raise it to the power of the next entry.
x! [ ! ] Return the factorial of the current entry. Note
that the factorial function is only valid for positive
integers. Rand [ ? ] Return a random number between 0.0 and
1.0. Hexadecimal Keys [ A-F ] The hexadecimal numerical
digits A-F. These buttons will be insensitive unless the
calculator is cur- rently in the hexadecimal mode. Cos [ J ]
Return the trigonometric cosine, arc cosine, hyper- bolic
cosine or inverse hyperbolic cosine of the cur- rent
display, depending upon the current settings of the
hyperbolic and inverse function switches. The result is
displayed in the current trigonometric units (degrees,
radians or grads). Sin [ K ] Return the trigonometric sine,
arc sine, hyperbolic sine or inverse hyperbolic sine of the
current dis- play, depending upon the current settings of
the hyperbolic and inverse function switches. The result is
displayed in the current trigonometric units (degrees,
radians or grads). Tan [ L ] Return the trigonometric
tangent, arc tangent, hyper- bolic tangent or inverse
hyperbolic tangent of the current display, depending upon
the current settings of the hyperbolic and inverse function
switches. The result is displayed in the current
trigonometric units (degrees, radians or grads). Ln [ N ]
Return the natural logarithm of the current entry. Log [ G ]
Return the base 10 logarithm of the current entry. Or [ | ]
Perform a logical OR operation on the current entry and the
next entry, And [ &amp; ] Perform a logical AND operation on
the current entry and the next entry, treating both numbers
as unsigned long integers. Not [ ~ ] Perform a logical NOT
operation on the current entry. Xor [ ^ ] Perform a logical
XOR operation on the current entry and the next entry,
treating both numbers as unsigned long integers. Xnor [ n ]
