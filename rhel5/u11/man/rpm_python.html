<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>NAME python - an interpreted, interactive,
object-oriented programming lan- guage</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS python [ -d ] [ -E ] [ -h ] [ -i ] [ -m
module-name ] [ -O ] [ -R ] [ -Q argument ] [ -S ] [ -t ] [
-u ] [ -v ] [ -V ] [ -W argument ] [ -x ] [ -c command |
script | - ] [ arguments ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Python is an interpreted, interactive,
object-oriented programming lan- guage that combines
remarkable power with very clear syntax. For an introduction
to programming in Python you are referred to the Python
Tutorial. The Python Library Reference documents built-in
and standard types, constants, functions and modules.
Finally, the Python Reference Manual describes the syntax
and semantics of the core language in (per- haps too) much
detail. (These documents may be located via the INTER- NET
RESOURCES below; they may be installed on your system as
well.)</p>

<p>Pythons basic power can be extended with your own
modules written in C or C++. On most systems such modules
may be dynamically loaded. Python is also adaptable as an
extension language for existing applica- tions. See the
internal documentation for hints.</p>

<p>Documentation for installed Python modules and packages
can be viewed by running the pydoc program.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS -c command Specify the command to
execute (see next section). This termi- nates the option
list (following options are passed as arguments to the
command).</p>

<p>-d Turn on parser debugging output (for wizards only,
depending on compilation options).</p>

<p>-E Ignore environment variables like PYTHONPATH and
PYTHONHOME that modify the behavior of the interpreter.</p>

<p>-h Prints the usage for the interpreter executable and
exits.</p>

<p>-i When a script is passed as first argument or the -c
option is used, enter interactive mode after executing the
script or the command. It does not read the $PYTHONSTARTUP
file. This can be useful to inspect global variables or a
stack trace when a script raises an exception.</p>

<p>-m module-name Searches sys.path for the named module
and runs the correspond- ing .py file as a script.</p>

<p>-O Turn on basic optimizations. This changes the
filename exten- sion for compiled (bytecode) files from .pyc
to .pyo. Given twice, causes docstrings to be discarded.</p>

<p>-R Turn on &quot;hash randomization&quot;, so that the
hash() values of str, unicode, buffer and datetime objects
are &quot;salted&quot; with an unpre- dictable pseudo-random
value. Although they remain constant within an individual
Python process, they are not predictable between repeated
invocations of Python.</p>

<p>This is intended to provide protection against a denial
of ser- vice caused by carefully-chosen inputs that exploit
the worst case performance of a dict construction, O(n^2)
complexity. See
http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html for
details.</p>

<p>-Q argument Division control; see PEP 238. The argument
must be one of &quot;old&quot; (the default, int/int and
long/long return an int or long), &quot;new&quot; (new
division semantics, i.e. int/int and long/long returns a
float), &quot;warn&quot; (old division semantics with a
warning for int/int and long/long), or &quot;warnall&quot;
(old division semantics with a warning for all use of the
division operator). For a use of &quot;warnall&quot;, see
the Tools/scripts/fixdiv.py script.</p>

<p>-S Disable the import of the module site and the
site-dependent manipulations of sys.path that it
entails.</p>

<p>-t Issue a warning when a source file mixes tabs and
spaces for indentation in a way that makes it depend on the
worth of a tab expressed in spaces. Issue an error when the
option is given twice.</p>

<p>-u Force stdin, stdout and stderr to be totally
unbuffered. On systems where it matters, also put stdin,
stdout and stderr in binary mode. Note that there is
internal buffering in xread- lines(), readlines() and
file-object iterators (&quot;for line in sys.stdin&quot;)
which is not influenced by this option. To work around this,
you will want to use &quot;sys.stdin.readline()&quot; inside
a &quot;while 1:&quot; loop.</p>

<p>-v Print a message each time a module is initialized,
showing the place (filename or built-in module) from which
it is loaded. When given twice, print a message for each
file that is checked for when searching for a module. Also
provides information on module cleanup at exit.</p>

<p>-V Prints the Python version number of the executable
and exits.</p>

<p>-W argument Warning control. Python sometimes prints
warning message to sys.stderr. A typical warning message has
the following form: file:line: category: message. By
default, each warning is printed once for each source line
where it occurs. This option controls how often warnings are
printed. Multiple -W options may be given; when a warning
matches more than one option, the action for the last
matching option is performed. Invalid -W options are ignored
(a warning message is printed about invalid options when the
first warning is issued). Warnings can also be controlled
from within a Python program using the warnings mod-
ule.</p>

<p>The simplest form of argument is one of the following
action strings (or a unique abbreviation): ignore to ignore
all warn- ings; default to explicitly request the default
behavior (print- ing each warning once per source line); all
to print a warning each time it occurs (this may generate
many messages if a warn- ing is triggered repeatedly for the
same source line, such as inside a loop); module to print
each warning only only the first time it occurs in each
module; once to print each warning only the first time it
occurs in the program; or error to raise an exception
instead of printing a warning message.</p>

<p>The full form of argument is
action:message:category:mod- ule:line. Here, action is as
explained above but only applies to messages that match the
remaining fields. Empty fields match all values; trailing
empty fields may be omitted. The message field matches the
start of the warning message printed; this match is
case-insensitive. The category field matches the warn- ing
category. This must be a class name; the match test whether
the actual warning category of the message is a subclass of
the specified warning category. The full class name must be
given. The module field matches the (fully-qualified) module
name; this match is case-sensitive. The line field matches
the line num- ber, where zero matches all line numbers and
is thus equivalent to an omitted line number.</p>

<p>-x Skip the first line of the source. This is intended
for a DOS specific hack only. Warning: the line numbers in
error messages will be off by one!</p>

<p>INTERPRETER INTERFACE The interpreter interface
resembles that of the UNIX shell: when called with standard
input connected to a tty device, it prompts for commands and
executes them until an EOF is read; when called with a file
name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and
executes a script from that file; when called with -c
command, it executes the Python statement(s) given as
command. Here command may contain multi- ple statements
separated by newlines. Leading whitespace is signifi- cant
in Python statements! In non-interactive mode, the entire
input is parsed before it is executed.</p>

<p>If available, the script name and additional arguments
thereafter are passed to the script in the Python variable
sys.argv , which is a list of strings (you must first import
sys to be able to access it). If no script name is given,
sys.argv[0] is an empty string; if -c is used, sys.argv[0]
contains the string -c. Note that options interpreted by the
Python interpreter itself are not placed in sys.argv.</p>

<p>In interactive mode, the primary prompt is &gt;&gt;&gt;;
the second prompt (which appears when a command is not
complete) is ... . The prompts can be changed by assignment
to sys.ps1 or sys.ps2. The interpreter quits when it reads
an EOF at a prompt. When an unhandled exception occurs, a
stack trace is printed and control returns to the primary
prompt; in non-interactive mode, the interpreter exits after
printing the stack trace. The interrupt signal raises the
KeyboardInterrupt exception; other UNIX signals are not
caught (except that SIGPIPE is sometimes ignored, in favor
of the IOError exception). Error messages are written to
stderr.</p>

<p>FILES AND DIRECTORIES These are subject to difference
depending on local installation conven- tions; ${prefix} and
${exec_prefix} are installation-dependent and should be
interpreted as for GNU software; they may be the same. The
default for both is /usr/local.</p>

<p>${exec_prefix}/bin/python Recommended location of the
interpreter.</p>

<p>${prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;
${exec_prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt; Recommended
locations of the directories containing the standard
modules.</p>

<p>${prefix}/include/python&lt;version&gt;
${exec_prefix}/include/python&lt;version&gt; Recommended
locations of the directories containing the include files
needed for developing Python extensions and embedding the
interpreter.</p>

<p>~/.pythonrc.py User-specific initialization file loaded
by the user module; not used by default or by most
applications.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES PYTHONHOME Change the location of
the standard Python libraries. By default, the libraries are
searched in ${prefix}/lib/python&lt;ver- sion&gt; and
${exec_prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;, where ${prefix}
and ${exec_prefix} are installation-dependent directories,
both defaulting to /usr/local. When $PYTHONHOME is set to a
single directory, its value replaces both ${prefix} and
${exec_prefix}. To specify different values for these, set
$PYTHONHOME to ${pre- fix}:${exec_prefix}.</p>

<p>PYTHONPATH Augments the default search path for module
files. The format is the same as the shell s $PATH: one or
more directory path- names separated by colons. Non-existent
directories are silently ignored. The default search path is
installation dependent, but generally begins with
${prefix}/lib/python&lt;ver- sion&gt; (see PYTHONHOME
above). The default search path is always appended to
$PYTHONPATH. If a script argument is given, the directory
containing the script is inserted in the path in front of
$PYTHONPATH. The search path can be manipulated from within
a Python program as the variable sys.path .</p>

<p>PYTHONSTARTUP If this is the name of a readable file,
the Python commands in that file are executed before the
first prompt is displayed in interactive mode. The file is
executed in the same name space where interactive commands
are executed so that objects defined or imported in it can
be used without qualification in the interactive session.
You can also change the prompts sys.ps1 and sys.ps2 in this
file.</p>

<p>PYTHONY2K Set this to a non-empty string to cause the
time module to require dates specified as strings to include
4-digit years, otherwise 2-digit years are converted based
on rules described in the time module documentation.</p>

<p>PYTHONOPTIMIZE If this is set to a non-empty string it
is equivalent to speci- fying the -O option. If set to an
integer, it is equivalent to specifying -O multiple
times.</p>

<p>PYTHONDEBUG If this is set to a non-empty string it is
equivalent to speci- fying the -d option. If set to an
integer, it is equivalent to specifying -d multiple
times.</p>

<p>PYTHONINSPECT If this is set to a non-empty string it is
equivalent to speci- fying the -i option.</p>

<p>PYTHONUNBUFFERED If this is set to a non-empty string it
is equivalent to speci- fying the -u option.</p>

<p>PYTHONVERBOSE If this is set to a non-empty string it is
equivalent to speci- fying the -v option. If set to an
integer, it is equivalent to specifying -v multiple
times.</p>

<p>PYTHONHASHSEED If this variable is set to
&quot;random&quot;, the effect is the same as specifying the
-R option: a random value is used to seed the hashes of str,
unicode, buffer and datetime objects.</p>

<p>If PYTHONHASHSEED is set to an integer value, it is used
as a fixed seed for generating the hash() of the types
covered by the hash randomization. Its purpose is to allow
repeatable hashing, such as for selftests for the
interpreter itself, or to allow a cluster of python
processes to share hash values.</p>

<p>The integer must be a decimal number in the range
[0,4294967295]. Specifying the value 0 will lead to the same
hash values as when hash randomization is disabled.</p>
