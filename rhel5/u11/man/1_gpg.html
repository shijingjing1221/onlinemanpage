<p>NAME gpg encryption and signing tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gpg [--homedir name] [--options file] [options]
command [args]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gpg is the main program for the GnuPG
system.</p>

<p>This man page only lists the commands and options
available. For more verbose documentation get the GNU
Privacy Handbook (GPH) or one of the other documents at
http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/ .</p>

<p>Please remember that option parsing stops as soon as a
non option is encountered, you can explicitly stop option
parsing by using the spe- cial option &quot;--&quot;.</p>

<p>COMMANDS gpg may be run with no commands, in which case
it will perform a rea- sonable action depending on the type
of file it is given as input (an encrypted message is
decrypted, a signature is verified, a file con- taining keys
is listed).</p>

<p>gpg recognizes these commands:</p>

<p>-s, --sign [file] Make a signature. This command may be
combined with --encrypt (for a signed and encrypted
message), --symmetric (for a signed and symmetrically
encrypted message), or --encrypt and --symmetric together
(for a signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key
or a passphrase).</p>

<p>--clearsign [file] Make a clear text signature. The
content in a clear text signature is readable without any
special software. OpenPGP software is only needed to verify
the signature. Clear text signatures may modify end-of-line
whitespace for platform independence and are not intended to
be reversible.</p>

<p>-b, --detach-sign [file] Make a detached signature.</p>

<p>-e, --encrypt [file] Encrypt data. This option may be
combined with --sign (for a signed and encrypted message),
--symmetric (for a message that may be decrypted via a
secret key or a passphrase), or --sign and --symmetric
together (for a signed message that may be decrypted via a
secret key or a passphrase).</p>

<p>-c, --symmetric [file] Encrypt with a symmetric cipher
using a passphrase. The default symmetric cipher used is
CAST5, but may be chosen with the --cipher-algo option. This
option may be combined with --sign (for a signed and
symmetrically encrypted mes- sage), --encrypt (for a message
that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase), or
--sign and --encrypt together (for a signed message that may
be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase).</p>

<p>--store [file] Store only (make a simple RFC1991
packet).</p>

<p>-d, --decrypt [file] Decrypt file (or stdin if no file
is specified) and write it to stdout (or the file specified
with --output). If the decrypted file is signed, the
signature is also verified. This command differs from the
default operation, as it never writes to the filename which
is included in the file and it rejects files which dont
begin with an encrypted message.</p>

<p>--verify [[sigfile] [signed-files]] Assume that sigfile
is a signature and verify it without gen- erating any
output. With no arguments, the signature packet is read from
stdin. If only a sigfile is given, it may be a complete
signature or a detached signature, in which case the signed
stuff is expected in a file without the &quot;.sig&quot; or
&quot;.asc&quot; extension. With more than 1 argument, the
first should be a detached signature and the remaining files
are the signed stuff. To read the signed stuff from stdin,
use - as the second filename. For security reasons a
detached signature cannot read the signed material from
stdin without denoting it in the above way.</p>

<p>--multifile This modifies certain other commands to
accept multiple files for processing on the command line or
read from stdin with each filename on a separate line. This
allows for many files to be processed at once. --multifile
may currently be used along with --verify, --encrypt, and
--decrypt. Note that --multifile --verify may not be used
with detached signa- tures.</p>

<p>--verify-files [files] Identical to --multifile
--verify.</p>

<p>--encrypt-files [files] Identical to --multifile
--encrypt.</p>

<p>--decrypt-files [files] Identical to --multifile
--decrypt.</p>

<p>--list-keys [names]</p>

<p>--list-public-keys [names] List all keys from the public
keyrings, or just the ones given on the command line.</p>

<p>Avoid using the output of this command in scripts or
other programs as it is likely to change as GnuPG changes.
See --with-colons for a machine-parseable key listing
command that is appropriate for use in scripts and other
programs.</p>

<p>-K, --list-secret-keys [names] List all keys from the
secret keyrings, or just the ones given on the command line.
A # after the letters sec means that the secret key is not
usable (for example, if it was created via
--export-secret-subkeys).</p>

<p>--list-sigs [names] Same as --list-keys, but the
signatures are listed too.</p>

<p>For each signature listed, there are several flags in
between the &quot;sig&quot; tag and keyid. These flags give
additional infor- mation about each signature. From left to
right, they are the numbers 1-3 for certificate check level
(see --ask-cert- level), &quot;L&quot; for a local or
non-exportable signature (see --lsign-key), &quot;R&quot;
for a nonRevocable signature (see the --edit-key command
&quot;nrsign&quot;), &quot;P&quot; for a signature that con-
tains a policy URL (see --cert-policy-url), &quot;N&quot;
for a signature that contains a notation (see
--cert-notation), &quot;X&quot; for an eXpired signature
(see --ask-cert-expire), and the numbers 1-9 or
&quot;T&quot; for 10 and above to indicate trust signa- ture
levels (see the --edit-key command &quot;tsign&quot;).</p>

<p>--check-sigs [names] Same as --list-sigs, but the
signatures are verified.</p>

<p>--fingerprint [names] List all keys with their
fingerprints. This is the same out- put as --list-keys but
with the additional output of a line with the fingerprint.
May also be combined with --list-sigs or --check-sigs. If
this command is given twice, the finger- prints of all
secondary keys are listed too.</p>

<p>--list-packets List only the sequence of packets. This
is mainly useful for debugging.</p>

<p>--gen-key Generate a new key pair. This command is
normally only used interactively.</p>

<p>There is an experimental feature which allows you to
create keys in batch mode. See the file doc/DETAILS in the
source distribution on how to use this.</p>

<p>--edit-key name Present a menu which enables you to do
all key related tasks:</p>

<p>sign Make a signature on key of user name If the key is
not yet signed by the default user (or the users given with
-u), the program displays the informa- tion of the key
again, together with its finger- print and asks whether it
should be signed. This question is repeated for all users
specified with -u.</p>

<p>lsign Same as &quot;sign&quot; but the signature is
marked as non- exportable and will therefore never be used
by oth- ers. This may be used to make keys valid only in the
local environment.</p>

<p>nrsign Same as &quot;sign&quot; but the signature is
marked as non- revocable and can therefore never be
revoked.</p>

<p>tsign Make a trust signature. This is a signature that
combines the notions of certification (like a regu- lar
signature), and trust (like the &quot;trust&quot; com-
mand). It is generally only useful in distinct communities
or groups.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;l&quot; (for local / non-exportable),
&quot;nr&quot; (for non- revocable, and &quot;t&quot; (for
trust) may be freely mixed and pre- fixed to
&quot;sign&quot; to create a signature of any type
desired.</p>

<p>revsig Revoke a signature. For every signature which has
been generated by one of the secret keys, GnuPG asks whether
a revocation certificate should be generated.</p>

<p>trust Change the owner trust value. This updates the
trust-db immediately and no save is required.</p>

<p>disable</p>

<p>enable Disable or enable an entire key. A disabled key
can not normally be used for encryption.</p>

<p>adduid Create an alternate user id.</p>

<p>addphoto Create a photographic user id. This will prompt
for a JPEG file that will be embedded into the user ID. Note
that a very large JPEG will make for a very large key. Also
note that some programs will display your JPEG unchanged
(GnuPG), and some pro- grams will scale it to fit in a
dialog box (PGP).</p>

<p>deluid Delete a user id.</p>

<p>delsig Delete a signature.</p>

<p>revuid Revoke a user id.</p>

<p>addkey Add a subkey to this key.</p>

<p>addcardkey Generate a key on a card and add it to this
key.</p>

<p>keytocard Transfer the selected secret key (or the
primary key if no key has been selected) to a smartcard. The
secret key in the keyring will be replaced by a stub if the
key could be stored successfully on the card and you use the
save command later. Only cer- tain key types may be
transferred to the card. A sub menu allows you to select on
what card to store the key. Note that it is not possible to
get that key back from the card - if the card gets broken
your secret key will be lost unless you have a backup
somewhere.</p>

<p>bkuptocard file Restore the given file to a card. This
command may be used to restore a backup key (as generated
dur- ing card initialization) to a new card. In almost all
cases this will be the encryption key. You should use this
command only with the corresponding public key and make sure
that the file given as argument is indeed the backup to
restore. You should then select 2 to restore as encryption
key. You will first be asked to enter the passphrase of the
backup key and then for the Admin PIN of the card.</p>

<p>delkey Remove a subkey.</p>

<p>addrevoker [sensitive] Add a designated revoker. This
takes one optional argument: &quot;sensitive&quot;. If a
designated revoker is marked as sensitive, it will not be
exported by default (see export-options).</p>

<p>revkey Revoke a subkey.</p>

<p>expire Change the key expiration time. If a subkey is
selected, the expiration time of this subkey will be
changed. With no selection, the key expiration of the
primary key is changed.</p>

<p>passwd Change the passphrase of the secret key.</p>

<p>primary Flag the current user id as the primary one,
removes the primary user id flag from all other user ids and
sets the timestamp of all affected self-signatures one
second ahead. Note that setting a photo user ID as primary
makes it primary over other photo user IDs, and setting a
regular user ID as primary makes it primary over other reg-
ular user IDs.</p>

<p>uid n Toggle selection of user id with index n. Use 0 to
deselect all.</p>

<p>key n Toggle selection of subkey with index n. Use 0 to
deselect all.</p>

<p>check Check all selected user ids.</p>

<p>showphoto Display the selected photographic user id.</p>

<p>pref List preferences from the selected user ID. This
shows the actual preferences, without including any implied
preferences.</p>

<p>showpref More verbose preferences listing for the
selected user ID. This shows the preferences in effect by
including the implied preferences of 3DES (cipher), SHA-1
(digest), and Uncompressed (compression) if they are not
already included in the preference list. In addition, the
preferred keyserver and signature notations (if any) are
shown.</p>

<p>setpref string Set the list of user ID preferences to
string for all (or just the selected) user IDs. Calling set-
pref with no arguments sets the preference list to the
default (either built-in or set via --default-
preference-list), and calling setpref with &quot;none&quot;
as the argument sets an empty preference list. Use &quot;gpg
--version&quot; to get a list of available algo- rithms.
Note that while you can change the prefer- ences on an
attribute user ID (aka &quot;photo ID&quot;), GnuPG does not
select keys via attribute user IDs so these preferences will
not be used by GnuPG.</p>

<p>keyserver Set a preferred keyserver for the specified
user ID(s). This allows other users to know where you prefer
they get your key from. See --keyserver- options
honor-keyserver-url for more on how this works. Setting a
value of &quot;none&quot; removes an exist- ing preferred
keyserver.</p>

<p>notation Set a name=value notation for the specified
user ID(s). See --cert-notation for more on how this works.
Setting a value of &quot;none&quot; removes all nota- tions,
setting a notation prefixed with a minus sign (-) removes
that notation, and setting a nota- tion name (without the
=value) prefixed with a minus sign removes all notations
with that name.</p>

<p>toggle Toggle between public and secret key listing.</p>

<p>clean Compact (by removing all signatures except the
selfsig) any user ID that is no longer usable (e.g. revoked,
or expired). Then, remove any signatures that are not usable
by the trust calculations. Specifically, this removes any
signature that does not validate, any signature that is
superseded by a later signature, revoked signatures, and
signatures issued by keys that are not present on the
keyring.</p>

<p>minimize Make the key as small as possible. This removes
all signatures from each user ID except for the most recent
self-signature.</p>

<p>cross-certify Add cross-certification signatures to
signing sub- keys that may not currently have them.
Cross-cer- tification signatures protect against a subtle
attack against signing subkeys. See --require-
cross-certification.</p>

<p>save Save all changes to the key rings and quit.</p>

<p>quit Quit the program without updating the key
rings.</p>

<p>The listing shows you the key with its secondary keys
and all user ids. Selected keys or user ids are indicated by
an asterisk. The trust value is displayed with the primary
key: the first is the assigned owner trust and the second is
the calculated trust value. Letters are used for the
values:</p>

<p>- No ownertrust assigned / not yet calculated.</p>

<p>e Trust calculation has failed; probably due to an
expired key.</p>

<p>q Not enough information for calculation.</p>

<p>n Never trust this key.</p>

<p>m Marginally trusted.</p>

<p>f Fully trusted.</p>

<p>u Ultimately trusted.</p>

<p>--card-edit Present a menu to work with a smartcard. The
subcommand &quot;help&quot; provides an overview on
available commands. For a detailed description, please see
the Card HOWTO at
http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html#GnuPG-card-
HOWTO .</p>

<p>--card-status Show the content of the smart card.</p>

<p>--change-pin Present a menu to allow changing the PIN of
a smartcard. This functionality is also available as the
subcommand &quot;passwd&quot; with the --card-edit
command.</p>

<p>--sign-key name Signs a public key with your secret key.
This is a shortcut version of the subcommand
&quot;sign&quot; from --edit.</p>

<p>--lsign-key name Signs a public key with your secret key
but marks it as non- exportable. This is a shortcut version
of the subcommand &quot;lsign&quot; from --edit.</p>

<p>--delete-key name Remove key from the public keyring. In
batch mode either --yes is required or the key must be
specified by finger- print. This is a safeguard against
accidental deletion of multiple keys.</p>

<p>--delete-secret-key name Remove key from the secret and
public keyring. In batch mode the key must be specified by
fingerprint.</p>

<p>--delete-secret-and-public-key name Same as
--delete-key, but if a secret key exists, it will be removed
first. In batch mode the key must be specified by
fingerprint.</p>

<p>--gen-revoke name Generate a revocation certificate for
the complete key. To revoke a subkey or a signature, use the
--edit command.</p>

<p>--desig-revoke name Generate a designated revocation
certificate for a key. This allows a user (with the
permission of the keyholder) to revoke someone elses
key.</p>

<p>--export [names] Either export all keys from all
keyrings (default keyrings and those registered via option
--keyring), or if at least one name is given, those of the
given name. The new keyring is written to stdout or to the
file given with option &quot;out- put&quot;. Use together
with --armor to mail those keys.</p>

<p>--send-keys [names] Same as --export but sends the keys
to a keyserver. Option --keyserver must be used to give the
name of this keyserver. Dont send your complete keyring to a
keyserver - select only those keys which are new or changed
by you.</p>

<p>--export-secret-keys [names]</p>

<p>--export-secret-subkeys [names] Same as --export, but
exports the secret keys instead. This is normally not very
useful and a security risk. The second form of the command
has the special property to render the secret part of the
primary key useless; this is a GNU exten- sion to OpenPGP
and other implementations can not be expected to
successfully import such a key.</p>

<p>See the option --simple-sk-checksum if you want to
import such an exported key with an older OpenPGP
implementation.</p>

<p>--import [files]</p>

<p>--fast-import [files] Import/merge keys. This adds the
given keys to the keyring. The fast version is currently
just a synonym.</p>

<p>There are a few other options which control how this
command works. Most notable here is the --keyserver-options
merge- only option which does not insert new keys but does
only the merging of new signatures, user-IDs and
subkeys.</p>

<p>--recv-keys key IDs Import the keys with the given key
IDs from a keyserver. Option --keyserver must be used to
give the name of this key- server.</p>

<p>--refresh-keys [key IDs] Request updates from a
keyserver for keys that already exist on the local keyring.
This is useful for updating a key with the latest
signatures, user IDs, etc. Calling this with no arguments
will refresh the entire keyring. Option --key- server must
be used to give the name of the keyserver for all keys that
do not have preferred keyservers set (see --key-
server-options honor-keyserver-url).</p>

<p>--search-keys names Search the keyserver for the given
names. Multiple names given here will be joined together to
create the search string for the keyserver. Option
--keyserver must be used to give the name of this keyserver.
Keyservers that support different search methods allow using
the syntax specified in &quot;How to specify a user ID&quot;
below. Note that different key- server types support
different search methods. Currently only LDAP supports them
all.</p>

<p>--fetch-keys URIs Retrieve keys located at the specified
URIs. Note that dif- ferent installations of GnuPG may
support different protocols (HTTP, FTP, LDAP, etc.)</p>

<p>--update-trustdb Do trust database maintenance. This
command iterates over all keys and builds the Web of Trust.
This is an interactive command because it may have to ask
for the &quot;ownertrust&quot; val- ues for keys. The user
has to give an estimation of how far she trusts the owner of
the displayed key to correctly cer- tify (sign) other keys.
GnuPG only asks for the ownertrust value if it has not yet
been assigned to a key. Using the --edit-key menu, the
assigned value can be changed at any time.</p>

<p>--check-trustdb Do trust database maintenance without
user interaction. From time to time the trust database must
be updated so that expired keys or signatures and the
resulting changes in the Web of Trust can be tracked.
Normally, GnuPG will calculate when this is required and do
it automatically unless --no- auto-check-trustdb is set.
This command can be used to force a trust database check at
any time. The processing is iden- tical to that of
--update-trustdb but it skips keys with a not yet defined
&quot;ownertrust&quot;.</p>

<p>For use with cron jobs, this command can be used
together with --batch in which case the trust database check
is done only if a check is needed. To force a run even in
batch mode add the option --yes.</p>

<p>--export-ownertrust Send the ownertrust values to
stdout. This is useful for backup purposes as these values
are the only ones which cant be re-created from a corrupted
trust DB.</p>

<p>--import-ownertrust [files] Update the trustdb with the
ownertrust values stored in files (or stdin if not given);
existing values will be overwritten.</p>

<p>--rebuild-keydb-caches When updating from version 1.0.6
to 1.0.7 this command should be used to create signature
caches in the keyring. It might be handy in other situations
too.</p>

<p>--print-md algo [files]</p>

<p>--print-mds [files] Print message digest of algorithm
ALGO for all given files or stdin. With the second form (or
a deprecated &quot;*&quot; as algo) digests for all
available algorithms are printed.</p>

<p>--gen-random 0|1|2 [count] Emit COUNT random bytes of
the given quality level. If count is not given or zero, an
endless sequence of random bytes will be emitted. PLEASE,
don t use this command unless you know what you are doing;
it may remove precious entropy from the system!</p>

<p>--gen-prime mode bits [qbits] Use the source, Luke :-).
The output format is still subject to change.</p>

<p>--version Print version information along with a list of
supported algorithms.</p>

<p>--warranty Print warranty information.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print usage information. This is a really
long list even though it doesnt list all options. For every
option, con- sult this manual.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Long options can be put in an options file
(default &quot;~/.gnupg/gpg.conf&quot;). Short option names
will not work - for example, &quot;armor&quot; is a valid
option for the options file, while &quot;a&quot; is not. Do
not write the 2 dashes, but simply the name of the option
and any required arguments. Lines with a hash (#) as the
first non-white- space character are ignored. Commands may
be put in this file too, but that is not generally useful as
the command will execute automatically with every execution
of gpg.</p>

<p>gpg recognizes these options:</p>

<p>-a, --armor Create ASCII armored output.</p>

<p>-o, --output file Write output to file.</p>

<p>--max-output n This option sets a limit on the number of
bytes that will be generated when processing a file. Since
OpenPGP supports various levels of compression, it is
possible that the plain- text of a given message may be
significantly larger than the original OpenPGP message.
While GnuPG works properly with such messages, there is
often a desire to set a maximum file size that will be
generated before processing is forced to stop by the OS
limits. Defaults to 0, which means &quot;no limit&quot;.</p>

<p>--mangle-dos-filenames</p>

<p>--no-mangle-dos-filenames Older version of Windows
cannot handle filenames with more than one dot.
--mangle-dos-filenames causes GnuPG to replace (rather than
add to) the extension of an output filename to avoid this
problem. This option is off by default and has no effect on
non-Windows platforms.</p>

<p>-u, --local-user name Use name as the key to sign with.
Note that this option overrides --default-key.</p>

<p>--default-key name Use name as the default key to sign
with. If this option is not used, the default key is the
first key found in the secret keyring. Note that -u or
--local-user overrides this option.</p>

<p>-r, --recipient name Encrypt for user id name. If this
option or --hidden-recipi- ent is not specified, GnuPG asks
for the user-id unless --default-recipient is given.</p>

<p>-R, --hidden-recipient name Encrypt for user ID name,
but hide the key ID of this users key. This option helps to
hide the receiver of the message and is a limited
countermeasure against traffic analysis. If this option or
--recipient is not specified, GnuPG asks for the user ID
unless --default-recipient is given.</p>

<p>--default-recipient name Use name as default recipient
if option --recipient is not used and dont ask if this is a
valid one. name must be non- empty.</p>

<p>--default-recipient-self Use the default key as default
recipient if option --recipi- ent is not used and dont ask
if this is a valid one. The default key is the first one
from the secret keyring or the one set with
--default-key.</p>

<p>--no-default-recipient Reset --default-recipient and
--default-recipient-self.</p>

<p>--encrypt-to name Same as --recipient but this one is
intended for use in the options file and may be used with
your own user-id as an &quot;encrypt-to-self&quot;. These
keys are only used when there are other recipients given
either by use of --recipient or by the asked user id. No
trust checking is performed for these user ids and even
disabled keys can be used.</p>

<p>--hidden-encrypt-to name Same as --hidden-recipient but
this one is intended for use in the options file and may be
used with your own user-id as a hidden
&quot;encrypt-to-self&quot;. These keys are only used when
there are other recipients given either by use of
--recipient or by the asked user id. No trust checking is
performed for these user ids and even disabled keys can be
used.</p>

<p>--no-encrypt-to Disable the use of all --encrypt-to and
--hidden-encrypt-to keys.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Give more information during processing.
If used twice, the input data is listed in detail.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Try to be as quiet as possible.</p>

<p>-z n</p>

<p>--compress-level n</p>

<p>--bzip2-compress-level n Set compression level to n for
the ZIP and ZLIB compression algorithms. The default is to
use the default compression level of zlib (normally 6).
--bzip2-compress-level sets the compression level for the
BZIP2 compression algorithm (defaulting to 6 as well). This
is a different option from --compress-level since BZIP2 uses
a significant amount of memory for each additional
compression level. -z sets both. A value of 0 for n disables
compression.</p>

<p>--bzip2-decompress-lowmem Use a different decompression
method for BZIP2 compressed files. This alternate method
uses a bit more than half the memory, but also runs at half
the speed. This is useful under extreme low memory
circumstances when the file was originally compressed at a
high --bzip2-compress-level.</p>

<p>-t, --textmode</p>

<p>--no-textmode Treat input files as text and store them
in the OpenPGP canonical text form with standard
&quot;CRLF&quot; line endings. This also sets the necessary
flags to inform the recipient that the encrypted or signed
data is text and may need its line endings converted back to
whatever the local system uses. This option is useful when
communicating between two plat- forms that have different
line ending conventions (UNIX-like to Mac, Mac to Windows,
etc). --no-textmode disables this option, and is the
default.</p>

<p>If -t (but not --textmode) is used together with
armoring and signing, this enables clearsigned messages.
This kludge is needed for command-line compatibility with
command-line ver- sions of PGP; normally you would use
--sign or --clearsign to select the type of the
signature.</p>

<p>-n, --dry-run Dont make any changes (this is not
completely implemented).</p>

<p>-i, --interactive Prompt before overwriting any
files.</p>

<p>--batch</p>

<p>--no-batch Use batch mode. Never ask, do not allow
interactive com- mands. --no-batch disables this option.</p>

<p>--no-tty Make sure that the TTY (terminal) is never used
for any out- put. This option is needed in some cases
because GnuPG some- times prints warnings to the TTY if
--batch is used.</p>

<p>--yes Assume &quot;yes&quot; on most questions.</p>

<p>--no Assume &quot;no&quot; on most questions.</p>

<p>--ask-cert-level</p>

<p>--no-ask-cert-level When making a key signature, prompt
for a certification level. If this option is not specified,
the certification level used is set via
--default-cert-level. See --default- cert-level for
information on the specific levels and how they are used.
--no-ask-cert-level disables this option. This option
defaults to no.</p>

<p>--default-cert-level n The default to use for the check
level when signing a key.</p>

<p>0 means you make no particular claim as to how carefully
you verified the key.</p>

<p>1 means you believe the key is owned by the person who
claims to own it but you could not, or did not verify the
key at all. This is useful for a &quot;persona&quot;
verification, where you sign the key of a pseudonymous
user.</p>

<p>2 means you did casual verification of the key. For
example, this could mean that you verified that the key
fingerprint and checked the user ID on the key against a
photo ID.</p>

<p>3 means you did extensive verification of the key. For
exam- ple, this could mean that you verified the key
fingerprint with the owner of the key in person, and that
you checked, by means of a hard to forge document with a
photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key owner
matches the name in the user ID on the key, and finally that
you verified (by exchange of email) that the email address
on the key belongs to the key owner.</p>

<p>Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3
are just that: examples. In the end, it is up to you to
decide just what &quot;casual&quot; and
&quot;extensive&quot; mean to you.</p>

<p>This option defaults to 0 (no particular claim).</p>

<p>--min-cert-level When building the trust database, treat
any signatures with a certification level below this as
invalid. Defaults to 2, which disregards level 1 signatures.
Note that level 0 &quot;no particular claim&quot; signatures
are always accepted.</p>

<p>--trusted-key long key ID Assume that the specified key
(which must be given as a full 8 byte key ID) is as
trustworthy as one of your own secret keys. This option is
useful if you dont want to keep your secret keys (or one of
them) online but still want to be able to check the validity
of a given recipients or signators key.</p>

<p>--trust-model pgp|classic|direct|always|auto Set what
trust model GnuPG should follow. The models are:</p>

<p>pgp This is the Web of Trust combined with trust signa-
tures as used in PGP 5.x and later. This is the default
trust model when creating a new trust database.</p>

<p>classic This is the standard Web of Trust as used in PGP
2.x and earlier.</p>

<p>direct Key validity is set directly by the user and not
calculated via the Web of Trust.</p>

<p>always Skip key validation and assume that used keys are
always fully trusted. You generally wont use this unless you
are using some external validation scheme. This option also
suppresses the &quot;[uncer- tain]&quot; tag printed with
signature checks when there is no evidence that the user ID
is bound to the key.</p>

<p>auto Select the trust model depending on whatever the
internal trust database says. This is the default model if
such a database already exists.</p>

<p>--always-trust Identical to --trust-model always . This
option is depre- cated.</p>

<p>--auto-key-locate parameters</p>

<p>--no-auto-key-locate GnuPG can automatically locate and
retrieve keys as needed using this option. This happens when
encrypting to an email address (in the
&quot;user@example.com&quot; form), and there are no
user@example.com keys on the local keyring. This option
takes any number of the following arguments, in the order
they are to be tried:</p>

<p>cert locate a key using DNS CERT, as specified in
2538bis (currently in draft): http://www.josefs-
son.org/rfc2538bis/</p>

<p>pka locate a key using DNS PKA.</p>

<p>ldap locate a key using the PGP Universal method of
checking &quot;ldap://keys.(thedomain)&quot;.</p>

<p>keyserver locate a key using whatever keyserver is
defined using the --keyserver option.</p>

<p>(keyserver URL) In addition, a keyserver URL as used in
the --key- server option may be used here to query that par-
ticular keyserver.</p>

<p>--keyid-format short|0xshort|long|0xlong Select how to
display key IDs. &quot;short&quot; is the traditional
8-character key ID. &quot;long&quot; is the more accurate
(but less convenient) 16-character key ID. Add an
&quot;0x&quot; to either to include an &quot;0x&quot; at the
beginning of the key ID, as in 0x99242560.</p>

<p>--keyserver name [name=value1 value2 value3 ...] Use
name as your keyserver. This is the server that --recv-
keys, --send-keys, and --search-keys will communicate with
to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on.
The format of the name is a URI: scheme:[//]keyserver-
name[:port] The scheme is the type of keyserver:
&quot;hkp&quot; for the HTTP (or compatible) keyservers,
&quot;ldap&quot; for the LDAP key- servers, or
&quot;mailto&quot; for the Graff email keyserver. Note that
your particular installation of GnuPG may have other
keyserver types available as well. Keyserver schemes are
case-insensitive. After the keyserver name, optional key-
server configuration options may be provided. These are the
same as the global --keyserver-options from below, but apply
only to this particular keyserver.</p>

<p>Most keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is
gen- erally no need to send keys to more than one server.
The keyserver &quot;hkp://subkeys.pgp.net&quot; uses round
robin DNS to give a different keyserver each time you use
it.</p>

<p>--keyserver-options name=value1 [value2 value3 ...] This
is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for
the keyserver. Options can be prepended with a no- to give
the opposite meaning. Valid import-options or export-
options may be used here as well to apply to importing
(--recv-key) or exporting (--send-key) a key from a key-
server. While not all options are available for all key-
server types, some common options are:</p>

<p>include-revoked When searching for a key with
--search-keys, include keys that are marked on the keyserver
as revoked. Note that not all keyservers differenti- ate
between revoked and unrevoked keys, and for such keyservers
this option is meaningless. Note also that most keyservers
do not have cryptographic verification of key revocations,
and so turning this option off may result in skipping keys
that are incorrectly marked as revoked.</p>

<p>include-disabled When searching for a key with
--search-keys, include keys that are marked on the keyserver
as disabled. Note that this option is not used with HKP
keyservers.</p>

<p>auto-key-retrieve This option enables the automatic
retrieving of keys from a keyserver when verifying
signatures made by keys that are not on the local
keyring.</p>

<p>Note that this option makes a &quot;web bug&quot; like
behav- ior possible. Keyserver operators can see which keys
you request, so by sending you a message signed by a brand
new key (which you naturally will not have on your local
keyring), the operator can tell both your IP address and the
time when you verified the signature.</p>

<p>honor-keyserver-url When using --refresh-keys, if the
key in question has a preferred keyserver URL, then use that
pre- ferred keyserver to refresh the key from. In addi-
tion, if auto-key-retrieve is set, and the signa- ture being
verified has a preferred keyserver URL, then use that
preferred keyserver to fetch the key from. Defaults to
yes.</p>

<p>honor-pka-record If auto-key-retrieve is set, and the
signature being verified has a PKA record, then use the PKA
information to fetch the key. Defaults to yes.</p>

<p>include-subkeys When receiving a key, include subkeys as
potential targets. Note that this option is not used with
HKP keyservers, as they do not support retrieving keys by
subkey id.</p>

<p>use-temp-files On most Unix-like platforms, GnuPG
communicates with the keyserver helper program via pipes,
which is the most efficient method. This option forces GnuPG
to use temporary files to communicate. On some platforms
(such as Win32 and RISC OS), this option is always
enabled.</p>

<p>keep-temp-files If using use-temp-files , do not delete
the temp files after using them. This option is useful to
learn the keyserver communication protocol by read- ing the
temporary files.</p>

<p>verbose Tell the keyserver helper program to be more
ver- bose. This option can be repeated multiple times to
increase the verbosity level.</p>

<p>timeout[=value] Tell the keyserver helper program how
long (in sec- onds) to try and perform a keyserver action
before giving up. Note that performing multiple actions at
the same time uses this timeout value per action. For
example, when retrieving multiple keys via --recv-keys, the
timeout applies separately to each key retrieval, and not to
the --recv-keys com- mand as a whole. Defaults to 30
seconds.</p>

<p>http-proxy[=value] For HTTP-like keyserver schemes that
(such as HKP and HTTP itself), try to access the keyserver
over a proxy. If a value is specified, use this as the HTTP
proxy. If no value is specified, the value of the
environment variable &quot;http_proxy&quot;, if any, will be
used.</p>

<p>max-cert-size[=value] When retrieving a key via DNS
CERT, only accept keys up to this size. Defaults to 16384
bytes.</p>

<p>--import-options parameters This is a space or comma
delimited string that gives options for importing keys.
Options can be prepended with a no- to give the opposite
meaning. The options are:</p>

<p>import-local-sigs Allow importing key signatures marked
as &quot;local&quot;. This is not generally useful unless a
shared keyring scheme is being used. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>repair-pks-subkey-bug During import, attempt to repair
the damage caused by the PKS keyserver bug (pre version
0.9.6) that mangles keys with multiple subkeys. Note that
this cannot completely repair the damaged key as some
crucial data is removed by the keyserver, but it does at
least give you back one subkey. Defaults to no for regular
--import and to yes for keyserver --recv-keys.</p>

<p>merge-only During import, allow key updates to existing
keys, but do not allow any new keys to be imported. Defaults
to no.</p>

<p>import-clean After import, compact (remove all
signatures except the self-signature) any user IDs from the
new key that are not usable. Then, remove any signatures
from the new key that are not usable. This includes
signatures that were issued by keys that are not present on
the keyring. This option is the same as running the
--edit-key command &quot;clean&quot; after import. Defaults
to no.</p>

<p>import-minimal Import the smallest key possible. This
removes all signatures except the most recent self-signature
on each user ID. This option is the same as running the
--edit-key command &quot;minimize&quot; after import.
Defaults to no.</p>

<p>--export-options parameters This is a space or comma
delimited string that gives options for exporting keys.
Options can be prepended with a no- to give the opposite
meaning. The options are:</p>

<p>export-local-sigs Allow exporting key signatures marked
as &quot;local&quot;. This is not generally useful unless a
shared keyring scheme is being used. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>export-attributes Include attribute user IDs (photo IDs)
while exporting. This is useful to export keys if they are
going to be used by an OpenPGP program that does not accept
attribute user IDs. Defaults to yes.</p>

<p>export-sensitive-revkeys Include designated revoker
information that was marked as &quot;sensitive&quot;.
Defaults to no.</p>

<p>export-reset-subkey-passwd When using the
&quot;--export-secret-subkeys&quot; command, this option
resets the passphrases for all exported subkeys to empty.
This is useful when the exported subkey is to be used on an
unattended machine where a passphrase doesn t necessarily
make sense. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>export-clean Compact (remove all signatures from) user
IDs on the key being exported if the user IDs are not
usable. Also, do not export any signatures that are not
usable. This includes signatures that were issued by keys
that are not present on the keyring. This option is the same
as running the --edit-key command &quot;clean&quot; before
export except that the local copy of the key is not
modified. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>export-minimal Export the smallest key possible. This
removes all signatures except the most recent self-signature
on each user ID. This option is the same as running the
--edit-key command &quot;minimize&quot; before export except
that the local copy of the key is not modi- fied. Defaults
to no.</p>

<p>--list-options parameters This is a space or comma
delimited string that gives options used when listing keys
and signatures (that is, --list-keys, --list-sigs,
--list-public-keys, --list-secret-keys, and the --edit-key
functions). Options can be prepended with a no- to give the
opposite meaning. The options are:</p>

<p>show-photos Causes --list-keys, --list-sigs,
--list-public- keys, and --list-secret-keys to display any
photo IDs attached to the key. Defaults to no. See also
--photo-viewer.</p>

<p>show-policy-urls Show policy URLs in the --list-sigs or
--check-sigs listings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-notations</p>

<p>show-std-notations</p>

<p>show-user-notations Show all, IETF standard, or
user-defined signature notations in the --list-sigs or
--check-sigs list- ings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-keyserver-urls Show any preferred keyserver URL in
the --list-sigs or --check-sigs listings. Defaults to
no.</p>

<p>show-uid-validity Display the calculated validity of
user IDs during key listings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-unusable-uids Show revoked and expired user IDs in
key listings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-unusable-subkeys Show revoked and expired subkeys
in key listings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-keyring Display the keyring name at the head of key
list- ings to show which keyring a given key resides on.
Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-sig-expire Show signature expiration dates (if any)
during --list-sigs or --check-sigs listings. Defaults to
no.</p>

<p>show-sig-subpackets Include signature subpackets in the
key listing. This option can take an optional argument list
of the subpackets to list. If no argument is passed, list
all subpackets. Defaults to no. This option is only
meaningful when using --with-colons along with --list-sigs
or --check-sigs.</p>

<p>--verify-options parameters This is a space or comma
delimited string that gives options used when verifying
signatures. Options can be prepended with a no- to give the
opposite meaning. The options are:</p>

<p>show-photos Display any photo IDs present on the key
that issued the signature. Defaults to no. See also
--photo-viewer.</p>

<p>show-policy-urls Show policy URLs in the signature being
verified. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-notations</p>

<p>show-std-notations</p>

<p>show-user-notations Show all, IETF standard, or
user-defined signature notations in the signature being
verified. Defaults to IETF standard.</p>

<p>show-keyserver-urls Show any preferred keyserver URL in
the signature being verified. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-uid-validity Display the calculated validity of the
user IDs on the key that issued the signature. Defaults to
no.</p>

<p>show-unusable-uids Show revoked and expired user IDs
during signature verification. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>pka-lookups Enable PKA lookups to verify sender
addresses. Note that PKA is based on DNS, and so enabling
this option may disclose information on when and what
signatures are verified or to whom data is encrypted. This
is similar to the &quot;web bug&quot; described for the
auto-key-retrieve feature.</p>

<p>pka-trust-increase Raise the trust in a signature to
full if the sig- nature passes PKA validation. This option
is only meaningful if pka-lookups is set.</p>

<p>--enable-dsa2</p>

<p>--disable-dsa2 Enables new-style DSA keys which (unlike
the old style) may be larger than 1024 bit and use hashes
other than SHA-1 and RIPEMD/160. Note that very few programs
currently support these keys and signatures from them.</p>

<p>--show-photos</p>

<p>--no-show-photos Causes --list-keys, --list-sigs,
--list-public-keys, --list- secret-keys, and verifying a
signature to also display the photo ID attached to the key,
if any. See also --photo- viewer. These options are
deprecated. Use --list-options [no-]show-photos and/or
--verify-options [no-]show-photos instead.</p>

<p>--photo-viewer string This is the command line that
should be run to view a photo ID. &quot;%i&quot; will be
expanded to a filename containing the photo. &quot;%I&quot;
does the same, except the file will not be deleted once the
viewer exits. Other flags are &quot;%k&quot; for the key ID,
&quot;%K&quot; for the long key ID, &quot;%f&quot; for the
key finger- print, &quot;%t&quot; for the extension of the
image type (e.g. &quot;jpg&quot;), &quot;%T&quot; for the
MIME type of the image (e.g. &quot;image/jpeg&quot;), and
&quot;%%&quot; for an actual percent sign. If neither %i or
%I are present, then the photo will be supplied to the
viewer on standard input.</p>

<p>The default viewer is &quot;xloadimage -fork -quiet
-title KeyID 0x%k stdin&quot;. Note that if your image
viewer program is not secure, then executing it from GnuPG
does not make it secure.</p>

<p>--exec-path string Sets a list of directories to search
for photo viewers and keyserver helpers. If not provided,
keyserver helpers use the compiled-in default directory, and
photo viewers use the $PATH environment variable. Note, that
on W32 system this value is ignored when searching for
keyserver helpers.</p>

<p>--show-keyring Display the keyring name at the head of
key listings to show which keyring a given key resides on.
This option is depre- cated: use --list-options
[no-]show-keyring instead.</p>

<p>--keyring file Add file to the current list of keyrings.
If file begins with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced
by the $HOME directory. If the filename does not contain a
slash, it is assumed to be in the GnuPG home directory
(&quot;~/.gnupg&quot; if --homedir or $GNUPGHOME is not
used).</p>

<p>Note that this adds a keyring to the current list. If
the intent is to use the specified keyring alone, use
--keyring along with --no-default-keyring.</p>

<p>--secret-keyring file Same as --keyring but for the
secret keyrings.</p>

<p>--primary-keyring file Designate file as the primary
public keyring. This means that newly imported keys (via
--import or keyserver --recv- from) will go to this
keyring.</p>

<p>--trustdb-name file Use file instead of the default
trustdb. If file begins with a tilde and a slash, these are
replaced by the $HOME direc- tory. If the filename does not
contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the GnuPG home
directory (&quot;~/.gnupg&quot; if --homedir or $GNUPGHOME
is not used).</p>

<p>--homedir directory Set the name of the home directory
to directory If this option is not used it defaults to
&quot;~/.gnupg&quot;. It does not make sense to use this in
a options file. This also overrides the environment variable
$GNUPGHOME.</p>

<p>--pcsc-driver file Use file to access the smartcard
reader. The current default is libpcsclite.so.1 for GLIBC
based systems, /Sys-
tem/Library/Frameworks/PCSC.framework/PCSC for MAC OS X,
winscard.dll for Windows and libpcsclite.so for other
systems.</p>

<p>--ctapi-driver file Use file to access the smartcard
reader. The current default is libtowitoko.so. Note that the
use of this interface is deprecated; it may be removed in
future releases.</p>

<p>--disable-ccid Disable the integrated support for CCID
compliant readers. This allows to fall back to one of the
other drivers even if the internal CCID driver can handle
the reader. Note, that CCID support is only available if
libusb was available at build time.</p>

<p>--reader-port number_or_string This option may be used
to specify the port of the card ter- minal. A value of 0
refers to the first serial device; add 32768 to access USB
devices. The default is 32768 (first USB device). PC/SC or
CCID readers might need a string here; run the program in
verbose mode to get a list of available read- ers. The
default is then the first reader found.</p>

<p>--display-charset name Set the name of the native
character set. This is used to convert some informational
strings like user IDs to the proper UTF-8 encoding. Note
that this has nothing to do with the character set of data
to be encrypted or signed; GnuPG does not recode user
supplied data. If this option is not used, the default
character set is determined from the cur- rent locale. A
verbosity level of 3 shows the chosen set. Valid values for
name are:</p>

<p>iso-8859-1 This is the Latin 1 set.</p>

<p>iso-8859-2 The Latin 2 set.</p>

<p>iso-8859-15 This is currently an alias for the Latin 1
set.</p>

<p>koi8-r The usual Russian set (rfc1489).</p>

<p>utf-8 Bypass all translations and assume that the OS
uses native UTF-8 encoding.</p>

<p>--utf8-strings</p>

<p>--no-utf8-strings Assume that command line arguments are
given as UTF8 strings. The default (--no-utf8-strings) is to
assume that arguments are encoded in the character set as
specified by --display- charset. These options affect all
following arguments. Both options may be used multiple
times.</p>

<p>--options file Read options from file and do not try to
read them from the default options file in the homedir (see
--homedir). This option is ignored if used in an options
file.</p>

<p>--no-options Shortcut for &quot;--options
/dev/null&quot;. This option is detected before an attempt
to open an option file. Using this option will also prevent
the creation of a &quot;~./gnupg&quot; homedir.</p>

<p>--load-extension name Load an extension module. If name
does not contain a slash it is searched for in the directory
configured when GnuPG was built (generally
&quot;/usr/local/lib/gnupg&quot;). Extensions are not
generally useful anymore, and the use of this option is dep-
recated.</p>

<p>--debug flags Set debugging flags. All flags are or-ed
and flags may be given in C syntax (e.g. 0x0042).</p>

<p>--debug-all Set all useful debugging flags.</p>

<p>--debug-ccid-driver Enable debug output from the
included CCID driver for smart- cards. Note that this option
is only available on some system.</p>

<p>--enable-progress-filter Enable certain PROGRESS status
outputs. This option allows frontends to display a progress
indicator while gpg is pro- cessing larger files. There is a
slight performance overhead using it.</p>

<p>--status-fd n Write special status strings to the file
descriptor n. See the file DETAILS in the documentation for
a listing of them.</p>

<p>--status-file file Same as --status-fd, except the
status data is written to file file.</p>

<p>--logger-fd n Write log output to file descriptor n and
not to stderr.</p>

<p>--logger-file file Same as --logger-fd, except the
logger data is written to file file.</p>

<p>--attribute-fd n Write attribute subpackets to the file
descriptor n. This is most useful for use with --status-fd,
since the status mes- sages are needed to separate out the
various subpackets from the stream delivered to the file
descriptor.</p>

<p>--attribute-file file Same as --attribute-fd, except the
attribute data is written to file file.</p>

<p>--comment string</p>

<p>--no-comments Use string as a comment string in clear
text signatures and ASCII armored messages or keys (see
--armor). The default behavior is not to use a comment
string. --comment may be repeated multiple times to get
multiple comment strings. --no-comments removes all
comments. It is a good idea to keep the length of a single
comment below 60 characters to avoid problems with mail
programs wrapping such lines. Note that comment lines, like
all other header lines, are not pro- tected by the
signature.</p>

<p>--emit-version</p>

<p>--no-emit-version Force inclusion of the version string
in ASCII armored out- put. --no-emit-version disables this
option.</p>

<p>--sig-notation name=value</p>

<p>--cert-notation name=value</p>

<p>-N, --set-notation name=value Put the name value pair
into the signature as notation data. name must consist only
of printable characters or spaces, and must contain a @
character in the form keyname@domain.exam- ple.com
(substituting the appropriate keyname and domain name, of
course). This is to help prevent pollution of the IETF
reserved notation namespace. The --expert flag over- rides
the @ check. value may be any printable string; it will be
encoded in UTF8, so you should check that your --dis-
play-charset is set correctly. If you prefix name with an
exclamation mark (!), the notation data will be flagged as
critical (rfc2440:5.2.3.15). --sig-notation sets a notation
for data signatures. --cert-notation sets a notation for key
signatures (certifications). --set-notation sets both.</p>

<p>There are special codes that may be used in notation
names. &quot;%k&quot; will be expanded into the key ID of
the key being signed, &quot;%K&quot; into the long key ID of
the key being signed, &quot;%f&quot; into the fingerprint of
the key being signed, &quot;%s&quot; into the key ID of the
key making the signature, &quot;%S&quot; into the long key
ID of the key making the signature, &quot;%g&quot; into the
fingerprint of the key making the signature (which might be
a subkey), &quot;%p&quot; into the fingerprint of the
primary key of the key making the signature, &quot;%c&quot;
into the signature count from the OpenPGP smartcard, and
&quot;%%&quot; results in a single &quot;%&quot;. %k, %K,
and %f are only meaningful when making a key signature
(certification), and %c is only meaningful when using the
OpenPGP smartcard.</p>

<p>--show-notation</p>

<p>--no-show-notation Show signature notations in the
--list-sigs or --check-sigs listings as well as when
verifying a signature with a nota- tion in it. These options
are deprecated. Use --list- options [no-]show-notation
and/or --verify-options [no-]show-notation instead.</p>

<p>--sig-policy-url string</p>

<p>--cert-policy-url string</p>

<p>--set-policy-url string Use string as a Policy URL for
signatures (rfc2440:5.2.3.19). If you prefix it with an
exclamation mark (!), the policy URL packet will be flagged
as critical. --sig-policy-url sets a policy url for data
signatures. --cert-policy-url sets a policy url for key
signatures (certifications). --set-pol- icy-url sets
both.</p>

<p>The same %-expandos used for notation data are available
here as well.</p>

<p>--show-policy-url</p>

<p>--no-show-policy-url Show policy URLs in the --list-sigs
or --check-sigs listings as well as when verifying a
signature with a policy URL in it. These options are
deprecated. Use --list-options [no-]show-policy-url and/or
--verify-options [no-]show-pol- icy-url instead.</p>

<p>--sig-keyserver-url string Use string as a preferred
keyserver URL for data signatures. If you prefix it with an
exclamation mark, the keyserver URL packet will be flagged
as critical.</p>

<p>The same %-expandos used for notation data are available
here as well.</p>

<p>--set-filename string Use string as the filename which
is stored inside messages. This overrides the default, which
is to use the actual file- name of the file being
encrypted.</p>

<p>--for-your-eyes-only</p>

<p>--no-for-your-eyes-only Set the for your eyes only flag
in the message. This causes GnuPG to refuse to save the file
unless the --output option is given, and PGP to use the
&quot;secure viewer&quot; with a Tempest-resistant font to
display the message. This option overrides --set-filename.
--no-for-your-eyes-only disables this option.</p>

<p>--use-embedded-filename</p>

<p>--no-use-embedded-filename Try to create a file with a
name as embedded in the data. This can be a dangerous option
as it allows to overwrite files. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>--completes-needed n Number of completely trusted users
to introduce a new key signer (defaults to 1).</p>

<p>--marginals-needed n Number of marginally trusted users
to introduce a new key signer (defaults to 3)</p>

<p>--max-cert-depth n Maximum depth of a certification
chain (default is 5).</p>

<p>--cipher-algo name Use name as cipher algorithm. Running
the program with the command --version yields a list of
supported algorithms. If this is not used the cipher
algorithm is selected from the preferences stored with the
key. In general, you do not want to use this option as it
allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard.
--personal-cipher-preferences is the safe way to accomplish
the same thing.</p>

<p>--digest-algo name Use name as the message digest
algorithm. Running the program with the command --version
yields a list of supported algo- rithms. In general, you do
not want to use this option as it allows you to violate the
OpenPGP standard. --personal- digest-preferences is the safe
way to accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p>--compress-algo name Use compression algorithm name.
&quot;zlib&quot; is RFC-1950 ZLIB com- pression.
&quot;zip&quot; is RFC-1951 ZIP compression which is used by
PGP. &quot;bzip2&quot; is a more modern compression scheme
that can compress some things better than zip or zlib, but
at the cost of more memory used during compression and
decompression. &quot;uncompressed&quot; or &quot;none&quot;
disables compression. If this option is not used, the
default behavior is to examine the recipient key preferences
to see which algorithms the recipi- ent supports. If all
else fails, ZIP is used for maximum compatibility.</p>

<p>ZLIB may give better compression results than ZIP, as
the compression window size is not limited to 8k. BZIP2 may
give even better compression results than that, but will use
a significantly larger amount of memory while compressing
and decompressing. This may be significant in low memory
situa- tions. Note, however, that PGP (all versions) only
supports ZIP compression. Using any algorithm other than ZIP
or &quot;none&quot; will make the message unreadable with
PGP. In gen- eral, you do not want to use this option as it
allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard.
--personal-compress-prefer- ences is the safe way to
accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p>--cert-digest-algo name Use name as the message digest
algorithm used when signing a key. Running the program with
the command --version yields a list of supported algorithms.
Be aware that if you choose an algorithm that GnuPG supports
but other OpenPGP implementa- tions do not, then some users
will not be able to use the key signatures you make, or
quite possibly your entire key.</p>

<p>--s2k-cipher-algo name Use name as the cipher algorithm
used to protect secret keys. The default cipher is CAST5.
This cipher is also used for conventional encryption if
--personal-cipher-preferences and --cipher-algo is not
given.</p>

<p>--s2k-digest-algo name Use name as the digest algorithm
used to mangle the passphrases. The default algorithm is
SHA-1.</p>

<p>--s2k-mode n Selects how passphrases are mangled. If n
is 0 a plain passphrase (which is not recommended) will be
used, a 1 adds a salt to the passphrase and a 3 (the
default) iterates the whole process a couple of times.
Unless --rfc1991 is used, this mode is also used for
conventional encryption.</p>

<p>--simple-sk-checksum Secret keys are integrity protected
by using a SHA-1 check- sum. This method is part of the
upcoming enhanced OpenPGP specification but GnuPG already
uses it as a countermeasure against certain attacks. Old
applications don t understand this new format, so this
option may be used to switch back to the old behaviour.
Using this option bears a security risk. Note that using
this option only takes effect when the secret key is
encrypted - the simplest way to make this happen is to
change the passphrase on the key (even changing it to the
same value is acceptable).</p>

<p>--disable-cipher-algo name Never allow the use of name
as cipher algorithm. The given name will not be checked so
that a later loaded algorithm will still get disabled.</p>

<p>--disable-pubkey-algo name Never allow the use of name
as public key algorithm. The given name will not be checked
so that a later loaded algo- rithm will still get
disabled.</p>

<p>--no-sig-cache Do not cache the verification status of
key signatures. Caching gives a much better performance in
key listings. However, if you suspect that your public
keyring is not save against write modifications, you can use
this option to dis- able the caching. It probably does not
make sense to disable it because all kind of damage can be
done if someone else has write access to your public
keyring.</p>

<p>--no-sig-create-check GnuPG normally verifies each
signature right after creation to protect against bugs and
hardware malfunctions which could leak out bits from the
secret key. This extra verification needs some time (about
115% for DSA keys), and so this option can be used to
disable it. However, due to the fact that the signature
creation needs manual interaction, this performance penalty
does not matter in most settings.</p>

<p>--auto-check-trustdb</p>

<p>--no-auto-check-trustdb If GnuPG feels that its
information about the Web of Trust has to be updated, it
automatically runs the --check-trustdb command internally.
This may be a time consuming process.
--no-auto-check-trustdb disables this option.</p>

<p>--throw-keyids</p>

<p>--no-throw-keyids Do not put the recipient key IDs into
encrypted messages. This helps to hide the receivers of the
message and is a lim- ited countermeasure against traffic
analysis. On the receiv- ing side, it may slow down the
decryption process because all available secret keys must be
tried. --no-throw-keyids dis- ables this option. This option
is essentially the same as using --hidden-recipient for all
recipients.</p>

<p>--not-dash-escaped This option changes the behavior of
cleartext signatures so that they can be used for patch
files. You should not send such an armored file via email
because all spaces and line endings are hashed too. You can
not use this option for data which has 5 dashes at the
beginning of a line, patch files dont have this. A special
armor header line tells GnuPG about this cleartext signature
option.</p>

<p>--escape-from-lines</p>

<p>--no-escape-from-lines Because some mailers change lines
starting with &quot;From &quot; to &quot;&gt;From &quot; it
is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating
cleartext signatures to prevent the mail system from
breaking the signature. Note that all other PGP ver- sions
do it this way too. Enabled by default. --no-escape-
from-lines disables this option.</p>

<p>--passphrase-fd n Read the passphrase from file
descriptor n. Only the first line will be read from file
descriptor n. If you use 0 for n, the passphrase will be
read from stdin. This can only be used if only one
passphrase is supplied.</p>

<p>--passphrase-file file Read the passphrase from file
file. Only the first line will be read from file file. This
can only be used if only one passphrase is supplied.
Obviously, a passphrase stored in a file is of questionable
security if other users can read this file. Dont use this
option if you can avoid it.</p>

<p>--passphrase string Use string as the passphrase. This
can only be used if only one passphrase is supplied.
Obviously, this is of very ques- tionable security on a
multi-user system. Don t use this option if you can avoid
it.</p>

<p>--command-fd n This is a replacement for the deprecated
shared-memory IPC mode. If this option is enabled, user
input on questions is not expected from the TTY but from the
given file descriptor. It should be used together with
--status-fd. See the file doc/DETAILS in the source
distribution for details on how to use it.</p>

<p>--command-file file Same as --command-fd, except the
commands are read out of file file</p>

<p>--use-agent</p>

<p>--no-use-agent Try to use the GnuPG-Agent. Please note
that this agent is still under development. With this
option, GnuPG first tries to connect to the agent before it
asks for a passphrase. --no-use-agent disables this
option.</p>

<p>--gpg-agent-info Override the value of the environment
variable GPG_AGENT_INFO. This is only used when --use-agent
has been given</p>

<p>Compliance options These options control what GnuPG is
compliant to. Only one of these options may be active at a
time. Note that the default setting of this is nearly always
the correct one. See the INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP
PROGRAMS section below before using one of these
options.</p>

<p>--gnupg Use standard GnuPG behavior. This is essentially
OpenPGP behavior (see --openpgp), but with some additional
workarounds for common compatibility problems in different
versions of PGP. This is the default option, so it is not
generally needed, but it may be useful to override a
different compliance option in the gpg.conf file.</p>

<p>--openpgp Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to
strict OpenPGP behavior. Use this option to reset all
previous options like --rfc1991, --force- v3-sigs, --s2k-*,
--cipher-algo, --digest-algo and --compress-algo to OpenPGP
compliant values. All PGP workarounds are disabled.</p>

<p>--rfc2440 Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to
strict RFC-2440 behavior. Note that this is cur- rently the
same thing as --openpgp.</p>

<p>--rfc1991 Try to be more RFC-1991 (PGP 2.x)
compliant.</p>

<p>--pgp2 Set up all options to be as PGP 2.x compliant as
possible, and warn if an action is taken (e.g. encrypting to
a non-RSA key) that will create a message that PGP 2.x will
not be able to handle. Note that PGP 2.x here means MIT PGP
2.6.2. There are other versions of PGP 2.x available, but
the MIT release is a good common baseline.</p>

<p>This option implies --rfc1991 --disable-mdc --no-
force-v4-certs --no-sk-comment --escape-from-lines
--force-v3-sigs --no-ask-sig-expire --no-ask-cert- expire
--cipher-algo IDEA --digest-algo MD5 --com- press-algo 1 .
It also disables --textmode when encrypting.</p>

<p>--pgp6 Set up all options to be as PGP 6 compliant as
pos- sible. This restricts you to the ciphers IDEA (if the
IDEA plugin is installed), 3DES, and CAST5, the hashes MD5,
SHA1 and RIPEMD160, and the compression algorithms none and
ZIP. This also disables --throw-keyids, and making
signatures with signing subkeys as PGP 6 does not understand
signatures made by signing subkeys.</p>

<p>This option implies --disable-mdc --no-sk-comment
--escape-from-lines --force-v3-sigs --no-ask-sig- expire</p>

<p>--pgp7 Set up all options to be as PGP 7 compliant as
pos- sible. This is identical to --pgp6 except that MDCs are
not disabled, and the list of allowable ciphers is expanded
to add AES128, AES192, AES256, and TWOFISH.</p>

<p>--pgp8 Set up all options to be as PGP 8 compliant as
pos- sible. PGP 8 is a lot closer to the OpenPGP stan- dard
than previous versions of PGP, so all this does is disable
--throw-keyids and set --escape- from-lines. All algorithms
are allowed except for the SHA224, SHA384, and SHA512
digests.</p>

<p>--force-v3-sigs</p>

<p>--no-force-v3-sigs OpenPGP states that an implementation
should generate v4 sig- natures but PGP versions 5 through 7
only recognize v4 signa- tures on key material. This option
forces v3 signatures for signatures on data. Note that this
option overrides --ask- sig-expire, as v3 signatures cannot
have expiration dates. --no-force-v3-sigs disables this
option.</p>

<p>--force-v4-certs</p>

<p>--no-force-v4-certs Always use v4 key signatures even on
v3 keys. This option also changes the default hash algorithm
for v3 RSA keys from MD5 to SHA-1. --no-force-v4-certs
disables this option.</p>

<p>--force-mdc Force the use of encryption with a
modification detection code. This is always used with the
newer ciphers (those with a blocksize greater than 64 bits),
or if all of the recipient keys indicate MDC support in
their feature flags.</p>

<p>--disable-mdc Disable the use of the modification
detection code. Note that by using this option, the
encrypted message becomes vul- nerable to a message
modification attack.</p>

<p>--allow-non-selfsigned-uid</p>

<p>--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid Allow the import and use
of keys with user IDs which are not self-signed. This is not
recommended, as a non self-signed user ID is trivial to
forge. --no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid disables.</p>

<p>--allow-freeform-uid Disable all checks on the form of
the user ID while generat- ing a new one. This option should
only be used in very spe- cial environments as it does not
ensure the de-facto standard format of user IDs.</p>

<p>--ignore-time-conflict GnuPG normally checks that the
timestamps associated with keys and signatures have
plausible values. However, some- times a signature seems to
be older than the key due to clock problems. This option
makes these checks just a warning. See also
--ignore-valid-from for timestamp issues on subkeys.</p>

<p>--ignore-valid-from GnuPG normally does not select and
use subkeys created in the future. This option allows the
use of such keys and thus exhibits the pre-1.0.7 behaviour.
You should not use this option unless you there is some
clock problem. See also --ignore-time-conflict for timestamp
issues with signatures.</p>

<p>--ignore-crc-error The ASCII armor used by OpenPGP is
protected by a CRC check- sum against transmission errors.
Occasionally the CRC gets mangled somewhere on the
transmission channel but the actual content (which is
protected by the OpenPGP protocol anyway) is still okay.
This option allows GnuPG to ignore CRC errors.</p>

<p>--ignore-mdc-error This option changes a MDC integrity
protection failure into a warning. This can be useful if a
message is partially cor- rupt, but it is necessary to get
as much data as possible out of the corrupt message.
However, be aware that a MDC protec- tion failure may also
mean that the message was tampered with intentionally by an
attacker.</p>

<p>--lock-once Lock the databases the first time a lock is
requested and do not release the lock until the process
terminates.</p>

<p>--lock-multiple Release the locks every time a lock is
no longer needed. Use this to override a previous
--lock-once from a config file.</p>

<p>--lock-never Disable locking entirely. This option
should be used only in very special environments, where it
can be assured that only one process is accessing those
files. A bootable floppy with a stand-alone encryption
system will probably use this. Improper usage of this option
may lead to data and key cor- ruption.</p>

<p>--exit-on-status-write-error This option will cause
write errors on the status FD to imme- diately terminate the
process. That should in fact be the default but it never
worked this way and thus we need an option to enable this,
so that the change won t break appli- cations which close
their end of a status fd connected pipe too early. Using
this option along with --enable-progress- filter may be used
to cleanly cancel long running gpg opera- tions.</p>

<p>--limit-card-insert-tries n With n greater than 0 the
number of prompts asking to insert a smartcard gets limited
to N-1. Thus with a value of 1 gpg wont at all ask to insert
a card if none has been inserted at startup. This option is
useful in the configuration file in case an application does
not know about the smartcard sup- port and waits ad
infinitum for an inserted card.</p>

<p>--no-random-seed-file GnuPG uses a file to store its
internal random pool over invocations. This makes random
generation faster; however sometimes write operations are
not desired. This option can be used to achieve that with
the cost of slower random gener- ation.</p>

<p>--no-verbose Reset verbose level to 0.</p>

<p>--no-greeting Suppress the initial copyright
message.</p>

<p>--no-secmem-warning Suppress the warning about
&quot;using insecure memory&quot;.</p>

<p>--no-permission-warning Suppress the warning about
unsafe file and home directory (--homedir) permissions. Note
that the permission checks that GnuPG performs are not
intended to be authoritative, but rather they simply warn
about certain common permission prob- lems. Do not assume
that the lack of a warning means that your system is
secure.</p>

<p>Note that the warning for unsafe --homedir permissions
cannot be suppressed in the gpg.conf file, as this would
allow an attacker to place an unsafe gpg.conf file in place,
and use this file to suppress warnings about itself. The
--homedir permissions warning may only be suppressed on the
command line.</p>

<p>--no-mdc-warning Suppress the warning about missing MDC
integrity protection.</p>

<p>--require-secmem</p>

<p>--no-require-secmem Refuse to run if GnuPG cannot get
secure memory. Defaults to no (i.e. run, but give a
warning).</p>

<p>--no-armor Assume the input data is not in ASCII armored
format.</p>

<p>--no-default-keyring Do not add the default keyrings to
the list of keyrings. Note that GnuPG will not operate
without any keyrings, so if you use this option and do not
provide alternate keyrings via --keyring or
--secret-keyring, then GnuPG will still use the default
public or secret keyrings.</p>

<p>--skip-verify Skip the signature verification step. This
may be used to make the decryption faster if the signature
verification is not needed.</p>

<p>--with-colons Print key listings delimited by colons.
Note that the output will be encoded in UTF-8 regardless of
any --display-charset setting. This format is useful when
GnuPG is called from scripts and other programs as it is
easily machine parsed. The details of this format are
documented in the file doc/DETAILS, which is included in the
GnuPG source distribu- tion.</p>

<p>--with-key-data Print key listings delimited by colons
(like --with-colons) and print the public key data.</p>

<p>--with-fingerprint Same as the command --fingerprint but
changes only the format of the output and may be used
together with another command.</p>

<p>--fast-list-mode Changes the output of the list commands
to work faster; this is achieved by leaving some parts
empty. Some applications don t need the user ID and the
trust information given in the listings. By using this
options they can get a faster list- ing. The exact behaviour
of this option may change in future versions.</p>

<p>--fixed-list-mode Do not merge primary user ID and
primary key in --with-colon listing mode and print all
timestamps as seconds since 1970-01-01.</p>

<p>--list-only Changes the behaviour of some commands. This
is like --dry- run but different in some cases. The semantic
of this com- mand may be extended in the future. Currently
it only skips the actual decryption pass and therefore
enables a fast list- ing of the encryption keys.</p>

<p>--no-literal This is not for normal use. Use the source
to see for what it might be useful.</p>

<p>--set-filesize This is not for normal use. Use the
source to see for what it might be useful.</p>

<p>--show-session-key Display the session key used for one
message. See --override- session-key for the counterpart of
this option.</p>

<p>We think that Key Escrow is a Bad Thing; however the
user should have the freedom to decide whether to go to
prison or to reveal the content of one specific message
without compro- mising all messages ever encrypted for one
secret key. DONT USE IT UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY FORCED TO DO
SO.</p>

<p>--override-session-key string Dont use the public key
but the session key string. The format of this string is the
same as the one printed by --show-session-key. This option
is normally not used but comes handy in case someone forces
you to reveal the content of an encrypted message; using
this option you can do this without handing out the secret
key.</p>

<p>--require-cross-certification</p>

<p>--no-require-certification When verifying a signature
made from a subkey, ensure that the cross certification
&quot;back signature&quot; on the subkey is present and
valid. This protects against a subtle attack against subkeys
that can sign. Currently defaults to --no-
require-cross-certification, but will be changed to
--require-cross-certification in the future.</p>

<p>--ask-sig-expire</p>

<p>--no-ask-sig-expire When making a data signature, prompt
for an expiration time. If this option is not specified, the
expiration time set via --default-sig-expire is used.
--no-ask-sig-expire disables this option. Note that by
default, --force-v3-sigs is set which also disables this
option. If you want signature expi- ration, you must set
--no-force-v3-sigs as well as turning --ask-sig-expire
on.</p>

<p>--default-sig-expire The default expiration time to use
for signature expiration. Valid values are &quot;0&quot; for
no expiration, a number followed by the letter d (for days),
w (for weeks), m (for months), or y (for years) (for example
&quot;2m&quot; for two months, or &quot;5y&quot; for five
years), or an absolute date in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults
to &quot;0&quot;.</p>

<p>--ask-cert-expire</p>

<p>--no-ask-cert-expire When making a key signature, prompt
for an expiration time. If this option is not specified, the
expiration time set via --default-cert-expire is used.
--no-ask-cert-expire disables this option.</p>

<p>--default-cert-expire The default expiration time to use
for key signature expira- tion. Valid values are
&quot;0&quot; for no expiration, a number fol- lowed by the
letter d (for days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or y
(for years) (for example &quot;2m&quot; for two months, or
&quot;5y&quot; for five years), or an absolute date in the
form YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults to &quot;0&quot;.</p>

<p>--expert</p>

<p>--no-expert Allow the user to do certain nonsensical or
&quot;silly&quot; things like signing an expired or revoked
key, or certain poten- tially incompatible things like
generating unusual key types. This also disables certain
warning messages about potentially incompatible actions. As
the name implies, this option is for experts only. If you
dont fully understand the implica- tions of what it allows
you to do, leave this off. --no- expert disables this
option.</p>

<p>--allow-secret-key-import This is an obsolete option and
is not used anywhere.</p>

<p>--try-all-secrets Dont look at the key ID as stored in
the message but try all secret keys in turn to find the
right decryption key. This option forces the behaviour as
used by anonymous recipients (created by using
--throw-keyids) and might come handy in case where an
encrypted message contains a bogus key ID.</p>

<p>--allow-multisig-verification Allow verification of
concatenated signed messages. This will run a signature
verification for each data+signature block. There are some
security issues with this option and thus it is off by
default. Note that versions of GPG prior to version 1.4.3
implicitly allowed this.</p>

<p>--enable-special-filenames This options enables a mode
in which filenames of the form -&amp;n, where n is a
non-negative decimal number, refer to the file descriptor n
and not to a file with that name.</p>

<p>--no-expensive-trust-checks Experimental use only.</p>

<p>--group name=value1 [value2 value3 ...] Sets up a named
group, which is similar to aliases in email programs. Any
time the group name is a recipient (-r or --recipient), it
will be expanded to the values specified. Multiple groups
with the same name are automatically merged into a single
group.</p>

<p>The values are key IDs or fingerprints, but any key
descrip- tion is accepted. Note that a value with spaces in
it will be treated as two different values. Note also there
is only one level of expansion - you cannot make an group
that points to another group. When used from the command
line, it may be necessary to quote the argument to this
option to prevent the shell from treating it as multiple
arguments.</p>

<p>--ungroup name Remove a given entry from the --group
list.</p>

<p>--no-groups Remove all entries from the --group
list.</p>

<p>--preserve-permissions Don t change the permissions of a
secret keyring back to user read/write only. Use this option
only if you really know what you are doing.</p>

<p>--personal-cipher-preferences string Set the list of
personal cipher preferences to string, this list should be a
string similar to the one printed by the command
&quot;pref&quot; in the edit menu. This allows the user to
factor in their own preferred algorithms when algorithms are
chosen via recipient key preferences. The most highly ranked
cipher in this list is also used for the --symmetric encryp-
tion command.</p>

<p>--personal-digest-preferences string Set the list of
personal digest preferences to string, this list should be a
string similar to the one printed by the command
&quot;pref&quot; in the edit menu. This allows the user to
factor in their own preferred algorithms when algorithms are
chosen via recipient key preferences. The most highly ranked
digest algorithm in this list is algo used when signing
with- out encryption (e.g. --clearsign or --sign). The
default value is SHA-1.</p>

<p>--personal-compress-preferences string Set the list of
personal compression preferences to string, this list should
be a string similar to the one printed by the command
&quot;pref&quot; in the edit menu. This allows the user to
factor in their own preferred algorithms when algorithms are
chosen via recipient key preferences. The most highly ranked
algorithm in this list is also used when there are no
recipi- ent keys to consider (e.g. --symmetric).</p>

<p>--default-preference-list string Set the list of default
preferences to string. This prefer- ence list is used for
new keys and becomes the default for &quot;setpref&quot; in
the edit menu.</p>

<p>--default-keyserver-url name Set the default keyserver
URL to name. This keyserver will be used as the keyserver
URL when writing a new self-signa- ture on a key, which
includes key generation and changing preferences.</p>

<p>--list-config [names] Display various internal
configuration parameters of GnuPG. This option is intended
for external programs that call GnuPG to perform tasks, and
is thus not generally useful. See the file doc/DETAILS in
the source distribution for the details of which
configuration items may be listed. --list-config is only
usable with --with-colons set.</p>

<p>How to specify a user ID There are different ways to
specify a user ID to GnuPG; here are some examples:</p>

<p>234567C4</p>

<p>0F34E556E</p>

<p>01347A56A</p>

<p>0xAB123456 Here the key ID is given in the usual short
form.</p>

<p>234AABBCC34567C4</p>

<p>0F323456784E56EAB</p>

<p>01AB3FED1347A5612</p>

<p>0x234AABBCC34567C4 Here the key ID is given in the long
form as used by OpenPGP (you can get the long key ID using
the option --with-colons).</p>

<p>1234343434343434C434343434343434</p>

<p>123434343434343C3434343434343734349A3434</p>

<p>0E12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434</p>

<p>0xE12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434 The best way
to specify a key ID is by using the fingerprint of the key.
This avoids any ambiguities in case that there are
duplicated key IDs (which are really rare for the long key
IDs).</p>

<p>=Heinrich Heine &lt;heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de&gt;
Using an exact to match string. The equal sign indicates
this.</p>

<p>&lt;heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de&gt; Using the email
address part which must match exactly. The left angle
bracket indicates this email address mode.</p>

<p>@heinrichh Match within the &lt;email.address&gt; part
of a user ID. The at sign indicates this email address
mode.</p>

<p>Heine</p>

<p>*Heine By case insensitive substring matching. This is
the default mode but applications may want to explicitly
indicate this by putting the asterisk in front.</p>

<p>Note that you can append an exclamation mark (!) to key
IDs or finger- prints. This flag tells GnuPG to use the
specified primary or sec- ondary key and not to try and
calculate which primary or secondary key to use.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The program returns 0 if everything was
fine, 1 if at least a signature was bad, and other error
codes for fatal errors.</p>

<p>gpg --verify sigfile [files] Verify the signature of the
file but do not output the data. The second form is used for
detached signatures, where sig- file is the detached
signature (either ASCII armored or binary) and [files] are
the signed data; if this is not given, the name of the file
holding the signed data is con- structed by cutting off the
extension (&quot;.asc&quot; or &quot;.sig&quot;) of sigfile
or by asking the user for the filename.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT HOME Used to locate the default home
directory.</p>

<p>GNUPGHOME If set directory used instead of
&quot;~/.gnupg&quot;.</p>

<p>GPG_AGENT_INFO Used to locate the gpg-agent; only
honored when --use-agent is set. The value consists of 3
colon delimited fields: The first is the path to the Unix
Domain Socket, the second the PID of the gpg-agent and the
protocol version which should be set to 1. When starting the
gpg-agent as described in its documentation, this variable
is set to the correct value. The option --gpg-agent-info can
be used to override it.</p>

<p>COLUMNS</p>

<p>LINES Used to size some displays to the full size of the
screen.</p>

<p>FILES ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg The secret keyring</p>

<p>~/.gnupg/secring.gpg.lock and the lock file</p>

<p>~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg The public keyring</p>

<p>~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.lock and the lock file</p>

<p>~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg The trust database</p>

<p>~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg.lock and the lock file</p>

<p>~/.gnupg/random_seed used to preserve the internal
random pool</p>

<p>~/.gnupg/gpg.conf Default configuration file</p>

<p>~/.gnupg/options Old style configuration file; only used
when gpg.conf is not found</p>

<p>/usr[/local]/share/gnupg/options.skel Skeleton options
file</p>

<p>/usr[/local]/lib/gnupg/ Default location for
extensions</p>

<p>WARNINGS Use a *good* password for your user account and
a *good* passphrase to protect your secret key. This
passphrase is the weakest part of the whole system. Programs
to do dictionary attacks on your secret keyring are very
easy to write and so you should protect your
&quot;~/.gnupg/&quot; directory very well.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that, if this program is used over a
network (telnet), it is *very* easy to spy out your
passphrase!</p>

<p>If you are going to verify detached signatures, make
sure that the pro- gram knows about it; either give both
filenames on the command line or use - to specify stdin.</p>

<p>INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS GnuPG tries
to be a very flexible implementation of the OpenPGP stan-
dard. In particular, GnuPG implements many of the optional
parts of the standard, such as the SHA-512 hash, and the
ZLIB and BZIP2 compres- sion algorithms. It is important to
be aware that not all OpenPGP pro- grams implement these
optional algorithms and that by forcing their use via the
--cipher-algo, --digest-algo, --cert-digest-algo, or --com-
press-algo options in GnuPG, it is possible to create a
perfectly valid OpenPGP message, but one that cannot be read
by the intended recipient.</p>

<p>There are dozens of variations of OpenPGP programs
available, and each supports a slightly different subset of
these optional algorithms. For example, until recently, no
(unhacked) version of PGP supported the BLOWFISH cipher
algorithm. A message using BLOWFISH simply could not be read
by a PGP user. By default, GnuPG uses the standard OpenPGP
preferences system that will always do the right thing and
create mes- sages that are usable by all recipients,
regardless of which OpenPGP program they use. Only override
this safe default if you really know what you are doing.</p>

<p>If you absolutely must override the safe default, or if
the preferences on a given key are invalid for some reason,
you are far better off using the --pgp6, --pgp7, or --pgp8
options. These options are safe as they do not force any
particular algorithms in violation of OpenPGP, but rather
reduce the available algorithms to a &quot;PGP-safe&quot;
list.</p>

<p>BUGS On many systems this program should be installed as
setuid(root). This is necessary to lock memory pages.
Locking memory pages prevents the operating system from
writing memory pages (which may contain passphrases or other
sensitive material) to disk. If you get no warn- ing message
about insecure memory your operating system supports lock-
ing without being root. The program drops root privileges as
soon as locked memory is allocated.</p>
