<p>PRCTL(2) Linux Programmer s Manual PRCTL(2)</p>

<p>NAME prctl - operations on a process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/prctl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int prctl(int option, unsigned long arg2, unsigned long
arg3 , unsigned long arg4, unsigned long arg5);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION prctl() is called with a first argument
describing what to do (with values defined in
&lt;linux/prctl.h&gt;), and further parameters with a sig-
nificance depending on the first one. The first argument can
be:</p>

<p>PR_SET_PDEATHSIG (since Linux 2.1.57) Set the parent
process death signal of the current process to arg2 (either
a signal value in the range 1..maxsig, or 0 to clear). This
is the signal that the current process will get when its
parent dies. This value is cleared upon a fork().</p>

<p>PR_GET_PDEATHSIG (since Linux 2.3.15) Read the current
value of the parent pro- cess death signal into the (int *)
arg2.</p>

<p>PR_SET_DUMPABLE (Since Linux 2.4) Set the state of the
flag determining whether core dumps are produced for this
process upon delivery of a sig- nal whose default behaviour
is to produce a core dump. (Nor- mally this flag is set for
a process by default, but it is cleared when a set-user-ID
or set-group-ID program is executed and also by various
system calls that manipulate process UIDs and GIDs). In
kernels up to and including 2.6.12, arg2 must be either 0
(process is not dumpable) or 1 (process is dumpable). Since
kernel 2.6.13, the value 2 is also permitted; this causes
any binary which normally would not be dumped to be dumped
read- able by root only. (See also the description of
/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable in proc(5).)</p>

<p>PR_GET_DUMPABLE (Since Linux 2.4) Return (as the
function result) the current state of the calling processs
dumpable flag.</p>

<p>PR_SET_KEEPCAPS Set the state of the processs &quot;keep
capabilities&quot; flag, which determines whether the
process s effective and permitted capa- bility sets are
cleared when a change is made to the processs user IDs such
that the process s real UID, effective UID, and saved
set-user-ID all become non-zero when at least one of them
previously had the value 0. (By default, these credential
sets are cleared). arg2 must be either 0 (capabilities are
cleared) or 1 (capabilities are kept).</p>

<p>PR_GET_KEEPCAPS Return (as the function result) the
current state of the calling processs &quot;keep
capabilities&quot; flag.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE PR_GET_DUMPABLE and PR_GET_KEEPCAPS return
0 or 1 on success. All other option values return 0 on
success. On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL The value of option is not recognized, or
it is PR_SET_PDEATHSIG and arg2 is not zero or a signal
number.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This call is Linux-specific. IRIX has a
prctl() system call (also introduced in Linux 2.1.44 as
irix_prctl on the MIPS architecture), with prototype</p>

<p>ptrdiff_t prctl(int option, int arg2, int arg3);</p>

<p>and options to get the maximum number of processes per
user, get the maximum number of processors the calling
process can use, find out whether a specified process is
currently blocked, get or set the maxi- mum stack size,
etc.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The prctl() system call was introduced in
Linux 2.1.57.</p>
