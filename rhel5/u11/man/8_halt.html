<p>HALT(8) Linux System Administrator s Manual HALT(8)</p>

<p>NAME halt, reboot, poweroff - stop the system.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /sbin/halt [-n] [-w] [-d] [-f] [-i] [-p] [-h]
/sbin/reboot [-n] [-w] [-d] [-f] [-i] /sbin/poweroff [-n]
[-w] [-d] [-f] [-i] [-h]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Halt notes that the system is being brought
down in the file /var/log/wtmp, and then either tells the
kernel to halt, reboot or poweroff the system.</p>

<p>If halt or reboot is called when the system is not in
runlevel 0 or 6, in other words when its running normally,
shutdown will be invoked instead (with the -h or -r flag).
For more info see the shutdown(8) manpage.</p>

<p>The rest of this manpage describes the behaviour in
runlevels 0 and 6, that is when the systems shutdown scripts
are being run.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -n Dont sync before reboot or halt. Note that
the kernel and stor- age drivers may still sync.</p>

<p>-w Don t actually reboot or halt but only write the wtmp
record (in the /var/log/wtmp file).</p>

<p>-d Dont write the wtmp record. The -n flag implies
-d.</p>

<p>-f Force halt or reboot, dont call shutdown(8).</p>

<p>-i Shut down all network interfaces just before halt or
reboot.</p>

<p>-h Put all harddrives on the system in standby mode just
before halt or poweroff.</p>

<p>-p When halting the system, do a poweroff. This is the
default when halt is called as poweroff.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS If youre not the superuser, you will get the
message must be supe- ruser . Users logged in locally on the
console can call halt, reboot, and poweroff without
supplying the root password, due to pam_console (8).</p>

<p>NOTES Under older sysvinit releases , reboot and halt
should never be called directly. From release 2.74 on halt
and reboot invoke shutdown(8) if the system is not in
runlevel 0 or 6. This means that if halt or reboot cannot
find out the current runlevel (for example, when
/var/run/utmp hasnt been initialized correctly) shutdown
will be called, which might not be what you want. Use the -f
flag if you want to do a hard halt or reboot.</p>

<p>The -h flag puts all harddisks in standby mode just
before halt or poweroff. Right now this is only implemented
for IDE drives. A side effect of putting the drive in
standby mode is that the write cache on the disk is flushed.
This is important for IDE drives, since the kernel doesnt
flush the write-cache itself before poweroff.</p>

<p>The halt program uses /proc/ide/hd* to find all IDE disk
devices, which means that /proc needs to be mounted when
halt or poweroff is called or the -h switch will do
nothing.</p>
