<p>NAME magic - file commands magic number file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents the format of the
magic file as used by the file(1) command, version 4.17. The
file command identifies the type of a file using, among
other tests, a test for whether the file begins with a
certain magic number. The file /usr/share/file/magic
specifies what magic numbers are to be tested for, what
message to print if a particular magic number is found, and
additional information to extract from the file.</p>

<p>Each line of the file specifies a test to be performed.
A test com- pares the data starting at a particular offset
in the file with a 1-byte, 2-byte, or 4-byte numeric value
or a string. If the test suc- ceeds, a message is printed.
The line consists of the following fields:</p>

<p>offset A number specifying the offset, in bytes, into
the file of the data which is to be tested.</p>

<p>type The type of the data to be tested. The possible
values are:</p>

<p>byte A one-byte value.</p>

<p>short A two-byte value (on most systems) in this
machines native byte order.</p>

<p>long A four-byte value (on most systems) in this
machines native byte order.</p>

<p>string A string of bytes. The string type specification
can be optionally followed by /[Bbc]*. The B flag compacts
whitespace in the target, which must contain at least one
whitespace character. If the magic has n consecutive blanks,
the target needs at least n consecutive blanks to match. The
b flag treats every blank in the target as an optional
blank. Finally the c flag, specifies case insensitive
matching: lowercase characters in the magic match both lower
and upper case characters in the targer, whereas upper case
characters in the magic, only much uppercase characters in
the target.</p>

<p>pstring A pascal style string where the first byte is
inter- preted as the an unsigned length. The string is not
NUL terminated.</p>

<p>date A four-byte value interpreted as a UNIX date.</p>

<p>ldate A four-byte value interpreted as a UNIX-style
date, but interpreted as local time rather than UTC.</p>

<p>beshort A two-byte value (on most systems) in big-endian
byte order.</p>

<p>belong A four-byte value (on most systems) in big-endian
byte order.</p>

<p>bedate A four-byte value (on most systems) in big-endian
byte order, interpreted as a Unix date.</p>

<p>beldate A four-byte value (on most systems) in
big-endian byte order, interpreted as a UNIX-style date, but
interpreted as local time rather than UTC.</p>

<p>bestring16 A two-byte unicode (UCS16) string in
big-endian byte order.</p>

<p>leshort A two-byte value (on most systems) in
little-endian byte order.</p>

<p>lelong A four-byte value (on most systems) in
little-endian byte order.</p>

<p>ledate A four-byte value (on most systems) in
little-endian byte order, interpreted as a UNIX date.</p>

<p>leldate A four-byte value (on most systems) in
little-endian byte order, interpreted as a UNIX-style date,
but interpreted as local time rather than UTC.</p>

<p>lestring16 A two-byte unicode (UCS16) string in
little-endian byte order.</p>

<p>melong A four-byte value (on most systems) in
middle-endian (PDP-11) byte order.</p>

<p>medate A four-byte value (on most systems) in
middle-endian (PDP-11) byte order, interpreted as a UNIX
date.</p>

<p>meldate A four-byte value (on most systems) in
middle-endian (PDP-11) byte order, interpreted as a
UNIX-style date, but interpreted as local time rather than
UTC.</p>

<p>regex A regular expression match in extended POSIX
regular expression syntax (much like egrep). The type speci-
fication can be optionally followed by /c for case-
insensitive matches. The regular expression is always tested
against the first N lines, where N is the given offset, thus
it is only useful for (single- byte encoded) text. ^ and $
will match the beginning and end of individual lines,
respectively, not begin- ning and end of file.</p>

<p>search A literal string search starting at the given
offset. It must be followed by /&lt;number&gt; which
specifies how many matches shall be attempted (the range).
This is suitable for searching larger binary expressions
with variable offsets, using escapes for special charac-
ters.</p>

<p>The numeric types may optionally be followed by &amp;
and a numeric value, to specify that the value is to be
ANDed with the numeric value before any comparisons are
done. Prepending a u to the type indicates that ordered
comparisons should be unsigned.</p>

<p>test The value to be compared with the value from the
file. If the type is numeric, this value is specified in C
form; if it is a string, it is specified as a C string with
the usual escapes permitted (e.g. for new-line).</p>

<p>Numeric values may be preceded by a character indicating
the operation to be performed. It may be =, to specify that
the value from the file must equal the specified value,
&lt;, to spec- ify that the value from the file must be less
than the specified value, &gt;, to specify that the value
from the file must be greater than the specified value,
&amp;, to specify that the value from the file must have set
all of the bits that are set in the specified value, ^, to
specify that the value from the file must have clear any of
the bits that are set in the specified value, or ~, the
value specified after is negated before tested. x, to
specify that any value will match. If the character is
omitted, it is assumed to be =. For all tests except string
and regex, operation ! specifies that the line matches if
the test does not succeed.</p>

<p>Numeric values are specified in C form; e.g. 13 is
decimal, 013 is octal, and 0x13 is hexadecimal.</p>

<p>For string values, the byte string from the file must
match the specified byte string. The operators =, &lt; and
&gt; (but not &amp;) can be applied to strings. The length
used for matching is that of the string argument in the
magic file. This means that a line can match any string, and
then presumably print that string, by doing 0 (because all
strings are greater than the null string).</p>

<p>message The message to be printed if the comparison
succeeds. If the string contains a printf(3) format
specification, the value from the file (with any specified
masking performed) is printed using the message as the
format string.</p>

<p>Some file formats contain additional information which
is to be printed along with the file type or need additional
tests to determine the true file type. These additional
tests are introduced by one or more &gt; characters
preceding the offset. The number of &gt; on the line
indicates the level of the test; a line with no &gt; at the
beginning is considered to be at level 0. Tests are arranged
in a tree-like hierarchy: If a the test on a line at level n
succeeds, all following tests at level n+1 are performed,
and the messages printed if the tests succeed, untile a line
with level n (or less) appears. For more complex files, one
can use empty messages to get just the &quot;if/then&quot;
effect, in the following way:</p>

<p>0 string MZ &gt;0x18 leshort &lt;0x40 MS-DOS executable
&gt;0x18 leshort &gt;0x3f extended PC executable (e.g., MS
Windows)</p>

<p>Offsets do not need to be constant, but can also be read
from the file being examined. If the first character
following the last &gt; is a ( then the string after the
parenthesis is interpreted as an indirect offset. That means
that the number after the parenthesis is used as an offset
in the file. The value at that offset is read, and is used
again as an offset in the file. Indirect offsets are of the
form: ((x[.[bslBSL]][+-][y]). The value of x is used as an
offset in the file. A byte, short or long is read at that
offset depending on the [bslBSLm] type specifier. The
capitalized types interpret the number as a big endian
value, whereas the small letter versions interpret the
number as a little endian value; the m type interprets the
number as a middle endian (PDP-11) value. To that number the
value of y is added and the result is used as an offset in
the file. The default type if one is not specified is
long.</p>

<p>That way variable length structures can be examined:</p>

<p># MS Windows executables are also valid MS-DOS
executables 0 string MZ &gt;0x18 leshort &lt;0x40 MZ
executable (MS-DOS) # skip the whole block below if it is
not an extended executable &gt;0x18 leshort &gt;0x3f
&gt;&gt;(0x3c.l) string PE PE executable (MS-Windows)
&gt;&gt;(0x3c.l) string LX LX executable (OS/2)</p>

<p>This strategy of examining has one drawback: You must
make sure that you eventually print something, or users may
get empty output (like, when there is neither PE nor LE in
the above example)</p>

<p>If this indirect offset cannot be used as-is, there are
simple calcula- tions possible: appending
[+-*/%&amp;|^]&lt;number&gt; inside parentheses allows one
to modify the value read from the file before it is used as
an off- set:</p>

<p># MS Windows executables are also valid MS-DOS
executables 0 string MZ # sometimes, the value at 0x18 is
less that 0x40 but theres still an # extended executable,
simply appended to the file &gt;0x18 leshort &lt;0x40
&gt;&gt;(4.s*512) leshort 0x014c COFF executable (MS-DOS,
DJGPP) &gt;&gt;(4.s*512) leshort !0x014c MZ executable
(MS-DOS)</p>

<p>Sometimes you do not know the exact offset as this
depends on the length or position (when indirection was used
before) of preceding fields. You can specify an offset
relative to the end of the last uplevel field using &amp; as
a prefix to the offset:</p>

<p>0 string MZ &gt;0x18 leshort &gt;0x3f &gt;&gt;(0x3c.l)
string PE PE executable (MS-Windows) # immediately following
the PE signature is the CPU type &gt;&gt;&gt;&amp;0 leshort
0x14c for Intel 80386 &gt;&gt;&gt;&amp;0 leshort 0x184 for
DEC Alpha</p>

<p>Indirect and relative offsets can be combined:</p>

<p>0 string MZ &gt;0x18 leshort &lt;0x40 &gt;&gt;(4.s*512)
leshort !0x014c MZ executable (MS-DOS) # if it s not COFF,
go back 512 bytes and add the offset taken # from byte 2/3,
which is yet another way of finding the start # of the
extended executable &gt;&gt;&gt;&amp;(2.s-514) string LE LE
executable (MS Windows VxD driver)</p>

<p>Or the other way around:</p>

<p>0 string MZ &gt;0x18 leshort &gt;0x3f &gt;&gt;(0x3c.l)
string LE LE executable (MS-Windows) # at offset 0x80 (-4,
since relative offsets start at the end # of the uplevel
match) inside the LE header, we find the absolute # offset
to the code area, where we look for a specific signature U P
X c o m &gt;&gt;&gt;(&amp;0x7c.l+0x26) string UPX p r e s s
e d</p>

<p>Or even both!</p>

<p>0 string MZ &gt;0x18 leshort &gt;0x3f &gt;&gt;(0x3c.l)
string LE LE executable (MS-Windows) # at offset 0x58 inside
the LE header, we find the relative offset # to a data area
where we look for a specific signature A C E s e l f - e x t
r &gt;&gt;&gt;&amp;(&amp;0x54.l-3) string UNACE a c t i n g
a r c h i v e</p>

<p>Finally, if you have to deal with offset/length pairs in
your file, even the second value in a parenthesed expression
can be taken from the file itself, using another set of
parentheses. Note that this addi- tional indirect offset is
always relative to the start of the main indirect
offset.</p>

<p>0 string MZ &gt;0x18 leshort &gt;0x3f &gt;&gt;(0x3c.l)
string PE PE executable (MS-Windows) # search for the PE
section called &quot;.idata&quot;... &gt;&gt;&gt;&amp;0xf4
search/0x140 .idata # ...and go to the end of it, calculated
from start+length; # these are located 14 and 10 bytes after
the section name Z I P s e l f - e x t r
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(&amp;0xe.l+(-4)) string PK34 a c t i n g a
r c h i v e</p>

<p>BUGS The formats long, belong, lelong, melong, short,
beshort, leshort, date, bedate, medate, ledate, beldate,
leldate, and meldate are system- dependent; perhaps they
should be specified as a number of bytes (2B, 4B, etc),
since the files being recognized typically come from a
system on which the lengths are invariant.</p>
