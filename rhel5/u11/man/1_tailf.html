<p>TAILF(1) Linux Programmer s Manual TAILF(1)</p>

<p>NAME tailf - follow the growth of a log file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tailf file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tailf will print out the last 10 lines of a
file and then wait for the file to grow. It is similar to
tail -f but does not access the file when it is not growing.
This has the side effect of not updating the access time for
the file, so a filesystem flush does not occur periodi-
cally when no log activity is happening.</p>

<p>tailf is extremely useful for monitoring log files on a
laptop when logging is infrequent and the user desires that
the hard disk spin down to conserve battery life.</p>

<p>BUGS An option could be provided to print out the last n
lines instead of the last 10.</p>
