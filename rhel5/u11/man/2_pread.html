<p>PREAD(2) Linux Programmer s Manual PREAD(2)</p>

<p>NAME pread, pwrite - read from or write to a file
descriptor at a given off- set</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _XOPEN_SOURCE 500</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t pread(int fd, void *buf, size_t count, off_t
offset);</p>

<p>ssize_t pwrite(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count,
off_t offset);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pread() reads up to count bytes from file
descriptor fd at offset off- set (from the start of the
file) into the buffer starting at buf. The file offset is
not changed.</p>

<p>pwrite() writes up to count bytes from the buffer
starting at buf to the file descriptor fd at offset offset.
The file offset is not changed.</p>

<p>The file referenced by fd must be capable of
seeking.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, the number of bytes read or
written is returned (zero indi- cates that nothing was
written, in the case of pwrite(), or end of file, in the
case of pread), or -1 on error, in which case errno is set
to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS pread() can fail and set errno to any error
specified for read(2) or lseek(2). pwrite() can fail and set
errno to any error specified for write(2) or lseek(2).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>HISTORY The pread() and pwrite() system calls were added
to Linux in version 2.1.60; the entries in the i386 system
call table were added in 2.1.69. The libc support (including
emulation on older kernels without the sys- tem calls) was
added in glibc 2.1.</p>
