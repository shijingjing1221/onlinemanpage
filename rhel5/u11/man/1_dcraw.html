<p>NAME dcraw - command-line decoder for raw digital
photos</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dcraw [OPTION]... [FILE]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dcraw decodes raw photos, displays metadata,
and extracts thumbnails.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v Print verbose messages, not just warnings and
errors.</p>

<p>-c Write decoded images or thumbnails to standard
output.</p>

<p>-e Extract the camera-generated thumbnail, not the raw
image. Youll get either a JPEG or a PPM file, depending on
the camera.</p>

<p>-z Change the access and modification times of an AVI,
JPEG or raw file to when the photo was taken, assuming that
the camera clock was set to Universal Time.</p>

<p>-i Identify files but dont decode them. Exit status is 0
if dcraw can decode the last file, 1 if it can t. -i -v
shows metadata.</p>

<p>dcraw cannot decode JPEG files!!</p>

<p>-d Show the raw data as a grayscale image with no
interpolation. Good for photographing black-and-white
documents.</p>

<p>-D Same as -d, but totally raw (no color scaling).</p>

<p>-h Output a half-size color image. Twice as fast as -q
0.</p>

<p>-q 0 Use high-speed, low-quality bilinear
interpolation.</p>

<p>-q 2 Use Variable Number of Gradients (VNG)
interpolation.</p>

<p>-q 3 Use Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed (AHD)
interpolation.</p>

<p>-f Interpolate RGB as four colors. Use this if the
output shows false 2x2 meshes with VNG or mazes with
AHD.</p>

<p>-B sigma_domain sigma_range Use a bilateral filter to
smooth noise while preserving edges. sigma_domain is in
units of pixels, while sigma_range is in units of CIELab
colorspace. Try -B 2 4 to start.</p>

<p>-b brightness By default, dcraw writes 8-bit PGM/PPM/PAM
with a BT.709 gamma curve and a 99th-percentile white point.
If the result is too light or too dark, -b lets you adjust
it. Default is 1.0.</p>

<p>-4 Write 16-bit linear pseudo-PGM/PPM/PAM with no gamma
curve, no white point, and no -b option.</p>

<p>-3 Same output as -4, written in Adobe PhotoShop
format.</p>

<p>-k black Set the black point. Default depends on the
camera.</p>

<p>-a Automatic color balance. The default is to use a
fixed color balance based on a white card photographed in
sunlight.</p>

<p>-w Use the color balance specified by the camera. If
this cant be found, print a warning and revert to the
default.</p>

<p>-r mul0 mul1 mul2 mul3 Specify your own raw color
balance. These multipliers can be cut and pasted from the
output of dcraw -v.</p>

<p>-n Same as -H 1.</p>

<p>-H 0 Clip all highlights to solid white (default).</p>

<p>-H 1 Leave highlights unclipped in various shades of
pink.</p>

<p>-H 2-9 Reconstruct highlights. Low numbers favor whites;
high numbers favor colors. Try -H 5 as a compromise. If that
s not good enough, do -H 9, cut out the non-white
highlights, and paste them into an image generated with -H
3.</p>

<p>-m Same as -o 0.</p>

<p>-o [0-5] Select the output colorspace when the -p option
is not used:</p>

<p>0 Raw color (unique to each camera) 1 sRGB D65 (default)
2 Adobe 1998 D65 3 Wide Gamut D65 4 Kodak ProPhoto D65 5
XYZ</p>

<p>-p camera.icm [ -o output.icm ] Use ICC profiles to
define the camera s raw colorspace and the desired output
colorspace (sRGB by default).</p>

<p>-p embed Use the ICC profile embedded in the raw
photo.</p>

<p>-t [0-7,90,180,270] Flip the output image. By default,
dcraw applies the flip spec- ified by the camera. -t 0
disables all flipping.</p>

<p>-j For Fuji Super CCD cameras, show the image tilted 45
degrees, so that each output pixel corresponds to one raw
pixel.</p>

<p>-s For Fuji Super CCD SR cameras, use the secondary
sensors, in effect underexposing the image by four stops to
reveal detail in the highlights.</p>

<p>For all other cameras, -j and -s are silently
ignored.</p>

pnmtotiff(1), pnmtopng(1), gphoto2(1), cjpeg(1),
djpeg(1)</p>

<p>BUGS The author stubbornly refuses to add more output
formats.</p>

<p>Don t expect dcraw to produce the same images as
software provided by the camera vendor. Often dcraw yields
better results!</p>
