<p>NAME distrib.pats - Default values for the Distribution
header</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file pathetc/distrib.pats is used by
nnrpd to determine the default value of the Distribution
header. Blank lines and lines beginning with a number sign
(&quot;#&quot;) are ignored. All other lines consist of
three fields separated by a colon:</p>

<p>&lt;weight&gt;:&lt;pattern&gt;:&lt;value&gt;</p>

<p>The first field is the weight to assign to this match.
If a newsgroup matches multiple lines, the line with the
highest weight is used. This should be an arbitrary integer
greater than zero. The order of lines in the file is only
important if groups have equal weight (in which case, the
first matching line will be used).</p>

<p>The second field is either the name of a newsgroup or a
uwild- mat(3)-style pattern to specify a set of
newsgroups.</p>

<p>The third field is the value that should be used for the
Distribution header of a posted article, if this line was
picked as the best match and no Distribution header was
supplied by the user. It can be an empty string, specifying
that no Distribution header should be added.</p>

<p>When a post is received by nnrpd that does not already
contain a Dis- tribution header, each newsgroup to which an
article is posted will be checked against this file in turn,
and the matching line with the high- est weight will be used
as the value of the Distribution header. If no lines match,
or if the matching line has an empty string for its third
field, no header will be added.</p>
