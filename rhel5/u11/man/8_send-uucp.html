<p>NAME send-uucp - Send Usenet articles via UUCP</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS send-uucp [SITE ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The send-uucp program processes batch files
written by innd(8) to send Usenet articles to UUCP sites. It
reads a configuration file to con- trol how it behaves with
various sites. Normally, its run periodi- cally out of cron
to put together batches and send them to remote UUCP
sites.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Any arguments provided to the program are
interpreted as a list of sites specfied in send-uucp.cf for
which batches should be generated. If no arguments are
supplied then batches will be generated for all sites listed
in that configuration file.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The sites to which articles are to be sent
must be configured in the configuration file send-uucp.cf.
Each site is specified with a line of the form:</p>

<p>site[:host] [compressor [maxsize [batchtime]]]</p>

<p>site The news site name being configured. This must
match a site name from newsfeeds(5).</p>

<p>host The UUCP host name to which batches should be sent
for this site. If omitted, the news site name will be used
as the UUCP host name.</p>

<p>compressor The compression method to use for batches.
This should be one of compress, gzip or none. Arguments for
the compression command may be specified by using
&quot;_&quot; instead of spaces. For example,
&quot;gzip_-9&quot;. The default value is
&quot;compress&quot;.</p>

<p>maxsize The maximum size of a single batch before
compression. The default value is 500,000 bytes.</p>

<p>batchtime A comma separated list of hours during which
batches should be gen- erated for a given site. When
send-uucp runs, a site will only be processed if the current
hour matches one of the hours in batchtime. The default is
no limitation on when to generate batches.</p>

<p>Fields are seperated by spaces and only the site name
needs to be spec- ified, with defaults being used for
unspecified values. If the first character on a line is a
&quot;#&quot; then the rest of the line is ignored.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Here is an example send-uucp.cf configuration
file:</p>

<p>zoetermeer gzip 1048576 5,18,22 hoofddorp gzip 1048576
5,18,22 pa3ebv gzip 1048576 5,18,22 drinkel gzip 1048576
5,6,18,20,22,0,2 manhole compress 1048576 5,18,22 owl
compress 1048576 able</p>

<p>This defines seven UUCP sites. The first four use gzip
compression and the last three use compress. The first six
use a batch size of 1MB, and the last site (able) uses the
default of 500,000 bytes. The zoetermeer, hoofddorp, pa3ebv,
and manhole sites will only have batches generated for them
during the hours of 05:00, 18:00, and 22:00, and the drinkel
site will only have batches generated during those hours and
20:00, 00:00, and 02:00. There are no restrictions on when
batches will be generated for owl or able.</p>

<p>FILES pathetc/send-uucp.cf Configuration file specifying
a list of sites to be processed.</p>

<p>NOTES The usual flags used for a UUCP feed in the
newsfeeds file are &quot;Tf,Wfb&quot;.</p>
