<p>IRQBALANCE(1) irqbalance IRQBALANCE(1)</p>

<p>NAME irqbalance - distribute hardware interrupts across
processors on a mul- tiprocessor system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS irqbalance</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The purpose of irqbalance is distribute
hardware interrupts across pro- cessors on a multiprocessor
system in order to increase performance.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --oneshot Causes irqbalance to be run once,
after which the daemon exits</p>

<p>--debug Causes irqbalance to run in the foreground and
extra debug information to be printed</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IRQBALANCE_ONESHOT Same as
--oneshot</p>

<p>IRQBALANCE_DEBUG Same as --debug</p>

<p>IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS Provides a mask of cpus which
irqbalance should ignore and never assign interrupts to.
This is a hex mask without the leading 0x , on systems with
large numbers of processors each group of eight hex digits
is sepearated ba a comma , . i.e. export
IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS=fc0 would prevent irqbalance from
assigning irqs to the 7th-12th cpus (cpu6-cpu11) or export
IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS=ff000000,00000001 would prevent
irqbal- ance from assigning irqs to the 1st (cpu0) and
57th-64th cpus (cpu56-cpu63).</p>

<p>IRQBALANCE_BANNED_INTERRUPTS Space seperated list of
integer irq s which irqbalance should ignore and never
change the affinity of. i.e. export IRQBAL-
ANCE_BANNED_INTERRUPTS=&quot;205 217 225&quot;</p>

<p>NOTES The purpose of irqbalance is to distribute
interrupts accross cpus in an smp system such that
cache-domain affinity is maximized for each irq. In other
words, irqbalance tries to assign irqs to cpu cores such
that each irq stands a greater chance of having its
interrupt handler be in cache when the irq is asserted to
the cpu. This raises a few interesting cases in which the
behavior of irqbalance may be non-intu- itive. Most notably,
cases in which a system has only one cache domain. Nominally
these systems are only single cpu environments, but can also
be found in multi-core environments in which the cores share
an L2 cache. In these situations irqbalance will exit
immediately, since there is no work that irqbalance can do
which will improve interrupt handling performance. This is
normal and not cause for con- cern. For more information
