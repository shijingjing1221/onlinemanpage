<p>NAME mke2fs.conf - Configuration file for mke2fs</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mke2fs.conf is the configuration file for
mke2fs(8). It controls the default parameters used by
mke2fs(8) when it is creating ext2 or ext3 filesystems.</p>

<p>The mke2fs.conf file uses an INI-style format. Stanzas,
or top-level sections, are delimited by square braces: [ ].
Within each section, each line defines a relation, which
assigns tags to values, or to a subsection, which contains
further relations or subsections. An exam- ple of the
INI-style format used by this configuration file follows
below:</p>

<p>[section1] tag1 = value_a tag1 = value_b tag2 =
value_c</p>

<p>[section 2] tag3 = { subtag1 = subtag_value_a subtag1 =
subtag_value_b subtag2 = subtag_value_c } tag1 = value_d
tag2 = value_e }</p>

<p>Comments are delimited by a semicolon (;) or a hash (#)
character at the beginning of the comment, and are
terminated by the end of line character.</p>

<p>Tags and values must be quoted using double quotes if
they contain spaces. Within a quoted string, the standard
backslash interpretations apply: &quot;0 (for the newline
character), &quot;&quot; (for the tab character), ( f o r t
h e b a c k s p a c &quot;e\&quot; (for the backslash
charac- c h a r a c t e r ) , a n d ter).</p>

<p>The following stanzas are used in the mke2fs.conf file.
They will be described in more detail in future sections of
this document.</p>

<p>[defaults] Contains relations which define the default
parameters used by mke2fs(8). In general, these defaults may
be overridden by a definition in the fs_types stanza, or by
an command-line option provided by the user.</p>

<p>[fs_types] Contains relations which define defaults that
should be used for specific filesystem types. The filesystem
type can be specified explicitly using the -T option to
mke2fs(8). If no filesystem type is specified, mke2fs(8)
will use the filesystem type floppy if the filesystem size
is less than or equal to 3 megabytes. If the filesystem size
is greater than 3 but less than or equal to 512 megabytes,
mke2fs(8) will use the filesystem small. Other- wise,
mke2fs(8) will use the default filesystem type default.</p>

<p>THE [defaults] STANZA The following relations are
defined in the [defaults] stanza.</p>

<p>base_features This relation specifies the filesystems
features which are enabled in newly created filesystems. It
may be overridden by the base_features relation found in the
filesystem-type-specific subsection of the [fs_types]
stanza.</p>

<p>default_features This relation specifies a set of
features that should be added or removed to the features
listed in the base_features relation. It may be overridden
by the filesystem-specific default_features in the
filesystem-type subsection of [fs_types], and by the -O
command-line option to mke2fs(8).</p>

<p>blocksize This relation specifies the default blocksize
if the user does not specify a blocksize on the command
line, and the filesystem- type specific section of the
configuration file does not specify a blocksize.</p>

<p>inode_ratio This relation specifies the default inode
ratio if the user does not specify one on the command line,
and the filesystem-type specific section of the
configuration file does not specify a default inode
ratio.</p>

<p>THE [fs_types] STANZA Each tag in the [fs_types] stanza
names a filesystem type which can be specified via the -T
option to mke2fs(8). The value of the tag is a subsection
where the relations in that subsection define the defaults
for that filesystem type. For example:</p>

<p>[fs_types] small = { blocksize = 1024 inode_ratio = 4096
} floppy = { blocksize = 1024 }</p>

<p>For each filesystem type, the following tags may be used
in that fs_types subsection:</p>

<p>base_features This relation specifies the features which
are enabled for this filesystem type.</p>

<p>default_features This relation specifies set of features
which should be enabled or disabled to the features listed
in the base_features rela- tion. It may be overridden by the
-O command-line option to mke2fs(8).</p>

<p>blocksize This relation specifies the default blocksize
if the user does not specify a blocksize on the command
line.</p>

<p>inode_ratio This relation specifies the default inode
ratio if the user does not specify one on the command
line.</p>
