<p>NAME asctime, ctime, gmtime, localtime, mktime,
asctime_r, ctime_r, gmtime_r, localtime_r - transform date
and time to broken-down time or ASCII</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *asctime(const struct tm *tm); char
*asctime_r(const struct tm *tm, char *buf);</p>

<p>char *ctime(const time_t *timep); char *ctime_r(const
time_t *timep, char *buf);</p>

<p>struct tm *gmtime(const time_t *timep); struct tm
*gmtime_r(const time_t *timep, struct tm *result);</p>

<p>struct tm *localtime(const time_t *timep); struct tm
*localtime_r(const time_t *timep, struct tm *result);</p>

<p>time_t mktime(struct tm *tm);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ctime(), gmtime() and localtime()
functions all take an argument of data type time_t which
represents calendar time. When interpreted as an absolute
time value, it represents the number of seconds elapsed
since 00:00:00 on January 1, 1970, Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC).</p>

<p>The asctime() and mktime() functions both take an
argument representing broken-down time which is a
representation separated into year, month, day, etc.</p>

<p>Broken-down time is stored in the structure tm which is
defined in &lt;time.h&gt; as follows:</p>

<p>struct tm { int tm_sec; /* seconds */ int tm_min; /*
minutes */ int tm_hour; /* hours */ int tm_mday; /* day of
the month */ int tm_mon; /* month */ int tm_year; /* year */
int tm_wday; /* day of the week */ int tm_yday; /* day in
the year */ int tm_isdst; /* daylight saving time */ };</p>

<p>The members of the tm structure are:</p>

<p>tm_sec The number of seconds after the minute, normally
in the range 0 to 59, but can be up to 60 to allow for leap
seconds.</p>

<p>tm_min The number of minutes after the hour, in the
range 0 to 59.</p>

<p>tm_hour The number of hours past midnight, in the range
0 to 23.</p>

<p>tm_mday The day of the month, in the range 1 to 31.</p>

<p>tm_mon The number of months since January, in the range
0 to 11.</p>

<p>tm_year The number of years since 1900.</p>

<p>tm_wday The number of days since Sunday, in the range 0
to 6.</p>

<p>tm_yday The number of days since January 1, in the range
0 to 365.</p>

<p>tm_isdst A flag that indicates whether daylight saving
time is in effect at the time described. The value is
positive if daylight saving time is in effect, zero if it is
not, and negative if the infor- mation is not available.</p>

<p>The call ctime(t) is equivalent to
asctime(localtime(t)). It converts the calendar time t into
a string of the form</p>

<p>&quot;Wed Jun 30 21:49:08 19930</p>

<p>The abbreviations for the days of the week are Sun, Mon
, Tue, Wed , Thu , Fri, and Sat. The abbreviations for the
months are Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct,
Nov, and Dec. The return value points to a statically
allocated string which might be overwritten by subsequent
calls to any of the date and time functions. The function
also sets the external variable tzname (see tzset(3)) with
information about the current time zone. The re-entrant
version ctime_r() does the same, but stores the string in a
user-supplied buffer of length at least 26. It need not set
tzname.</p>

<p>The gmtime() function converts the calendar time timep
to broken-down time representation, expressed in Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC). It may return NULL when the year does
not fit into an integer. The return value points to a
statically allocated struct which might be overwrit- ten by
subsequent calls to any of the date and time functions. The
gmtime_r() function does the same, but stores the data in a
user-sup- plied struct.</p>

<p>The localtime() function converts the calendar time
timep to broken- time representation, expressed relative to
the users specified time zone. The function acts as if it
called tzset(3) and sets the exter- nal variables tzname
with information about the current time zone, timezone with
the difference between Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and
local standard time in seconds, and daylight to a non-zero
value if daylight savings time rules apply during some part
of the year. The return value points to a statically
allocated struct which might be overwritten by subsequent
calls to any of the date and time functions. The
localtime_r() function does the same, but stores the data in
a user-supplied struct. It need not set tzname.</p>

<p>The asctime() function converts the broken-down time
value tm into a string with the same format as ctime(). The
return value points to a statically allocated string which
might be overwritten by subsequent calls to any of the date
and time functions. The asctime_r() function does the same,
but stores the string in a user-supplied buffer of length at
least 26.</p>

<p>The mktime() function converts a broken-down time
structure, expressed as local time, to calendar time
representation. The function ignores the specified contents
of the structure members tm_wday and tm_yday and recomputes
them from the other information in the broken-down time
structure. If structure members are outside their legal
interval, they will be normalized (so that, e.g., 40 October
is changed into 9 Novem- ber). Calling mktime() also sets
the external variable tzname with information about the
current time zone. If the specified broken-down time cannot
be represented as calendar time (seconds since the epoch),
mktime() returns a value of (time_t)(-1) and does not alter
the tm_wday and tm_yday members of the broken-down time
structure.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Each of these functions returns the value
described, or NULL (-1 in case of mktime()) in case an error
was detected.</p>

<p>NOTES The four functions asctime(), ctime(), gmtime()
and localtime() return a pointer to static data and hence
are not thread-safe. Thread-safe versions asctime_r(),
ctime_r(), gmtime_r() and localtime_r() are spec- ified by
SUSv2, and available since libc 5.2.5.</p>

<p>In many implementations, including glibc, a 0 in tm_mday
is interpreted as meaning the last day of the preceding
month.</p>

<p>The glibc version of struct tm has additional fields</p>

<p>long tm_gmtoff; /* Seconds east of UTC */ const char
*tm_zone; /* Timezone abbreviation */</p>

<p>defined when _BSD_SOURCE was set before including
&lt;time.h&gt;. This is a BSD extension, present in
4.3BSD-Reno.</p>
