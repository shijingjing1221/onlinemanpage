<p>IOPERM(2) Linux Programmer s Manual IOPERM(2)</p>

<p>NAME ioperm - set port input/output permissions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt; /* for libc5 */
#include &lt;sys/io.h&gt; /* for glibc */</p>

<p>int ioperm(unsigned long from, unsigned long num, int
turn_on);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Ioperm sets the port access permission bits
for the process for num bytes starting from port address
from to the value turn_on. The use of ioperm() requires root
privileges.</p>

<p>Only the first 0x3ff I/O ports can be specified in this
manner. For more ports, the iopl() function must be used.
Permissions are not inherited on fork(), but on exec() they
are. This is useful for giving port access permissions to
non-privileged tasks.</p>

<p>This call is mostly for the i386 architecture. On many
other architec- tures it does not exist or will always
return an error.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL Invalid values for from or num.</p>

<p>EIO (on ppc) This call is not supported.</p>

<p>EPERM The calling process has insufficient privilege to
call ioperm(); the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability is required.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO ioperm() is Linux specific and should not
be used in programs intended to be portable.</p>

<p>NOTES Libc5 treats it as a system call and has a
prototype in &lt;unistd.h&gt;. Glibc1 does not have a
prototype. Glibc2 has a prototype both in &lt;sys/io.h&gt;
and in &lt;sys/perm.h&gt;. Avoid the latter, it is available
on i386 only.</p>
