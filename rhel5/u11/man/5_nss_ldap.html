<p>nss_ldap(5) nss_ldap(5)</p>

<p>NAME nss_ldap - LDAP nameservice provider</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The nss_ldap module is a set of C library
extensions which allows X.500 and LDAP directory servers to
be used as a primary source of name ser- vice information.
(Name service information typically includes users, hosts,
groups, and other such data historically stored in flat
files or NIS.)</p>

<p>Features of the PADL nss_ldap module include support for
both the RFC 2307 and RFC 2307bis schema, a common
implementation across multiple platforms, Kerberos and SSL
security, configurable schema mapping, and configuration
file compatibility with the pam_ldap(5) module.</p>

<p>Because LDAP is a hierarchical directory service, one
can distribute the information in a manner which reflects
organizational structure. This contrasts with the flat,
single domain policy of NIS. LDAP has many of the advantages
of NIS+ (security and scalability) without the
complexity.</p>

<p>nss_ldap will work alongside existing NIS, NIS+, DNS and
flat file name services. More importantly, because it builds
as a shared library, it is not necessary to recompile any
applications to take advantage of LDAP.</p>

<p>The present version of nss_ldap supports AIX 4.3.3 and
above, FreeBSD 5.1, HP-UX 11i, Linux and Solaris 2.6 and
above. Many vendors provide their own LDAP nameservice
providers, often also called nss_ldap. This manual page
applies to the PADL nss_ldap module only. If you are using a
vendor provided module, consult the relevant documentation
instead.</p>

<p>The features supported by the version of nss_ldap depend
on which flags were enabled when the software was built.
Most features are enabled in the configuration file,
described below. (The location of the configu- ration file
is configurable at compile time; the default path is
/etc/ldap.conf.) Also, some features may be unavailable on
certain operating systems or with certain LDAP libraries.
For more information, consult your vendor.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION nss_ldap stores its configuration in the
ldap.conf file, the location of which is configurable at
compile time. (It should be noted that some LDAP client
libraries, such as OpenLDAP, also use a configuration file
of the same name. nss_ldap supports many of the same
configura- tion file options as OpenLDAP, but it adds
several that are specific to the functionality it provides.
Additionally, it is not guaranteed that nss_ldap will
continue to match the configuration file semantics of
OpenLDAP. You may wish to use different files.)</p>

<p>Configuration file options consist of a keyword followed
by a space and any arguments. The following options are
supported by both nss_ldap and the PADL pam_ldap module:</p>

<p>host &lt;name:port ...&gt; Specifies the name(s) or IP
address(es) of the LDAP server(s) to connect to. In the case
that nss_ldap is used for host name res- olution, each
server should be specified as an IP address or name that can
be resolved without using LDAP. Multiple servers may be
specified, each separated by a space. The failover time
depends on whether the LDAP client library supports
configurable network or connect timeouts (see bind_timelimit
below).</p>

<p>base &lt;base&gt; Specifies the default base
distinguished name (DN) to use for searches.</p>

<p>uri &lt;ldap[is]://[name[:port]] ...&gt; For LDAP client
libraries that support it, specifies the URI(s) of the LDAP
server(s) to connect to. The URI scheme may be ldap, ldapi,
or ldaps, specifying LDAP over TCP, IPC and SSL respec-
tively. If applicable, a port number can be specified; the
default port number for the selected protocol is used if
omit- ted. This option takes precedence over the host
option; it is not possible to combine the two.</p>

<p>ldap_version &lt;version&gt; Specifies the version of
the LDAP protocol to use. Presently version must be 2 or 3.
The default is to use the maximum ver- sion supported by the
client library.</p>

<p>binddn &lt;binddn&gt; Specifies the distinguished name
with which to bind to the directory server(s). This option
is optional; the default is to bind anonymously.</p>

<p>bindpw &lt;bindpw&gt; Specifies the cleartext
credentials with which to bind. This option is only
applicable when used with binddn above. The default is no
credential (anonymous bind). When binding to the directory
using SASL or other authentication mechanisms apart from
simple binds, this option is not used.</p>

<p>rootbinddn &lt;binddn&gt; This option has the same
syntax and effect as the binddn option above, except it
applies when the effective user ID is zero. If not
specified, then the identity specified in binddn is used
instead. Because the configuration file may be readable by
many users, the root bind DN credentials are stored in the
ldap.secret file instead. This file is usually in the same
directory as the configuration file.</p>

<p>port &lt;port&gt; Specifies the port to connect to; this
option is used with the host option, and is ignored with the
uri option.</p>

<p>scope &lt;sub|one|base&gt; Specifies the search scope
(subtree, one level or base object). The default scope is
subtree; base scope is almost never useful for nameservice
lookups.</p>

<p>deref &lt;never|searching|finding|always&gt; Specifies
the policy for dereferencing aliases. The default pol- icy
is to never dereference aliases.</p>

<p>timelimit &lt;timelimit&gt; Specifies the time limit (in
seconds) to use when performing searches. A value of zero
(0), which is the default, is to wait indefinitely for
searches to be completed.</p>

<p>bind_timelimit &lt;timelimit&gt; Specifies the time
limit (in seconds) to use when connecting to the directory
server. This is distinct from the time limit spec- ified in
timelimit and affects the initial server connection only.
(Server connections are otherwise cached.) Only some LDAP
client libraries have the underlying functionality necessary
to support this option. The default bind timelimit is 30
seconds.</p>

<p>referrals &lt;yes|no&gt; Specifies whether automatic
referral chasing should be enabled. The default behaviour is
specifed by the LDAP client library.</p>

<p>restart &lt;yes|no&gt; Specifies whether the LDAP client
library should restart the select(2) system call when
interrupted. This feature is not sup- ported by all client
libraries.</p>

<p>logdir &lt;directory&gt; Specifies the directory used
for logging by the LDAP client library. This feature is not
supported by all client libraries.</p>

<p>debug &lt;level&gt; Specifies the debug level used for
logging by the LDAP client library. This feature is not
supported by all client libraries, and does not apply to the
nss_ldap and pam_ldap modules them- selves (debugging, if
any, is configured separately and usually at compile
time).</p>

<p>ssl &lt;on|off|start_tls&gt; Specifies whether to use
SSL/TLS or not (the default is not to). If start_tls is
specified then StartTLS is used rather than raw LDAP over
SSL. Not all LDAP client libraries support both SSL and
StartTLS, and all related configuration options.</p>

<p>sslpath &lt;cert7_path&gt; For the Netscape and Mozilla
LDAP client libraries only, this specifies the path to the
X.509 certificate database.</p>

<p>tls_checkpeer &lt;yes|no&gt; Specifies whether to
require and verify the server certificate or not, when using
SSL/TLS with the OpenLDAP client library. The default is to
use the default behaviour of the client library; for
OpenLDAP 2.0 and earlier it is &quot;no&quot;, for OpenLDAP
2.1 and later it is &quot;yes&quot;. At least one of
tls_cacertdir and tls_cacertfile is required if peer
verification is enabled.</p>

<p>tls_cacertdir &lt;certificate_dir&gt; Specifies the
directory containing X.509 certificates for peer
authentication.</p>

<p>tls_cacertfile &lt;certificate_file&gt; Specifies the
path to the X.509 certificate for peer authentica- tion.</p>

<p>tls_randfile &lt;entropy_file&gt; Specifies the path to
an entropy source.</p>

<p>tls_ciphers &lt;ciphers&gt; Specifies the ciphers to use
for TLS. See your TLS implementa- tions documentation for
further information.</p>

<p>tls_cert &lt;certificate_file&gt; Specifies the path to
the file containing the local certificate for client TLS
authentication.</p>

<p>tls_key &lt;key_file&gt; Specifies the path to the file
containing the private key for client TLS
authentication.</p>

<p>The following configuration options apply to nss_ldap
only:</p>

<p>bind_policy &lt;hard_open|hard_init|soft&gt; Specifies
the policy to use for reconnecting to an unavailable LDAP
server. The default is hard_open, which reconnects if
opening the connection to the directory server failed. By
con- trast, hard_init reconnects if initializing the
connection failed. Initializing may not actually contact the
directory server, and it is possible that a malformed
configuration file will trigger reconnection. If soft is
specified, then nss_ldap will return immediately on server
failure. All &quot;hard&quot; reconnect policies block with
exponential backoff before retrying.</p>

<p>nss_connect_policy &lt;persist|oneshot&gt; Determines
whether nss_ldap persists connections. The default is for
the connection to the LDAP server to remain open after the
first request.</p>

<p>idle_timelimit &lt;timelimit&gt; Specifies the time (in
seconds) after which nss_ldap will close connections to the
directory server. The default is not to time out
connections.</p>

<p>sasl_authid &lt;authid&gt; Specifies the authorization
identity to be used when performing SASL authentication.</p>

<p>rootsasl_auth_id &lt;authid&gt; Specifies the
authorization identity to be used when performing SASL
authentication as root (when the effective user ID is
zero).</p>

<p>sasl_secprops &lt;properties&gt; Specifies Cyrus SASL
security properties. Allowed values are described in the
ldap.conf(5) manual page.</p>

<p>rootuse_sasl &lt;yes|no&gt; Specifies whether SASL
authentication should be used when the effective user ID is
zero.</p>

<p>krb5_ccname &lt;PREFIX:args&gt; If nss_ldap is built
with configurable GSS-API credentials cache name support,
specifies the Kerberos credentials cache to use.</p>

<p>nss_paged_results &lt;yes|no&gt; Enables support for
paged results.</p>

<p>pagesize &lt;pagesize&gt; When paged results are enabled
(see above), specifies the number of entries to return in a
single page. The default is 1000.</p>

<p>nss_base_&lt;map&gt; &lt;basedn?scope?filter&gt; Specify
the search base, scope and filter to be used for spe- cific
maps. (Note that map forms part of the configuration file
keyword and is one of passwd, shadow, group, hosts,
services, networks, protocols, rpc, ethers, netmasks,
bootparams, aliases and netgroup.) The syntax of basedn and
scope are the same as for the configuration file options of
the same name, with the addition of being able to omit the
trailing suffix of the base DN (in which case the global
base DN will be appended instead). The filter is a search
filter to be added to the default search filter for a
specific map, such that the effective filter is the logical
intersection of the two. The base DN, scope and filter are
separated with literal question marks (?) as given above;
this is for compatibility with the DUA configuration profile
schema and the ldapprofile tool. This option may be
specified multiple times.</p>

<p>nss_map_attribute &lt;from_attribute&gt;
&lt;to_attribute&gt; This option may be specified multiple
times, and directs nss_ldap to use the attribute
to_attribute instead of the RFC 2307 attribute
from_attribute in all lookups. If nss_ldap was built without
schema mapping support, then this option is ignored.</p>

<p>nss_map_objectclass &lt;from_objectclass&gt;
&lt;to_objectclass&gt; This option may be specified multiple
times, and directs nss_ldap to use the object class
to_objectclass instead of the RFC 2307 object class
from_objectclass in all lookups. If nss_ldap was built
without schema mapping support, then this option is
ignored.</p>

<p>nss_default_attribute_value &lt;attribute&gt;
&lt;value&gt; Specifies the default value to use for entries
that lack the specified attribute. This option may be
specified multiple times, for different attributes. If
nss_ldap was built without schema mapping support, then this
option is ignored.</p>

<p>nss_override_attribute_value &lt;attribute&gt;
&lt;value&gt; Specifies a value to use for the specified
attribute in prefer- ence to that contained in the actual
entry. This option may be specified multiple times, for
different attributes. If nss_ldap was built without schema
mapping support, then this option is ignored.</p>

<p>nss_schema &lt;rfc2307bis|rfc2307&gt; If the value of
this option is rfc2307bis then support for the RFC2307bis
schema (distinguished names in groups) will be enabled.</p>

<p>nss_initgroups &lt;backlink&gt; This option directs the
nss_ldap implementation of initgroups(3) to determine a
users group membership by reading the memberOf attribute of
their directory entry (and of any nested groups), rather
than querying on uniqueMember. This may provide increased
performance with certain directory servers that have
peculiar indexing configurations. If RFC2307bis support is
disabled, then this option is ignored.</p>

<p>nss_initgroups_ignoreusers &lt;user1,user2,...,userN&gt;
This option directs the nss_ldap implementation of
initgroups(3) to return NSS_STATUS_NOTFOUND if called with a
listed users as its argument.</p>

<p>nss_check_case &lt;yes|no&gt; This option directs the
nss_ldap module to check that results it retrieves from the
server exactly match the name for which it searched for
data.</p>

<p>nss_getgrent_skipmembers &lt;yes|no&gt; Specifies
whether or not to populate the members list in the group
structure for group lookups. If very large groups are
present, enabling this option will greatly increase
perforance, at the cost of some lost functionality. You
should verify no local applications rely on this information
before enabling this on a production system.</p>

<p>nss_srv_domain &lt;domain&gt; This option determines the
DNS domain used for performing SRV lookups.</p>
