<p>NAME mbsnrtowcs - convert a multibyte string to a wide
character string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t mbsnrtowcs(wchar_t *dest, const char **src,
size_t nms, size_t len, mbstate_t *ps);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mbsnrtowcs() function is like the
mbsrtowcs() function, except that the number of bytes to be
converted, starting at *src, is limited to nms.</p>

<p>If dest is not a NULL pointer, the mbsnrtowcs() function
converts at most nms bytes from the multibyte string *src to
a wide-character string starting at dest. At most len wide
characters are written to dest. The shift state *ps is
updated. The conversion is effectively performed by
repeatedly calling mbrtowc(dest,*src,n,ps) where n is some
positive number, as long as this call succeeds, and then
incrementing dest by one and *src by the number of bytes
consumed. The conversion can stop for three reasons:</p>

<p>1. An invalid multibyte sequence has been encountered.
In this case *src is left pointing to the invalid multibyte
sequence, (size_t)(-1) is returned, and errno is set to
EILSEQ.</p>

<p>2. The nms limit forces a stop, or len non-L wide
characters have been stored at dest. In this case *src is
left pointing to the next multibyte sequence to be
converted, and the number of wide characters written to dest
is returned.</p>

<p>3. The multibyte string has been completely converted,
including the terminating (which has the side effect of
bringing back *ps to the initial state). In this case *src
is set to NULL, and the number of wide characters written to
dest, excluding the terminating L char- acter, is
returned.</p>

<p>If dest is NULL, len is ignored, and the conversion
proceeds as above, except that the converted wide characters
are not written out to mem- ory, and that no destination
length limit exists.</p>

<p>In both of the above cases, if ps is a NULL pointer, a
static anonymous state only known to the mbsnrtowcs function
is used instead.</p>

<p>The programmer must ensure that there is room for at
least len wide characters at dest.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The mbsnrtowcs() function returns the
number of wide characters that make up the converted part of
the wide character string, not including the terminating
null wide character. If an invalid multibyte sequence was
encountered, (size_t)(-1) is returned, and errno set to
EILSEQ.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function is a GNU extension.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO iconv(3), mbsrtowcs(3)</p>

<p>NOTES The behaviour of mbsnrtowcs() depends on the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.</p>

<p>Passing NULL as ps is not multi-thread safe.</p>
