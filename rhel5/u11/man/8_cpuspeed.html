<p>CPUSPEED(8) Program Options CPUSPEED(8)</p>

<p>NAME cpuspeed - user-space cpu frequency scaling
program, v1.2.1</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cpuspeed [Options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cpuspeed v1.2.1</p>

<p>This program monitors the systems idle percentage and
reduces or raises the CPUs clock speeds and voltages
accordingly to minimize power consumption when idle and
maximize performance when needed. This is the default.</p>

<p>The program may also optionally be configured to reduce
the CPUs clock speeds if the temperature gets too high, NOT
minimize their speeds if the computers AC adapter is
disconnected or maximize their speeds when the AC adapter is
connected.</p>

<p>By default this program will manage every CPU found in
the system.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>-d</p>

<p>Tells the process to daemonize itself (run in
background).</p>

<p>-i &lt;interval&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the interval between idle percentage tests and
possible speed changes in tenths of a second (default is
20).</p>

<p>-p &lt;fast up&gt; &lt;threshold&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the CPU idle percentage thresholds. &lt;fast up&gt;
is the idle</p>

<p>percentage below which a CPU will be set to the highest
possible speed. &lt;threshold&gt; is the idle percentage
above which a CPUs speed will be decreased and below which a
CPUs speed will be increased (defaults are 10 and 25).</p>

<p>-m &lt;minimum speed&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the minimum speed in KHz below which a CPU will not
be set.</p>

<p>-M &lt;maximum speed&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the maximum speed in KHz above which a CPU will not
be set.</p>

<p>-t &lt;temp file&gt; &lt;maxtemp&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the ACPI temperature file and the temperature at
which CPUs will be set to minimum speed.</p>

<p>-T &lt;interval&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the interval at which the temperature will be
polled in tenths of a second (default is 10). (Requires the
-t option above.)</p>

<p>-a &lt;AC file&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the ACPI AC adapter state file and tells the
program to set the CPUs to minimum speed when the AC adapter
is disconnected. (This is the default but is changeable by
the -D option below).</p>

<p>-A &lt;interval&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the interval at which the AC adapter state will be
polled in tenths of a second (default is 50). (Requires the
-a option above.)</p>

<p>-C</p>

<p>Run at maximum speed when AC adapter is connected.
(Requires the -a option above.)</p>

<p>-D</p>

<p>Do NOT force minimum speed when AC adapter is
disconnected. (Requires the -a option above.)</p>

<p>-r</p>

<p>Restores previous speed on program exit.</p>

<p>-s &lt;CPU&gt;</p>

<p>Manage only a single CPU. &lt;CPU&gt; specifies the
number of the CPU</p>

<p>to manage and is in the range 0 to (n-1) where n is the
number of CPUs in the system. Without this option the
program creates copies of itself to manage every CPU in the
system.</p>

<p>To have a CPU stay at the highest clock speed to
maximize per- formance send the process controlling that CPU
the SIGUSR1 sig- nal.</p>

<p>To have a CPU stay at the lowest clock speed to maximize
battery life send the process controlling that CPU the
SIGUSR2 signal.</p>

<p>To resume having a CPUs clock speed dynamically scaled
send the process controlling that CPU the SIGHUP signal.</p>

<p>Notes: Many modern Linux systems support in-kernel cpu
frequency scaling. The cpuspeed daemon only works in
conjunction with the userspace fre- quency scaling governor.
Other governors, such as ondemand and con- servative , rely
on the Linux kernel to adjust cpu frequencies on the fly
without the need of any user-space assistance, such as that
pro- vided by cpuspeed.</p>

<p>Red Hat and Fedora distributions employ a unified
configuration file for both scenarios, as well as a cpuspeed
init script that will config- ure either cpuspeed or
in-kernel cpu frequency scaling, as appropriate.</p>
