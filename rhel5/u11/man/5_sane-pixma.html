<p>sane-pixma(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-pixma(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-pixma - SANE backend for Canon PIXMA MP
series</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-pixma library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
Canon PIXMA multi-function devices (All-in-one printers).
Currently, the following models work with this backend:</p>

<p>PIXMA MP150, PIXMA MP170, PIXMA MP450, PIXMA MP500 PIXMA
MP800, PIXMA MP830, MultiPASS MP700 (no grayscale), PIXMA
MP750 (no grayscale)</p>

<p>The following model are marked as experimental because
they are not well tested and/or the scanner sometimes hangs
and must be switched off and on. Therefore they are disabled
by default. (See PIXMA_EXPERIMENT below)</p>

<p>MultiPASS MP730, PIXMA MP760, PIXMA MP780</p>

<p>The backend supports * resolutions at
75,150,300,600,1200 and 2400 DPI, * color and grayscale
mode, * a custom gamma table with 4096 entries and *
automatic document feeder.</p>

<p>The device name is in the form pixma:xxxxyyyy_zzzzz
where x, y and z are vendor ID, product ID and serial number
respectively. Example: pixma:04A91709_123456 is a MP150.</p>

<p>This backend is in alpha stage and will stay in this
stage until we get the programming manual for the hardware.
Although we have tested it as good as we could, it will not
work in every situations. You will find an up-to-date status
at the project homepage. (See below)</p>

<p>OPTIONS Besides &quot;well-known&quot; options (e.g.
resolution, mode etc.) pixma backend also provides the
following experimental options for button handling, i.e. the
options might change in the future.</p>

<p>button-controlled This option can be used in combination
with scanadf(1) and scan- image(1) in batch mode, for
example when you want to scan many photos or multiple-page
documents. If it is enabled (i.e. is set to true or yes),
the backend waits before every scan until the user presses
the &quot;SCAN&quot; button (for MP150) or the color-scan
button (for other models). Just put the first page in the
scan- ner, press the button, then the next page, press the
button and so on. When you finished, press the gray-scan
button. (For MP150 you have to stop the frontend by pressing
Ctrl-C for example.)</p>

<p>button-update button-1 button-2 These options are
interesting for developers. To check button status: (1) set
button-1 and button-2 to zero, (2) set button- update (Its
type is SANE_TYPE_BUTTON.), (3) get button-1 and button-2.
If the result is not zero, the corresponding button was
pressed.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib*/sane/libsane-pixma.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib*/sane/libsane-pixma.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_PIXMA If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. Higher value
increases the verbosity.</p>

<p>0 print nothing 1 print error and warning messages
(recommended) 2 print informational messages 3 print
debug-level messages 10 dump USB traffics</p>

<p>PIXMA_EXPERIMENT Setting to a non-zero value will enable
the support for experi- mental models. You should also set
SANE_DEBUG_PIXMA to 10.</p>

<p>I would like to thank all testers and helpers. Without
them I would not be able to write subdrivers for models I
dont have. See also the project homepage.</p>
