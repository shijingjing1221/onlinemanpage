<p>NAME sendinpaths - Send Usenet Path statistics via
e-mail</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sendinpaths [-n]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sendinpaths checks pathlog/path for ninpaths
dump files, finds dump files generated in the past 30 days,
makes sure they are valid by run- ning ninpaths on each one
and making sure the exit status is zero, and passes them to
ninpaths to generate a cumulative report. That report is
mailed to the e-mail addresses configured at the beginning
of this script (by default
&quot;pathsurvey@top1000.org&quot; and
&quot;top1000@antholo- geek.net&quot;).</p>

<p>When finished, sendinpaths deletes all dump files in
pathlog/path that are older than 14 days (configurable at
the beginning of the script).</p>

<p>For more information on how to set up ninpaths, see
ninpaths(8).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -n Don t e-mail the report; instead, just print
it to standard output. Dont delete old dump files.</p>
