<p>NAME pnmconvol - general MxN convolution on a PNM
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmconvol</p>

<p>convolution_matrix_file [-nooffset] [pnmfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmconvol reads two PNM images as input, convolves the
second using the first, and writes a PNM image as
output.</p>

<p>Convolution means replacing each pixel with a weighted
average of the nearby pixels. The weights and the area to
average are determined by the convolution matrix (sometimes
called a convolution kernel), which you supply by way of the
PNM image in the file you identify with the
convolution_matrix_file argument. There are two ways
pnmconvol inter- prets the PNM convolution matrix image
pixels as weights: with offsets, and without offsets.</p>

<p>The simpler of the two is without offsets. That is what
happens when you specify the -nooffset option. In that case,
pnmconvol simply nor- malizes the sample values in the PNM
image by dividing by the maxval.</p>

<p>For example, here is a sample convolution file that
causes an output pixel to be a simple average of its
corresponding input pixel and its 8 neighbors, resulting in
a smoothed image:</p>

<p>P2 3 3 18 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2</p>

<p>(Note that the above text is an actual PGM file -- you
can cut and paste it. If you re not familiar with the plain
PGM format, see theP- GMformatspecification(1)).</p>

<p>pnmconvol divides each of the sample values (2) by the
maxval (18) so the weight of each of the 9 input pixels gets
is 1/9, which is exactly what you want to keep the overall
brightness of the image the same. pnmconvol creates an
output pixel by multiplying the values of each of 9 pixels
by 1/9 and adding.</p>

<p>Note that with maxval 18, the range of possible values
is 0 to 18. After scaling, the range is 0 to 1.</p>

<p>For a normal convolution, where youre neither adding nor
subtracting total value from the image, but merely moving it
around, youll want to make sure that all the scaled values
in (each plane of) your convolu- tion PNM add up to 1, which
means all the actual sample values add up to the maxval.</p>

<p>When you dont specify -nooffset, pnmconvol applies an
offset, the pur- pose of which is to allow you to indicate
negative weights even though PNM sample values are never
negative. In this case, pnmconvol sub- tracts half the
maxval from each sample and then normalizes by dividing by
half the maxval. So to get the same result as we did above
with -nooffset, the convolution matrix PNM image would have
to look like this:</p>

<p>P2 3 3 18 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10</p>

<p>To see how this works, do the above-mentioned offset: 10
- 18/2 gives 1. The normalization step divides by 18/2 = 9,
which makes it 1/9 - exactly what you want. The equivalent
matrix for 5x5 smoothing would have maxval 50 and be filled
with 26.</p>

<p>Note that with maxval 18, the range of possible values
is 0 to 18. After offset, thats -9 to 9, and after
normalizing, the range is -1 to 1.</p>

<p>For a normal convolution, where youre neither adding nor
subtracting total value from the image, but merely moving it
around, youll want to make sure that all the offset, scaled
values in (each plane of) your convolution PNM add up to 1.
That means the actual sample values, less half the maxval,
add up to half the maxval as in the example above.</p>

<p>The convolution file will usually be a PGM, so that the
same convolu- tion gets applied to each color component.
However, if you want to use a PPM and do a different
convolution to different colors, you can cer- tainly do
that.</p>

<p>At the edges of the convolved image, where the
convolution matrix would extend over the edge of the image,
pnmconvol just copies the input pix- els directly to the
output.</p>

<p>The convolution computation can result in a value which
is outside the range representable in the output. When that
happens, pnmconvol just clips the output, which means
brightness is not conserved.</p>

<p>HISTORY The -nooffset option was new in Netpbm 10.23
(July 2004).</p>
