<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

no decoded file is written)</p>

<p>-a, --analyze Analyze a FLAC encoded file (same as -d
except an analysis file is written)</p>

<p>-c, --stdout Write output to stdout</p>

<p>-s, --silent Silent mode (do not write runtime
encode/decode statistics to stderr)</p>

<p>--totally-silent Do not print anything of any kind,
including warnings or errors. The exit code will be the only
way to determine successful com- pletion.</p>

<p>-f, --force Force overwriting of output files. By
default, flac warns that the output file already exists and
continues to the next file.</p>

<p>-o filename, --output-name=filename Force the output
file name (usually flac just changes the exten- sion). May
only be used when encoding a single file. May not be used in
conjunction with --output-prefix.</p>

<p>--output-prefix=string Prefix each output file name with
the given string. This can be useful for encoding or
decoding files to a different directory. Make sure if your
string is a path name that it ends with a trailing /
(slash).</p>

<p>--delete-input-file Automatically delete the input file
after a successful encode or decode. If there was an error
(including a verify error) the input file is left
intact.</p>

<p>--skip={#|mm:ss.ss} Skip over the first number of
samples of the input. This works for both encoding and
decoding, but not testing. The alterna- tive form mm:ss.ss
can be used to specify minutes, seconds, and fractions of a
second.</p>

<p>--until={#|[+|-]mm:ss.ss} Stop at the given sample
number for each input file. This works for both encoding and
decoding, but not testing. The given sam- ple number is not
included in the decoded output. The alterna- tive form
mm:ss.ss can be used to specify minutes, seconds, and
fractions of a second. If a + (plus) sign is at the begin-
ning, the --until point is relative to the --skip point. If
a - (minus) sign is at the beginning, the --until point is
rela- tive to end of the audio.</p>

<p>--ogg When encoding, generate Ogg FLAC output instead of
native FLAC. Ogg FLAC streams are FLAC streams wrapped in an
Ogg transport layer. The resulting file should have an .ogg
extension and will still be decodable by flac.</p>

<p>When decoding, force the input to be treated as Ogg
FLAC. This is useful when piping input from stdin or when
the filename does not end in .ogg.</p>

<p>--serial-number=# When used with --ogg, specifies the
serial number to use for the first Ogg FLAC stream, which is
then incremented for each addi- tional stream. When encoding
and no serial number is given, flac uses a random number for
the first stream, then increments it for each additional
stream. When decoding and no number is given, flac uses the
serial number of the first page.</p>

<p>ANALYSIS OPTIONS --residual-text Includes the residual
signal in the analysis file. This will make the file very
big, much larger than even the decoded file.</p>

<p>--residual-gnuplot Generates a gnuplot file for every
subframe; each file will con- tain the residual distribution
of the subframe. This will cre- ate a lot of files.</p>

<p>DECODING OPTIONS --cue=[#.#][-[#.#]] Set the beginning
and ending cuepoints to decode. The optional first #.# is
the track and index point at which decoding will start; the
default is the beginning of the stream. The optional second
#.# is the track and index point at which decoding will end;
the default is the end of the stream. If the cuepoint does
not exist, the closest one before it (for the start point)
or after it (for the end point) will be used. If those dont
exist, the start of the stream (for the start point) or end
of the stream (for the end point) will be used. The
cuepoints are merely translated into sample numbers then
used as --skip and --until.</p>

<p>-F, --decode-through-errors By default flac stops
decoding with an error and removes the partially decoded
file if it encounters a bitstream error. With -F, errors are
still printed but flac will continue decoding to completion.
Note that errors may cause the decoded audio to be missing
some samples or have silent sections.</p>

<p>ENCODING OPTIONS -V, --verify Verify a correct encoding
by decoding the output in parallel and comparing to the
original</p>

<p>--lax Allow encoder to generate non-Subset files. The
resulting FLAC file may not be streamable or might have
trouble being played in all players (especially hardware
devices), so you should only use this option in combination
with custom encoding options meant for archival.</p>

<p>--replay-gain Calculate ReplayGain values and store in
Vorbis comments, simi- lar to vorbisgain. Title gains/peaks
will be computed for each input file, and an album gain/peak
will be computed for all files. All input files must have
the same resolution, sample rate, and number of channels.
Only mono and stereo files are allowed, and the sample rate
must be one of 8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, or 48
kHz. Also note that this option may leave a few extra bytes
in a PADDING block as the exact size of the tags is not
known until all files are processed. Note that this option
cannot be used when encoding to standard output
(stdout).</p>

<p>--cuesheet=filename Import the given cuesheet file and
store it in a CUESHEET meta- data block. This option may
only be used when encoding a single file. A seekpoint will
be added for each index point in the cuesheet to the
SEEKTABLE unless --no-cued-seekpoints is speci- fied.</p>

<p>--sector-align Align encoding of multiple CD format WAVE
files on sector bound- aries. See the HTML documentation for
more information.</p>

<p>-S {#|X|#x|#s}, --seekpoint={#|X|#x|#s} Include a point
or points in a SEEKTABLE. Using #, a seek point at that
sample number is added. Using X, a placeholder point is
added at the end of a the table. Using #x, # evenly spaced
seek points will be added, the first being at sample 0.
Using #s, a seekpoint will be added every # seconds (# does
not have to be a whole number; it can be, for example, 9.5,
meaning a seekpoint every 9.5 seconds). You may use many -S
options; the resulting SEEKTABLE will be the unique-ified
union of all such values. With no -S options, flac defaults
to -S 10s. Use --no-seek- table for no SEEKTABLE. Note: -S
#x and -S #s will not work if the encoder can t determine
the input size before starting. Note: if you use -S # and #
is &gt;= samples in the input, there will be either no seek
point entered (if the input size is determinable before
encoding starts) or a placeholder point (if input size is
not determinable).</p>

<p>-P #, --padding=# Tell the encoder to write a PADDING
metadata block of the given length (in bytes) after the
STREAMINFO block. This is useful if you plan to tag the file
later with an APPLICATION block; instead of having to
rewrite the entire file later just to insert your block, you
can write directly over the PADDING block. Note that the
total length of the PADDING block will be 4 bytes longer
than the length given because of the 4 metadata block header
bytes. You can force no PADDING block at all to be written
with --no-padding. The encoder writes a PADDING block of
4096 bytes by default.</p>

<p>-T FIELD=VALUE, --tag=FIELD=VALUE Add a Vorbis comment.
The comment must adhere to the Vorbis comment spec; i.e. the
FIELD must contain only legal characters, terminated by an
equals sign. Make sure to quote the comment if necessary.
This option may appear more than once to add sev- eral
comments. NOTE: all tags will be added to all encoded
files.</p>

<p>-b #, --blocksize=# Specify the block size in samples.
The default is 1152 for -l 0, else 4608; must be one of 192,
576, 1152, 2304, 4608, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192,
16384, or 32768 (unless --lax is used)</p>

<p>-m, --mid-side Try mid-side coding for each frame
(stereo input only)</p>

<p>-M, --adaptive-mid-side Adaptive mid-side coding for all
frames (stereo input only)</p>

<p>-0..-8, --compression-level-0..--compression-level-8
Fastest compression..highest compression (default is -5).
These are synonyms for other options:</p>

<p>-0, --compression-level-0 Synonymous with -l 0 -b 1152

<p>-2, --compression-level-2 Synonymous with -l 0 -b 1152
-m -r 3</p>

<p>-3, --compression-level-3 Synonymous with -l 6 -b 4608
-r 3,3</p>

<p>-4, --compression-level-4 Synonymous with -l 8 -b 4608
-M -r 3,3</p>

<p>-5, --compression-level-5 Synonymous with -l 8 -b 4608

<p>-6, --compression-level-6 Synonymous with -l 8 -b 4608
-m -r 4</p>

<p>-7, --compression-level-7 Synonymous with -l 8 -b 4608
-m -e -r 6</p>

<p>-8, --compression-level-8 Synonymous with -l 12 -b 4608
-m -e -r 6</p>

<p>--fast Fastest compression. Currently synonymous with
-0.</p>

<p>--best Highest compression. Currently synonymous with
-8.</p>

<p>-e, --exhaustive-model-search Do exhaustive model search
(expensive!)</p>

<p>-l #, --max-lpc-order=# Set the maximum LPC order; 0
means use only the fixed predictors</p>

<p>-p, --qlp-coeff-precision-search Do exhaustive search of
LP coefficient quantization (expen- sive!). Overrides -q;
does nothing if using -l 0</p>

<p>-q #, --qlp-coeff-precision=# Precision of the quantized
linear-predictor coefficients, 0 =&gt; let encoder decide
(min is 5, default is 0)</p>

<p>-r [#,]#, --rice-partition-order=[#,]# Set the [min,]max
residual partition order (0..16). min defaults to 0 if
unspecified. Default is -r 3,3.</p>

<p>FORMAT OPTIONS --endian={big|little} Set the byte order
for samples</p>

<p>--channels=# Set number of channels.</p>

<p>--bps=# Set bits per sample.</p>

<p>--sample-rate=# Set sample rate (in Hz).</p>

<p>--sign={signed|unsigned} Set the sign of samples (the
default is signed).</p>

<p>--input-size=# Specify the size of the raw input in
bytes. If you are encoding raw samples from stdin, you must
set this option in order to be able to use --skip, --until,
--cue-sheet, or other options that need to know the size of
the input beforehand. If the size given is greater than what
is found in the input stream, the encoder will complain
about an unexpected end-of-file. If the size given is less,
samples will be truncated.</p>

<p>--force-aiff-format Force the decoder to output AIFF
format. This option is not needed if the output filename (as
set by -o) ends with .aiff. Also, this option has no effect
when encoding since input AIFF is auto-detected.</p>

<p>--force-raw-format Force input (when encoding) or output
(when decoding) to be treated as raw samples (even if
filename ends in .wav).</p>

<p>NEGATIVE OPTIONS --no-adaptive-mid-side</p>

<p>--no-decode-through-errors</p>

<p>--no-delete-input-file</p>

<p>--no-exhaustive-model-search</p>

<p>--no-lax</p>

<p>--no-mid-side</p>

<p>--no-ogg</p>

<p>--no-padding</p>

<p>--no-qlp-coeff-precision-search</p>

<p>--no-residual-text</p>

<p>--no-sector-align</p>

<p>--no-seektable</p>

<p>--no-verify These flags can be used to invert the sense
of the corresponding normal option.</p>
