<p>GETPWNAM(3) Linux Programmer s Manual GETPWNAM(3)</p>

<p>NAME getpwnam, getpwnam_r, getpwuid, getpwuid_r - get
password file entry</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;pwd.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct passwd *getpwnam(const char *name);</p>

<p>struct passwd *getpwuid(uid_t uid);</p>

<p>int getpwnam_r(const char *name, struct passwd *pwbuf,
char *buf, size_t buflen, struct passwd **pwbufp);</p>

<p>int getpwuid_r(uid_t uid, struct passwd *pwbuf, char
*buf, size_t buflen, struct passwd **pwbufp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getpwnam() function returns a pointer to
a structure containing the broken-out fields of the record
in the password database (e.g., the local password file
/etc/passwd, NIS, and LDAP) that matches the user name
name.</p>

<p>The getpwuid() function returns a pointer to a structure
containing the broken-out fields of the record in the
password database that matches the user ID uid.</p>

<p>The getpwnam_r() and getpwuid_r() functions obtain the
same informa- tion, but store the retrieved passwd structure
in the space pointed to by pwbuf. This passwd structure
contains pointers to strings, and these strings are stored
in the buffer buf of size buflen. A pointer to the result
(in case of success) or NULL (in case no entry was found or
an error occurred) is stored in *pwbufp.</p>

<p>The passwd structure is defined in &lt;pwd.h&gt; as
follows:</p>

<p>struct passwd { char *pw_name; /* user name */ char
*pw_passwd; /* user password */ uid_t pw_uid; /* user ID */
gid_t pw_gid; /* group ID */ char *pw_gecos; /* real name */
char *pw_dir; /* home directory */ char *pw_shell; /* shell
program */ };</p>

<p>The maximum needed size for buf can be found using
sysconf(3) with the _SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX parameter.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The getpwnam() and getpwuid() functions
return a pointer to a passwd structure, or NULL if the
matching entry is not found or an error occurs. If an error
occurs, errno is set appropriately. If one wants to check
errno after the call, it should be set to zero before the
call.</p>

<p>The return value may point to static area, and may be
overwritten by subsequent calls to getpwent(), getpwnam(),
or getpwuid().</p>

<p>The getpwnam_r() and getpwuid_r() functions return zero
on success. In case of error, an error number is
returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS 0 or ENOENT or ESRCH or EBADF or EPERM or ... The
given name or uid was not found.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught.</p>

<p>EIO I/O error.</p>

<p>EMFILE The maximum number (OPEN_MAX) of files was open
already in the calling process.</p>

<p>ENFILE The maximum number of files was open already in
the system.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory to allocate passwd
structure.</p>

<p>ERANGE Insufficient buffer space supplied.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd local password database file</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001</p>

<p>NOTES The formulation given above under &quot;RETURN
VALUE&quot; is from POSIX.1-2001. It does not call &quot;not
found&quot; an error, and hence does not specify what value
errno might have in this situation. But that makes it
impossible to recognize errors. One might argue that
according to POSIX errno should be left unchanged if an
entry is not found. Experiments on vari- ous Unix-like
systems show that lots of different values occur in this
situation: 0, ENOENT, EBADF, ESRCH, EWOULDBLOCK, EPERM and
probably others.</p>

<p>The pw_dir field contains the name of the initial
working directory of the user. Login programs use the value
of this field to initialize the HOME environment variable
for the login shell. An application that wants to determine
its user s home directory should inspect the value of HOME
(rather than the value getpwuid(getuid())-&gt;pw_dir) since
this allows the user to modify their notion of &quot;the
home directory&quot; during a login session. To determine
the (initial) home directory of another user, it is
necessary to use getpwnam(&quot;username&quot;)-&gt;pw_dir
or similar.</p>
