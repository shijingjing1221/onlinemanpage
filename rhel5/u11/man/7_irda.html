<p>NAME irda - The Linux-IrDA protocol stack</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;linux/irda.h&gt;</p>

<p>stream_s = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); seqpkt_s =
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0); dgram_s =
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IRDAPROTO_UNITDATA); ultra_s =
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IRDAPROTO_ULTRA);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Linux-IrDA is a complete implementation of
the various IrDA protocols and IrDA drivers for Linux.</p>

<p>The configuration of the low level of the IrDA stack
(IrDA ports) and the various IrDA drivers are described in
irattach(8).</p>

<p>The usage of the higher layers of the IrDA stack
(IrCOMM, IrLPT, IrNET, IrLAN, OBEX...) are described in
their respective man pages.</p>

<p>The core of the Linux-IrDA protocol stack is composed of
the IrLAP, IrLMP, IrTTP and IrIAS protocols and is
implemented as a kernel module. The programmer s interface
for the IrDA stack is socket based. For more information on
sockets, see socket(7).</p>

<p>Note that higher level IrDA protocols may offer a
different program- mer s interface. For example IrCOMM
offers a TTY based interface and OBEX is available through a
user space library.</p>

<p>SOCKETS TYPE The Linux-IrDA socket interface offers 4
types of sockets:</p>

<p>Stream socket - SOCK_STREAM, 0 Stream sockets provides a
reliable, stream oriented, full duplex connection between
two sockets on top of IrTTP, similar to TCP sockets. IrTTP
guarantees that the data arrives in order and manages flow
contol, IrLAP retransmits lost packets. Stream sockets does
not preserve record boundaries.</p>

<p>SeqPacket socket - SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0 SeqPacket sockets
provides a reliable, datagram oriented, full duplex
connection between two sockets on top of IrTTP. IrTTP
guarantees that the data arrives in order and manages flow
con- tol, IrLAP retransmits lost packets. SeqPacket sockets
preserve record boundaries. Large datagrams will be
fragmented as needed.</p>

<p>Datagram socket - SOCK_DGRAM, IRDAPROTO_UNITDATA
SeqPacket sockets provides a reliable, datagram oriented,
full duplex connection between two sockets on top of IrLMP.
There is no guarantees that the data arrives in order and
there is no flow contol, however IrLAP retransmits lost
packets. Datagram sockets preserve record boundaries. No
fragmentation is provided, datagrams larger than the IrDA
link MTU are truncated or discarded.</p>

<p>Ultra socket - SOCK_DGRAM, IRDAPROTO_ULTRA Ultra sockets
provides a connectionless, unreliable datagram packet
service on top of IrLAP-Ultra. Ultra datagrams are sent and
receive only when no IrLAP connection is established and
otherwise discarded. They are always transmitted at 9600
bauds. Datagrams may be lost, reordered, and there is no
flow control. Ultra sockets preserve record boundaries. No
fragmentation is provided, datagrams larger than the Ultra
MTU (382 bytes) are truncated or discarded.</p>

<p>ADDRESS FORMAT An IrDA socket address is defined as a
combination of an IrDA interface address and a service name.
Service names are automatically resolved to lsap through the
IrIAP protocol.</p>

<p>struct sockaddr_irda { sa_family_t sir_family; /*
AF_IRDA */ __u8 sir_lsap_sel; /* LSAP selector */ __u32
sir_addr; /* Device address */ char sir_name[25]; /* Usually
&lt;service&gt;:IrDA:TinyTP */ };</p>

<p>sin_family is always set to AF_IRDA. sir_lsap_sel is
usually not used. sir_addr is the address of the peer and
optional (and that case the first peer discoverd will be
used). sir_name is the service name of the socket.</p>

<p>SOCKET OPTIONS IrDA sockets supports some protocol
specific socket options that can be set with setsockopt(2)
and read with getsockopt(2). The socket option level for
IrDA is SOL_IRLMP.</p>

<p>Options that can be set:</p>

<p>IRLMP_IAS_SET Set an entry in the local IAS
database.</p>

<p>IRLMP_IAS_DEL Delete an entry from the local IAS
database.</p>

<p>IRLMP_MAX_SDU_SIZE Set maximum receive MTU for SeqPacket
sockets.</p>

<p>IRLMP_HINTS_SET Set IrDA hint bits to be advertised to
peers.</p>

<p>IRLMP_HINT_MASK_SET Set IrDA hint bits filter to be used
when performing discovery.</p>

<p>Options that can be get:</p>

<p>IRLMP_ENUMDEVICES Perform link level discovery and
return the content of the dis- covery log.</p>

<p>IRLMP_MAX_SDU_SIZE Get maximum receive MTU.</p>

<p>IRLMP_IAS_GET Get an entry from the local IAS
database.</p>

<p>IRLMP_IAS_QUERY Query an entry in IAS database of a peer
using IrIAP.</p>

<p>IRLMP_WAITDEVICE Block until a new device is discovered.
Experimental feature, use with caution.</p>
