<p>NAME adsl-connect - Shell script to manage a PPPoE
link</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS adsl-connect [config_file]</p>

<p>adsl-connect interface user [config_file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION adsl-connect is a shell script which manages
an ADSL connection using the Roaring Penguin user-space
PPPoE client. If you omit config_file, the default file
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ppp0 is used. If you
supply interface and user, then they override the Ethernet
inter- face and user-name settings in the configuration
file.</p>

<p>Note that normally, you should not invoke adsl-connect
directly. Instead, use adsl-start to bring up the ADSL
connection.</p>

<p>adsl-connect first reads a configuration file. It then
brings up a PPPoE connection. If the connection ever drops,
a message is logged to syslog, and adsl-connect
re-establishes the connection. In addition, each time the
connection is dropped or cannot be established, adsl-con-
nect executes the script /etc/ppp/adsl-lost if it exists and
is exe- cutable.</p>

<p>The shell script adsl-stop causes adsl-connect to break
out of its loop, bring the connection down, and exit.</p>

<p>TECHNICAL DETAILS adsl-connect uses the following shell
variables from the configuration file:</p>

<p>ETH The Ethernet interface connected to the ADSL modem
(for example, eth0).</p>

<p>USER The ADSL user-id (for example,
b1xxnxnx@sympatico.ca).</p>

<p>PIDFILE A file in which to write the process-ID of the
adsl-connect pro- cess (for example, /var/run/pppoe.pid).
Two additional files ($PIDFILE.pppd and $PIDFILE.pppoe) hold
the process-IDs of the pppd and pppoe processes,
respectively.</p>

<p>By using different configuration files with different
PIDFILE settings, you can manage multiple PPPoE connections.
Just specify the configura- tion file as an argument to
adsl-start and adsl-stop.</p>
