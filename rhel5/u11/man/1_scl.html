<p>NAME scl - Setup and run software from Software
Collection environment</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS scl &lt;action&gt; [&lt;collection1&gt;
&lt;collection2&gt; ...] &lt;command&gt;</p>

<p>scl &lt;action&gt; &lt;collection1&gt;
[&lt;collection2&gt; ...] -- &lt;command&gt;</p>

<p>scl {-l|--list}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents scl, a program
which is an utility for run- ning software packaged as a
Software Collection.</p>

<p>scl utility allows to execute an application which is
not located in the filesystem root hierarchy but is present
in an alternative loca- tion. This application can still use
and benefit from software installed in the root filesystem.
In order to let an application be visible to the system one
has to use scl utility as an interface.</p>

<p>&lt;action&gt; is a script name to execute in a bash
environment before the application itself takes in executed.
Currently only enable scriptlet is mandatory which is needed
to update search paths, etc.</p>

<p>One can enable more Software Collections if needed and
therefore one can use multiple collections which are enabled
by the left-right order as present on scl command-line.</p>

<p>&lt;command&gt; is an arbitrary command or set of
commands to execute within the Software Collection
environment enabled. Control is returned back to the caller
with the original environment as soon as the command fin-
ishes. It &lt;command&gt; is - (dash) then it is read from
the standard input.</p>

<p>Note that if you use &lt;command&gt; consisting of
multiple arguments, you either need to use quotes or the --
command separator. Everything that follows the separator
will be considered a command or its argument.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -l, --list Lists all installed Software
Collections on the system. If a collection name is specified
then list of installed packages belonging to the collection
is listed.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES scl enable example less --version runs command
less --version in the environment with collection example
enabled</p>

<p>scl enable foo bar bash runs bash instance with foo and
bar Software Collections enabled</p>

<p>cat my_command | scl enable baz - run set of commands
listed in my_command file in the environment with baz
Software Collection enabled</p>

<p>scl -l list all installed collections</p>

<p>scl -l example list all packages within example
collection</p>
