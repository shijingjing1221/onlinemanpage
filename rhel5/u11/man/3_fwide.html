<p>NAME fwide - set and determine the orientation of a FILE
stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fwide(FILE *stream, int mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When mode is zero, the fwide() function
determines the current orienta- tion of stream. It returns a
value &gt; 0 if stream is wide-character ori- ented, i.e. if
wide character I/O is permitted but char I/O is disal-
lowed. It returns a value &lt; 0 if stream is byte oriented,
i.e. if char I/O is permitted but wide character I/O is
disallowed. It returns zero if stream has no orientation
yet; in this case the next I/O operation might change the
orientation (to byte oriented if it is a char I/O operation,
or to wide-character oriented if it is a wide character I/O
operation).</p>

<p>Once a stream has an orientation, it cannot be changed
and persists until the stream is closed.</p>

<p>When mode is non-zero, the fwide() function first
attempts to set stream s orientation (to wide-character
oriented if mode &gt; 0, or to byte oriented if mode &lt;
0). It then returns a value denoting the cur- rent
orientation, as above.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The fwide() function returns the streams
orientation, after possibly changing it. A return value &gt;
0 means wide-character oriented. A return value &lt; 0 means
byte oriented. A return value of zero means undecided.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO ISO/ANSI C, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO fprintf(3), fwprintf(3)</p>

<p>NOTES Wide-character output to a byte oriented stream
can be performed through the fprintf() function with the %lc
and %ls directives.</p>

<p>Char oriented output to a wide-character oriented stream
can be per- formed through the fwprintf() function with the
%c and %s directives.</p>
