<p>RNEWS(1) RNEWS(1)</p>

<p>NAME rnews - receive news from a UUCP connection</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rnews [ -h host ] [ -N ] [ -P port ] [ -r
remote ] [ -S remote ] [ -U ] [ -v ] [ input ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rnews reads messages typically queued by a
UUCP newsfeed and sends them to the InterNetNews server
(either localhost , or the value defined by the variable
&lt;nnrpdposthost in inn.conf&gt;.</p>

<p>The message is read from the specified input file, or
standard input if no input is named.</p>

<p>When sent over UUCP, Usenet articles are typically
joined in a single batch to reduce the UUCP overhead.
Batches can also be compressed, to reduce the communication
time. If a message does not start with a num- ber sign (#)
and an exclamation point, then the entire input is taken as
a single news article. If it does start with with those two
characters, then the first line is read and interpreted as a
batch com- mand.</p>

<p>If the command is #! rnews nnn where nnn is a number,
then the next nnn bytes (starting with the next line) are
read as a news article.</p>

<p>If the command is #! cunbatch then the rest of input is
fed to the compress(1) program with the -d flag to
uncompress it, and the out- put of this pipe is read as
rnewss input. This is for historical com- patibility there
is no program named cunbatch. A compressed batch will start
with a #! cunbatch line, then contain a series of arti- cles
separated by #! rnews nnn lines. If &lt;DO_RNEWSPROGS in
include/config.h&gt; is defined and the command is any other
word, then rnews will try to execute a program with that
name in the directory &lt;pathbin in
inn.conf&gt;/bin/rnews.libexec.</p>

<p>The batch will be fed into the program s standard input,
and the stan- dard output will be read back as input into
rnews. If &lt;DO_RNEWS_SAVE_BAD in include/config.h&gt; is
defined and rnews detects any problems with an article such
as a missing header, or an unintelli- gible reply from the
server, it will save a copy of the article in the
&lt;pathincoming in inn.conf&gt;/bad directory.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h If the -h flag is given, then rnews will log
the Message-ID and host via syslog(3) for each article
offered to the server. Logging will only be done if the
value is not an empty string. If -h is not set, the
environment variable &lt;_ENV_UUCPHOST in
include/paths.h&gt; (typically $UU_MACHINE) will be examined
for a similar string.</p>

<p>-N Normally, if unpacking the input fails it is
re-spooled to &lt;pathincoming in inn.conf&gt; for another
attempt later. If the -N flag is used then no such
re-spooling is done and rnews exits with status value 9 to
indicate this.</p>

<p>-P If the -P flag is used, then the articles will be
sent to the specified port on the remote host.</p>

<p>-r If the -r flag is used, then the articles will be
sent to the named remote host instead of the default
host.</p>

<p>-S -S flag is equivalent to -r flag.</p>

<p>-U If the server is not available, the message is
spooled into a new file created in the &lt;pathincoming in
inn.conf&gt; directory. The -U flag may be used to send all
spooled messages to the server once it becomes available
again, and can be invoked regu- larly by cron(8).</p>

<p>-v If the -v flag is used, it will print a notice of all
errors on the standard error, naming the input file (if
known) and printing the first few characters of the input.
Errors are always logged through syslog(3).</p>

<p>BUGS Rnews cannot process articles that have embedded
characters in them.</p>
