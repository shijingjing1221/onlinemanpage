<p>gnutls_safe_negotiation_set_initial(gnutgnutls_safe_negotiation_set_initial(3)</p>

<p>NAME gnutls_safe_negotiation_set_initial - API
function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>void
gnutls_safe_negotiation_set_initial(gnutls_session_t
session, int value);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a gnutls_session_t
structure.</p>

<p>int value 0 to disable and 1 to enable</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Used to enable and disable initial safe
renegotiation for the current session. By default it is
allowed for a client or server to not adver- tise safe
renegotiation capability. Note however that the client can
not tell whether it is currently under attack or not and so
this default will be changed for clients as soon as the
unsafe servers are not widely deployed anymore. There might
be also cases where signalling a client of its insecurity by
rejecting session by the servers might be beneficial.</p>
