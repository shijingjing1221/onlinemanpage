<p>LISTEN(2) Linux Programmer s Manual LISTEN(2)</p>

<p>NAME listen - listen for connections on a socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION To accept connections, a socket is first
created with socket(2), a willingness to accept incoming
connections and a queue limit for incom- ing connections are
specified with listen(), and then the connections are
accepted with accept(2). The listen() call applies only to
sockets of type SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET.</p>

<p>The backlog parameter defines the maximum length the
queue of pending connections may grow to. If a connection
request arrives with the queue full the client may receive
an error with an indication of ECON- NREFUSED or, if the
underlying protocol supports retransmission, the request may
be ignored so that retries succeed.</p>

<p>NOTES The behaviour of the backlog parameter on TCP
sockets changed with Linux 2.2. Now it specifies the queue
length for completely estab- lished sockets waiting to be
accepted, instead of the number of incom- plete connection
requests. The maximum length of the queue for incom- plete
sockets can be set using the tcp_max_syn_backlog sysctl.
When syncookies are enabled there is no logical maximum
length and this sysctl setting is ignored. See tcp(7) for
more information.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EADDRINUSE Another socket is already listening on
the same port.</p>

<p>EBADF The argument sockfd is not a valid descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The argument sockfd is not a socket.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The socket is not of a type that supports the
listen() opera- tion.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.4BSD, POSIX.1-2001. The listen()
function call first appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>BUGS If the socket is of type AF_INET, and the backlog
argument is greater than the constant SOMAXCONN (128 in
Linux 2.0 &amp; 2.2), it is silently truncated to
SOMAXCONN.</p>
