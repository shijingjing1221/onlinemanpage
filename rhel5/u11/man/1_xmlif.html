<p>NAME xmlif - conditional processing instructions for
XML</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xmlif [attrib=value...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xmlif filters XML according to
conditionalizing markup. This can be useful for formatting
one of several versions of an XML document depending on
conditions passed to the command.</p>

<p>Attribute/value pairs from the command line are matched
against the attributes associated with certain processing
instructions in the document. The instructions are
&lt;?xmlif if?&gt; and its inverse &lt;?xmlif if not?&gt;,
&lt;?xmlif elif?&gt; and its inverse &lt;?xmlif elif
not?&gt;, &lt;?xmlif else?&gt;, and &lt;?xmlif fi?&gt;.</p>

<p>Argument/value pairs given on the command line are
checked against the value of corresponding attributes in the
conditional processing instructions. An attribute match
happens if an attribute occurs in both the command-line
arguments and the tag, and the values match. An attribute
mismatch happens if an attribute occurs in both the
command-line arguments and the tag, but the values do not
match.</p>

<p>Spans between &lt;?xmlif if?&gt; or &lt;?xmlif elif?&gt;
and the next conditional processing instruction at the same
nesting level are passed through unaltered if there is at
least one attribute match and no attribute mismatch; spans
between &lt;?xmlif if not?&gt; and &lt;?xmlif elif not?&gt;
and the next conditional processing instruction are passed
otherwise. Spans between &lt;?xmlif else?&gt; and the next
conditional-processing tag are passed through only if no
previous span at the same level has been passed through.
&lt;?xmlif if?&gt; and &lt;?xmlif fi?&gt; (and their not
variants) change the current nesting level; &lt;?xmlif
else?&gt; and &lt;?xmlif elif?&gt; do not.</p>

<p>All these processing instructions will be removed from
the output produced. Aside from the conditionalization, all
other input is passed through untouched; in particular,
entity references are not resolved.</p>

<p>Value matching is by string equality, except that
&quot;|&quot; in an attribute value is interpreted as an
alternation character. Thus, saying foo=red|blue on the
command line enables conditions red and blue. Saying color=
black|white in a tag matches command-line conditions
color=black and color=white.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<p>Always issue this text. &lt;?xmlif if
condition=html?&gt; Issue this text if condition=html is
given on the command line. &lt;?xmlif elif
condition=pdf|ps?&gt; Issue this text if condition=pdf or
condition=ps is given on the command line. &lt;?xmlif
else?&gt; Otherwise issue this text. &lt;?xmlif fi?&gt;
Always issue this text.</p>
