<p>INNFEED(1) INNFEED(1)</p>

<p>NAME innfeed - multi-host, multi-connection, streaming
NNTP feeder.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS innfeed [ -a spool-dir ] [ -b directory ] [ -C
] [ -c filename ] [ -d num ] [ -e bytes ] [ -h ] [ -l
filename ] [ -m ] [ -M ] [ -o bytes ] [ -p file ] [ -S file
] [ -x ] [ -y ] [ -z ] [ -v ] [ file ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Innfeed implements the NNTP protocol for
transferring news between com- puters. It handles the
standard IHAVE protocol as well as the CHECK/TAKETHIS
streaming extension. Innfeed can feed any number of remote
hosts at once and will open multiple connections to each
host if configured to do so. The only limitations are the
process limits for open file descriptors and memory.</p>

<p>As an alternative to using NNTP, INN may also be fed to
an IMAP server. This is done by using an executable called
imapfeed, which is identical to innfeed except for the
delivery process. The new version has two types of
connections: an LMTP connection to deliver regular messages
and an IMAP connection to handle control messages. The
startinnfeed process can then be told to start imapfeed
instead of innfeed. (See the INSTALL file for how to do
this.)</p>

<p>MODES Innfeed has three modes of operation: channel,
funnel-file and batch.</p>

<p>Channel mode is used when no filename is given on the
command line, the input-file keyword is not given in the
config file, and the -x option is not given. In channel mode
innfeed runs with stdin connected via a pipe to innd.
Whenever innd closes this pipe (and it has several reasons
during normal processing to do so), innfeed will exit. It
first will try to finish sending all articles it was in the
middle of trans- mitting, before issuing a QUIT command.
This means innfeed may take a while to exit depending on how
slow your peers are. It never (well, almost never) just
drops the connection.</p>

<p>The recommended way to restart innfeed when run in
channel mode is therefore to tell innd to close the pipe and
spawn a new innfeed pro- cess. This can be done with ctlinnd
flush &lt;feed&gt; where &lt;feed&gt; is the name of the
innfeed channel feed in newsfeeds.</p>

<p>Funnel-file mode is used when a filename is given as an
argument or the input-file keyword is given in the config
file. In funnel file mode it reads the specified file for
the same formatted information as innd would give in channel
mode. It is expected that innd is continu- ally writing to
this file, so when innfeed reaches the end of the file it
will check periodically for new information. To prevent the
funnel file from growing without bounds, you will need to
periodically move the file to the side (or simply remove it)
and have innd flush the file. Then, after the file is
flushed by innd, you can send innfeed a SIGALRM, and it too
will close the file and open the new file created by innd.
Something like:</p>

<p>innfeed -p /var/run/news/innfeed.pid my-funnel-file
&amp; while true; do sleep 43200 rm -f my-funnel-file
ctlinnd flush funnel-file-site kill -ALRM cat
/var/run/news/innfeed.pid done</p>

<p>Batch mode is used when the -x flag is used. In batch
mode innfeed will ignore stdin, and will simply process any
backlog created by a previously running innfeed. This mode
is not normally needed as innfeed will take care of backlog
processing.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION Innfeed expects a couple of things to be
able to run correctly: a directory where it can store
backlog files and a configuration file to describe which
peers it should handle.</p>

<p>The configuration file is described in innfeed.conf(5).
The -c option can be used to specify a different file.</p>

<p>For each peer (say, foo), innfeed manages up to 4 files
in the backlog directory: a foo.lock file, which prevents
other instances of innfeed from interfering with this one; a
foo.input file which has old article information innfeed is
reading for re-processing; a foo.output file where innfeed
is writing information on articles that couldn t be
processed (normally due to a slow or blocked peer); and a
foo file.</p>

<p>This last file (foo) is never created by innfeed, but if
innfeed notices it, it will rename it to foo.input at the
next opportunity and will start reading from it. This lets
you create a batch file and put it in a place where innfeed
will find it. You should never alter the .input or .output
files of a running innfeed.</p>

<p>The format of these last three files is one of the
following:</p>

<p>/path/to/article &lt;message-id&gt; @token@
&lt;message-id&gt;</p>

<p>This is the same as the first two fields of the lines
innd feeds to innfeed, and the same as the first two fields
of the lines of the batch file innd will write if innfeed is
unavailable for some reason. When innfeed processes its own
batch files it ignores everything after the first two
whitespace separated fields, so moving the innd-created
batch file to the appropriate spot will work, even though
the lines have extra fields.</p>

<p>The first field can also be a storage API token. The two
types of lines can be intermingled; innfeed will use the
storage manager if appropriate and otherwise treat the first
field as a filename to read directly.</p>

<p>Innfeed writes its current status to the file
innfeed.status (or the file given by the -S option). This
file contains details on the process as a whole, and on each
peer this instance of innfeed is manag- ing.</p>

<p>If innfeed is told to send an article to a host it is
not managing, then the article information will be put into
a file matching the pat- tern innfeed-dropped.* , with part
of the file name matching the pid of the innfeed process
that is writing to it. Innfeed will not process this file
except to write to it. If nothing is written to the file
then it will be removed if innfeed exits normally.</p>

<p>SIGNALS Upon receipt of a SIGALRM innfeed will close the
funnel-file specified on the command line, and will reopen
it (see funnel file description above).</p>

<p>Innfeed with catch SIGINT and will write a large
debugging snapshot of the state of the running system.</p>

<p>Innfeed will catch SIGHUP and will reload the config
file. See innfeed.conf(5) for more details.</p>

<p>Innfeed will catch SIGCHLD and will close and reopen all
backlog files.</p>

<p>Innfeed will catch SIGTERM and will do an orderly
shutdown.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of a SIGUSR1 innfeed will increment the
debugging level by one; receipt of a SIGUSR2 will decrement
it by one. The debugging level starts at zero (unless the -d
option it used), in which case no debugging information is
emitted. A larger value for the level means more debugging
information. Numbers up to 5 are currently useful.</p>

<p>SYSLOG ENTRIES There are 3 different categories of
syslog entries for statistics: Host, Connection and
Global.</p>

<p>The Host statistics are generated for a given peer at
regular intervals after the first connection is made (or, if
the remote is unreachable, after spooling starts). The Host
statistics give totals over all Con- nections that have been
active during the given time frame. For example (broken here
to fit the page, with vixie being the peer):</p>

<p>May 23 12:49:08 data innfeed[16015]: vixie checkpoint
seconds 1381 offered 2744 accepted 1286 refused 1021
rejected 437 missing 0 spooled 990 on_close 0 unspooled 240
deferred 10 requeued 25 queue 42.1/100:14,35,13,4,24,10</p>

<p>These meanings of these fields are:</p>

<p>seconds The time since innfeed connected to the host or
since the statistics were reset by a final log entry.</p>

<p>offered The number of IHAVE commands sent to the host if
it is not in streaming mode. The sum of the number of
TAKETHIS commands sent when no-CHECK mode is in effect plus
the number CHECK commands sent in streaming mode (when
no-CHECK mode is not in effect).</p>

<p>accepted The number of articles which were sent to the
remote host and accepted by it.</p>

<p>refused The number of articles offered to the host that
it it indi- cated it didnt want because it had already seen
the Message- ID. The remote host indicates this by sending a
435 response to an IHAVE command or a 438 response to a
CHECK command.</p>

<p>rejected The number of articles transferred to the host
that it did not accept because it determined either that it
already had the article or it did not want it because of the
articles Newsgroups: or Distribution: headers, etc. The
remote host indicates that it is rejecting the article by
sending a 437 or 439 response after innfeed sent the entire
article.</p>

<p>missing The number of articles which innfeed was told to
offer to the host but which were not present in the article
spool. These articles were probably cancelled or expired
before innfeed was able to offer them to the host.</p>

<p>spooled The number of article entries that were written
to the .out- put backlog file because the articles could not
either be sent to the host or be refused by it. Articles are
generally spooled either because new articles are arriving
more quickly than they can be offered to the host, or
because innfeed closed all the connections to the host and
pushed all the articles currently in progress to the .output
backlog file.</p>

<p>on_close The number of articles that were spooled when
innfeed closed all the connections to the host.</p>

<p>unspooled The number of article entries that were read
from the .input backlog file.</p>

<p>deferred The number of articles that the host told
innfeed to retry later by sending a 431 or 436 response.
Innfeed immediately puts these articles back on the tail of
the queue.</p>

<p>requeued The number of articles that were in progress on
connections when innfeed dropped those connections and put
the articles back on the queue. These connections may have
been broken by a network problem or became unresponsive
causing innfeed to time them out.</p>

<p>queue The first number is the average (mean) queue size
during the previous logging interval. The second number is
the maximum allowable queue size. The third number is the
percentage of the time that the queue was empty. The fourth
through sev- enth numbers are the percentages of the time
that the queue was &gt;0% to 25% full, 25% to 50% full, 50%
to 75% full, and 75% to &lt;100% full. The last number is
the percentage of the time that the queue was totally
full.</p>

<p>If the -z option is used (see below), then when the peer
stats are generated, each Connection will log its stats too.
For example, for connection number zero (from a set of
five):</p>

<p>May 23 12:49:08 data innfeed[16015]: vixie:0 checkpoint
seconds 1381 offered 596 accepted 274 refused 225 rejected
97</p>

<p>If you only open a maximum of one Connection to a
remote, then there will be a close correlation between
Connection numbers and Host num- bers, but in general you
cant tie the two sets of number together in any easy or very
meaningful way. When a Connection closes it will always log
its stats.</p>

<p>If all Connections for a Host get closed together, then
the Host logs its stats as final and resets its counters. If
the feed is so busy that there s always at least one
Connection open and running, then after some amount of time
(set via the config file), the Host stats are logged as
final and reset. This is to make generating higher level
stats from log files, by other programs, easier.</p>

<p>There is one log entry that is emitted for a Host just
after its last Connection closes and innfeed is preparing to
exit. This entry contains counts over the entire life of the
process. The seconds field is from the first time a
Connection was successfully built, or the first time
spooling started. If a Host has been completely idle, it
will have no such log entry.</p>

<p>May 23 12:49:08 data innfeed[16015]: decwrl global
seconds 1381 offered 34 accepted 22 refused 3 rejected 7
missing 0</p>

<p>The final log entry is emitted immediately before
exiting. It contains a summary of the statistics over the
entire life of the process.</p>

<p>Feb 13 14:43:41 data innfeed-0.9.4[22344]: ME global
seconds 15742 offered 273441 accepted 45750 refused 222008
rejected 3334 missing 217</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a The -a flag is used to specify the top of the
article spool tree. Innfeed does a chdir(2) to this
directory, so it should probably be an absolute path. The
default is &lt;patharti- cles in inn.conf&gt;.</p>

<p>-b The -b flag may be used to specify a different
directory for backlog file storage and retrieval. If the
path is relative then it is relative to &lt;pathspool in
inn.conf&gt;. The default is inn- feed.</p>

<p>-c The -c flag may be used to specify a different config
file from the default value. If the path is relative then it
is rela- tive to &lt;pathetc in inn.conf&gt;. The default is
innfeed.conf.</p>

<p>-C The -C flag is used to have innfeed simply check the
config file, report on any errors and then exit.</p>

<p>-d The -d flag may be used to specify the initial
logging level. All debugging messages go to stderr (which
may not be what you want, see the -l flag below).</p>

<p>-e The -e flag may be used to specify the size limit (in
bytes) for the .output backlog files innfeed creates. If the
output file gets bigger than 10% more than the given number,
innfeed will replace the output file with the tail of the
original ver- sion. The default value is 0, which means
there is no limit.</p>

<p>-h Use the -h flag to print the usage message.</p>

<p>-l The -l flag may be used to specify a different log
file from stderr. As innd starts innfeed with stderr
attached to /dev/null, using this option can be useful in
catching any abnormal error messages, or any debugging
messages (all nor- mal errors messages go to syslog).</p>

<p>-M If innfeed has been built with mmap support, then the
-M flag turns OFF the use of mmap(); otherwise it has no
effect.</p>

<p>-m The -m flag is used to turn on logging of all missing
arti- cles. Normally if an article is missing, innfeed keeps
a count, but logs no further information. When this flag is
used, details about message-id and expected pathname are
logged.</p>

<p>-o The -o flag sets a value of the maximum number of
bytes of article data innfeed is supposed to keep in memory.
This doesnt work properly yet.</p>

<p>-p The -p flag is used to specify the filename to write
the pid of the process into. A relative path is relative to
&lt;pathrun in inn.conf&gt;. The default is innfeed.pid.</p>

<p>-S The -S flag specifies the name of the file to write
the periodic staus to. If the path is relative it is
considered rel- ative to &lt;pathlog in inn.conf&gt;. The
default is innfeed.sta- tus.</p>

<p>-v When the -v flag is given, version information is
printed to stderr and then innfeed exits.</p>

<p>-x The -x flag is used to tell innfeed not to expect any
arti- cle information from innd but just to process any
backlog files that exist and then exit.</p>

<p>-y The -y flag is used to allow dynamic peer binding. If
this flag is used and article information is received from
innd that specifies an unknown peer, then the peer name is
taken to be the IP name too, and an association with it is
created. Using this it is possible to only have the global
defaults in the inn- feed.conf file, provided the peername
as used by innd is the same as the ip name. Note that
innfeed with -y and no peer in innfeed.conf would cause a
problem that innfeed drops the first article.</p>

<p>-z The -z flag is used to cause each connection, in a
parallel feed configuration, to report statistics when the
controller for the connections prints its statistics.</p>

<p>BUGS</p>

<p>When using the -x option, the config file entry s
initial-connec- tions field will be the total number of
connections created and used, no matter how many big the
batch file, and no matter how big the max- connectiond field
specifies. Thus a value of 0 for initial-connec- tions means
nothing will happen in -x mode.</p>

<p>Innfeed does not automatically grab the file out of
out.going--this needs to be prepared for it by external
means.</p>

<p>Probably too many other bugs to count.</p>

backlog files.</p>
