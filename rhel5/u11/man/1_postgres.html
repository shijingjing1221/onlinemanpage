<p>DESCRIPTION The postgres executable is the actual
PostgreSQL server process that processes queries. It is
normally not called directly; instead a post- master(1)
multiuser server is started.</p>

<p>The second form above is how postgres is invoked by the
postmaster(1) (only conceptually, since both postmaster and
postgres are in fact the same program); it should not be
invoked directly this way. The first form invokes the server
directly in interactive single-user mode. The primary use
for this mode is during bootstrapping by initdb(1). Some-
times it is used for debugging or disaster recovery.</p>

<p>When invoked in interactive mode from the shell, the
user can enter queries and the results will be printed to
the screen, but in a form that is more useful for developers
than end users. But note that run- ning a single-user server
is not truly suitable for debugging the server since no
realistic interprocess communication and locking will
happen.</p>

<p>When running a stand-alone server, the session user will
be set to the user with ID 1. This user does not actually
have to exist, so a stand- alone server can be used to
manually recover from certain kinds of accidental damage to
the system catalogs. Implicit superuser powers are granted
to the user with ID 1 in stand-alone mode.</p>

<p>OPTIONS When postgres is started by a postmaster(1) then
it inherits all options set by the latter. Additionally,
postgres-specific options can be passed from the postmaster
with the -o switch.</p>

<p>You can avoid having to type these options by setting up
a configura- tion file. See the documentation for details.
Some (safe) options can also be set from the connecting
client in an application-dependent way. For example, if the
environment variable PGOPTIONS is set, then libpq- based
clients will pass that string to the server, which will
interpret it as postgres command-line options.</p>

<p>GENERAL PURPOSE The options -A, -B, -c, -d, -D, -F, and
--name have the same meanings as the postmaster(1) except
that -d 0 prevents the server log level of the postmaster
from being propagated to postgres.</p>

<p>-e Sets the default date style to European, that is DMY
order- ing of input date fields. This also causes the day to
be printed before the month in certain date output formats.
See the documentation for more information.</p>

<p>-o filename Send all server log output to filename. If
postgres is running under the postmaster, this option is
ignored, and the stderr inherited from the postmaster is
used.</p>

<p>-P Ignore system indexes when reading system tables (but
still update the indexes when modifying the tables). This is
useful when recovering from damaged system indexes.</p>

<p>-s Print time information and other statistics at the
end of each command. This is useful for benchmarking or for
use in tuning the number of buffers.</p>

<p>-S work-mem Specifies the amount of memory to be used by
internal sorts and hashes before resorting to temporary disk
files. See the description of the work_mem configuration
parameter in the docu- mentation.</p>

<p>OPTIONS FOR STAND-ALONE MODE database Specifies the name
of the database to be accessed. If it is omitted it defaults
to the user name.</p>

<p>-E Echo all commands.</p>

<p>-N Disables use of newline as a statement delimiter.</p>

<p>SEMI-INTERNAL OPTIONS There are several other options
that may be specified, used mainly for debugging purposes.
These are listed here only for the use by Post- greSQL
system developers. Use of any of these options is highly
dis- couraged. Furthermore, any of these options may
disappear or change in a future release without notice.</p>

<p>-f { s | i | m | n | h } Forbids the use of particular
scan and join methods: s and i disable sequential and index
scans respectively, while n, m, and h disable nested-loop,
merge and hash joins respectively.</p>

<p>Note: Neither sequential scans nor nested-loop joins can
be dis- abled completely; the -fs and -fn options simply
discourage the optimizer from using those plan types if it
has any other alter- native.</p>

<p>-O Allows the structure of system tables to be modified.
This is used by initdb.</p>

<p>-p database Indicates that this process has been started
by a postmaster and specifies the database to use. etc.</p>

<p>-t pa[rser] | pl[anner] | e[xecutor] Print timing
statistics for each query relating to each of the major
system modules. This option cannot be used together with the
-s option.</p>

<p>-v protocol Specifies the version number of the
frontend/backend protocol to be used for this particular
session.</p>

<p>-W seconds As soon as this option is encountered, the
process sleeps for the specified amount of seconds. This
gives developers time to attach a debugger to the server
process.</p>

<p>--describe-config This option dumps out the server s
internal configuration vari- ables, descriptions, and
defaults in tab-delimited COPY format. It is designed
primarily for use by administration tools.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT PGDATA Default data directory location</p>

<p>For others, which have little influence during
single-user mode, see postmaster(1).</p>

<p>NOTES To cancel a running query, send the SIGINT signal
to the postgres pro- cess running that command.</p>

<p>To tell postgres to reload the configuration files, send
a SIGHUP sig- nal. Normally its best to SIGHUP the
postmaster instead; the postmas- ter will in turn SIGHUP
each of its children. But in some cases it might be
desirable to have only one postgres process reload the
config- uration files.</p>

<p>The postmaster uses SIGTERM to tell a postgres process
to quit normally and SIGQUIT to terminate without the normal
cleanup. These signals should not be used by users. It is
also unwise to send SIGKILL to a postgres process the
postmaster will interpret this as a crash in postgres, and
will force all the sibling postgres processes to quit as
part of its standard crash-recovery procedure.</p>

<p>USAGE Start a stand-alone server with a command like</p>

<p>postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data other-options
my_database</p>

<p>Provide the correct path to the database directory with
-D, or make sure that the environment variable PGDATA is
set. Also specify the name of the particular database you
want to work in.</p>

<p>Normally, the stand-alone server treats newline as the
command entry terminator; there is no intelligence about
semicolons, as there is in psql. To continue a command
across multiple lines, you must type back- slash just before
each newline except the last one.</p>

<p>But if you use the -N command line switch, then newline
does not termi- nate command entry. In this case, the server
will read the standard input until the end-of-file (EOF)
marker, then process the input as a single command string.
Backslash-newline is not treated specially in this case.</p>

<p>To quit the session, type EOF (Control+D, usually). If
youve used -N, two consecutive EOFs are needed to exit.</p>

<p>Note that the stand-alone server does not provide
sophisticated line- editing features (no command history,
for example).</p>
