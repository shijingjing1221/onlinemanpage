<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) GREP(1) GREP(1)</p>

<p>NAME grep, egrep, fgrep - print lines matching a
pattern</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS grep [options] PATTERN [FILE...] grep [options]
[-e PATTERN | -f FILE] [FILE...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Grep searches the named input FILEs (or
standard input if no files are named, or the file name - is
given) for lines containing a match to the given PATTERN. By
default, grep prints the matching lines.</p>

<p>In addition, two variant programs egrep and fgrep are
available. Egrep is the same as grep -E. Fgrep is the same
as grep -F.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A NUM, --after-context=NUM Print NUM lines of
trailing context after matching lines. Places a line
containing -- between contiguous groups of matches.</p>

<p>-a, --text Process a binary file as if it were text;
this is equivalent to the --binary-files=text option.</p>

<p>-B NUM, --before-context=NUM Print NUM lines of leading
context before matching lines. Places a line containing --
between contiguous groups of matches.</p>

<p>-C NUM, --context=NUM Print NUM lines of output context.
Places a line containing -- between contiguous groups of
matches.</p>

<p>-b, --byte-offset Print the byte offset within the input
file before each line of output.</p>

<p>--binary-files=TYPE If the first few bytes of a file
indicate that the file contains binary data, assume that the
file is of type TYPE. By default, TYPE is binary, and grep
normally outputs either a one-line mes- sage saying that a
binary file matches, or no message if there is no match. If
TYPE is without-match, grep assumes that a binary file does
not match; this is equivalent to the -I option. If TYPE is
text, grep processes a binary file as if it were text; this
is equivalent to the -a option. Warning: grep
--binary-files=text might output binary garbage, which can
have nasty side effects if the output is a terminal and if
the termi- nal driver interprets some of it as commands.</p>

<p>--colour[=WHEN], --color[=WHEN] Surround the matching
string with the marker find in GREP_COLOR environment
variable. WHEN may be never, always, or auto</p>

<p>-c, --count Suppress normal output; instead print a
count of matching lines for each input file. With the -v,
--invert-match option (see below), count non-matching
lines.</p>

<p>-D ACTION, --devices=ACTION If an input file is a
device, FIFO or socket, use ACTION to pro- cess it. By
default, ACTION is read, which means that devices are read
just as if they were ordinary files. If ACTION is skip,
devices are silently skipped.</p>

<p>-d ACTION, --directories=ACTION If an input file is a
directory, use ACTION to process it. By default, ACTION is
read, which means that directories are read just as if they
were ordinary files. If ACTION is skip, direc- tories are
silently skipped. If ACTION is recurse, grep reads all files
under each directory, recursively; this is equivalent to the
-r option.</p>

<p>-E, --extended-regexp Interpret PATTERN as an extended
regular expression (see below).</p>

<p>-e PATTERN, --regexp=PATTERN Use PATTERN as the pattern;
useful to protect patterns beginning with -.</p>

<p>-F, --fixed-strings Interpret PATTERN as a list of fixed
strings, separated by new- lines, any of which is to be
matched.</p>

<p>-P, --perl-regexp Interpret PATTERN as a Perl regular
expression.</p>

<p>-f FILE, --file=FILE Obtain patterns from FILE, one per
line. The empty file con- tains zero patterns, and therefore
matches nothing.</p>

<p>-G, --basic-regexp Interpret PATTERN as a basic regular
expression (see below). This is the default.</p>

<p>-H, --with-filename Print the filename for each
match.</p>

<p>-h, --no-filename Suppress the prefixing of filenames on
output when multiple files are searched.</p>

<p>--help Output a brief help message.</p>

<p>-I Process a binary file as if it did not contain
matching data; this is equivalent to the
--binary-files=without-match option.</p>

<p>-i, --ignore-case Ignore case distinctions in both the
PATTERN and the input files.</p>

<p>-L, --files-without-match Suppress normal output;
instead print the name of each input file from which no
output would normally have been printed. The scanning will
stop on the first match.</p>

<p>-l, --files-with-matches Suppress normal output; instead
print the name of each input file from which output would
normally have been printed. The scanning will stop on the
first match.</p>

<p>-m NUM, --max-count=NUM Stop reading a file after NUM
matching lines. If the input is standard input from a
regular file, and NUM matching lines are output, grep
ensures that the standard input is positioned to just after
the last matching line before exiting, regardless of the
presence of trailing context lines. This enables a calling
process to resume a search. When grep stops after NUM
matching lines, it outputs any trailing context lines. When
the -c or --count option is also used, grep does not output
a count greater than NUM. When the -v or --invert-match
option is also used, grep stops after outputting NUM
non-matching lines.</p>

<p>--mmap If possible, use the mmap(2) system call to read
input, instead of the default read(2) system call. In some
situations, --mmap yields better performance. However,
--mmap can cause undefined behavior (including core dumps)
if an input file shrinks while grep is operating, or if an
I/O error occurs.</p>

<p>-n, --line-number Prefix each line of output with the
line number within its input file.</p>

<p>-o, --only-matching Show only the part of a matching
line that matches PATTERN.</p>

<p>--label=LABEL Displays input actually coming from
standard input as input com- ing from file LABEL. This is
especially useful for tools like zgrep, e.g. gzip -cd foo.gz
|grep -H --label=foo something</p>

<p>--line-buffered Use line buffering, it can be a
performance penality.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet, --silent Quiet; do not write anything to
standard output. Exit immedi- ately with zero status if any
match is found, even if an error was detected. Also see the
-s or --no-messages option.</p>

<p>-R, -r, --recursive Read all files under each directory,
recursively; this is equiv- alent to the -d recurse
option.</p>

<p>--include=PATTERN Recurse in directories only searching
file matching PATTERN.</p>

<p>--exclude=PATTERN Recurse in directories skip file
matching PATTERN.</p>

<p>-s, --no-messages Suppress error messages about
nonexistent or unreadable files. Portability note: unlike
GNU grep, traditional grep did not con- form to POSIX.2,
because traditional grep lacked a -q option and its -s
option behaved like GNU grep s -q option. Shell scripts
intended to be portable to traditional grep should avoid
both -q and -s and should redirect output to /dev/null
instead.</p>

<p>-U, --binary Treat the file(s) as binary. By default,
under MS-DOS and MS- Windows, grep guesses the file type by
looking at the contents of the first 32KB read from the
file. If grep decides the file is a text file, it strips the
CR characters from the original file contents (to make
regular expressions with ^ and $ work correctly). Specifying
-U overrules this guesswork, causing all files to be read
and passed to the matching mechanism verbatim; if the file
is a text file with CR/LF pairs at the end of each line,
this will cause some regular expressions to fail. This
option has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and
MS-Win- dows.</p>

<p>-u, --unix-byte-offsets Report Unix-style byte offsets.
This switch causes grep to report byte offsets as if the
file were Unix-style text file, i.e. with CR characters
stripped off. This will produce results identical to running
grep on a Unix machine. This option has no effect unless -b
option is also used; it has no effect on platforms other
than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print the version number of grep to
standard error. This ver- sion number should be included in
all bug reports (see below).</p>

<p>-v, --invert-match Invert the sense of matching, to
select non-matching lines.</p>

<p>-w, --word-regexp Select only those lines containing
matches that form whole words. The test is that the matching
substring must either be at the beginning of the line, or
preceded by a non-word con- stituent character. Similarly,
it must be either at the end of the line or followed by a
non-word constituent character. Word- constituent characters
are letters, digits, and the underscore.</p>

<p>-x, --line-regexp Select only those matches that exactly
match the whole line.</p>

<p>-y Obsolete synonym for -i.</p>

<p>-Z, --null Output a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character)
instead of the character that normally follows a file name.
For example, grep -lZ outputs a zero byte after each file
name instead of the usual newline. This option makes the
output unambiguous, even in the presence of file names
containing unusual characters like newlines. This option can
be used with commands like find -print0, perl -0, sort -z,
and xargs -0 to process arbitrary file names, even those
that contain newline characters.</p>

<p>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS A regular expression is a pattern
that describes a set of strings. Regular expressions are
constructed analogously to arithmetic expres- sions, by
using various operators to combine smaller expressions.</p>

<p>Grep understands two different versions of regular
expression syntax: basic and extended. In GNU grep, there is
no difference in avail- able functionality using either
syntax. In other implementations, basic regular expressions
are less powerful. The following description applies to
extended regular expressions; differences for basic regular
expressions are summarized afterwards.</p>

<p>The fundamental building blocks are the regular
expressions that match a single character. Most characters,
including all letters and digits, are regular expressions
that match themselves. Any metacharacter with special
meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.</p>

<p>A bracket expression is a list of characters enclosed by
[ and ]. It matches any single character in that list; if
the first character of the list is the caret ^ then it
matches any character not in the list. For example, the
regular expression [0123456789] matches any single
digit.</p>

<p>Within a bracket expression, a range expression consists
of two charac- ters separated by a hyphen. It matches any
single character that sorts between the two characters,
inclusive, using the locales collating sequence and
character set. For example, in the default C locale, [a-d]
is equivalent to [abcd]. Many locales sort characters in
dictio- nary order, and in these locales [a-d] is typically
not equivalent to [abcd]; it might be equivalent to
[aBbCcDd], for example. To obtain the traditional
interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the C
locale by setting the LC_ALL environment variable to the
value C.</p>

<p>Finally, certain named classes of characters are
predefined within bracket expressions, as follows. Their
names are self explanatory, and they are [:alnum:],
[:alpha:], [:cntrl:], [:digit:], [:graph:], [:lower:],
[:print:], [:punct:], [:space:], [:upper:], and [:xdigit:].
For example, [[:alnum:]] means [0-9A-Za-z], except the
latter form depends upon the C locale and the ASCII
character encoding, whereas the former is independent of
locale and character set. (Note that the brackets in these
class names are part of the symbolic names, and must be
included in addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket
list.) Most metacharacters lose their special meaning inside
lists. To include a literal ] place it first in the list.
Similarly, to include a literal ^ place it anywhere but
first. Finally, to include a literal - place it last.</p>

<p>The period . matches any single character. The symbol336
for [[:alnum:]] andW is a synonym for [^[:alnum]].</p>

<p>The caret ^ and the dollar sign $ are metacharacters
that respectively match the empty string at the beginning
and end of a line. The symbols &lt; and&gt; respectively
match the empty string at the beginning and end b m a t c h
e s t h e e m p t y s of a word. The symbolt r i n g a t t h
e e d g e o f a word, and0not at the edge of a word.</p>

<p>A regular expression may be followed by one of several
repetition oper- ators: ? The preceding item is optional and
matched at most once. * The preceding item will be matched
zero or more times. + The preceding item will be matched one
or more times. {n} The preceding item is matched exactly n
times. {n,} The preceding item is matched n or more times.
{n,m} The preceding item is matched at least n times, but
not more than m times.</p>

<p>Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the
resulting regular expression matches any string formed by
concatenating two substrings that respectively match the
concatenated subexpressions.</p>

<p>Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix
operator |; the resulting regular expression matches any
string matching either subex- pression.</p>

<p>Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in
turn takes precedence over alternation. A whole
subexpression may be enclosed in parentheses to override
these precedence rules.</p>

<p>The backreferencen, where n is a single digit, matches
the substring previously matched by the nth parenthesized
subexpression of the regu- lar expression.</p>

<p>In basic regular expressions the metacharacters ?, +, {,
|, (, and ) lose their special meaning; instead use the
backslashed versions +{|,(, an).</p>

<p>Traditional egrep did not support the { metacharacter,
and some egrep implementations support{ instead, so portable
scripts should avoid { in egrep patterns and should use [{]
to match a literal {.</p>

<p>GNU egrep attempts to support traditional usage by
assuming that { is not special if it would be the start of
an invalid interval specifica- tion. For example, the shell
command egrep{1searches for the two- character string {1
instead of reporting a syntax error in the regular
expression. POSIX.2 allows this behavior as an extension,
but portable scripts should avoid it.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES Greps behavior is affected by the
following environment variables.</p>

<p>A locale LC_foo is specified by examining the three
environment variables LC_ALL, LC_foo, LANG, in that order.
The first of these variables that is set specifies the
locale. For example, if LC_ALL is not set, but LC_MESSAGES
is set to pt_BR, then Brazilian Portuguese is used for the
LC_MESSAGES locale. The C locale is used if none of these
environment variables are set, or if the locale catalog is
not installed, or if grep was not compiled with national
language support (NLS).</p>

<p>GREP_OPTIONS This variable specifies default options to
be placed in front of any explicit options. For example, if
GREP_OPTIONS is --binary-files=without-match
--directories=skip , grep behaves as if the two options
--binary-files=without-match and --direc- tories=skip had
been specified before any explicit options. Option
specifications are separated by whitespace. A backslash
escapes the next character, so it can be used to specify an
option containing whitespace or a backslash.</p>

<p>GREP_COLOR Specifies the marker for highlighting.</p>

<p>LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LANG These variables specify the
LC_COLLATE locale, which determines the collating sequence
used to interpret range expressions like [a-z].</p>

<p>LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG These variables specify the
LC_CTYPE locale, which determines the type of characters,
e.g., which characters are whitespace.</p>

<p>LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, LANG These variables specify the
LC_MESSAGES locale, which determines the language that grep
uses for messages. The default C locale uses American
English messages.</p>

<p>POSIXLY_CORRECT If set, grep behaves as POSIX.2
requires; otherwise, grep behaves more like other GNU
programs. POSIX.2 requires that options that follow file
names must be treated as file names; by default, such
options are permuted to the front of the operand list and
are treated as options. Also, POSIX.2 requires that
unrecognized options be diagnosed as illegal , but since
they are not really against the law the default is to
diagnose them as invalid . POSIXLY_CORRECT also disables
_N_GNU_nonop- tion_argv_flags_, described below.</p>

<p>_N_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_ (Here N is greps numeric
process ID.) If the ith character of this environment
variable s value is 1, do not consider the ith operand of
grep to be an option, even if it appears to be one. A shell
can put this variable in the environment for each com- mand
it runs, specifying which operands are the results of file
name wildcard expansion and therefore should not be treated
as options. This behavior is available only with the GNU C
library, and only when POSIXLY_CORRECT is not set.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Normally, exit status is 0 if selected lines
are found and 1 otherwise. But the exit status is 2 if an
error occurred, unless the -q or --quiet or --silent option
is used and a selected line is found.</p>

<p>BUGS Email bug reports to bug-grep@gnu.org.</p>

<p>Large repetition counts in the {n,m} construct may cause
grep to use lots of memory. In addition, certain other
obscure regular expressions require exponential time and
space, and may cause grep to run out of memory.</p>

<p>Backreferences are very slow, and may require
exponential time.</p>
