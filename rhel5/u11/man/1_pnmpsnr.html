<p>NAME pnmpsnr - compute the difference between two images
(the PSNR)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmpsnr</p>

<p>[pnmfile1]</p>

<p>[pnmfile2]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmpsnr reads two PBM, PGM, or PPM files, or PAM
equivalents, as input and prints the peak signal-to-noise
ratio (PSNR) difference between the two images. This metric
is typically used in image compression papers to rate the
distortion between original and decoded image.</p>

<p>If the inputs are PBM or PGM, pnmpsnr prints the PSNR of
the luminance only. Otherwise, it prints the separate PSNRs
of the luminance, and chrominance (Cb and Cr) components of
the colors.</p>

<p>The PSNR of a given component is the ratio of the mean
square differ- ence of the component for the two images to
the maximum mean square difference that can exist between
any two images. It is expressed as a decibel value.</p>

<p>The mean square difference of a component for two images
is the mean square difference of the component value,
comparing each pixel with the pixel in the same position of
the other image. For the purposes of this computation,
components are normalized to the scale [0..1].</p>

<p>The maximum mean square difference is identically 1.</p>

<p>So the higher the PSNR, the closer the images are. A
luminance PSNR of 20 means the mean square difference of the
luminances of the pixels is 100 times less than the maximum
possible difference, i.e. 0.01.</p>
