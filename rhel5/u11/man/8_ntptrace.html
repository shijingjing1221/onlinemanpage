<p>NAME ntptrace - trace a chain of NTP servers back to the
primary source</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ntptrace [ -n ] [ -m maxhosts ] [ server ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ntptrace determines where a given Network
Time Protocol (NTP) server gets its time from, and follows
the chain of NTP servers back to their master time source.
If given no arguments, it starts with localhost. Here is an
example of the output from ntptrace:</p>

<p>% ntptrace localhost: stratum 4, offset 0.0019529, synch
distance 0.144135 server2ozo.com: stratum 2, offset
0.0124263, synch distance 0.115784 usndh.edu: stratum 1,
offset 0.0019298, synch distance 0.011993, refid WWVB</p>

<p>On each line, the fields are (left to right): the host
name, the host stratum, the time offset between that host
and the local host (as mea- sured by ntptrace; this is why
it is not always zero for &quot;localhost&quot;), the host
synchronization distance, and (only for stratum-1 servers)
the reference clock ID. All times are given in seconds. Note
that the stra- tum is the server hop count to the primary
source, while the synchro- nization distance is the
estimated error relative to the primary source. These terms
are precisely defined in RFC-1305.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -n Turns off the printing of host names;
instead, host IP addresses are given. This may be useful if
a nameserver is down.</p>

<p>BUGS This program makes no attempt to improve accuracy
by doing multiple samples.</p>
