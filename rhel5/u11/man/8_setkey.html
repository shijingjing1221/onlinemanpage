<p>SETKEY(8) BSD System Manager s Manual SETKEY(8)</p>

<p>NAME setkey - manually manipulate the IPsec SA/SP
database</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS setkey [-knrv] file ... setkey [-knrv] -c
setkey [-krv] -f filename setkey [-aklPrv] -D setkey [-Pvp]
-F setkey [-H] -x setkey [-?V]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION setkey adds, updates, dumps, or flushes
Security Association Database (SAD) entries as well as
Security Policy Database (SPD) entries in the kernel.</p>

<p>setkey takes a series of operations from standard input
(if invoked with -c) or the file named filename (if invoked
with -f filename).</p>

<p>(no flag) Dump the SAD entries or SPD entries contained
in the specified file.</p>

<p>-? Print short help.</p>

<p>-a setkey usually does not display dead SAD entries with
-D. If -a is also specified, the dead SAD entries will be
displayed as well. A dead SAD entry is one that has expired
but remains in the system because it is referenced by some
SPD entries.</p>

<p>-D Dump the SAD entries. If -P is also specified, the
SPD entries are dumped. If -p is specified, the ports are
displayed.</p>

<p>-F Flush the SAD entries. If -P is also specified, the
SPD entries are flushed.</p>

<p>-H Add hexadecimal dump in -x mode.</p>

<p>-h On NetBSD, synonym for -H. On other systems, synonym
for -?.</p>

<p>-k Use semantics used in kernel. Available only in
Linux. See also -r.</p>

<p>-l Loop forever with short output on -D.</p>

<p>-n No action. The program will check validity of the
input, but no changes to the SPD will be made.</p>

<p>-r Use semantics described in IPsec RFCs. This mode is
default. For details see section RFC vs Linux kernel
semantics. Available only in Linux. See also -k.</p>

<p>-x Loop forever and dump all the messages transmitted to
the PF_KEY socket. -xx prints the unformatted
timestamps.</p>

<p>-V Print version string.</p>

<p>-v Be verbose. The program will dump messages exchanged
on the PF_KEY socket, including messages sent from other
processes to the kernel.</p>

<p>Configuration syntax With -c or -f on the command line,
setkey accepts the following configu- ration syntax. Lines
starting with hash signs (#) are treated as com- ment
lines.</p>

<p>add [-46n] src dst protocol spi [extensions] algorithm
... ; Add an SAD entry. add can fail for multiple reasons,
including when the key length does not match the specified
algorithm.</p>

<p>get [-46n] src dst protocol spi ; Show an SAD entry.</p>

<p>delete [-46n] src dst protocol spi ; Remove an SAD
entry.</p>

<p>deleteall [-46n] src dst protocol ; Remove all SAD
entries that match the specification.</p>

<p>flush [protocol] ; Clear all SAD entries matched by the
options. -F on the command line achieves the same
functionality.</p>

<p>dump [protocol] ; Dumps all SAD entries matched by the
options. -D on the command line achieves the same
functionality.</p>

<p>spdadd [-46n] src_range dst_range upperspec label policy
; Add an SPD entry.</p>

<p>spdadd tagged tag policy ; Add an SPD entry based on a
PF tag. tag must be a string sur- rounded by double
quotes.</p>

<p>spddelete [-46n] src_range dst_range upperspec -P
direction ; Delete an SPD entry.</p>

<p>spdflush ; Clear all SPD entries. -FP on the command
line achieves the same functionality.</p>

<p>spddump ; Dumps all SPD entries. -DP on the command line
achieves the same functionality.</p>

<p>Meta-arguments are as follows:</p>

<p>src dst Source/destination of the secure communication
is specified as an IPv4/v6 address, and an optional port
number between square brackets. setkey can resolve a FQDN
into numeric addresses. If the FQDN resolves into multiple
addresses, setkey will install multiple SAD/SPD entries into
the kernel by trying all possible combinations. -4, -6, and
-n restrict the address resolution of FQDN in certain ways.
-4 and -6 restrict results into IPv4/v6 addresses only,
respectively. -n avoids FQDN resolution and requires
addresses to be numeric addresses.</p>

<p>protocol protocol is one of following: esp ESP based on
rfc2406 esp-old ESP based on rfc1827 ah AH based on rfc2402
ah-old AH based on rfc1826 ipcomp IPComp tcp TCP-MD5 based
on rfc2385</p>

<p>spi Security Parameter Index (SPI) for the SAD and the
SPD. spi must be a decimal number, or a hexadecimal number
with a 0x prefix. SPI values between 0 and 255 are reserved
for future use by IANA and cannot be used. TCP-MD5
associations must use 0x1000 and therefore only have
per-host granularity at this time.</p>

<p>extensions take some of the following: -m mode Specify a
security protocol mode for use. mode is one of following:
transport, tunnel, or any. The default value is any. -r size
Specify window size of bytes for replay prevention. size
must be decimal number in 32-bit word. If size is zero or
not specified, replay checks dont take place. -u id Specify
the identifier of the policy entry in the SPD. See policy.
-f pad_option defines the content of the ESP padding.
pad_option is one of following: zero-pad All the paddings
are zero. random-pad A series of randomized values are used.
seq-pad A series of sequential increasing numbers started
from 1 are used. -f nocyclic-seq Dont allow cyclic sequence
numbers. -lh time -ls time Specify hard/soft life time
duration of the SA mea- sured in seconds. -bh bytes -bs
bytes Specify hard/soft life time duration of the SA mea-
sured in bytes transported. -ctx doi algorithm context-name
Specify an access control label. The access control label is
interpreted by the LSM (e.g., SELinux). Ultimately, it
enables MAC on network communications. doi The domain of
interpretation, which is used by the IKE daemon to identify
the domain in which negotiation takes place. algorithm
Indicates the LSM for which the label is generated (e.g.,
SELinux). context-name The string representation of the
label that is interpreted by the LSM.</p>

<p>algorithm -E ealgo key Specify an encryption algorithm
ealgo for ESP. -E ealgo key -A aalgo key Specify an
encryption algorithm ealgo, as well as a payload
authentication algorithm aalgo, for ESP. -A aalgo key
Specify an authentication algorithm for AH. -C calgo [-R]
Specify a compression algorithm for IPComp. If -R is
specified, the spi field value will be used as the IPComp
CPI (compression parameter index) on wire as- is. If -R is
not specified, the kernel will use well-known CPI on wire,
and spi field will be used only as an index for kernel
internal usage.</p>

<p>key must be a double-quoted character string, or a
series of hex- adecimal digits preceded by 0x.</p>

<p>Possible values for ealgo, aalgo, and calgo are
specified in the Algorithms sections.</p>

<p>src_range dst_range These select the communications that
should be secured by IPsec. They can be an IPv4/v6 address
or an IPv4/v6 address range, and may be accompanied by a
TCP/UDP port specification. This takes the following
form:</p>

<p>address address/prefixlen address[port]
address/prefixlen[port]</p>

<p>prefixlen and port must be decimal numbers. The square
brackets around port are really necessary, they are not man
page meta- characters. For FQDN resolution, the rules
applicable to src and dst apply here as well.</p>

<p>upperspec Upper-layer protocol to be used. You can use
one of the words in /etc/protocols as upperspec, or icmp6,
ip4, or any. any stands for any protocol . You can also use
the protocol number. You can specify a type and/or a code of
ICMPv6 when the upper-layer protocol is ICMPv6. The
specification can be placed after icmp6. A type is separated
from a code by single comma. A code must always be
specified. When a zero is specified, the kernel deals with
it as a wildcard. Note that the kernel can not distinguish a
wildcard from an ICPMv6 type of zero. For example, the
follow- ing means that the policy doesnt require IPsec for
any inbound Neighbor Solicitation. spdadd ::/0 ::/0 icmp6
135,0 -P in none;</p>

<p>Note: upperspec does not work against forwarding case at
this moment, as it requires extra reassembly at the
forwarding node (not implemented at this moment). There are
many protocols in /etc/protocols, but all protocols except
of TCP, UDP, and ICMP may not be suitable to use with IPsec.
You have to consider carefully what to use.</p>

<p>label label is the access control label for the policy.
This label is interpreted by the LSM (e.g., SELinux).
Ultimately, it enables MAC on network communications. When a
policy contains an access control label, SAs negotiated with
this policy will contain the label. Its format: -ctx doi
algorithm context-name doi The domain of interpretation,
which is used by the IKE daemon to identify the domain in
which negotiation takes place. algorithm Indicates the LSM
for which the label is generated (e.g., SELinux).
context-name The string representation of the label that is
interpreted by the LSM.</p>

<p>policy policy is in one of the following three
formats:</p>

<p>-P direction [priority specification] discard -P
direction [priority specification] none -P direction
[priority specification] ipsec protocol/mode/src-dst/level
[...]</p>

<p>You must specify the direction of its policy as
direction. Either out, in, or fwd can be used.</p>

<p>priority specification is used to control the placement
of the policy within the SPD. Policy position is determined
by a signed integer where higher priorities indicate the
policy is placed closer to the beginning of the list and
lower priorities indicate the policy is placed closer to the
end of the list. Policies with equal priorities are added at
the end of groups of such policies.</p>

<p>Priority can only be specified when setkey has been
compiled against kernel headers that support policy
priorities (Linux &gt;= 2.6.6). If the kernel does not
support priorities, a warning message will be printed the
first time a priority specification is used. Policy priority
takes one of the following formats:</p>

<p>{priority,prio} offset offset is an integer in the range
from -2147483647 to 214783648.</p>

<p>{priority,prio} base {+,-} offset base is either low
(-1073741824), def (0), or high (1073741824)</p>

<p>offset is an unsigned integer. It can be up to
1073741824 for positive offsets, and up to 1073741823 for
negative offsets.</p>

<p>discard means the packet matching indexes will be
discarded. none means that IPsec operation will not take
place onto the packet. ipsec means that IPsec operation will
take place onto the packet.</p>

<p>The protocol/mode/src-dst/level part specifies the rule
how to process the packet. Either ah, esp, or ipcomp must be
used as protocol. mode is either transport or tunnel. If
mode is tunnel, you must specify the end-point addresses of
the SA as src and dst with - between these addresses, which
is used to spec- ify the SA to use. If mode is transport,
both src and dst can be omitted. level is to be one of the
following: default, use, require, or unique. If the SA is
not available in every level, the kernel will ask the key
exchange daemon to establish a suit- able SA. default means
the kernel consults the system wide default for the protocol
you specified, e.g. the esp_trans_deflev sysctl variable,
when the kernel processes the packet. use means that the
kernel uses an SA if it s available, otherwise the ker- nel
keeps normal operation. require means SA is required when-
ever the kernel sends a packet matched with the policy.
unique is the same as require; in addition, it allows the
policy to match the unique out-bound SA. You just specify
the policy level unique, racoon(8) will configure the SA for
the policy. If you configure the SA by manual keying for
that policy, you can put a decimal number as the policy
identifier after unique separated by a colon : like:
unique:number in order to bind this policy to the SA. number
must be between 1 and 32767. It corresponds to extensions -u
of the manual SA configuration. When you want to use SA
bundle, you can define multiple rules. For example, if an IP
header was followed by an AH header followed by an ESP
header followed by an upper layer protocol header, the rule
would be: esp/transport//require ah/transport//require; The
rule order is very important.</p>

<p>When NAT-T is enabled in the kernel, policy matching for
ESP over UDP packets may be done on endpoint addresses and
port (this depends on the system. System that do not perform
the port check cannot support multiple endpoints behind the
same NAT). When using ESP over UDP, you can specify port
numbers in the endpoint addresses to get the correct
matching. Here is an example:</p>

<p>spdadd 10.0.11.0/24[any] 10.0.11.33/32[any] any -P out
ipsec
esp/tunnel/192.168.0.1[4500]-192.168.1.2[30000]/require
;</p>

<p>These ports must be left unspecified (which defaults to
0) for anything other than ESP over UDP. They can be
displayed in SPD dump using setkey -DPp.</p>

<p>Note that discard and none are not in the syntax
described in ipsec_set_policy(3). There are a few
differences in the syntax. See ipsec_set_policy(3) for
detail.</p>

<p>Algorithms The following list shows the supported
algorithms. protocol and algorithm are almost orthogonal.
These authentication algorithms can be used as aalgo in -A
aalgo of the protocol parameter:</p>

<p>These encryption algorithms can be used as ealgo in -E
ealgo of the protocol parameter:</p>

draft-ietf-ipsec-ciph-aes-ctr-03</p>

<p>Note that the first 128 bits of a key for aes-ctr will
be used as AES key, and the remaining 32 bits will be used
as nonce.</p>

<p>These compression algorithms can be used as calgo in -C
calgo of the protocol parameter:</p>

<p>algorithm deflate rfc2394</p>

<p>RFC vs Linux kernel semantics The Linux kernel uses the
fwd policy instead of the in policy for packets what are
forwarded through that particular box.</p>

<p>In kernel mode, setkey manages and shows policies and
SAs exactly as they are stored in the kernel.</p>

<p>In RFC mode, setkey</p>

<p>creates fwd policies for every in policy inserted</p>

<p>(not implemented yet) filters out all fwd policies</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES The command exits with 0 on success, and
non-zero on errors.</p>

<p>Changed manual key configuration for IPsec, October
1999, http://www.kame.net/newsletter/19991007/.</p>

<p>HISTORY The setkey command first appeared in the WIDE
Hydrangea IPv6 protocol stack kit. The command was
completely re-designed in June 1998.</p>

<p>BUGS setkey should report and handle syntax errors
better.</p>

<p>For IPsec gateway configuration, src_range and dst_range
with TCP/UDP port numbers does not work, as the gateway does
not reassemble packets (it cannot inspect upper-layer
headers).</p>
