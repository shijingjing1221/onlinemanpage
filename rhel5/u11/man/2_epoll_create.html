<p>EPOLL_CREATE(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
EPOLL_CREATE(2)</p>

<p>NAME epoll_create - open an epoll file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/epoll.h&gt;</p>

<p>int epoll_create(int size)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Open an epoll file descriptor by requesting
the kernel allocate an event backing store dimensioned for
size descriptors. The size is not the maximum size of the
backing store but just a hint to the kernel about how to
dimension internal structures. The returned file descrip-
tor will be used for all the subsequent calls to the epoll
interface. The file descriptor returned by epoll_create(2)
must be closed by using close(2).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE When successful, epoll_create(2) returns a
non-negative integer identi- fying the descriptor. When an
error occurs, epoll_create(2) returns -1 and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL size is not positive.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>ENOMEM There was insufficient memory to create the
kernel object.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO epoll_create(2) is a new API introduced in
Linux kernel 2.5.44. The interface should be finalized by
Linux kernel 2.5.66.</p>
