<p>NAME test - check file types and compare values</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS test EXPRESSION test</p>

<p>[ EXPRESSION ] [ ] [ OPTION</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Exit with the status determined by
EXPRESSION.</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>An omitted EXPRESSION defaults to false. Otherwise,
EXPRESSION is true or false and sets exit status. It is one
of:</p>

<p>( EXPRESSION ) EXPRESSION is true</p>

<p>! EXPRESSION EXPRESSION is false</p>

<p>EXPRESSION1 -a EXPRESSION2 both EXPRESSION1 and
EXPRESSION2 are true</p>

<p>EXPRESSION1 -o EXPRESSION2 either EXPRESSION1 or
EXPRESSION2 is true</p>

<p>-n STRING the length of STRING is nonzero</p>

<p>STRING equivalent to -n STRING</p>

<p>-z STRING the length of STRING is zero</p>

<p>STRING1 = STRING2 the strings are equal</p>

<p>STRING1 != STRING2 the strings are not equal</p>

<p>INTEGER1 -eq INTEGER2 INTEGER1 is equal to INTEGER2</p>

<p>INTEGER1 -ge INTEGER2 INTEGER1 is greater than or equal
to INTEGER2</p>

<p>INTEGER1 -gt INTEGER2 INTEGER1 is greater than
INTEGER2</p>

<p>INTEGER1 -le INTEGER2 INTEGER1 is less than or equal to
INTEGER2</p>

<p>INTEGER1 -lt INTEGER2 INTEGER1 is less than INTEGER2</p>

<p>INTEGER1 -ne INTEGER2 INTEGER1 is not equal to
INTEGER2</p>

<p>FILE1 -ef FILE2 FILE1 and FILE2 have the same device and
inode numbers</p>

<p>FILE1 -nt FILE2 FILE1 is newer (modification date) than
FILE2</p>

<p>FILE1 -ot FILE2 FILE1 is older than FILE2</p>

<p>-b FILE FILE exists and is block special</p>

<p>-c FILE FILE exists and is character special</p>

<p>-d FILE FILE exists and is a directory</p>

<p>-e FILE FILE exists</p>

<p>-f FILE FILE exists and is a regular file</p>

<p>-g FILE FILE exists and is set-group-ID</p>

<p>-G FILE FILE exists and is owned by the effective group
ID</p>

<p>-h FILE FILE exists and is a symbolic link (same as
-L)</p>

<p>-k FILE FILE exists and has its sticky bit set</p>

<p>-L FILE FILE exists and is a symbolic link (same as
-h)</p>

<p>-O FILE FILE exists and is owned by the effective user
ID</p>

<p>-p FILE FILE exists and is a named pipe</p>

<p>-r FILE FILE exists and read permission is granted</p>

<p>-s FILE FILE exists and has a size greater than zero</p>

<p>-S FILE FILE exists and is a socket</p>

<p>-t FD file descriptor FD is opened on a terminal</p>

<p>-u FILE FILE exists and its set-user-ID bit is set</p>

<p>-w FILE FILE exists and write permission is granted</p>

<p>-x FILE FILE exists and execute (or search) permission
is granted</p>

<p>Except for -h and -L, all FILE-related tests dereference
symbolic links. Beware that parentheses need to be escaped
(e.g., by back- slashes) for shells. INTEGER may also be -l
STRING, which evaluates to the length of STRING.</p>

<p>NOTE: your shell may have its own version of test and/or
[, which usu- ally supersedes the version described here.
Please refer to your shells documentation for details about
the options it supports.</p>
