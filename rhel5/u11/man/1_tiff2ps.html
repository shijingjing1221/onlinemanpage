<p>TIFF2PS(1) TIFF2PS(1)</p>

<p>NAME tiff2ps - convert a TIFF image to</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tiff2ps [ options ] input.tif ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tiff2ps reads TIFF images and writes or
Encapsulated (EPS) on the standard output. By default,
tiff2ps writes Encapsulated for the first image in the
specified TIFF image file.</p>

<p>By default, tiff2ps will generate that fills a printed
area specified by the TIFF tags in the input file. If the
file does not contain XRes- olution or YResolution tags,
then the printed area is set according to the image
dimensions. The -w and -h options (see below) can be used to
set the dimensions of the printed area in inches; overriding
any rele- vant TIFF tags.</p>

<p>The generated for RGB, palette, and CMYK images uses the
colorimage operator. The generated for greyscale and bilevel
images uses the image operator. When the colorimage operator
is used, code to emulate this operator on older printers is
also generated. Note that this emulation code can be very
slow.</p>

<p>Color images with associated alpha data are composited
over a white background.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -1 Generate Level 1 (the default).</p>

<p>-2 Generate Level 2.</p>

<p>-3 Generate Level 3. It basically allows one to use the
/flateDe- code filter for ZIP compressed TIFF images.</p>

<p>-a Generate output for all IFDs (pages) in the input
file.</p>

<p>-b Specify the bottom margin for the output (in inches).
This does not affect the height of the printed image.</p>

<p>-c Center the image in the output. This option only
shows an effect if both the -w and the -h option are
given.</p>

<p>-d Set the initial TIFF directory to the specified
directory num- ber. (NB: directories are numbered starting
at zero.) This option is useful for selecting individual
pages in a multi-page (e.g. facsimile) file.</p>

<p>-e Force the generation of Encapsulated (implies
-z).</p>

<p>-h Specify the vertical size of the printed area (in
inches).</p>

<p>-H Specify the maximum height of image (in inches).
Images with larger sizes will be split in several pages.
Option -L may be used for specifying size of split images
overlapping.</p>

<p>-i Enable/disable pixel interpolation. This option
requires a sin- gle numeric value: zero to disable pixel
interpolation and non- zero to enable. The default is
enabled.</p>

<p>-L Specify the size of overlapping for split images (in
inches). Used in conjunction with -H option.</p>

<p>-l Specify the left margin for the output (in inches).
This does not affect the width of the printed image.</p>

<p>-m Where possible render using the imagemask operator
instead of the image operator. When this option is specified
tiff2ps will use imagemask for rendering 1 bit deep images.
If this option is not specified or if the image depth is
greater than 1 then the image operator is used.</p>

<p>-o Set the initial TIFF directory to the IFD at the
specified file offset. This option is useful for selecting
thumbnail images and the like which are hidden using the
SubIFD tag.</p>

<p>-p Force the generation of (non-Encapsulated) .</p>

<p>-r Rotate image by 180 degrees.</p>

<p>-s Generate output for a single IFD (page) in the input
file.</p>

<p>-w Specify the horizontal size of the printed area (in
inches).</p>

<p>-x Override resolution units specified in the TIFF as
centimeters.</p>

<p>-y Override resolution units specified in the TIFF as
inches.</p>

<p>-z When generating Level 2, data is scaled so that it
does not image into the deadzone on a page (the outer margin
that the printing device is unable to mark). This option
suppresses this behavior. When Level 1 is generated, data is
imaged to the entire printed page and this option has no
affect.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following generates Level 2 for all pages
of a facsimile: tiff2ps -a2 fax.tif | lpr Note also that if
you have version 2.6.1 or newer of Ghostscript then you can
efficiently preview facsimile generated with the above
command.</p>

<p>To generate Encapsulated for a the image at directory 2
of an image use: tiff2ps -d 1 foo.tif (notice that
directories are numbered starting at zero.)</p>

<p>If you have a long image, it may be split in several
pages: tiff2ps -h11 -w8.5 -H14 -L.5 foo.tif &gt; foo.ps The
page size is set to 8.5x11 by -w and -h options. We will
accept a small amount of vertical compression, so -H set to
14. Any pages between 11 and 14 inches will be fit onto one
page. Pages longer than 14 inches are cut off at 11 and
continued on the next page. The -L.5 option says to repeat a
half inch on the next page (to improve read- ability).</p>

<p>BUGS Because does not support the notion of a colormap,
8-bit palette images produce 24-bit images. This conversion
results in output that is six times bigger than the original
image and which takes a long time to send to a printer over
a serial line. Matters are even worse for 4-, 2-, and 1-bit
palette images.</p>

<p>BUGS Does not handle tiled images when generating PS
Level I output.</p>
