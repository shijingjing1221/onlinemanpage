<p>NET(8) System Administration tools NET(8)</p>

<p>NAME net - Tool for administration of Samba and remote
CIFS servers.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS net {&lt;ads|rap|rpc&gt;} [-h] [-w workgroup]
[-W myworkgroup] [-U user] [-I ip-address] [-p port] [-n
myname] [-s conffile] [-S server] [-l] [-P] [-d debuglevel]
[-V]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p>The Samba net utility is meant to work just like the net
utility available for windows and DOS. The first argument
should be used to specify the protocol to use when executing
a certain command. ADS is used for ActiveDirectory, RAP is
using for old (Win9x/NT3) clients and RPC can be used for
NT4 and Windows 2000. If this argument is omitted, net will
try to determine it automatically. Not all commands are
available on all protocols.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h|--help Print a summary of command line
options.</p>

<p>-w target-workgroup Sets target workgroup or domain. You
have to specify either this option or the IP address or the
name of a server.</p>

<p>-W workgroup Sets client workgroup or domain</p>

<p>-U user User name to use</p>

<p>-I ip-address IP address of target server to use. You
have to specify either this option or a target workgroup or
a target server.</p>

<p>-p port Port on the target server to connect to (usually
139 or 445). Defaults to trying 445 first, then 139.</p>

<p>-n &lt;primary NetBIOS name&gt; This option allows you
to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself.
This is identical to setting the netbios name parameter in
the smb.conf file. However, a command line setting will take
precedence over settings in smb.conf.</p>

<p>-s &lt;configuration file&gt; The file specified
contains the configuration details required by the server.
The information in this file includes server-specific
information such as what printcap file to use, as well as
descriptions of all the services that the server is to
provide. See smb.conf for more information. The default
configuration file name is determined at compile time.</p>

<p>-S server Name of target server. You should specify
either this option or a target workgroup or a target IP
address.</p>

<p>-l When listing data, give more information on each
item.</p>

<p>-P Make queries to the external server using the machine
account of the local server.</p>

<p>-d|--debuglevel=level level is an integer from 0 to 10.
The default value if this parameter is not specified is
0.</p>

<p>The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to
the log files about the activities of the server. At level
0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged.
Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it
generates a small amount of information about operations
carried out.</p>

<p>Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log
data, and should only be used when investigating a problem.
Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and
generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is
extremely cryptic.</p>

<p>Note that specifying this parameter here will override
the log level parameter in the smb.conf file.</p>

<p>COMMANDS CHANGESECRETPW This command allows the Samba
machine account password to be set from an external
application to a machine account password that has already
been stored in Active Directory. DO NOT USE this command
unless you know exactly what you are doing. The use of this
command requires that the force flag (-f) be used also.
There will be NO command prompt. Whatever information is
piped into stdin, either by typing at the command line or
otherwise, will be stored as the literal machine password.
Do NOT use this without care and attention as it will
overwrite a legitimate machine password without warning. YOU
HAVE BEEN WARNED.</p>

<p>TIME The NET TIME command allows you to view the time on
a remote server or synchronise the time on the local server
with the time on the remote server.</p>

<p>TIME Without any options, the NET TIME command displays
the time on the remote server.</p>

<p>TIME SYSTEM Displays the time on the remote server in a
format ready for /bin/date.</p>

<p>TIME SET Tries to set the date and time of the local
server to that on the remote server using /bin/date.</p>

<p>TIME ZONE Displays the timezone in hours from GMT on the
remote computer.</p>

<p>[RPC|ADS] JOIN [TYPE] [-U username[%password]]
[createupn=UPN] [createcomputer=OU] [options] Join a domain.
If the account already exists on the server, and [TYPE] is
MEMBER, the machine will attempt to join automatically.
(Assuming that the machine has been created in server
manager) Otherwise, a password will be prompted for, and a
new account may be created.</p>

<p>[TYPE] may be PDC, BDC or MEMBER to specify the type of
server joining the domain.</p>

<p>[UPN] (ADS only) set the principalname attribute during
the join. The default format is host/netbiosname@REALM.</p>

<p>[OU] (ADS only) Precreate the computer account in a
specific OU. The OU string reads from top to bottom without
RDNs, and is delimited by a &acute;/&acute;. Please note
that &acute;&acute; is used for escape by both the shell and
ldap, so it may need to be doubled or quadrupled to pass
through, and it is not used as a delimiter.</p>

<p>[RPC] OLDJOIN [options] Join a domain. Use the OLDJOIN
option to join the domain using the old style of domain
joining - you need to create a trust account in server
manager first.</p>

ldap server.</p>

<p>USERSHARE Starting with version 3.0.23, a Samba server
now supports the ability for non-root users to add user
defined shares to be exported using the &quot;net
usershare&quot; commands.</p>

<p>To set this up, first set up your smb.conf by adding to
the [global] section: usershare path =
/usr/local/samba/lib/usershares Next create the directory
/usr/local/samba/lib/usershares, change the owner to root
and set the group owner to the UNIX group who should have
the ability to create usershares, for example a group called
&quot;serverops&quot;. Set the permissions on
/usr/local/samba/lib/usershares to 01770. (Owner and group
all access, no access for others, plus the sticky bit, which
means that a file in that directory can be renamed or
deleted only by the owner of the file). Finally, tell smbd
how many usershares you will allow by adding to the [global]
section of smb.conf a line such as : usershare max shares =
100. To allow 100 usershare definitions. Now, members of the
UNIX group &quot;serverops&quot; can create user defined
shares on demand using the commands below.</p>

<p>The usershare commands are:</p>

<p>net usershare add sharename path [comment] [acl]
[guest_ok=[y|n]] - to add or change a user defined
share.</p>

<p>net usershare delete sharename - to delete a user
defined share.</p>

<p>net usershare info [-l|--long] [wildcard sharename] - to
print info about a user defined share.</p>

<p>net usershare list [-l|--long] [wildcard sharename] - to
list user defined shares.</p>

<p>USERSHARE ADD sharename path [comment] [acl]
[guest_ok=[y|n]] Add or replace a new user defined share,
with name &quot;sharename&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;path&quot; specifies the absolute pathname on the
system to be exported. Restrictions may be put on this, see
the global smb.conf parameters: &quot;usershare owner
only&quot;, &quot;usershare prefix allow list&quot;, and
&quot;usershare prefix deny list&quot;.</p>

<p>The optional &quot;comment&quot; parameter is the
comment that will appear on the share when browsed to by a
client.</p>

<p>The optional &quot;acl&quot; field specifies which users
have read and write access to the entire share. Note that
guest connections are not allowed unless the smb.conf
parameter &quot;usershare allow guests&quot; has been set.
The definition of a user defined share acl is:
&quot;user:permission&quot;, where user is a valid username
on the system and permission can be &quot;F&quot;,
&quot;R&quot;, or &quot;D&quot;. &quot;F&quot; stands for
&quot;full permissions&quot;, ie. read and write
permissions. &quot;D&quot; stands for &quot;deny&quot; for a
user, ie. prevent this user from accessing this share.
&quot;R&quot; stands for &quot;read only&quot;, ie. only
allow read access to this share (no creation of new files or
directories or writing to files).</p>

<p>The default if no &quot;acl&quot; is given is
&quot;Everyone:R&quot;, which means any authenticated user
has read-only access.</p>

<p>The optional &quot;guest_ok&quot; has the same effect as
the parameter of the same name in smb.conf, in that it
allows guest access to this user defined share. This
parameter is only allowed if the global parameter
&quot;usershare allow guests&quot; has been set to true in
the smb.conf.</p>

<p>There is no separate command to modify an existing user
defined share, just use the &quot;net usershare add
[sharename]&quot; command using the same sharename as the
one you wish to modify and specify the new options you wish.
The Samba smbd daemon notices user defined share
modifications at connect time so will see the change
immediately, there is no need to restart smbd on adding,
deleting or changing a user defined share.</p>

<p>USERSHARE DELETE sharename Deletes the user defined
share by name. The Samba smbd daemon immediately notices
this change, although it will not disconnect any users
currently connected to the deleted share.</p>

<p>USERSHARE INFO [-l|--long] [wildcard sharename] Get info
on user defined shares owned by the current user matching
the given pattern, or all users.</p>

<p>net usershare info on its own dumps out info on the user
defined shares that were created by the current user, or
restricts them to share names that match the given wildcard
pattern (&acute;*&acute; matches one or more characters,
&acute;?&acute; matches only one character). If the
&acute;-l&acute; or &acute;--long&acute; option is also
given, it prints out info on user defined shares created by
other users.</p>

<p>The information given about a share looks like: [foobar]
path=/home/jeremy comment=testme usershare_acl=Everyone:F
guest_ok=n And is a list of the current settings of the user
defined share that can be modified by the &quot;net
usershare add&quot; command.</p>

<p>USERSHARE LIST [-l|--long] wildcard sharename List all
the user defined shares owned by the current user matching
the given pattern, or all users.</p>

<p>net usershare list on its own list out the names of the
user defined shares that were created by the current user,
or restricts the list to share names that match the given
wildcard pattern (&acute;*&acute; matches one or more
characters, &acute;?&acute; matches only one character). If
the &acute;-l&acute; or &acute;--long&acute; option is also
given, it includes the names of user defined shares created
by other users.</p>
