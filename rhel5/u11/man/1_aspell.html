<p>NAME aspell - interactive spell checker</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS aspell [options] &lt;command&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION aspell is a utility that can function as an
ispell -a replacement, as an independent spell checker, as a
test utility to test out Aspell fea- tures, and as a utility
for managing dictionaries.</p>

<p>COMMANDS &lt;command&gt; is one of:</p>

<p>-?,help display the help message</p>

<p>-c,check file to spell-check a file</p>

<p>-a,pipe ispell -a compatibility mode</p>

<p>-list produce a list of misspelled words from standard
input</p>

<p>[dump] config dump the current configuration to
stdout</p>

<p>config key print the current value of an option</p>

<p>soundslike return the soundslike equivalent for each
word entered</p>

<p>filter pass standard input through the same set of
filters that would be used to spell check a document</p>

<p>-v,version print version number and exit</p>

<p>dump|create|merge master|personal|repl wordlist dump,
create, or merge a master, personal, or replacement word
list</p>

<p>DICTIONARY OPTIONS The following options may be used to
control which dictionaries to use and how they behave.</p>

<p>-d,--master=string base name of the dictionary to use.
If this option is specified then Aspell will either use this
dictionary or die.</p>

<p>--dict-dir=dir location of the main word list</p>

<p>-l,--lang=string language to use, it follows the same
format of the LANG environ- mental variable on most systems.
It consists of the two letter ISO 639 language code and an
optional two letter ISO 3166 coun- try code after a dash or
underscore. The default value is based on the value of the
LC_MESSAGES locale.</p>

<p>--size=string the preferred size of the word list</p>

<p>--jargon=string an extra information to distinguish two
different words lists that have the same lang and size.</p>

<p>--word-list-path=list search path for word list
information files</p>

<p>--module-search-order=list list of available modules,
modules that come first on this list have a higher priority.
Currently there is only one speller mod- ule.</p>

<p>-p,--personal=file personal word list file name</p>

<p>--repl=file replacements list file name</p>

<p>--extra-dicts=list extra dictionaries to use.</p>

<p>CHECKER OPTIONS These options control the behavior of
Aspell when checking documents.</p>

<p>-W,--ignore=integer ignore words &lt;= n chars</p>

<p>--ignore-case=boolean ignore case when checking
words</p>

<p>--ignore-repl=boolean ignore commands to store
replacement pairs</p>

<p>--save-repl=boolean save the replacement word list on
save allkeyboard (file) the base name of the keyboard
definition file to use (see section 4.4.3)</p>

<p>--sug-mode=mode suggestion mode = ultra | fast | normal
| bad-spellers</p>

<p>FILTER OPTIONS These options modify the behavior of the
various filters.</p>

<p>--filter=list add or removes a filter</p>

<p>--mode=string sets the filter mode. Mode is one if none,
url, email, sgml, or tex. (The short cut options -e may be
used for email, -H for Html/Sgml, or -t for Tex)</p>

<p>--encoding=string The encoding the input text is in.
Valid values are utf-8, iso8859-*, koi8-r, viscii, cp1252,
machine unsigned 16, machine unsigned 32. However, the
Aspell utility will currently only function correctly with
8-bit encod- ings. utf-8 support is planned for the future.
The two machine unsigned encodings are intended to be used
by other programs using the Aspell library and it is
unlikely the Aspell utility will ever support these
encodings.</p>

<p>--add|rem-email-quote=list email quote characters</p>

<p>--email-margin=integer number of chars that can appear
before the quote char</p>

<p>--sgml-check=list SGML attributes to always check</p>

<p>--sgml-extension=list SGML file extensions</p>

<p>--tex-command=list TeX commands</p>

<p>--tex-check-comments=boolean check TeX comments</p>

<p>RUN-TOGETHER WORD OPTIONS These may be used to control
the behavior of run-together words.</p>

<p>-C|-B,--run-together=boolean consider run-together words
legal</p>

<p>--run-together-limit=integer maximum numbers that can be
strung together</p>

<p>--run-together-min=integer minimal length of interior
words</p>

<p>MISC OPTIONS Miscellaneous options that don t fall under
any other category.</p>

<p>--conf=file main configuration file</p>

<p>--conf-dir=dir location of main configuration file</p>

<p>--data-dir=dir location of language data files</p>

<p>--local-data-dir=dir alternative location of language
data files. This directory is searched before data-dir. It
defaults to the same directory the actual main word list is
in (which is not necessarily dict-dir).</p>

<p>--home-dir=dir location for personal files</p>

<p>--per-conf=file personal configuration file</p>

<p>--prefix=dir prefix directory</p>

<p>UTILITY OPTIONS -b|-x--backup=boolean create a backup
file by appending .bak to the file name. Only applies when
the command is check.</p>

<p>--time=boolean time load time and suggest time in pipe
mode.</p>

<p>--reverse=boolean reverse the order of the suggestions
list</p>

<p>--keymapping=string the keymapping to use, either aspell
for the default mapping or ispell to use the same mapping
that the ispell utility uses</p>

<p>In addition Aspell will try to make sense out of ispell
s command line options so that it can function as a drop in
replacement for ispell. If Aspell is run without any command
line options it will display a brief help screen and
quit.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION Aspell can also accept options via a
personal or global configuration file. The exact files to
used are specified by the options per-conf and conf
respectfully but the personal configuration file is normally
.aspell.conf located in the $HOME directory. Each line of
the configu- ration file has the format:</p>

<p>option [value]</p>

<p>where option is any one of the standard library options
above without the leading dashes. For example the following
line will set the default language to Swiss German:</p>

<p>lang de_CH</p>

<p>There may any number of spaces between the option and
the value however it can only be spaces, i.e. there is no =
between the option name and the value. Comments may also be
included by preceding them with a # as anything from a # to
a newline is ignored. Blank lines are also allowed. Values
set in the personal configuration file override those in the
global file. Options specified at either the command line or
via an environmental variable override those specified by
either configura- tion file.</p>

<p>The global configuration file for Aspell is
/etc/aspell.conf and the per user configuration file is
~/.aspell.conf</p>
