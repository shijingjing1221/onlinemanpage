calling program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include

component of name that was used to invoke the calling
program. That is, it is the same value as
program_invocation_name, with all text up to and including
the final slash (/), if any, removed.</p>

<p>These variables are automatically initialised by the
glibc run-time startup code.</p>

<p>NOTES The Linux-specific /proc/[number]/cmdline file
provides access to simi- lar information.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These variables are GNU extensions, and
should not be used in programs intended to be portable.</p>
