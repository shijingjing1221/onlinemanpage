<p>NAME active - List of newsgroups carried by the
server</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file pathdb/active lists the newsgroups
carried by INN. This file is generally maintained using
ctlinnd(8) to create and remove groups, or by letting
controlchan(8) do so on the basis of received control
messages. This file should not be edited directly without
throttling innd, and must be reloaded using ctlinnd before
innd is unthrottled. Editing it directly even with those
precautions may make it inconsis- tent with the overview
database and won t update active.times, so ctlinnd should be
used to make modifications whenever possible.</p>

<p>Each newsgroup should be listed only once. Each line
specifies one group. The order of groups does not matter.
Within each newsgroup, received articles for that group are
assigned monotonically increasing numbers as unique names.
If an article is posted to newsgroups not mentioned in this
file, those newsgroups are ignored.</p>

<p>If none of the newsgroups listed in the Newsgroups
header of an article are present in this file, the article
is either rejected (if wanttrash is false in inn.conf), or
is filed into the newsgroup &quot;junk&quot; and only
propagated to sites that receive the &quot;junk&quot;
newsgroup (if wanttrash is true).</p>

<p>Each line of this file consists of four fields separated
by a space:</p>

<p>&lt;name&gt; &lt;high&gt; &lt;low&gt; &lt;flag&gt;</p>

<p>The first field is the name of the newsgroup. The
newsgroup &quot;junk&quot; is special, as mentioned above.
The newsgroup &quot;control&quot; and any news- groups
beginning with &quot;control.&quot; are also special;
control messages are filed into a control.* newsgroup named
after the type of control mes- sage if that group exists,
and otherwise are filed into the newsgroup
&quot;control&quot; (without regard to what newsgroups are
listed in the News- groups header). If mergetogroups is set
to true in inn.conf, news- groups that begin with
&quot;to.&quot; are also treated specially; see innd(8).</p>

<p>The second field is the highest article number that has
been used in that newsgroup. The third field is the lowest
article number in the group; this number is not guaranteed
to be accurate, and should only be taken to be a hint. It is
normally updated nightly as part of the expire process; see
news.daily(8) and look for &quot;lowmark&quot; or
&quot;renumber&quot; for more details. Note that because of
article cancellations, there may be gaps in the numbering
sequence. If the lowest article number is greater then the
highest article number, then there are no articles in the
newsgroup. In order to make it possible to update an entry
in- place without rewriting the entire file, the second and
third fields are padded out with leading zeros to make them
a fixed width.</p>

<p>The fourth field contains one of the following
flags:</p>

<p>y Local postings are allowed. m The group is moderated
and all postings must be approved. n No local postings are
allowed, only articles from peers. j Articles are filed in
the junk group instead. x No local postings and ignored for
articles from peers. =foo.bar Articles are filed in the
group foo.bar instead.</p>

<p>If a newsgroup has the &quot;j&quot; flag, no articles
will be filed in that newsgroup, and local postings to that
group will be rejected. If an article for that newsgroup is
received from a remote site, and it is not crossposted to
some other valid group, it will be filed into the
&quot;junk&quot; newsgroup instead. This is different than
simply not listing the group, since the article will still
be accepted and can be propa- gated to other sites, and the
&quot;junk&quot; group can be made available to readers if
wished.</p>

<p>If the &lt;flag&gt; field begins with an equal sign, the
newsgroup is an alias. Articles cannot be posted to that
newsgroup, but they can be received from other sites. Any
articles received from peers for that newsgroup are treated
as if they were actually posted to the group named after the
equal sign. Note that the Newsgroups header of the articles
are not modified. (Alias groups are typically used during a
transition and are typically created manually with
ctlinnd(8).) An alias should not point to another alias.</p>
