<p>NAME shadow - encrypted password file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION shadow contains the encrypted password
information for users accounts and optional the password
aging information. Included is:</p>

<p>&middot; login name</p>

<p>&middot; encrypted password</p>

<p>&middot; days since Jan 1, 1970 that password was last
changed</p>

<p>&middot; days before password may be changed</p>

<p>&middot; days after which password must be changed</p>

<p>&middot; days before password is to expire that user is
warned</p>

<p>&middot; days after password expires that account is
disabled</p>

<p>&middot; days since Jan 1, 1970 that account is
disabled</p>

<p>&middot; a reserved field</p>

<p>The password field must be filled. The encrypted
password consists of 13 to 24 characters from the 64
characters alphabet a thru z, A thru Z, 0 thru 9, . and /.
Optionally it can start with a &quot;$&quot; character. This
means the encrypted password was generated using another
(not DES) algorithm. For example if it starts with
&quot;$1$&quot; it means the MD5-based algorithm was
used.</p>

<p>Refer to crypt(3) for details on how this string is
interpreted.</p>

<p>If the password field contains some string that is not
valid result of crypt(3), for instance ! or *, the user will
not be able to use a unix password to log in, subject to
pam(7).</p>

<p>The date of the last password change is given as the
number of days since Jan 1, 1970. The password may not be
changed again until the proper number of days have passed,
and must be changed after the maximum number of days. If the
minimum number of days required is greater than the maximum
number of day allowed, this password may not be changed by
the user.</p>

<p>An account is considered to be inactive and is disabled
if the password is not changed within the specified number
of days after the password expires. An account will also be
disabled on the specified day regardless of other password
expiration information.</p>

<p>This information supersedes any password or password age
information present in /etc/passwd.</p>

<p>This file must not be readable by regular users if
password security is to be maintained.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd User account information.</p>

<p>/etc/shadow Secure user account information.</p>
