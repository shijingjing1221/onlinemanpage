<p>SYSKLOGD(8) Linux System Administration SYSKLOGD(8)</p>

<p>NAME sysklogd - Linux system logging utilities.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS syslogd [ -a socket ] [ -d ] [ -f config file ]
[ -h ] [ -l hostlist ] [ -m interval ] [ -n ] [ -p socket ]
[ -r ] [ -s domainlist ] [ -S ] [ -v ] [ -x ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sysklogd provides two system utilities which
provide support for system logging and kernel message
trapping. Support of both internet and unix domain sockets
enables this utility package to support both local and
remote logging.</p>

<p>System logging is provided by a version of syslogd(8)
derived from the stock BSD sources. Support for kernel
logging is provided by the klogd(8) utility which allows
kernel logging to be conducted in either a standalone
fashion or as a client of syslogd.</p>

<p>Syslogd provides a kind of logging that many modern
programs use. Every logged message contains at least a time
and a hostname field, normally a program name field, too,
but that depends on how trusty the logging program is.</p>

<p>While the syslogd sources have been heavily modified a
couple of notes are in order. First of all there has been a
systematic attempt to insure that syslogd follows its
default, standard BSD behavior. The second important concept
to note is that this version of syslogd inter- acts
transparently with the version of syslog found in the
standard libraries. If a binary linked to the standard
shared libraries fails to function correctly we would like
an example of the anomalous behav- ior.</p>

<p>The main configuration file /etc/syslog.conf or an
alternative file, given with the -f option, is read at
startup. Any lines that begin with the hash mark (#) and
empty lines are ignored. If an error occurs during parsing
the whole line is ignored.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a socket Using this argument you can specify
additional sockets from that syslogd has to listen to. This
is needed if you re going to let some daemon run within a
chroot() environment. You can use up to 19 additional
sockets. If your environment needs even more, you have to
increase the symbol MAXFUNIX within the syslogd.c source
file. An example for a chroot() daemon is described by the
people from OpenBSD at
http://www.psionic.com/papers/dns.html.</p>

<p>-d Turns on debug mode. Using this the daemon will not
proceed a fork(2) to set itself in the background, but
opposite to that stay in the foreground and write much debug
information on the current tty. See the DEBUGGING section
for more information.</p>

<p>-f config file Specify an alternative configuration file
instead of /etc/sys- log.conf, which is the default.</p>

<p>-h By default syslogd will not forward messages it
receives from remote hosts. Specifying this switch on the
command line will cause the log daemon to forward any remote
messages it receives to forwarding hosts which have been
defined.</p>

<p>-l hostlist Specify a hostname that should be logged
only with its simple hostname and not the fqdn. Multiple
hosts may be specified using the colon (:) separator.</p>

<p>-m interval The syslogd logs a mark timestamp regularly.
The default inter- val between two -- MARK -- lines is 20
minutes. This can be changed with this option. Setting the
interval to zero turns it off entirely.</p>

<p>-n Avoid auto-backgrounding. This is needed especially
if the sys- logd is started and controlled by init(8).</p>

<p>-p socket You can specify an alternative unix domain
socket instead of /dev/log.</p>

<p>-r This option will enable the facility to receive
message from the network using an internet domain socket
with the syslog service (see services(5)). The default is to
not receive any messages from the network.</p>

<p>This option is introduced in version 1.3 of the sysklogd
pack- age. Please note that the default behavior is the
opposite of how older versions behave, so you might have to
turn this on.</p>

<p>-s domainlist Specify a domainname that should be
stripped off before logging. Multiple domains may be
specified using the colon (:) sepa- rator. Please be advised
that no sub-domains may be specified but only entire
domains. For example if -s north.de is speci- fied and the
host logging resolves to satu.infodrom.north.de no domain
would be cut, you will have to specify two domains like: -s
north.de:infodrom.north.de.</p>

<p>-S Verbose logging. If specified once, the numeric
facility and priority are logged with each locally-written
message. If speci- fied more than once, the names of the
facility and priority are logged with each locally-written
message.</p>

<p>-v Print version and exit.</p>

<p>-x Disable name lookups when receiving remote messages.
This avoids deadlocks when the nameserver is running on the
same machine that runs the syslog daemon.</p>

<p>SIGNALS Syslogd reacts to a set of signals. You may
easily send a signal to syslogd using the following:</p>

<p>kill -SIGNAL cat /var/run/syslogd.pid</p>

<p>SIGHUP This lets syslogd perform a re-initialization.
All open files are closed, the configuration file (default
is /etc/syslog.conf) will be reread and the syslog(3)
facility is started again.</p>

<p>SIGTERM The syslogd will die.</p>

<p>SIGINT, SIGQUIT If debugging is enabled these are
ignored, otherwise syslogd will die.</p>

<p>SIGUSR1 Switch debugging on/off. This option can only be
used if sys- logd is started with the -d debug option.</p>

<p>SIGCHLD Wait for childs if some were born, because of
wall ing messages.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX DIFFERENCES Syslogd uses a
slightly different syntax for its configuration file than
the original BSD sources. Originally all messages of a
specific priority and above were forwarded to the log
file.</p>

<p>For example the following line caused ALL output from
daemons using the daemon facilities (debug is the lowest
priority, so every higher will also match) to go into
/usr/adm/daemons:</p>

<p># Sample syslog.conf daemon.debug /usr/adm/daemons</p>

<p>Under the new scheme this behavior remains the same. The
difference is the addition of four new specifiers, the
asterisk (*) wildcard, the equation sign (=), the
exclamation mark (!), and the minus sign (-).</p>

<p>The * specifies that all messages for the specified
facility are to be directed to the destination. Note that
this behavior is degenerate with specifying a priority level
of debug. Users have indicated that the asterisk notation is
more intuitive.</p>

<p>The = wildcard is used to restrict logging to the
specified priority class. This allows, for example, routing
only debug messages to a par- ticular logging source.</p>

<p>For example the following line in syslog.conf would
direct debug messages from all sources to the /usr/adm/debug
file.</p>

<p># Sample syslog.conf *.=debug /usr/adm/debug</p>

<p>The ! is used to exclude logging of the specified
priorities. This affects all (!) possibilities of specifying
priorities.</p>

<p>For example the following lines would log all messages
of the facility mail except those with the priority info to
the /usr/adm/mail file. And all messages from news.info
(including) to news.crit (excluding) would be logged to the
/usr/adm/news file.</p>

<p># Sample syslog.conf mail.*;mail.!=info /usr/adm/mail
news.info;news.!crit /usr/adm/news</p>

<p>You may use it intuitively as an exception specifier.
The above men- tioned interpretation is simply inverted.
Doing that you may use</p>

<p>mail.none or mail.!* or mail.!debug</p>

<p>to skip every message that comes with a mail facility.
There is much room to play with it. :-)</p>

<p>The - may only be used to prefix a filename if you want
to omit syncing the file after every write to it.</p>

<p>This may take some acclimatization for those individuals
used to the pure BSD behavior but testers have indicated
that this syntax is some- what more flexible than the BSD
behavior. Note that these changes should not affect standard
syslog.conf(5) files. You must specifically modify the
configuration files to obtain the enhanced behavior.</p>

<p>SUPPORT FOR REMOTE LOGGING These modifications provide
network support to the syslogd facility. Network support
means that messages can be forwarded from one node run- ning
syslogd to another node running syslogd where they will be
actu- ally logged to a disk file.</p>

<p>To enable this you have to specify the -r option on the
command line. The default behavior is that syslogd wont
listen to the network.</p>

<p>The strategy is to have syslogd listen on a unix domain
socket for locally generated log messages. This behavior
will allow syslogd to inter-operate with the syslog found in
the standard C library. At the same time syslogd listens on
the standard syslog port for messages for- warded from other
hosts. To have this work correctly the services(5) files
(typically found in /etc) must have the following entry:</p>

<p>syslog 514/udp</p>

<p>If this entry is missing syslogd neither can receive
remote messages nor send them, because the UDP port cant be
opened. Instead syslogd will die immediately, blowing out an
error message.</p>

<p>To cause messages to be forwarded to another host
replace the normal file line in the syslog.conf file with
the name of the host to which the messages is to be sent
prepended with an @.</p>

<p>For example, to forward ALL messages to a remote host
use the following syslog.conf entry:</p>

<p># Sample syslogd configuration file to # messages to a
remote host forward all. *.* @hostname</p>

<p>To forward all kernel messages to a remote host the
configura- tion file would be as follows:</p>

<p># Sample configuration file to forward all kernel #
messages to a remote host. kern.* @hostname</p>

<p>If the remote hostname cannot be resolved at startup,
because the name- server might not be accessible (it may be
started after syslogd) you dont have to worry. Syslogd will
retry to resolve the name ten times and then complain.
Another possibility to avoid this is to place the hostname
in /etc/hosts.</p>

<p>With normal syslogds you would get syslog-loops if you
send out mes- sages that were received from a remote host to
the same host (or more complicated to a third host that
sends it back to the first one, and so on). In my domain
(Infodrom Oldenburg) we accidently got one and our disks
filled up with the same single message. :-(</p>

<p>To avoid this in further times no messages that were
received from a remote host are sent out to another (or the
same) remote host anymore. If there are scenarios where this
doesn t make sense, please drop me (Joey) a line.</p>

<p>If the remote host is located in the same domain as the
host, syslogd is running on, only the simple hostname will
be logged instead of the whole fqdn.</p>

<p>In a local network you may provide a central log server
to have all the important information kept on one machine.
If the network consists of different domains you dont have
to complain about logging fully quali- fied names instead of
simple hostnames. You may want to use the strip- domain
feature -s of this server. You can tell the syslogd to strip
off several domains other than the one the server is located
in and only log simple hostnames.</p>

<p>Using the -l option theres also a possibility to define
single hosts as local machines. This, too, results in
logging only their simple hostnames and not the fqdns.</p>

<p>The UDP socket used to forward messages to remote hosts
or to receive messages from them is only opened when it is
needed. In releases prior to 1.3-23 it was opened every time
but not opened for reading or for- warding respectively.</p>

<p>OUTPUT TO NAMED PIPES (FIFOs) This version of syslogd
has support for logging output to named pipes (fifos). A
fifo or named pipe can be used as a destination for log
messages by prepending a pipy symbol (|) to the name of the
file. This is handy for debugging. Note that the fifo must
be created with the mkfifo command before syslogd is
started.</p>

<p>The following configuration file routes debug messages
from the kernel to a fifo:</p>

<p># Sample configuration to route kernel debugging #
messages ONLY to /usr/adm/debug which is a # named pipe.
kern.=debug |/usr/adm/debug</p>

<p>INSTALLATION CONCERNS There is probably one important
consideration when installing this ver- sion of syslogd.
This version of syslogd is dependent on proper for- matting
of messages by the syslog function. The functioning of the
syslog function in the shared libraries changed somewhere in
the region of libc.so.4.[2-4].n. The specific change was to
null-terminate the message before transmitting it to the
/dev/log socket. Proper func- tioning of this version of
syslogd is dependent on null-termination of the message.</p>

<p>This problem will typically manifest itself if old
statically linked binaries are being used on the system.
Binaries using old versions of the syslog function will
cause empty lines to be logged followed by the message with
the first character in the message removed. Relinking these
binaries to newer versions of the shared libraries will
correct this problem.</p>

<p>Both the syslogd(8) and the klogd(8) can either be run
from init(8) or started as part of the rc.* sequence. If it
is started from init the option -n must be set, otherwise
youll get tons of syslog daemons started. This is because
init(8) depends on the process ID.</p>

<p>SECURITY THREATS There is the potential for the syslogd
daemon to be used as a conduit for a denial of service
attack. Thanks go to John Morrison (jmor-
riso@rflab.ee.ubc.ca) for alerting me to this potential. A
rogue pro- gram(mer) could very easily flood the syslogd
daemon with syslog mes- sages resulting in the log files
consuming all the remaining space on the filesystem.
Activating logging over the inet domain sockets will of
course expose a system to risks outside of programs or
individuals on the local machine.</p>

<p>There are a number of methods of protecting a
machine:</p>

<p>1. Implement kernel firewalling to limit which hosts or
networks have access to the 514/UDP socket.</p>

<p>2. Logging can be directed to an isolated or non-root
filesystem which, if filled, will not impair the
machine.</p>

<p>3. The ext2 filesystem can be used which can be
configured to limit a certain percentage of a filesystem to
usage by root only. NOTE that this will require syslogd to
be run as a non-root pro- cess. ALSO NOTE that this will
prevent usage of remote logging since syslogd will be unable
to bind to the 514/UDP socket.</p>

<p>4. Disabling inet domain sockets will limit risk to the
local machine.</p>

<p>DEBUGGING When debugging is turned on using -d option
then syslogd will be very verbose by writing much of what it
does on stdout. Whenever the con- figuration file is reread
and re-parsed youll see a tabular, corre- sponding to the
internal data structure. This tabular consists of four
fields:</p>

<p>number This field contains a serial number starting by
zero. This num- ber represents the position in the internal
data structure (i.e. the array). If one number is left out
then there might be an error in the corresponding line in
/etc/syslog.conf.</p>

<p>pattern This field is tricky and represents the internal
structure exactly. Every column stands for a facility (refer
to sys- log(3)). As you can see, there are still some
facilities left free for former use, only the left most are
used. Every field in a column represents the priorities
(refer to syslog(3)).</p>

<p>action This field describes the particular action that
takes place whenever a message is received that matches the
pattern. Refer to the syslog.conf(5) manpage for all
possible actions.</p>

<p>arguments This field shows additional arguments to the
actions in the last field. For file-logging this is the
filename for the logfile; for user-logging this is a list of
users; for remote logging this is the hostname of the
machine to log to; for console-log- ging this is the used
console; for tty-logging this is the spec- ified tty; wall
has no additional arguments.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/syslog.conf Configuration file for syslogd.
See syslog.conf(5) for exact information. /dev/log The Unix
domain socket to from where local syslog messages are read.
/var/run/syslogd.pid The file containing the process id of
syslogd.</p>

<p>BUGS If an error occurs in one line the whole rule is
ignored.</p>

<p>Syslogd Syslogd doesn t change the filemode of opened
logfiles at any stage of process. If a file is created it is
world readable, however, the syslog init script in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux sets umask to 077 so only root has read
permissions. You can also change the permissions on your
own. This could be done in combination with rotating
logfiles using the savelog(8) program that is shipped in the
smail 3.x distribution. Remember that it might be a security
hole if everybody is able to read auth.* messages as these
might contain passwords.</p>
