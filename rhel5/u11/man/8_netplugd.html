<p>NETPLUGD(8) BSD System Manager s Manual NETPLUGD(8)</p>

<p>NAME netplugd - network cable hotplug management
daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS netplugd [-FP] [-c config_file] [-i
interface_pattern] [-p pid_file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION netplugd is a daemon that responds to
network link events from the Linux kernel, such as a network
interface losing or acquiring a carrier signal.</p>

<p>When an Ethernet-style network interface on a host is
plugged into a pow- ered-up switch, hub, or other host, the
two use a carrier signal to establish that the link is
alive. The Linux kernel makes this informa- tion available
through its netlink(7) interface.</p>

<p>The netplugd daemon listens for carrier detection and
loss messages from the kernels netlink(7) subsystem. When a
carrier signal is detected on an interface, it runs a script
to bring the interface up. When carrier is lost, netplugd
runs a script to bring the interface down. netplugd does not
define any policies for how to manage interfaces; it leaves
that to a script, /etc/netplug.d/netplug, which is described
in FILES below.</p>

<p>You tell netplugd which interfaces it should manage by
giving it a list of shell-style glob patterns, which it
matches against using the fnmatch(3) function. For example,
a pattern of eth[13] will tell netplugd to only manage eth1
and eth3, if those interfaces exist. If the interfaces are
not known to the kernel at the time you start netplugd,
perhaps because they are unplugged PCMCIA network interfaces
or devices whose drivers have not yet been installed,
netplugd will start to manage them as soon as they are
plugged in or their drivers are available.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -F Run in the foreground; do not detach and run
as a daemon. Mes- sages are logged to stdout or stderr,
instead of using the syslog(3) mechanism. This option is
useful mainly for debugging your configuration.</p>

<p>-P Prevent autoprobing for interfaces. The netplugd
daemon normally probes for all possible interface names that
might match the pat- terns you tell it to manage. This is
necessary in order to get network driver modules (the
default with almost all Linux distri- butions) loaded and
set up, so that they can provide link status notifications
to the netplugd daemon. Autoprobing should always be safe,
and doesn t take long. Disable it with caution.</p>

<p>-c config_file Specify the name of a file from which to
read patterns that describe the interfaces to manage. You
can provide this option multiple times to read from more
than one file. If you do not provide this option at all,
netplugd will attempt to read from a default config file. If
you do not want netplugd to try to read from any real config
files, you can specify /dev/null as a config file.</p>

<p>-i interface_pattern Specify a pattern that will be used
to match interface names that netplugd should manage. You
can provide this option multiple times to specify multiple
patterns.</p>

<p>-p pid_file Write the daemons process ID to the file
pid_file. If you tell netplugd to run in the foreground,
this option is ignored.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/netplug/netplugd.conf Default config file to
read, if none is specified on the command line. The config
file format is one pattern per line, with white space, empty
lines, and comments starting with a # character ignored.
Patterns are standard shell-style glob patterns, e.g.
&quot;eth[0-9]&quot;.</p>

<p>/etc/netplug.d/netplug The &quot;policy&quot; program
(typically a shell script) that netplugd uses to probe for
interfaces, and to bring them up or down in response to
network link events. This program is called with the name of
the interface as its first argument, and one of the fol-
lowing options:</p>

<p>in A cable was plugged in, or carrier came up. The
command should bring the interface up. The command is run
asyn- chronously, and it should exit with status 0 on
success.</p>

<p>out A cable was plugged out, or carrier went down. The
com- mand should bring the interface down. The command is
run asynchronously, and it should exit with status 0 on suc-
cess.</p>

<p>probe The command should load and initialise the driver
for this interface, if possible, and bring the interface
into the &quot;up&quot; state, so that it can generate
netlink(7) events. The command is run synchronously; it must
exit with status code 0 if it succeeds, otherwise with a
non- zero exit code or signal.</p>

<p>/etc/rc.d/init.d/netplugd The init(8) script that
starts, stops, and displays status of the netplugd
daemon.</p>
