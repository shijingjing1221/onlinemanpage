<p>SETPGID(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SETPGID(2)</p>

<p>NAME setpgid, getpgid, setpgrp, getpgrp - set/get
process group</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setpgid(pid_t pid, pid_t pgid); pid_t getpgid(pid_t
pid); int setpgrp(void); pid_t getpgrp(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION setpgid() sets the process group ID of the
process specified by pid to pgid. If pid is zero, the
process ID of the current process is used. If pgid is zero,
the process ID of the process specified by pid is used. If
setpgid() is used to move a process from one process group
to another (as is done by some shells when creating
pipelines), both pro- cess groups must be part of the same
session. In this case, the pgid specifies an existing
process group to be joined and the session ID of that group
must match the session ID of the joining process.</p>

<p>getpgid() returns the process group ID of the process
specified by pid. If pid is zero, the process ID of the
current process is used.</p>

<p>The call setpgrp() is equivalent to setpgid(0,0).</p>

<p>Similarly, getpgrp() is equivalent to getpgid(0). Each
process group is a member of a session and each process is a
member of the session of which its process group is a
member.</p>

<p>Process groups are used for distribution of signals, and
by terminals to arbitrate requests for their input:
Processes that have the same process group as the terminal
are foreground and may read, while others will block with a
signal if they attempt to read. These calls are thus used by
programs such as csh(1) to create process groups in
implement- ing job control. The TIOCGPGRP and TIOCSPGRP
calls described in termios(3) are used to get/set the
process group of the control termi- nal.</p>

<p>If a session has a controlling terminal, CLOCAL is not
set and a hangup occurs, then the session leader is sent a
SIGHUP. If the session leader exits, the SIGHUP signal will
be sent to each process in the foreground process group of
the controlling terminal.</p>

<p>If the exit of the process causes a process group to
become orphaned, and if any member of the newly-orphaned
process group is stopped, then a SIGHUP signal followed by a
SIGCONT signal will be sent to each pro- cess in the
newly-orphaned process group.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, setpgid() and setpgrp() return
zero. On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>getpgid() returns a process group on success. On error,
-1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>getpgrp() always returns the current process group.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES An attempt was made to change the process
group ID of one of the children of the calling process and
the child had already performed an execve() (setpgid(),
setpgrp()).</p>

<p>EINVAL pgid is less than 0 (setpgid(), setpgrp()).</p>

<p>EPERM An attempt was made to move a process into a
process group in a different session, or to change the
process group ID of one of the children of the calling
process and the child was in a dif- ferent session, or to
change the process group ID of a session leader (setpgid(),
setpgrp()).</p>

<p>ESRCH For getpgid(): pid does not match any process. For
setpgid(): pid is not the current process and not a child of
the current process.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The functions setpgid() and getpgrp()
conform to POSIX.1-2001. The function setpgrp() is from
4.2BSD. The function getpgid() conforms to SVr4.</p>

<p>NOTES A child created via fork(2) inherits its parents
process group ID. The process group ID is preserved across
an execve(2).</p>

<p>POSIX took setpgid() from the BSD function setpgrp().
Also System V has a function with the same name, but it is
identical to setsid(2).</p>

<p>To get the prototypes under glibc, define both
_XOPEN_SOURCE and _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED, or use
&quot;#define _XOPEN_SOURCE n&quot; for some inte- ger n
larger than or equal to 500.</p>
