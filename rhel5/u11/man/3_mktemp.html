<p>NAME mktemp - make a unique temporary filename</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *mktemp(char *template);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mktemp() function generates a unique
temporary filename from tem- plate. The last six characters
of template must be XXXXXX and these are replaced with a
string that makes the filename unique. Since it will be
modified, template must not be a string constant, but should
be declared as a character array.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The mktemp() function returns NULL on error
(template did not end in XXXXXX) and template otherwise. If
the call was successful, the last six bytes of template will
have been modified in such a way that the resulting name is
unique (does not exist already). If the call was
unsuccessful, template is made an empty string.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL The last six characters of template were
not XXXXXX.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTE The prototype is in &lt;unistd.h&gt; for libc4,
libc5, glibc1; glibc2 follows the Single Unix Specification
and has the prototype in &lt;stdlib.h&gt;.</p>

<p>BUGS Never use mktemp(). Some implementations follow
4.3BSD and replace XXXXXX by the current process ID and a
single letter, so that at most 26 different names can be
returned. Since on the one hand the names are easy to guess,
and on the other hand there is a race between test- ing
whether the name exists and opening the file, every use of
mktemp() is a security risk. The race is avoided by
mkstemp(3).</p>
