<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) SYSLINUX(1)
SYSLINUX(1)</p>

<p>NAME syslinux - install the SYSLINUX bootloader on a FAT
filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS syslinux [OPTIONS] device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Syslinux is a boot loader for the Linux
operating system which operates off an MS-DOS/Windows FAT
filesystem. It is intended to simplify first- time
installation of Linux, and for creation of rescue and other
spe- cial-purpose boot disks.</p>

<p>In order to create a bootable Linux floppy using
Syslinux, prepare a normal MS-DOS formatted floppy. Copy one
or more Linux kernel files to it, then execute the
command:</p>

<p>syslinux --install /dev/fd0</p>

<p>This will alter the boot sector on the disk and copy a
file named ldlinux.sys into its root directory.</p>

<p>On boot time, by default, the kernel will be loaded from
the image named LINUX on the boot floppy. This default can
be changed, see the section on the syslinux configuration
file.</p>

<p>If the Shift or Alt keys are held down during boot, or
the Caps or Scroll locks are set, syslinux will display a
lilo(8) -style &quot;boot:&quot; prompt. The user can then
type a kernel file name followed by any ker- nel parameters.
The SYSLINUX bootloader does not need to know about the
kernel file in advance; all that is required is that it is a
file located in the root directory on the disk.</p>

<p>Syslinux supports the loading of initial ramdisks
(initrd) and the bzImage kernel format.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -i, --install Install SYSLINUX on a new medium,
overwriting any previously installed bootloader.</p>

<p>-U, --update Install SYSLINUX on a new medium if and
only if a version of SYSLINUX is already installed.</p>

<p>-s, --stupid Install a &quot;safe, slow and stupid&quot;
version of SYSLINUX. This ver- sion may work on some very
buggy BIOSes on which SYSLINUX would otherwise fail. If you
find a machine on which the -s option is required to make it
boot reliably, please send as much info about your machine
as you can, and include the failure mode.</p>

<p>-f, --force Force install even if it appears unsafe.</p>

<p>-r, --raid RAID mode. If boot fails, tell the BIOS to
boot the next device in the boot sequence (usually the next
hard disk) instead of stopping with an error message. This
is useful for RAID-1 boot- ing.</p>

<p>-d, --directory subdirectory Install the SYSLINUX
control files in a subdirectory with the specified name
(relative to the root directory on the device).</p>

<p>-t, --offset offset Indicates that the filesystem is at
an offset from the base of the device or file.</p>

<p>--once command Declare a boot command to be tried on the
first boot only.</p>

<p>-O, --clear-once Clear the boot-once command.</p>

<p>-H, --heads head-count Override the detected number of
heads for the geometry.</p>

<p>-S, --sectors sector-count Override the detected number
of sectors for the geometry.</p>

<p>-z, --zipdrive Assume zipdrive geometry (--heads 64
--sectors 32).</p>

<p>FILES Configuration file All the configurable defaults
in SYSLINUX can be changed by putting a file called
syslinux.cfg in the install directory of the boot disk. This
is a text file in either UNIX or DOS format, containing one
or more of the following items (case is insensitive for
keywords).</p>

<p>This list is out of date.</p>

<p>In the configuration file blank lines and comment lines
beginning with a hash mark (#) are ignored.</p>

<p>default kernel [ options ... ] Sets the default command
line. If syslinux boots automatically, it will act just as
if the entries after &quot;default&quot; had been typed in
at the &quot;boot:&quot; prompt.</p>

<p>If no DEFAULT or UI statement is found, or the
configuration file is missing entirely, SYSLINUX drops to
the boot: prompt with an error message (if NOESCAPE is set,
it stops with a &quot;boot failed&quot; message; this is
also the case for PXELINUX if the con- figuration file is
not found.)</p>

<p>NOTE: Until SYSLINUX 3.85, if no configuration file is
present, or no &quot;default&quot; entry is present in the
configuration file, the default is &quot;linux
auto&quot;.</p>

<p>Even earlier versions of SYSLINUX used to automatically
append the string &quot;auto&quot; to whatever the user
specified using the DEFAULT command. As of version 1.54,
this is no longer true, as it caused problems when using a
shell as a substitute for &quot;init.&quot; You may want to
include this option manually.</p>

<p>append options ... Add one or more options to the kernel
command line. These are added both for automatic and manual
boots. The options are added at the very beginning of the
kernel command line, usually per- mitting explicitly entered
kernel options to override them. This is the equivalent of
the lilo(8) &quot;append&quot; option.</p>

<p>label label kernel image append options ... Indicates
that if label is entered as the kernel to boot, sys- linux
should instead boot image, and the specified
&quot;append&quot; options should be used instead of the
ones specified in the global section of the file (before the
first &quot;label&quot; command.) The default for image is
the same as label, and if no &quot;append&quot; is given the
default is to use the global entry (if any). Use
&quot;append -&quot; to use no options at all. Up to 128
&quot;label&quot; entries are permitted.</p>

<p>Notes: Labels are mangled as if they were DOS filenames,
and must be unique after mangling. For example, two labels
&quot;v2.1.30&quot; and &quot;v2.1.31&quot; will not be
distinguishable.</p>

<p>The &quot;image&quot; doesn t have to be a Linux kernel;
it can be a boot sector or a COMBOOT file (see below.)</p>

<p>implicit flag_val If flag_val is 0, do not load a kernel
image unless it has been explicitly named in a
&quot;label&quot; statement. The default is 1.</p>

<p>timeout timeout Indicates how long to wait at the
&quot;boot:&quot; prompt until booting automatically, in
units of 1/10 s. The timeout is cancelled as soon as the
user types anything on the keyboard, the assumption being
that the user will complete the command line already begun.
A timeout of zero will disable the timeout completely, this
is also the default. The maximum possible timeout value is
35996; corresponding to just below one hour.</p>

<p>serial port [ baudrate ] Enables a serial port to act as
the console. &quot;port&quot; is a number (0 = /dev/ttyS0 =
COM1, etc.); if &quot;baudrate&quot; is omitted, the baud
rate defaults to 9600 bps. The serial parameters are hard-
coded to be 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.</p>

<p>For this directive to be guaranteed to work properly, it
should be the first directive in the configuration file.</p>

<p>font filename Load a font in .psf format before
displaying any output (except the copyright line, which is
output as ldlinux.sys itself is loaded.) syslinux only loads
the font onto the video card; if the .psf file contains a
Unicode table it is ignored. This only works on EGA and VGA
cards; hopefully it should do nothing on others.</p>

<p>kbdmap keymap Install a simple keyboard map. The
keyboard remapper used is very simplistic (it simply remaps
the keycodes received from the BIOS, which means that only
the key combinations relevant in the default layout -
usually U.S. English - can be mapped) but should at least
help people with AZERTY keyboard layout and the locations of
= and , (two special characters used heavily on the Linux
kernel command line.)</p>

<p>The included program keytab-lilo.pl(8) from the lilo(8)
distribution can be used to create such keymaps.</p>

<p>display filename Displays the indicated file on the
screen at boot time (before the boot: prompt, if displayed).
Please see the section below on DISPLAY files. If the file
is missing, this option is simply ignored.</p>

<p>prompt flag_val If flag_val is 0, display the
&quot;boot:&quot; prompt only if the Shift or Alt key is
pressed, or Caps Lock or Scroll lock is set (this is the
default). If flag_val is 1, always display the
&quot;boot:&quot; prompt.</p>

<p>f1 filename f2 filename ... f9 filename f10 filename f11
filename f12 filename Displays the indicated file on the
screen when a function key is pressed at the
&quot;boot:&quot; prompt. This can be used to implement
pre-boot online help (presumably for the kernel command line
options.)</p>

<p>When using the serial console, press
&lt;Ctrl-F&gt;&lt;digit&gt; to get to the help screens, e.g.
&lt;Ctrl-F&gt;2 to get to the f2 screen. For f10-f12, hit
&lt;Ctrl-F&gt;A, &lt;Ctrl-F&gt;B, &lt;Ctrl-F&gt;C. For
compatiblity with earlier versions, f10 can also be entered
as &lt;Ctrl-F&gt;0.</p>

<p>Display file format DISPLAY and function-key help files
are text files in either DOS or UNIX format (with or without
&lt;CR&gt;). In addition, the following special codes are
interpreted:</p>

<p>&lt;FF&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-L&gt; = ASCII 12 Clear the screen,
home the cursor. Note that the screen is filled with the
current display color.</p>

<p>&lt;SI&gt;&lt;bg&gt;&lt;fg&gt;, &lt;SI&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-O&gt; = ASCII 15 Set the display colors to the
specified background and fore- ground colors, where
&lt;bg&gt; and &lt;fg&gt; are hex digits, corresponding to
the standard PC display attributes:</p>

<p>0 = black 8 = dark grey 1 = dark blue 9 = bright blue 2
= dark green a = bright green 3 = dark cyan b = bright cyan
4 = dark red c = bright red 5 = dark purple d = bright
purple 6 = brown e = yellow 7 = light grey f = white</p>

<p>Picking a bright color (8-f) for the background results
in the corresponding dark color (0-7), with the foreground
flashing.</p>

<p>colors are not visible over the serial console.</p>

<p>&lt;CAN&gt;filename&lt;newline&gt;, &lt;CAN&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-X&gt; = ASCII 24 If a VGA display is present, enter
graphics mode and display the graphic included in the
specified file. The file format is an ad hoc format called
LSS16; the included Perl program &quot;ppm- tolss16&quot;
can be used to produce these images. This Perl program also
includes the file format specification.</p>

<p>The image is displayed in 640x480 16-color mode. Once in
graph- ics mode, the display attributes (set by &lt;SI&gt;
code sequences) work slightly differently: the background
color is ignored, and the foreground colors are the 16
colors specified in the image file. For that reason,
ppmtolss16 allows you to specify that certain colors should
be assigned to specific color indicies.</p>

<p>Color indicies 0 and 7, in particular, should be chosen
with care: 0 is the background color, and 7 is the color
used for the text printed by SYSLINUX itself.</p>

<p>&lt;EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-U&gt; = ASCII 25 If we
are currently in graphics mode, return to text mode.</p>

<p>&lt;DLE&gt;..&lt;ETB&gt;, &lt;Ctrl-P&gt;..&lt;Ctrl-W&gt;
= ASCII 16-23 These codes can be used to select which modes
to print a certain part of the message file in. Each of
these control characters select a specific set of modes
(text screen, graphics screen, serial port) for which the
output is actually displayed:</p>

<p>Character Text Graph Serial
------------------------------------------------------
&lt;DLE&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-P&gt; = ASCII 16 No No No &lt;DC1&gt;
= &lt;Ctrl-Q&gt; = ASCII 17 Yes No No &lt;DC2&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-R&gt; = ASCII 18 No Yes No &lt;DC3&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-S&gt; = ASCII 19 Yes Yes No &lt;DC4&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-T&gt; = ASCII 20 No No Yes &lt;NAK&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-U&gt; = ASCII 21 Yes No Yes &lt;SYN&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-V&gt; = ASCII 22 No Yes Yes &lt;ETB&gt; =
&lt;Ctrl-W&gt; = ASCII 23 Yes Yes Yes</p>

<p>For example: &lt;DC1&gt;Text mode&lt;DC2&gt;Graphics
mode&lt;DC4&gt;Serial port&lt;ETB&gt; ... will actually
print out which mode the console is in!</p>

<p>&lt;SUB&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-Z&gt; = ASCII 26 End of file (DOS
convention).</p>

<p>Comboot Images and other operating systems This version
of syslinux supports chain loading of other operating sys-
tems (such as MS-DOS and its derivatives, including Windows
95/98), as well as COMBOOT-style standalone executables (a
subset of DOS .COM files; see separate section below.)</p>

<p>Chain loading requires the boot sector of the foreign
operating system to be stored in a file in the root
directory of the filesystem. Because neither Linux kernels,
boot sector images, nor COMBOOT files have reliable magic
numbers, syslinux will look at the file extension. The
following extensions are recognised:</p>

<p>none or other Linux kernel image CBT COMBOOT image (not
runnable from DOS) BSS Boot sector (DOS superblock will be
patched in) BS Boot sector COM COMBOOT image (runnable from
DOS)</p>

<p>For filenames given on the command line, syslinux will
search for the file by adding extensions in the order listed
above if the plain file- name is not found. Filenames in
KERNEL statements must be fully quali- fied.</p>

<p>A COMBOOT file is a standalone executable in DOS .COM
format. They can, among other things, be produced by the
Etherboot package by Markus Gutschke and Ken Yap. The
following requirements apply for these files to be
sufficiently &quot;standalone&quot; for syslinux to be able
to load and run them:</p>

<p>&middot; The program must not execute any DOS calls
(since there is no DOS), although it may call the BIOS. The
only exception is that the program may execute INT 20h
(Terminate Program) to return to the syslinux prompt. Note
especially that INT 21h AH=4Ch, INT 21h AH=31h or INT 27h
are not supported.</p>

<p>&middot; Only the fields pspInt20 at offset 00h,
pspNextParagraph at off- set 02h and pspCommandTail at
offset 80h (contains the arguments from the syslinux command
line) in the PSP are supported. All other fields will
contain zero.</p>

<p>&middot; The program must not modify any main memory
outside its 64K seg- ment if it returns to syslinux via INT
20h.</p>

<p>Syslinux currently doesnt provide any form of API for
the use of COM- BOOT files. If there is need, a future
version may contain an INT interface to some syslinux
functions; please contact me if you have a need or ideas for
such an API.</p>

<p>Novice protection Syslinux will attempt to detect if the
user is trying to boot on a 286 or lower class machine, or a
machine with less than 608K of low (&quot;DOS&quot;) RAM
(which means the Linux boot sequence cannot complete). If
so, a message is displayed and the boot sequence aborted.
Holding down the Ctrl key while booting disables this
feature.</p>

<p>The compile time and date of a specific syslinux version
can be obtained by the DOS command &quot;type
ldlinux.sys&quot;. This is also used as the signature for
the LDLINUX.SYS file, which must match the boot sec- tor</p>

<p>Any file that syslinux uses can be marked hidden, system
or readonly if so is convenient; syslinux ignores all file
attributes. The SYSLINUX installed automatically sets the
readonly attribute on LDLINUX.SYS.</p>

<p>Bootable CD-ROMs SYSLINUX can be used to create bootdisk
images for El Torito-compatible bootable CD-ROMs. However,
it appears that many BIOSes are very buggy when it comes to
booting CD-ROMs. Some users have reported that the following
steps are helpful in making a CD-ROM that is bootable on the
largest possible number of machines:</p>

<p>&middot; Use the -s (safe, slow and stupid) option to
SYSLINUX</p>

<p>&middot; Put the boot image as close to the beginning of
the ISO 9660 filesystem as possible.</p>

<p>A CD-ROM is so much faster than a floppy that the -s
option shouldnt matter from a speed perspective.</p>

<p>Of course, you probably want to use ISOLINUX instead.
See the documen- tation file isolinux.doc.</p>

<p>Booting from a FAT partition on a hard disk SYSLINUX can
boot from a FAT filesystem partition on a hard disk
(including FAT32). The installation procedure is identical
to the pro- cedure for installing it on a floppy, and should
work under either DOS or Linux. To boot from a partition,
SYSLINUX needs to be launched from a Master Boot Record or
another boot loader, just like DOS itself would. A sample
master boot sector (mbr.bin) is included with SYSLINUX.</p>

<p>BUGS I would appreciate hearing of any problems you have
with SYSLINUX. I would also like to hear from you if you
have successfully used SYS- LINUX, especially if you are
using it for a distribution.</p>

<p>If you are reporting problems, please include all
possible information about your system and your BIOS; the
vast majority of all problems reported turn out to be BIOS
or hardware bugs, and I need as much information as possible
in order to diagnose the problems.</p>

<p>There is a mailing list for discussion among SYSLINUX
users and for announcements of new and test versions. To
join, send a message to majordomo@linux.kernel.org with the
