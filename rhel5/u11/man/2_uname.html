<p>UNAME(2) Linux Programmer s Manual UNAME(2)</p>

<p>NAME uname - get name and information about current
kernel</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/utsname.h&gt;</p>

<p>int uname(struct utsname *buf);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION uname() returns system information in the
structure pointed to by buf. The utsname struct is defined
in &lt;sys/utsname.h&gt;: struct utsname { char sysname[];
char nodename[]; char release[]; char version[]; char
machine[]; #ifdef _GNU_SOURCE char domainname[]; #endif };
The length of the arrays in a struct utsname is unspecified;
the fields are terminated by a null byte ( ).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT buf is not valid.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001. There is no uname()
call in 4.3BSD.</p>

<p>The domainname member (the NIS or YP domain name) is a
GNU extension.</p>

<p>NOTES This is a system call, and the operating system
presumably knows its name, release and version. It also
knows what hardware it runs on. So, four of the fields of
the struct are meaningful. On the other hand, the field
nodename is meaningless: it gives the name of the present
machine in some undefined network, but typically machines
are in more than one network and have several names.
Moreover, the kernel has no way of knowing about such
things, so it has to be told what to answer here. The same
holds for the additional domainname field.</p>

<p>To this end Linux uses the system calls sethostname(2)
and setdomain- name(2). Note that there is no standard that
says that the hostname set by sethostname(2) is the same
string as the nodename field of the struct returned by
uname() (indeed, some systems allow a 256-byte host- name
and an 8-byte nodename), but this is true on Linux. The same
holds for setdomainname(2) and the domainname field.</p>

<p>The length of the fields in the struct varies. Some
operating systems or libraries use a hardcoded 9 or 33 or 65
or 257. Other systems use SYS_NMLN or _SYS_NMLN or UTSLEN or
_UTSNAME_LENGTH. Clearly, it is a bad idea to use any of
these constants; just use sizeof(...). Often 257 is chosen
in order to have room for an internet hostname.</p>

<p>There have been three Linux system calls uname(). The
first one used length 9, the second one used 65, the third
one also uses 65 but adds the domainname field.</p>

<p>Part of the utsname information is also accessible via
sysctl() and via /proc/sys/kernel/{ostype, hostname,
osrelease, version, domainname}.</p>
