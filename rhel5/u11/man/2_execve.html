<p>EXECVE(2) Linux Programmer s Manual EXECVE(2)</p>

<p>NAME execve - execute program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[],
char *const envp[]);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION execve() executes the program pointed to by
filename. filename must be either a binary executable, or a
script starting with a line of the form &quot;#! interpreter
[arg]&quot;. In the latter case, the interpreter must be a
valid pathname for an executable which is not itself a
script, which will be invoked as interpreter [arg]
filename.</p>

<p>argv is an array of argument strings passed to the new
program. envp is an array of strings, conventionally of the
form key=value, which are passed as environment to the new
program. Both argv and envp must be terminated by a null
pointer. The argument vector and environment can be accessed
by the called programs main function, when it is defined as
int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[]).</p>

<p>execve() does not return on success, and the text, data,
bss, and stack of the calling process are overwritten by
that of the program loaded. The program invoked inherits the
calling processs PID, and any open file descriptors that are
not set to close-on-exec. Signals pending on the calling
process are cleared. Any signals set to be caught by the
calling process are reset to their default behaviour. The
SIGCHLD sig- nal (when set to SIG_IGN) may or may not be
reset to SIG_DFL.</p>

<p>If the current program is being ptraced, a SIGTRAP is
sent to it after a successful execve().</p>

<p>If the set-user-ID bit is set on the program file
pointed to by file- name, and the calling process is not
being ptraced, then the effective user ID of the calling
process is changed to that of the owner of the program file.
i Similarly, when the set-group-ID bit of the program file
is set the effective group ID of the calling process is set
to the group of the program file.</p>

<p>The effective user ID of the process is copied to the
saved set-user- ID; similarly, the effective group ID is
copied to the saved set-group- ID. This copying takes place
after any effective ID changes that occur because of the
set-user-ID and set-group-ID permission bits.</p>

<p>If the executable is an a.out dynamically-linked binary
executable con- taining shared-library stubs, the Linux
dynamic linker ld.so(8) is called at the start of execution
to bring needed shared libraries into memory and link the
executable with them.</p>

<p>If the executable is a dynamically-linked ELF
executable, the inter- preter named in the PT_INTERP segment
is used to load the needed shared libraries. This
interpreter is typically /lib/ld-linux.so.1 for bina- ries
linked with the Linux libc version 5, or /lib/ld-linux.so.2
for binaries linked with the GNU libc version 2.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, execve() does not return, on
error -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS E2BIG The total number of bytes in the
environment (envp) and argument list (argv) is too
large.</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the
path prefix of filename or the name of a script interpreter.
(See also path_resolution(2).)</p>

<p>EACCES The file or a script interpreter is not a regular
file.</p>

<p>EACCES Execute permission is denied for the file or a
script or ELF interpreter.</p>

<p>EACCES The file system is mounted noexec.</p>

<p>EFAULT filename points outside your accessible address
space.</p>

<p>EINVAL An ELF executable had more than one PT_INTERP
segment (i.e., tried to name more than one interpreter).</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred.</p>

<p>EISDIR An ELF interpreter was a directory.</p>

<p>ELIBBAD An ELF interpreter was not in a recognised
format.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
resolving filename or the name of a script or ELF
interpreter.</p>

<p>EMFILE The process has the maximum number of files
open.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG filename is too long.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>ENOENT The file filename or a script or ELF interpreter
does not exist, or a shared library needed for file or
interpreter cannot be found.</p>

<p>ENOEXEC An executable is not in a recognised format, is
for the wrong architecture, or has some other format error
that means it can- not be executed.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix of filename or a
script or ELF interpreter is not a directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The file system is mounted nosuid, the user is not
the supe- ruser, and the file has an SUID or SGID bit
set.</p>

<p>EPERM The process is being traced, the user is not the
superuser and the file has an SUID or SGID bit set.</p>

<p>ETXTBSY Executable was open for writing by one or more
processes.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001. POSIX.1-2001
does not document the #! behavior but is otherwise
compatible.</p>

<p>NOTES SUID and SGID processes can not be ptrace()d.</p>

<p>Linux ignores the SUID and SGID bits on scripts.</p>

<p>The result of mounting a filesystem nosuid vary between
Linux kernel versions: some will refuse execution of
SUID/SGID executables when this would give the user powers
she did not have already (and return EPERM), some will just
ignore the SUID/SGID bits and exec() successfully.</p>

<p>A maximum line length of 127 characters is allowed for
the first line in a #! executable shell script.</p>

<p>HISTORICAL With Unix V6 the argument list of an exec()
call was ended by 0, while the argument list of main was
ended by -1. Thus, this argument list was not directly
usable in a further exec() call. Since Unix V7 both are
NULL.</p>
