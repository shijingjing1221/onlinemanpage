<p>RUNUSER(1) User Commands RUNUSER(1)</p>

<p>NAME runuser - run a shell with substitute user and
group IDs, similar to su, but will not run PAM hooks</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS runuser [OPTION]... [-] [USER [ARG]...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Change the effective user id and group id to
that of USER. Only ses- sion PAM hooks are run, and there is
no password prompt. This command is useful only when run as
the root user. If run as a non-root user without privilege
to set user ID, the command will fail as the binary is not
setuid. As runuser doesnt run auth and account PAM hooks, it
runs with lower overhead than su.</p>

<p>-, -l, --login make the shell a login shell, uses
runuser-l PAM file instead of default one</p>

<p>-g --group=group specify the primary group</p>

<p>-G --supp-group=group specify a supplemental group</p>

<p>-c, --command=COMMAND pass a single COMMAND to the shell
with -c</p>

<p>--session-command=COMMAND pass a single COMMAND to the
shell with -c and do not create a new session</p>

<p>-f, --fast pass -f to the shell (for csh or tcsh)</p>

<p>-m, --preserve-environment do not reset environment
variables</p>

<p>-p same as -m</p>

<p>-s, --shell=SHELL run SHELL if /etc/shells allows it</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>A mere - implies -l. If USER not given, assume root.</p>
