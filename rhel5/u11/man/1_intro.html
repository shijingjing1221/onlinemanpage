<p>INTRO(1) Linux Programmer s Manual INTRO(1)</p>

<p>NAME intro - Introduction to user commands</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Linux is a flavour of Unix, and as a first
approximation all user com- mands under Unix work precisely
the same under Linux (and FreeBSD and lots of other
Unix-like systems).</p>

<p>Under Linux there are GUIs (graphical user interfaces),
where you can point and click and drag, and hopefully get
work done without first reading lots of documentation. The
traditional Unix environment is a CLI (command line
interface), where you type commands to tell the com- puter
what to do. That is faster and more powerful, but requires
find- ing out what the commands are. Below a bare minimum,
to get started.</p>

<p>Login In order to start working, you probably first have
to login, that is, give your username and password. See also
login(1). The program login now starts a shell (command
interpreter) for you. In case of a graphi- cal login, you
get a screen with menus or icons and a mouse click will
start a shell in a window. See also xterm(1).</p>

<p>The shell One types commands to the shell, the command
interpreter. It is not built-in, but is just a program and
you can change your shell. Every- body has her own favourite
one. The standard one is called sh. See also ash(1),
bash(1), csh(1), zsh(1), chsh(1).</p>

maja 0501-1136285 % and here typing Control-D ended the
session. The % here was the com- mand prompt it is the
shells way of indicating that it is ready for the next
command. The prompt can be customized in lots of ways, and
one might include stuff like user name, machine name,
current directory, time, etc. An assignment PS1=&quot;What
next, master? &quot; would change the prompt as
indicated.</p>

<p>We see that there are commands date (that gives date and
time), and cal (that gives a calendar).</p>

<p>The command ls lists the contents of the current
directory it tells you what files you have. With a -l option
it gives a long listing, that includes the owner and size
and date of the file, and the permissions people have for
reading and/or changing the file. For example, the file
&quot;tel&quot; here is 37 bytes long, owned by aeb and the
owner can read and write it, others can only read it. Owner
and permissions can be changed by the commands chown and
chmod.</p>

<p>The command cat will show the contents of a file. (The
name is from &quot;concatenate and print&quot;: all files
given as parameters are concatenated and sent to
&quot;standard output&quot;, here the terminal screen.)</p>

<p>The command cp (from &quot;copy&quot;) will copy a file.
On the other hand, the command mv (from &quot;move&quot;)
only renames it.</p>

<p>The command diff lists the differences between two
files. Here there was no output because there were no
differences.</p>

<p>The command rm (from &quot;remove&quot;) deletes the
file, and be careful! it is gone. No wastepaper basket or
anything. Deleted means lost.</p>

<p>The command grep (from &quot;g/re/p&quot;) finds
occurrences of a string in one or more files. Here it finds
Majas telephone number.</p>

<p>Pathnames and the current directory Files live in a
large tree, the file hierarchy. Each has a pathname
describing the path from the root of the tree (which is
called /) to the file. For example, such a full pathname
might be /home/aeb/tel. Always using full pathnames would be
inconvenient, and the name of a file in the current
directory may be abbreviated by only giving the last
component. That is why &quot;/home/aeb/tel&quot; can be
abbreviated to &quot;tel&quot; when the current directory is
&quot;/home/aeb&quot;.</p>

<p>The command pwd prints the current directory.</p>

<p>The command cd changes the current directory. Try
&quot;cd /&quot; and &quot;pwd&quot; and &quot;cd&quot; and
&quot;pwd&quot;.</p>

<p>Directories The command mkdir makes a new directory.</p>

<p>The command rmdir removes a directory if it is empty,
and complains otherwise.</p>

<p>The command find (with a rather baroque syntax) will
find files with given name or other properties. For example,
&quot;find . -name tel&quot; would find the file
&quot;tel&quot; starting in the present directory (which is
called &quot;.&quot;). And &quot;find / -name tel&quot;
would do the same, but starting at the root of the tree.
Large searches on a multi-GB disk will be time- consuming,
and it may be better to use locate(1).</p>

<p>Disks and Filesystems The command mount will attach the
filesystem found on some disk (or floppy, or CDROM or so) to
the big filesystem hierarchy. And umount detaches it again.
The command df will tell you how much of your disk is still
free.</p>

<p>Processes On a Unix system many user and system
processes run simultaneously. The one you are talking to
runs in the foreground, the others in the background. The
command ps will show you which processes are active and what
numbers these processes have. The command kill allows you to
get rid of them. Without option this is a friendly request:
please go away. And &quot;kill -9&quot; followed by the
number of the process is an immedi- ate kill. Foreground
processes can often be killed by typing Control- C.</p>

<p>Getting information There are thousands of commands,
each with many options. Traditionally commands are
documented on man pages, (like this one), so that the com-
mand &quot;man kill&quot; will document the use of the
command &quot;kill&quot; (and &quot;man man&quot; document
the command &quot;man&quot;). The program man sends the text
through some pager, usually less. Hit the space bar to get
the next page, hit q to quit.</p>

<p>In documentation it is customary to refer to man pages
by giving the name and section number, as in man(1). Man
pages are terse, and allow you to find quickly some
forgotten detail. For newcomers an introduc- tory text with
more examples and explanations is useful.</p>

<p>A lot of GNU/FSF software is provided with info files.
Type &quot;info info&quot; for an introduction on the use of
the program &quot;info&quot;.</p>

<p>Special topics are often treated in HOWTOs. Look in
/usr/share/doc/howto/en and use a browser if you find HTML
files there.</p>
