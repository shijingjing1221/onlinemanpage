<p>NAME innwatch.ctl - control Usenet supervision by
innwatch</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file &lt;pathetc in
inn.conf&gt;/innwatch.ctl is used to determine what actions
are taken during the periodic supervisions by innwatch.</p>

<p>The file consists of a series of lines; blank lines and
lines beginning with a number sign (#) are ignored. All
other lines consist of seven fields, each preceded by a
delimiting character, for example:</p>

<p>:label:state:condition:test:limit:command:reason or
@label@state@condition@test@limit@command@reason</p>

<p>The delimiter can be any one of several non-alphanumeric
characters that does not appear elsewhere in the line; there
is no way to quote it to include it in any of the fields.
Any of !, ,, :, @, ; , or ? is a good choice. Each line can
have a different delimiter; the first character on each line
is the delimiter for that line. White space surrounding
delimiters, except before the first, is ignored, and does
not form part of the fields; white space within fields is
permitted. All delimiters must be present.</p>

<p>The first field is a label for this control line. It is
used as an internal state indicator and in ctlinnd messages
to control the server. If this field is empty, the line
number is used.</p>

<p>The second field specifies when this control line should
be used. It consists of a list of labels and special
indicators, separated by whitespace. If the current state
matches against any of the labels in this field, this line
will be used as described below. The values that may be used
are:</p>

<p>- This line matches if the current state is the same as
the label on this line, or if the current state is run, the
initial state. This is also the default state if this field
is empty.</p>

<p>+ This line matches if the current state is run.</p>

<p>* This line always matches.</p>

<p>label This line matches if the current state is the
specified label.</p>

<p>-label This line matches if the current state is not the
specified label.</p>

<p>The third field specifies a shell command that is
invoked if this line matches. Do not use any shell filename
expansion characters such as *, ?, or [ (even quoted, theyre
not likely to work as intended). If the command succeeds, as
indicated by its exit status, it is expected to have printed
a single integer to standard output. This gives the value of
this control line, to be used below. If the command fails,
the line is ignored. The command is executed with its
current directory set to the news spool articles directory,
&lt;patharti- cles in inn.conf&gt;.</p>

<p>The fourth field specifies the operator to use to test
the value returned above. It should be one of the two letter
numeric test opera- tors defined in test(1) such as eq, lt
and the like. The lead- ing dash (-) should not be
included.</p>

<p>The fifth field specifies a constant with which to
compare the value using the operator just defined. This is
done by invoking the command:</p>

<p>test value -operator constant</p>

<p>The line is said to succeed if it returns true.</p>

<p>The sixth field specifies what should be done if the
line succeeds, and in some cases if it fails. Any of the
following words may be used:</p>

<p>throttle Causes innwatch to throttle the server if this
line succeeds. It also sets the state to the value of the
line s label. If the line fails, and the state was
previously equal to the label on this line (that is, this
line had previously succeeded), then a go command will be
sent to the server, and innwatch will return to the run
state. The throttle is only performed if the current state
is run or a state other than the label of this line,
regardless of whether the command succeeds.</p>

<p>pause Is identical to throttle except that the server is
paused.</p>

<p>shutdown Sends a shutdown command to the server. It is
for emergency use only.</p>

<p>flush Sends a flush command to the server.</p>

<p>go Causes innwatch to send a go command to the server
and to set the state to run.</p>

<p>exit Causes innwatch to exit.</p>

<p>skip The remainder of the control file is skipped for
the current pass.</p>

<p>The last field specifies the reason that is used in
those ctlinnd com- mands that require one. More strictly, it
is part of the reason innwatch appends some information to
it. In order to enable other sites to recognize the state of
the local innd server, this field should usually be set to
one of several standard values. Use No space if the server
is rejecting articles because of a lack of filesystem
resources. Use loadav if the server is rejecting arti- cles
because of a lack of CPU resources.</p>

<p>Once innwatch has taken some action as a consequence of
its control line, it skips the rest of the control file for
this pass. If the action was to restart the server (that is,
issue a go command), then the next pass will commence almost
immediately, so that innwatch can discover any other
condition that may mean that the server should be suspended
again.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES @@@inndf .@lt@10000@throttle@No space @@@inndf
-i .@lt@1000@throttle@No space (inodes)</p>

<p>The first line causes the server to be throttled if the
free space drops below 10000 units (using whatever units
inndf(8) uses), and restarted again when free space
increases above the threshold.</p>

<p>The second line does the same for inodes.</p>

<p>The next three lines act as a group and should appear in
the following order. It is easier to explain them, however,
if they are described from the last up.</p>

<p>!load!load hiload!loadavg!lt!5!go! :hiload:+
load:loadavg:gt:8:throttle:loadav
/load/+/loadavg/ge/6/pause/loadav</p>

<p>The final line causes the server to be paused if
innwatch is in the run state and the load average rises to,
or above, six. The state is set to load when this happens.
The previous line causes the server to be throttled when
innwatch is in the run or load state, and the load average
rises above eight. The state is set to hiload when this
happens. Note that innwatch can switch the server from
paused to throttled if the load average rises from below six
to between six and seven, and then to above eight. The first
line causes the server to be sent a go command if innwatch
is in the load or hiload state, and the load average drops
below five.</p>

<p>Note that all three lines assume a mythical command
loadavg that is assumed to print the current load average as
an integer. In more prac- tical circumstances, a pipe of
uptime into awk is more likely to be useful.</p>

<p>BUGS This file must be tailored for each individual
site, the sample sup- plied is truly no more than a sample.
The file should be ordered so that the more common problems
are tested first.</p>

<p>The run state is not actually identified by the label
with that three letter name, and using it will not work as
expected.</p>

<p>Using an unusual character for the delimiter such as (,
* , &amp; , &lsquo;, &acute;, and the like, is likely to
lead to obscure and hard to locate bugs.</p>
