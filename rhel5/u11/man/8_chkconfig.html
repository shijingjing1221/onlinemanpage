<p>CHKCONFIG(8) CHKCONFIG(8)</p>

<p>NAME chkconfig - updates and queries runlevel
information for system ser- vices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS chkconfig --list [name] chkconfig --add name
chkconfig --del name chkconfig [--level levels] name
&lt;on|off|reset|resetpriorities&gt; chkconfig [--level
levels] name</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION chkconfig provides a simple command-line
tool for maintaining the /etc/rc[0-6].d directory hierarchy
by relieving system administrators of the task of directly
manipulating the numerous symbolic links in those
directories.</p>

<p>This implementation of chkconfig was inspired by the
chkconfig command present in the IRIX operating system.
Rather than maintaining configu- ration information outside
of the /etc/rc[0-6].d hierarchy, however, this version
directly manages the symlinks in /etc/rc[0-6].d. This leaves
all of the configuration information regarding what services
init starts in a single location.</p>

<p>chkconfig has five distinct functions: adding new
services for manage- ment, removing services from
management, listing the current startup information for
services, changing the startup information for ser- vices,
and checking the startup state of a particular service.</p>

<p>When chkconfig is run without any options, it displays
usage informa- tion. If only a service name is given, it
checks to see if the service is configured to be started in
the current runlevel. If it is, chkcon- fig returns true;
otherwise it returns false. The --level option may be used
to have chkconfig query an alternative runlevel rather than
the current one.</p>

<p>If one of on, off, reset, or resetpriorities is
specified after the service name, chkconfig changes the
startup information for the speci- fied service. The on and
off flags cause the service to be started or stopped,
respectively, in the runlevels being changed. The reset flag
resets the on/off state for all runlevels for the service to
whatever is specified in the init script in question, while
the resetpriorities flag resets the start/stop priorities
for the service to whatever is specifed in the init
script.</p>

<p>By default, the on and off options affect only runlevels
2, 3, 4, and 5, while reset and resetpriorities affects all
of the runlevels. The --level option may be used to specify
which runlevels are affected.</p>

<p>Note that for every service, each runlevel has either a
start script or a stop script. When switching runlevels,
init will not re-start an already-started service, and will
not re-stop a service that is not running.</p>

<p>chkconfig also can manage xinetd scripts via the means
of xinetd.d con- figuration files. Note that only the on,
off, and --list commands are supported for xinetd.d
services.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --level levels Specifies the run levels an
operation should pertain to. It is given as a string of
numbers from 0 to 6. For example, --level 35 specifies
runlevels 3 and 5.</p>

<p>--add name</p>

<p>This option adds a new service for management by
chkconfig. When a new service is added, chkconfig ensures
that the service has either a start or a kill entry in every
runlevel. If any runlevel is missing such an entry,
chkconfig creates the appro- priate entry as specified by
the default values in the init script. Note that default
entries in LSB-delimited INIT INFO sections take precedence
over the default runlevels in the initscript.</p>

<p>--del name The service is removed from chkconfig
management, and any sym- bolic links in /etc/rc[0-6].d which
pertain to it are removed.</p>

<p>Note that future package installs for this service may
run chk- config --add, which will re-add such links. To
disable a ser- vice, run chkconfig name off.</p>

<p>--list name This option lists all of the services which
chkconfig knows about, and whether they are stopped or
started in each runlevel. If name is specified, information
in only display about service name.</p>

<p>RUNLEVEL FILES Each service which should be manageable
by chkconfig needs two or more commented lines added to its
init.d script. The first line tells chk- config what
runlevels the service should be started in by default, as
well as the start and stop priority levels. If the service
should not, by default, be started in any runlevels, a -
should be used in place of the runlevels list. The second
line contains a description for the service, and may be
extended across multiple lines with backslash con-
tinuation.</p>

<p>For example, random.init has these three lines: #
chkconfig: 2345 20 80 # description: Saves and restores
system entropy pool for # higher quality random number
generation. This says that the random script should be
started in levels 2, 3, 4, and 5, that its start priority
should be 20, and that its stop priority should be 80. You
should be able to figure out what the description says; the
causes the line to be continued. The extra space in front of
the line is ignored.</p>
