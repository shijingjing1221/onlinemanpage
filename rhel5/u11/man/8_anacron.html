<p>ANACRON(8) Anacron Users Manual ANACRON(8)</p>

<p>NAME anacron - runs commands periodically</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS anacron [-s] [-f] [-n] [-d] [-q] [-t
anacrontab] [job] ... anacron -u [-t anacrontab] [job] ...
anacron [-V|-h]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Anacron can be used to execute commands
periodically, with a frequency specified in days. Unlike
cron(8), it does not assume that the machine is running
continuously. Hence, it can be used on machines that arent
running 24 hours a day, to control daily, weekly, and
monthly jobs that are usually controlled by cron.</p>

<p>When executed, Anacron reads a list of jobs from a
configuration file, normally /etc/anacrontab (see
anacrontab(5)). This file contains the list of jobs that
Anacron controls. Each job entry specifies a period in days,
a delay in minutes, a unique job identifier, and a shell
com- mand.</p>

<p>For each job, Anacron checks whether this job has been
executed in the last n days, where n is the period specified
for that job. If not, Anacron runs the jobs shell command,
after waiting for the number of minutes specified as the
delay parameter.</p>

<p>After the command exits, Anacron records the date in a
special times- tamp file for that job, so it can know when
to execute it again. Only the date is used for the time
calculations. The hour is not used.</p>

<p>When there are no more jobs to be run, Anacron
exits.</p>

<p>Anacron only considers jobs whose identifier, as
specified in the anacrontab matches any of the job
command-line arguments. The job arguments can be shell
wildcard patterns (be sure to protect them from your shell
with adequate quoting). Specifying no job arguments, is
equivalent to specifying &quot;*&quot; (That is, all jobs
will be considered).</p>

<p>Unless the -d option is given (see below), Anacron forks
to the back- ground when it starts, and the parent process
exits immediately.</p>

<p>Unless the -s or -n options are given, Anacron starts
jobs immediately when their delay is over. The execution of
different jobs is com- pletely independent.</p>

<p>If a job generates any output on its standard output or
standard error, the output is mailed to the user running
Anacron (usually root).</p>

<p>Informative messages about what Anacron is doing are
sent to syslogd(8) under facility cron, priority notice.
Error messages are sent at pri- ority error.</p>

<p>&quot;Active&quot; jobs (i.e. jobs that Anacron already
decided to run and now wait for their delay to pass, and
jobs that are currently being exe- cuted by Anacron), are
&quot;locked&quot;, so that other copies of Anacron wont run
them at the same time.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Force execution of the jobs, ignoring the
timestamps.</p>

<p>-u Only update the timestamps of the jobs, to the
current date, but dont run anything.</p>

<p>-s Serialize execution of jobs. Anacron will not start a
new job before the previous one finished.</p>

<p>-n Run jobs now. Ignore the delay specifications in the
/etc/anacrontab file. This options implies -s.</p>

<p>-d Dont fork to the background. In this mode, Anacron
will output informational messages to standard error, as
well as to syslog. The output of jobs is mailed as
usual.</p>

<p>-q Suppress messages to standard error. Only applicable
with -d.</p>

<p>-t anacrontab Use specified anacrontab, rather than the
default</p>

<p>-V Print version information, and exit.</p>

<p>-h Print short usage message, and exit.</p>

<p>SIGNALS After receiving a SIGUSR1 signal, Anacron waits
for running jobs, if any, to finish and then exits. This can
be used to stop Anacron cleanly.</p>

<p>NOTES Make sure that the time-zone is set correctly
before Anacron is started. (The time-zone affects the date).
This is usually accom- plished by setting the TZ environment
variable, or by installing a /usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime
file. See tzset(3) for more information.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/anacrontab Contains specifications of jobs.
See anacrontab(5) for a com- plete description.</p>

<p>/var/spool/anacron This directory is used by Anacron for
storing timestamp files.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO anacrontab(5), cron(8), tzset(3)</p>

<p>The Anacron README file.</p>

<p>BUGS Anacron never removes timestamp files. Remove
unused files manually.</p>

<p>Anacron uses up to two file descriptors for each active
job. It may run out of descriptors if there are more than
about 125 active jobs (on normal kernels).</p>
