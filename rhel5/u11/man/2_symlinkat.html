<p>SYMLINKAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SYMLINKAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME symlinkat - create a symbolic link relative to a
directory file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int symlinkat(const char *oldpath, int newdirfd, const
char *newpath);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The symlinkat() system call operates in
exactly the same way as sym- link(2), except for the
differences described in this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in newpath is relative, then it is
interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor newdirfd (rather than relative to the
current working directory of the calling process, as is done
by symlink(2) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in newpath is relative and
newdirfd is the spe- cial value AT_FDCWD, then newpath is
interpreted relative to the cur- rent working directory of
the calling process (like symlink(2)).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in newpath is absolute, then
newdirfd is ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, symlinkat() returns 0. On
error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for symlink(2) can
also occur for sym- linkat(). The following additional
errors can occur for symlinkat():</p>

<p>EBADF newdirfd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR newpath is a relative path and newdirfd is a
file descriptor referring to a file other than a
directory.</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
symlinkat().</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is non-standard but is
proposed for inclusion in a future revision of POSIX.1.</p>

<p>VERSIONS symlinkat() was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16.</p>
