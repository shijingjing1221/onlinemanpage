<p>NAME genhomedircon - generate SELinux file context
configuration entries for user home directories</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS genhomedircon [ -d selinuxdir ] [-n |
--nopasswd] [-t selinuxtype ] [-h]</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Print a short usage message</p>

<p>-d selinuxdir (--directory) Directory where selinux
files are installed defaults to /etc/selinux</p>

<p>-n --nopasswd Indicates to the utility not to read
homedirectories out of the password database.</p>

<p>-t selinuxtype (--type) Indicates the selinux type of
this install. Defaults to &quot;tar- geted&quot;.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This utility is used to generate file
context configuration entries for user home directories
based on their prefix entry in the the semanage user record.
genhomedircon is run when building the policy. It is also
run automaticaly when ever the semanage utility modifies
user or login records. Specifically, we replace HOME_ROOT,
HOME_DIR, and ROLE macros in the
/etc/selinux/&lt;&lt;SELINUXTYPE&gt;&gt;/contexts/files/homedir_template
file with generic and user-specific values. HOME_ROOT and
HOME_DIR is replaced with each distinct location where login
users homedirectories are located. Defaults to /home. ROLE
is replaced based on the prefix entry in the user
record.</p>

<p>genhomedircon searches through all password entires for
all &quot;login&quot; user home directories, (as opposed to
system users). Login users are those whose UID is greater
than or equal STARTING_UID (default 500) and whose login
shell is not &quot;/sbin/nologin&quot;, or
&quot;/bin/false&quot;.</p>
