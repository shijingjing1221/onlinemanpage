<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>NAME bc - An arbitrary precision calculator language</p>

<p>SYNTAX bc [ -hlwsqv ] [long-options] [ file ... ]</p>

<p>VERSION This man page documents GNU bc version 1.06.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION bc is a language that supports arbitrary
precision numbers with inter- active execution of
statements. There are some similarities in the syntax to the
C programming language. A standard math library is available
by command line option. If requested, the math library is
defined before processing any files. bc starts by processing
code from all the files listed on the command line in the
order listed. After all files have been processed, bc reads
from the standard input. All code is executed as it is read.
(If a file contains a command to halt the processor, bc will
never read from the standard input.)</p>

<p>This version of bc contains several extensions beyond
traditional bc implementations and the POSIX draft standard.
Command line options can cause these extensions to print a
warning or to be rejected. This doc- ument describes the
language accepted by this processor. Extensions will be

<p>NUMBERS The most basic element in bc is the number.
Numbers are arbitrary pre- cision numbers. This precision is
both in the integer part and the fractional part. All
numbers are represented internally in decimal and all
computation is done in decimal. (This version truncates
results from divide and multiply operations.) There are two
attributes of num- bers, the length and the scale. The
length is the total number of sig- nificant decimal digits
in a number and the scale is the total number of decimal
digits after the decimal point. For example: .000001 has a
length of 6 and scale of 6. 1935.000 has a length of 7 and a
scale of 3.</p>

<p>VARIABLES Numbers are stored in two types of variables,
simple variables and arrays. Both simple variables and array
variables are named. Names begin with a letter followed by
any number of letters, digits and underscores. All letters
must be lower case. (Full alpha-numeric names are an
extension. In POSIX bc all names are a single lower case
letter.) The type of variable is clear by the context
because all array variable names will be followed by
brackets ([]).</p>

<p>There are four special variables, scale, ibase, obase,
and last. scale defines how some operations use digits after
the decimal point. The default value of scale is 0. ibase
and obase define the conversion base for input and output
numbers. The default for both input and output is base 10.
last (an extension) is a variable that has the value of the
last printed number. These will be discussed in further
detail where appropriate. All of these variables may have
values assigned to them as well as used in expressions.</p>

<p>COMMENTS Comments in bc start with the characters /* and
end with the characters */. Comments may start anywhere and
appear as a single space in the input. (This causes comments
to delimit other input items. For exam- ple, a comment can
not be found in the middle of a variable name.) Comments
include any newlines (end of line) between the start and the
end of the comment.</p>

<p>To support the use of scripts for bc, a single line
comment has been added as an extension. A single line
comment starts at a # character and continues to the next
end of the line. The end of line character is not part of
the comment and is processed normally.</p>

<p>EXPRESSIONS The numbers are manipulated by expressions
and statements. Since the language was designed to be
interactive, statements and expressions are executed as soon
as possible. There is no &quot;main&quot; program. Instead,
code is executed as it is encountered. (Functions, discussed
in detail later, are defined when encountered.)</p>

<p>A simple expression is just a constant. bc converts
constants into internal decimal numbers using the current
input base, specified by the variable ibase. (There is an
exception in functions.) The legal values of ibase are 2
through 16. Assigning a value outside this range to ibase
will result in a value of 2 or 16. Input numbers may contain
the characters 0-9 and A-F. (Note: They must be capitals.
Lower case let- ters are variable names.) Single digit
numbers always have the value of the digit regardless of the
value of ibase. (i.e. A = 10.) For multi-digit numbers, bc
changes all input digits greater or equal to ibase to the
value of ibase-1. This makes the number FFF always be the
largest 3 digit number of the input base.</p>

<p>Full expressions are similar to many other high level
languages. Since there is only one kind of number, there are
no rules for mixing types. Instead, there are rules on the
scale of expressions. Every expression has a scale. This is
derived from the scale of original numbers, the operation
performed and in many cases, the value of the variable
scale. Legal values of the variable scale are 0 to the
maximum number repre- sentable by a C integer.</p>

<p>In the following descriptions of legal expressions,
&quot;expr&quot; refers to a complete expression and
&quot;var&quot; refers to a simple or an array variable. A
simple variable is just a name and an array variable is
specified as name[expr] Unless specifically mentioned the
scale of the result is the maximum scale of the expressions
involved.</p>

<p>- expr The result is the negation of the expression.</p>

<p>++ var The variable is incremented by one and the new
value is the result of the expression.</p>

<p>-- var The variable is decremented by one and the new
value is the result of the expression.</p>

<p>var ++ The result of the expression is the value of the
variable and then the variable is incremented by one.</p>

<p>var -- The result of the expression is the value of the
variable and then the variable is decremented by one.</p>

<p>expr + expr The result of the expression is the sum of
the two expressions.</p>

<p>expr - expr The result of the expression is the
difference of the two expressions.</p>

<p>expr * expr The result of the expression is the product
of the two expres- sions.</p>

<p>expr / expr The result of the expression is the quotient
of the two expres- sions. The scale of the result is the
value of the variable scale.</p>

<p>expr % expr The result of the expression is the
&quot;remainder&quot; and it is com- puted in the following
way. To compute a%b, first a/b is com- puted to scale
digits. That result is used to compute a-(a/b)*b to the
scale of the maximum of scale+scale(b) and scale(a). If
scale is set to zero and both expressions are integers this
expression is the integer remainder function.</p>

<p>expr ^ expr The result of the expression is the value of
the first raised to the second. The second expression must
be an integer. (If the second expression is not an integer,
a warning is generated and the expression is truncated to
get an integer value.) The scale of the result is scale if
the exponent is negative. If the exponent is positive the
scale of the result is the minimum of the scale of the first
expression times the value of the expo- nent and the maximum
of scale and the scale of the first expres- sion. (e.g.
scale(a^b) = min(scale(a)*b, max( scale, scale(a))).) It
should be noted that expr^0 will always return the value of
1.</p>

<p>( expr ) This alters the standard precedence to force
the evaluation of the expression.</p>

<p>var = expr The variable is assigned the value of the
expression.</p>

<p>var &lt;op&gt;= expr This is equivalent to &quot;var =
var &lt;op&gt; expr&quot; with the exception that the
&quot;var&quot; part is evaluated only once. This can make a
difference if &quot;var&quot; is an array.</p>

<p>Relational expressions are a special kind of expression
that always evaluate to 0 or 1, 0 if the relation is false
and 1 if the relation is true. These may appear in any legal
expression. (POSIX bc requires that relational expressions
are used only in if, while, and for state- ments and that
only one relational test may be done in them.) The
relational operators are</p>

<p>expr1 &lt; expr2 The result is 1 if expr1 is strictly
less than expr2.</p>

<p>expr1 &lt;= expr2 The result is 1 if expr1 is less than
or equal to expr2.</p>

<p>expr1 &gt; expr2 The result is 1 if expr1 is strictly
greater than expr2.</p>

<p>expr1 &gt;= expr2 The result is 1 if expr1 is greater
than or equal to expr2.</p>

<p>expr1 == expr2 The result is 1 if expr1 is equal to
expr2.</p>

<p>expr1 != expr2 The result is 1 if expr1 is not equal to
expr2.</p>

<p>Boolean operations are also legal. (POSIX bc does NOT
have boolean operations). The result of all boolean
operations are 0 and 1 (for false and true) as in relational
expressions. The boolean operators are:</p>

<p>!expr The result is 1 if expr is 0.</p>

<p>expr &amp;&amp; expr The result is 1 if both expressions
are non-zero.</p>

<p>expr || expr The result is 1 if either expression is
non-zero.</p>

<p>The expression precedence is as follows: (lowest to
highest) || operator, left associative &amp;&amp; operator,
left associative ! operator, nonassociative Relational
operators, left associative Assignment operator, right
associative + and - operators, left associative *, / and %
operators, left associative ^ operator, right associative
unary - operator, nonassociative ++ and -- operators,
nonassociative</p>

<p>This precedence was chosen so that POSIX compliant bc
programs will run correctly. This will cause the use of the
relational and logical opera- tors to have some unusual
behavior when used with assignment expres- sions. Consider
the expression: a = 3 &lt; 5</p>

<p>Most C programmers would assume this would assign the
result of &quot;3 &lt; 5&quot; (the value 1) to the variable
&quot;a&quot;. What this does in bc is assign the value 3 to
the variable &quot;a&quot; and then compare 3 to 5. It is
best to use parenthesis when using relational and logical
operators with the assignment operators.</p>

<p>There are a few more special expressions that are
provided in bc. These have to do with user defined functions
and standard functions. They all appear as
&quot;name(parameters)&quot;. See the section on functions
for user defined functions. The standard functions are:</p>

<p>length ( expression ) The value of the length function
is the number of significant digits in the expression.</p>

<p>read ( ) The read function (an extension) will read a
number from the standard input, regardless of where the
function occurs. Beware, this can cause problems with the
mixing of data and pro- gram in the standard input. The best
use for this function is in a previously written program
that needs input from the user, but never allows program
code to be input from the user. The value of the read
function is the number read from the standard input using
the current value of the variable ibase for the con- version
base.</p>

<p>scale ( expression ) The value of the scale function is
the number of digits after the decimal point in the
expression.</p>

<p>sqrt ( expression ) The value of the sqrt function is
the square root of the expres- sion. If the expression is
negative, a run time error is gener- ated.</p>

<p>STATEMENTS Statements (as in most algebraic languages)
provide the sequencing of expression evaluation. In bc
statements are executed &quot;as soon as pos- sible.&quot;
Execution happens when a newline in encountered and there is
one or more complete statements. Due to this immediate
execution, new- lines are very important in bc. In fact,
both a semicolon and a newline are used as statement
separators. An improperly placed newline will cause a syntax
error. Because newlines are statement separators, it is
possible to hide a newline by using the backslash character.
The sequence &quot;&lt;nl&gt;&quot;, where &lt;nl&gt; is the
newline appears to bc as whitespace instead of a newline. A
statement list is a series of statements sepa- rated by
semicolons and newlines. The following is a list of bc
state- ments and what they do: (Things enclosed in brackets
([]) are optional parts of the statement.)</p>

<p>expression This statement does one of two things. If the
expression starts with &quot;&lt;variable&gt;
&lt;assignment&gt; ...&quot;, it is considered to be an
assignment statement. If the expression is not an assignment
statement, the expression is evaluated and printed to the
out- put. After the number is printed, a newline is printed.
For example, &quot;a=1&quot; is an assignment statement and
&quot;(a=1)&quot; is an expression that has an embedded
assignment. All numbers that are printed are printed in the
base specified by the variable obase. The legal values for
obase are 2 through BC_BASE_MAX. (See the section LIMITS.)
For bases 2 through 16, the usual method of writing numbers
is used. For bases greater than 16, bc uses a
multi-character digit method of printing the numbers where
each higher base digit is printed as a base 10 number. The
multi-character digits are separated by spaces. Each digit
contains the number of characters required to represent the
base ten value of &quot;obase-1&quot;. Since numbers are of
arbitrary preci- sion, some numbers may not be printable on
a single output line. These long numbers will be split
across lines using the &quot; the last character on a line.
The maximum number of characters printed per line is 70. Due
to the interactive nature of bc, printing a number causes
the side effect of assigning the printed value to the
special variable last. This allows the user to recover the
last value printed without having to retype the expression
that printed the number. Assigning to last is legal and will
overwrite the last printed value with the assigned value.
The newly assigned value will remain until the next num- ber
is printed or another value is assigned to last. (Some
installations may allow the use of a single period (.) which
is not part of a number as a short hand notation for for
last.)</p>

<p>string The string is printed to the output. Strings
start with a dou- ble quote character and contain all
characters until the next double quote character. All
characters are take literally, including any newline. No
newline character is printed after the string.</p>

<p>print list The print statement (an extension) provides
another method of output. The &quot;list&quot; is a list of
strings and expressions sepa- rated by commas. Each string
or expression is printed in the order of the list. No
terminating newline is printed. Expressions are evaluated
and their value is printed and assigned to the variable
last. Strings in the print statement are printed to the
output and may contain special characters. Special
characters start with the backslash character (. The special
characters recognized by bc are &quot;a&quot; (alert or
bell), &quot;b&quot; (backspace), &quot;f&quot; (form feed),
&quot;n&quot; (newline), &quot;r&quot; (carriage return),
&quot;q&quot; (double quote), &quot;t&quot; (tab), and
&quot; Any other character following the backslash will be
ignored.</p>

<p>{ statement_list } This is the compound statement. It
allows multiple statements to be grouped together for
execution.</p>

<p>if ( expression ) statement1 [else statement2] The if
statement evaluates the expression and executes state- ment1
or statement2 depending on the value of the expression. If
the expression is non-zero, statement1 is executed. If
statement2 is present and the value of the expression is 0,
then statement2 is executed. (The else clause is an
extension.)</p>

<p>while ( expression ) statement The while statement will
execute the statement while the expres- sion is non-zero. It
evaluates the expression before each exe- cution of the
statement. Termination of the loop is caused by a zero
expression value or the execution of a break statement.</p>

<p>for ( [expression1] ; [expression2] ; [expression3] )
statement The for statement controls repeated execution of
the statement. Expression1 is evaluated before the loop.
Expression2 is evalu- ated before each execution of the
statement. If it is non-zero, the statement is evaluated. If
it is zero, the loop is termi- nated. After each execution
of the statement, expression3 is evaluated before the
reevaluation of expression2. If expres- sion1 or expression3
are missing, nothing is evaluated at the point they would be
evaluated. If expression2 is missing, it is the same as
substituting the value 1 for expression2. (The optional
expressions are an extension. POSIX bc requires all three
expressions.) The following is equivalent code for the for
statement: expression1; while (expression2) { statement;
expression3; }</p>

<p>break This statement causes a forced exit of the most
recent enclosing while statement or for statement.</p>

<p>continue The continue statement (an extension) causes
the most recent enclosing for statement to start the next
iteration.</p>

<p>halt The halt statement (an extension) is an executed
statement that causes the bc processor to quit only when it
is executed. For example, &quot;if (0 == 1) halt&quot; will
not cause bc to terminate because the halt is not
executed.</p>

<p>return Return the value 0 from a function. (See the
section on func- tions.)</p>

<p>return ( expression ) Return the value of the expression
from a function. (See the section on functions.) As an
extension, the parenthesis are not required.</p>

<p>PSEUDO STATEMENTS These statements are not statements in
the traditional sense. They are not executed statements.
Their function is performed at &quot;compile&quot; time.</p>

<p>limits Print the local limits enforced by the local
version of bc. This is an extension.</p>

<p>quit When the quit statement is read, the bc processor
is terminated, regardless of where the quit statement is
found. For example, &quot;if (0 == 1) quit&quot; will cause
bc to terminate.</p>

<p>warranty Print a longer warranty notice. This is an
extension.</p>

<p>FUNCTIONS Functions provide a method of defining a
computation that can be exe- cuted later. Functions in bc
always compute a value and return it to the caller. Function
definitions are &quot;dynamic&quot; in the sense that a
function is undefined until a definition is encountered in
the input. That definition is then used until another
definition function for the same name is encountered. The
new definition then replaces the older definition. A
function is defined as follows: define name ( parameters ) {
newline auto_list statement_list } A function call is just
an expression of the form &quot;name(parameters)&quot;.</p>

<p>Parameters are numbers or arrays (an extension). In the
function defi- nition, zero or more parameters are defined
by listing their names sep- arated by commas. Numbers are
only call by value parameters. Arrays are only call by
variable. Arrays are specified in the parameter defi- nition
by the notation &quot;name[]&quot;. In the function call,
actual parame- ters are full expressions for number
parameters. The same notation is used for passing arrays as
for defining array parameters. The named array is passed by
variable to the function. Since function defini- tions are
dynamic, parameter numbers and types are checked when a
func- tion is called. Any mismatch in number or types of
parameters will cause a runtime error. A runtime error will
also occur for the call to an undefined function.</p>

<p>The auto_list is an optional list of variables that are
for &quot;local&quot; use. The syntax of the auto list (if
present) is &quot;auto name, ... ;&quot;. (The semicolon is
optional.) Each name is the name of an auto vari- able.
Arrays may be specified by using the same notation as used
in parameters. These variables have their values pushed onto
a stack at the start of the function. The variables are then
initialized to zero and used throughout the execution of the
function. At function exit, these variables are popped so
that the original value (at the time of the function call)
of these variables are restored. The parameters are really
auto variables that are initialized to a value provided in
the function call. Auto variables are different than
traditional local variables because if function A calls
function B, B may access function As auto variables by just
using the same name, unless function B has called them auto
variables. Due to the fact that auto variables and
parameters are pushed onto a stack, bc supports recursive
functions.</p>

<p>The function body is a list of bc statements. Again,
statements are separated by semicolons or newlines. Return
statements cause the ter- mination of a function and the
return of a value. There are two ver- sions of the return
statement. The first form, &quot;return&quot;, returns the
value 0 to the calling expression. The second form,
&quot;return ( expres- sion )&quot;, computes the value of
the expression and returns that value to the calling
expression. There is an implied &quot;return (0)&quot; at
the end of every function. This allows a function to
terminate and return 0 with- out an explicit return
statement.</p>

<p>Functions also change the usage of the variable ibase.
All constants in the function body will be converted using
the value of ibase at the time of the function call. Changes
of ibase will be ignored during the execution of the
function except for the standard function read, which will
always use the current value of ibase for conversion of
numbers.</p>

<p>As an extension, the format of the definition has been
slightly relaxed. The standard requires the opening brace be
on the same line as the define keyword and all other parts
must be on following lines. This version of bc will allow
any number of newlines before and after the opening brace of
the function. For example, the following defini- tions are
legal.</p>

<p>define d (n) { return (2*n); } define d (n) { return
(2*n); }</p>

<p>MATH LIBRARY If bc is invoked with the -l option, a math
library is preloaded and the default scale is set to 20. The
math functions will calculate their results to the scale set
at the time of their call. The math library defines the
following functions:</p>

<p>s (x) The sine of x, x is in radians.</p>

<p>c (x) The cosine of x, x is in radians.</p>

<p>a (x) The arctangent of x, arctangent returns
radians.</p>

<p>l (x) The natural logarithm of x.</p>

<p>e (x) The exponential function of raising e to the value
x.</p>

<p>j (n,x) The bessel function of integer order n of x.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES In /bin/sh, the following will assign the value
of &quot;pi&quot; to the shell variable pi.</p>

<p>pi=$(echo &quot;scale=10; 4*a(1)&quot; | bc -l)</p>

<p>The following is the definition of the exponential
function used in the math library. This function is written
in POSIX bc.</p>

<p>scale = 20</p>

<p>/* Uses the fact that e^x = (e^(x/2))^2 When x is small
enough, we use the series: e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! +
... */</p>

<p>define e(x) { auto a, d, e, f, i, m, v, z</p>

<p>/* Check the sign of x. */ if (x&lt;0) { m = 1 x = -x
}</p>

<p>/* Precondition x. */ z = scale; scale = 4 + z + .44*x;
while (x &gt; 1) { f += 1; x /= 2; }</p>

<p>/* Initialize the variables. */ v = 1+x a = x d = 1</p>

<p>for (i=2; 1; i++) { e = (a *= x) / (d *= i) if (e == 0)
{ if (f&gt;0) while (f--) v = v*v; scale = z if (m) return
(1/v); return (v/1); } v += e } }</p>

<p>The following is code that uses the extended features of
bc to imple- ment a simple program for calculating checkbook
balances. This program is best kept in a file so that it can
be used many times without having to retype it at every
use.</p>

<p>scale=2 print &quot;0heck book program!0 print &quot;
Remember, deposits are negative transactions.0 print &quot;
Exit by a 0 transaction.0</p>

<p>print &quot;Initial balance? &quot;; bal = read() bal /=
1 print &quot;0 while (1) { &quot;current balance = &quot;;
bal &quot;transaction? &quot;; trans = read() if (trans ==
0) break; bal -= trans bal /= 1 } quit</p>

<p>The following is the definition of the recursive
factorial function.</p>

<p>define f (x) { if (x &lt;= 1) return (1); return (f(x-1)
* x); }</p>

<p>READLINE AND LIBEDIT OPTIONS GNU bc can be compiled (via
a configure option) to use the GNU readline input editor
library or the BSD libedit library. This allows the user to
do editing of lines before sending them to bc. It also
allows for a history of previous lines typed. When this
option is selected, bc has one more special variable. This
special variable, history is the num- ber of lines of
history retained. For readline, a value of -1 means that an
unlimited number of history lines are retained. Setting the
value of history to a positive number restricts the number
of history lines to the number given. The value of 0
disables the history fea- ture. The default value is 100.
For more information, read the user manuals for the GNU
readline, history and BSD libedit libraries. One can not
enable both readline and libedit at the same time.</p>

<p>DIFFERENCES This version of bc was implemented from the
POSIX P1003.2/D11 draft and contains several differences and
extensions relative to the draft and traditional
implementations. It is not implemented in the traditional
way using dc(1). This version is a single process which
parses and runs a byte code translation of the program.
There is an &quot;undocu- mented&quot; option (-c) that
causes the program to output the byte code to the standard
output instead of running it. It was mainly used for
debugging the parser and preparing the math library.</p>

<p>A major source of differences is extensions, where a
feature is extended to add more functionality and additions,
where new features are added. The following is the list of
differences and extensions.</p>

<p>LANG This version does not conform to the POSIX standard
in the pro- cessing of the LANG environment variable and all
environment variables starting with LC_.</p>

<p>names Traditional and POSIX bc have single letter names
for functions, variables and arrays. They have been extended
to be multi-char- acter names that start with a letter and
may contain letters, numbers and the underscore
character.</p>

<p>Strings Strings are not allowed to contain NUL
characters. POSIX says all characters must be included in
strings.</p>

<p>last POSIX bc does not have a last variable. Some
implementations of bc use the period (.) in a similar
way.</p>

<p>comparisons POSIX bc allows comparisons only in the if
statement, the while statement, and the second expression of
the for statement. Also, only one relational operation is
allowed in each of those statements.</p>

<p>if statement, else clause POSIX bc does not have an else
clause.</p>

<p>for statement POSIX bc requires all expressions to be
present in the for statement.</p>

<p>&amp;&amp;, ||, ! POSIX bc does not have the logical
operators.</p>

<p>read function POSIX bc does not have a read
function.</p>

<p>print statement POSIX bc does not have a print statement
.</p>

<p>continue statement POSIX bc does not have a continue
statement.</p>

<p>return statement POSIX bc requires parentheses around
the return expression.</p>

<p>array parameters POSIX bc does not (currently) support
array parameters in full. The POSIX grammar allows for
arrays in function definitions, but does not provide a
method to specify an array as an actual parameter. (This is
most likely an oversight in the grammar.) Traditional
implementations of bc have only call by value array
parameters.</p>

<p>function format POSIX bc requires the opening brace on
the same line as the define key word and the auto statement
on the next line.</p>

<p>=+, =-, =*, =/, =%, =^ POSIX bc does not require these
&quot;old style&quot; assignment operators to be defined.
This version may allow these &quot;old style&quot; assign-
ments. Use the limits statement to see if the installed
version supports them. If it does support the &quot;old
style&quot; assignment operators, the statement &quot;a =-
1&quot; will decrement a by 1 instead of setting a to the
value -1.</p>

<p>spaces in numbers Other implementations of bc allow
spaces in numbers. For exam- ple, &quot;x=1 3&quot; would
assign the value 13 to the variable x. The same statement
would cause a syntax error in this version of bc.</p>

<p>errors and execution This implementation varies from
other implementations in terms of what code will be executed
when syntax and other errors are found in the program. If a
syntax error is found in a function definition, error
recovery tries to find the beginning of a statement and
continue to parse the function. Once a syntax error is found
in the function, the function will not be callable and
becomes undefined. Syntax errors in the interac- tive
execution code will invalidate the current execution block.
The execution block is terminated by an end of line that
appears after a complete sequence of statements. For
example, a = 1 b = 2 has two execution blocks and { a = 1 b
= 2 } has one execution block. Any runtime error will
terminate the execu- tion of the current execution block. A
runtime warning will not termi- nate the current execution
block.</p>

<p>Interrupts During an interactive session, the SIGINT
signal (usually gener- ated by the control-C character from
the terminal) will cause execution of the current execution
block to be interrupted. It will display a
&quot;runtime&quot; error indicating which function was
interrupted. After all runtime structures have been cleaned
up, a message will be printed to notify the user that bc is
ready for more input. All previously defined functions
remain defined and the value of all non-auto variables are
the value at the point of interruption. All auto variables
and function parame- ters are removed during the clean up
process. During a non- interactive session, the SIGINT
signal will terminate the entire run of bc.</p>

<p>LIMITS The following are the limits currently in place
for this bc processor. Some of them may have been changed by
an installation. Use the limits statement to see the actual
values.</p>

<p>BC_BASE_MAX The maximum output base is currently set at
999. The maximum input base is 16.</p>

<p>BC_DIM_MAX This is currently an arbitrary limit of 65535
as distributed. Your installation may be different.</p>

<p>BC_SCALE_MAX The number of digits after the decimal
point is limited to INT_MAX digits. Also, the number of
digits before the decimal point is limited to INT_MAX
digits.</p>

<p>BC_STRING_MAX The limit on the number of characters in a
string is INT_MAX characters.</p>

<p>exponent The value of the exponent in the raise
operation (^) is limited to LONG_MAX.</p>

<p>variable names The current limit on the number of unique
names is 32767 for each of simple variables, arrays and
functions.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables are processed by bc:</p>

<p>POSIXLY_CORRECT This is the same as the -s option.</p>

<p>BC_ENV_ARGS This is another mechanism to get arguments
to bc. The format is the same as the command line arguments.
These arguments are processed first, so any files listed in
the environent arguments are processed before any command
line argument files. This allows the user to set up
&quot;standard&quot; options and files to be processed at
every invocation of bc. The files in the environ- ment
variables would typically contain function definitions for
functions the user wants defined every time bc is run.</p>

<p>BC_LINE_LENGTH This should be an integer specifing the
number of characters in an output line for numbers. This
includes the backslash and new- line characters for long
numbers.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS If any file on the command line can not be
opened, bc will report that the file is unavailable and
terminate. Also, there are compile and run time diagnostics
that should be self-explanatory.</p>

<p>BUGS Error recovery is not very good yet.</p>

<p>Email bug reports to bug-bc@gnu.org. Be sure to include
the word bc somewhere in the Subject: field.</p>
