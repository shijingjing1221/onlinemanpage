<p>DESCRIPTION The gethostbyname() function returns a
structure of type hostent for the given host name. Here name
is either a host name, or an IPv4 address in standard dot
notation, or an IPv6 address in colon (and pos- sibly dot)
notation. (See RFC 1884 for the description of IPv6
addresses.) If name is an IPv4 or IPv6 address, no lookup is
performed and gethostbyname() simply copies name into the
h_name field and its struct in_addr equivalent into the
h_addr_list[0] field of the returned hostent structure. If
name doesnt end in a dot and the environment variable
HOSTALIASES is set, the alias file pointed to by HOSTALIASES
will first be searched for name (see hostname(7) for the
file format). The current domain and its parents are
searched unless name ends in a dot.</p>

<p>The gethostbyaddr() function returns a structure of type
hostent for the given host address addr of length len and
address type type. Valid address types are AF_INET and
AF_INET6. The host address argument is a pointer to a struct
of a type depending on the address type, for exam- ple a
struct in_addr * (probably obtained via a call to
inet_addr()) for address type AF_INET.</p>

<p>The sethostent() function specifies, if stayopen is true
(1), that a connected TCP socket should be used for the name
server queries and that the connection should remain open
during successive queries. Oth- erwise, name server queries
will use UDP datagrams.</p>

<p>The endhostent() function ends the use of a TCP
connection for name server queries.</p>

<p>The (obsolete) herror() function prints the error
message associated with the current value of h_errno on
stderr.</p>

<p>The (obsolete) hstrerror() function takes an error
number (typically h_errno) and returns the corresponding
message string.</p>

<p>The domain name queries carried out by gethostbyname()
and gethost- byaddr() use a combination of any or all of the
name server named(8), a broken out line from /etc/hosts, and
the Network Information Service (NIS or YP), depending upon
the contents of the order line in /etc/host.conf. The
default action is to query named(8), followed by
/etc/hosts.</p>

<p>The hostent structure is defined in &lt;netdb.h&gt; as
follows:</p>

<p>struct hostent { char *h_name; /* official name of host
*/ char **h_aliases; /* alias list */ int h_addrtype; /*
host address type */ int h_length; /* length of address */
char **h_addr_list; /* list of addresses */ } #define h_addr
h_addr_list[0] /* for backward compatibility */</p>

<p>The members of the hostent structure are:</p>

<p>h_name The official name of the host.</p>

<p>h_aliases An array of alternative names for the host,
terminated by a NULL pointer.</p>

<p>h_addrtype The type of address; always AF_INET or
AF_INET6 at present.</p>

<p>h_length The length of the address in bytes.</p>

<p>h_addr_list An array of pointers to network addresses
for the host (in net- work byte order), terminated by a NULL
pointer.</p>

<p>h_addr The first address in h_addr_list for backward
compatibility.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The gethostbyname() and gethostbyaddr()
functions return the hostent structure or a NULL pointer if
an error occurs. On error, the h_errno variable holds an
error number. When non-NULL, the return value may point at
static data, see the notes below.</p>

<p>ERRORS The variable h_errno can have the following
values:</p>

<p>HOST_NOT_FOUND The specified host is unknown.</p>

<p>NO_ADDRESS or NO_DATA The requested name is valid but
does not have an IP address.</p>

<p>NO_RECOVERY A non-recoverable name server error
occurred.</p>

<p>TRY_AGAIN A temporary error occurred on an authoritative
name server. Try again later.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/host.conf resolver configuration file</p>

<p>/etc/hosts host database file</p>

<p>/etc/nsswitch.conf name service switch configuration</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>SYSTEM V/POSIX EXTENSION POSIX requires the gethostent()
call, that should return the next entry in the host data
base. When using DNS/BIND this does not make much sense, but
it may be reasonable if the host data base is a file that
can be read line by line. On many systems a routine of this
name reads from the file /etc/hosts. It may be available
only when the library was built without DNS support. The
glibc version will ignore ipv6 entries. This function is not
reentrant, and glibc adds a reentrant version
gethostent_r().</p>

<p>GNU EXTENSIONS Glibc2 also has a gethostbyname2() that
works like gethostbyname(), but permits to specify the
address family to which the address must belong.</p>

<p>Glibc2 also has reentrant versions gethostbyname_r() and
gethostby- name2_r(). These return 0 on success and non-zero
on error. The result of the call is now stored in the struct
with address ret. After the call, *result will be NULL on
error or point to the result on success. Auxiliary data is
stored in the buffer buf of length buflen. (If the buffer is
too small, these functions will return ERANGE.) No global
variable h_errno is modified, but the address of a variable
in which to store error numbers is passed in h_errnop.</p>

<p>NOTES The functions gethostbyname() and gethostbyaddr()
may return pointers to static data, which may be overwritten
by later calls. Copying the struct hostent does not suffice,
since it contains pointers; a deep copy is required.</p>

<p>The SUS-v2 standard is buggy and declares the len
parameter of gethost- byaddr() to be of type size_t. (That
is wrong, because it has to be int, and size_t is not.
POSIX.1-2001 makes it socklen_t, which is OK.)</p>

<p>The BSD prototype for gethostbyaddr() uses const char *
for the first argument.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 marks gethostbyaddr() and gethostbyname()
obsolescent. See getaddrinfo(3), getnameinfo(3),
gai_strerror(3).</p>
