<p>FCHMODAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual FCHMODAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME fchmodat - change permissions of a file relative to
a directory file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fchmodat(int dirfd, const char *path, mode_t mode,
int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fchmodat() system call operates in
exactly the same way as chmod(2), except for the differences
described in this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in path is relative, then it is
interpreted rela- tive to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor dirfd (rather than relative to the current
working directory of the calling process, as is done by
chmod(2) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in path is relative and dirfd is
the special value AT_FDCWD, then path is interpreted
relative to the current work- ing directory of the calling
process (like chmod(2)).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in path is absolute, then dirfd is
ignored.</p>

<p>flags can either be 0, or include the following
flag:</p>

<p>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW If path is a symbolic link, do not
dereference it: instead oper- ate on the link itself. This
flag is not currently implemented.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, fchmodat() returns 0. On error,
-1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for chmod(2) can also
occur for fchmodat(). The following additional errors can
occur for fchmodat():</p>

<p>EBADF dirfd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid flag specified in flags.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR path is a relative path and dirfd is a file
descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.</p>

<p>ENOTSUP flags specified AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW, which is
not supported.</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
fchmodat().</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is non-standard but is
proposed for inclusion in a future revision of POSIX.1.</p>

<p>VERSIONS fchmodat() was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16.</p>
