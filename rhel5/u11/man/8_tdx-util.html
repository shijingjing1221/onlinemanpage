<p>NAME tdx-util - Tradindexed overview manipulation
utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tdx-util [-AFgio] [-a article] [-n newsgroup]
[-p path] [-R path]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tdx-util is an administrative interface to
the tradindexed overview method for INN. It only works on
tradindexed overview databases, not on any other type of INN
overview. It allows the administrator to dump various
information about the internal state of the overview, audit
it for errors, and rebuild portions of the overview
database.</p>

<p>The tradindexed overview method should lock properly and
therefore it should be safe to run this utility and perform
any operation it per- forms, including full repairs or
per-group overview rebuilds, while the server is running.
However, note that some of the operations performed by this
utility can take an extended period of time and will hold
locks in the overview database during that period, which
depending on what the server is doing may cause the server
to stall until tdx-util com- pletes its operation.</p>

<p>The dump operations are -i, which dumps the master index
for the overview database, -g, which dumps the index for an
individual group, and -o, which dumps the overview
information for a particular group (including the additional
metadata stored in the index). For -g and -o, the -n option
must also be given to specify a newsgroup to operate on.</p>

<p>To audit the entire overview database for problems, use
-A. Any prob- lems found will be reported to standard error.
There is not (yet) a corresponding option to correct the
errors found.</p>

<p>To rebuild the database for a particular newsgroup, use
-R. The -R option takes a path to a directory which contains
all of the articles for that newsgroup, one per file. The
names of the files must be the numbers of the articles in
that group. (In other words, this directory must be a
traditional spool directory for that group.) The -n option
must also be given to specify the newsgroup for which the
overview is being rebuilt.</p>

<p>For all operations performed by tdx-util, a different
overview database than the one specified in inn.conf may be
specified using the -p option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A Audit the entire overview database for
problems. This runs the internal consistency checks built
into the tradindexed overview implementation, checking such
things as the validity and reachabil- ity of all group index
entries, the format of the individual overview entries, the
correspondance of index entries to overview data, and
similar such things. No changes will be made to the
database, but problems will be reported to standard
error.</p>

<p>-a article The article number to act on. Only useful in
combination with the -o option to dump overview
information.</p>

<p>-F Audit the entire overview database for problems,
fixing them as theyre detected where possible. This runs the
internal consistency checks built into the tradindexed
overview implementation, checking such things as the
validity and reachability of all group index entries, the
format of the individual overview entries, the corre-
spondance of index entries to overview data, and similar
such things. The strategy used when fixing problems is to
throw away data thats unrecoverable, so be warned that using
this option may result in inaccessible articles if their
overview data has been corrupted.</p>

<p>To see what would be changed by -F, run tdx-util with -A
first.</p>

<p>-g Dump the master index of the overview database. This
contains sim- ilar information to the server active file,
such as high and low water marks and moderation status, and
is the information that nnrpd hands out to clients.</p>

<p>The fields are, in order, the newsgroup name, the high
water mark, the low water mark, the base article number (the
point at which the group index begins), the count of
articles in the group, the group status flag, the time (in
seconds since epoch) when that newsgroup was deleted or 0 if
it hasnt been, and the inode of the index file for that
group.</p>

<p>-i Dump the index of a particular group. The fields are,
in order, the article number, the offset of the data for
that article in the overview data file for that group, the
length of the overview data, the time (in seconds since
epoch) when the article arrived on the server, the time (in
seconds since epoch) when the article should expire based on
its Expires header (or 0 if there is no Expires header), and
the storage API token of the article.</p>

<p>If this option is given, the -n option must also be
given to spec- ify the newsgroup on which to act.</p>

<p>-n newsgroup Specify the newsgroup on which to act,
required for the -i, -o, and -R options.</p>

<p>-o Dump the overview information for a newsgroup, in the
same format as it would be returned to clients but with one
modification. Appended to the end of each entry will be four
additional pieces of data: the article number according to
the index file for that group, the storage API token for
that article, the arrival date for that article on the
server in RFC 822 date format, and the expira- tion date for
that article (from the Expires header) in RFC 822 date
format if there is any.</p>

<p>If this option is given, the -n option must also be
given to spec- ify the newsgroup on which to act. By
default, all of the overview information for that newsgroup
is dumped, but the -a option may be given to restrict the
dump to the information for a single article.</p>

<p>-p path Act on the overview database rooted in path,
overriding the overview path specified in inn.conf.</p>

<p>-R path Rebuild the overview for a given group from the
articles stored in path. The articles must be in the form of
a traditional spool directory; in other words, each article
must be in a separate file and the name of the file must
match the article number of the arti- cle.</p>

<p>If this option is given, the -n option must also be
given to spec- ify the newsgroup on which to act.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Dump the master index for the overview database
in /news/overview, regardless of the overview path specified
in inn.conf:</p>

<p>tdx-util -i -p /news/overview</p>

<p>Dump the group index for example.test:</p>

<p>tdx-util -g -n example.test</p>

<p>Dump the complete overview information for
example.test:</p>

<p>tdx-util -o -n example.test</p>

<p>Audit the entire overview database for any problems:</p>

<p>tdx-util -A</p>

<p>Rebuild the overview information for example.test from a
traditional spool directory:</p>

<p>tdx-util -R /news/spool/articles/example/test -n
example.test</p>

<p>The last command may be useful for recovering from a bad
crash or cor- rupted overview information for a particular
group, if you are also using the tradspool article storage
method.</p>
