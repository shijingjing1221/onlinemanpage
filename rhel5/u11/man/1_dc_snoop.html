<p>NAME dc_snoop - Distributed session cache traffic
analysis</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dc_snoop -listen &lt;address&gt; -server
&lt;address&gt; [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dc_snoop runs as a transparent proxy
supporting the distcache(8) proto- col and (in theory)
should work when inserted between any compliant tools. Ie.
this can be used to monitor cache operation requests and
responses between applications and dc_client, or between
dc_client and dc_server.</p>

<p>This tool is still in early stages of development and is
provided very much as-is. It is intended to be used by
developers with access to the source code - for now, most
configurable behaviour of dc_snoop is set in source code and
can not be manipulated on the command-line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -listen address Configures the address on which
dc_snoop should listen for incoming connections. The syntax
is that defined by the libnal API.</p>

<p>-server address -connect address These flags are
identical, and specify the address dc_snoop should
transparently proxy all incoming connections to. For each
connec- tion accepted by dc_snoop (on the address specified
by -listen) a corresponding connection is opened to the
address specified by these flags. When either connection is
closed, dc_snoop will corre- spondingly close the other
connection.</p>

<p>-h, -help, -? Any of these flags will cause dc_snoop to
display a brief usage summary to the console and exit
cleanly. Any other flags are ignored.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This example demonstrates the use of dc_snoop
to monitor communications between an instance of dc_client
and dc_server both running on the same machine using only
unix domain sockets. Suppose the tools are started and
tested using the following commands;</p>

<p># Start services dc_server -daemon -listen
UNIX:/tmp/cacheserver dc_client -deamon -listen
UNIX:/tmp/cacheclient -server UNIX:/tmp/cacheserver # Run
some tests dc_test -connect UNIX:/tmp/cacheclient</p>

<p>The following modification should be functionally
equivalent (ignoring the additional latency and overhead of
dc_snoop s involvement) and should generate a log file of
all cache transactions to logfile. Note the change to the
-server flag in dc_client;</p>

<p># Start services dc_server -daemon -listen
UNIX:/tmp/cacheserver dc_client -deamon -listen
UNIX:/tmp/cacheclient -server UNIX:/tmp/cachesnoop # Start
dc_snoop logging to logfile in the background dc_snoop
-listen UNIX:/tmp/cachesnoop -server UNIX:/tmp/cacheserver
&gt; logfile &amp; # Run some tests dc_test -connect
UNIX:/tmp/cacheclient</p>

<p>BUGS This program is incomplete and not at all
configurable on the com- mand-line.</p>
