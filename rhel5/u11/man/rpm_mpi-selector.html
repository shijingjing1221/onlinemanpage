<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) mpi-selector(1) User
Commands mpi-selector(1)</p>

<p>NAME mpi-selector - A simple site-wide/per-user MPI
selection tool for clus- ters with more than one MPI
implementation installed.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Commands for end users</p>

<p>mpi-selector [options] --list</p>

<p>mpi-selector [options] --set &lt;name&gt;</p>

<p>mpi-selector [options] --unset</p>

<p>mpi-selector [options] --query</p>

<p>mpi-selector [options] --version</p>

<p>Commands for MPI implementations</p>

<p>mpi-selector [options] --register &lt;name&gt;
--source-dir &lt;dir&gt;</p>

<p>mpi-selector [options] --unregister &lt;name&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mpi-selector command is a simplistic
tool to select one of multiple MPI implementations.
mpi-selector allows system administrators to set a site-wide
default MPI implementation while also allowing users to set
their own default MPI implementation (thereby overriding the
system- wide default).</p>

<p>Note that both the site-wide and per-user defaults are
independent from each other; a system administrator may
choose not to have a site-wide default while a user may
choose to have a personal default -- and vice versa.</p>

<p>The system is effected by having system-wide shell
startup files that looks first at the users MPI preferences.
If found, the MPI implemen- tation indicated by the users
preferences is setup in the current environment. If not
found, look for a site-wide default. If found, the MPI
implementation indicated in by the site-wide default is
setup in the current environment. If not found, exit
silently.</p>

<p>End Users / System Administrators</p>

<p>The mpi-selector command provides four main actions:</p>

<p>* List which MPI implementations are available * Set a
default (either on a per-user or site-wide basis) * Unset a
default (either on a per-user or site-wide basis) * Query
what the current default is</p>

<p>A common scenario is that a system administrator sets a
site-wide default for a supported MPI implementation that
most users will use. Power users then change their per-user
defaults to use a different MPI implementation.</p>

<p>Another common scenario is for power users to frequently
use mpi-selec- tor to swap back and forth between multiple
different MPI implementa- tions.</p>

<p>NOTE: The mpi-selector command only changes the defaults
for new shells. Specifically, after you invoke the
mpi-selector command to change the default MPI
implementation, this change does not take effect until you
start a new shell. This is intentional. See the &quot;KNOWN
LIM- ITATIONS&quot; section, below.</p>

<p>MPI Implementations</p>

<p>MPI implementations register themselves with
mpi-selector when they are installed and unregister
themselves when they are uninstalled. Each MPI installation
provides two files that setup the environment for
itself:</p>

<p>* mpivars.sh: File sourceable by Bourne-like shells (sh,
bash, etc.) * mpivars.csh: File sourceable by C-like shells
(csh, tcsh, etc.)</p>

<p>These files are expected to be in a single directory and
&quot;registered&quot; with mpi-selector using the
--register and --source-dir options. mpi- selector will copy
these files to its own internal store; it is safe to remove
the originals after the mpi-selector registration completes
suc- cessfully.</p>

<p>The &lt;name&gt; argument to --register must be
simplistic -- it cannot con- tain any shell special
characters (not even if they are escaped), nor can it
contain spaces. The intent is to provide simple names that
users can type without escaping or quoting. Names not
conforming to these rules will be rejected and the
registration will fail.</p>

<p>When an MPI implementation is uninstalled, it should
unregister with mpi-selector via the --unregister
option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --list: List which MPI implementations are
available</p>

<p>--no: Assume &quot;no&quot; to any interactive questions
asked.</p>

<p>--query: See what the current default is. If specified
with no options, whichevery default has precedence -- if any
-- will be shown. If specified with --user, only show the
per-user default (if there is one). If specified with
--system, only show the site-wide default (if there is
one).</p>

<p>--register: Register a new MPI implementation. Must be
combined with the --source-dir option.</p>

<p>--set &lt;name&gt;: Set the default MPI implementation.
May be combined with --system or --user (--user is the
default and does not need to be spec- ified).</p>

<p>--source-dir: Specify the location where mpivars.* files
should be copied from. Only meaningful when used with the
--register option.</p>

<p>--system: When used with --set or --unset, specifies to
work with the site-wide default (vs. the per-user default).
When used with --query, it specifies to specifically query
the site-wide default.</p>

<p>--unregister: Unregister an MPI implementation.</p>

<p>--user: When used with --set or --unset, specifies to
work with the per-user default (vs. the site-wide default).
When used with --query, it specifies to specifically query
the per-user default.</p>

<p>--unset: Unset the default MPI implementation. May be
combined with --system or --user (--user is the default and
does not need to be explicitly specified).</p>

<p>--verbose: Be verbose.</p>

<p>--version: Return the version of mpi-selector.</p>

<p>--yes: Assume &quot;yes&quot; to any interactive
questions asked.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Examples for End Users / System
Administrators</p>

<p>The four main actions that system administrators and end
users invoke are: listing which MPI implementations are
available, setting a default, unsetting a default, and
querying what the current default is.</p>

<p>Listing which MPI implementations are available</p>

<p>The --list option to the mpi-selector command shows a
simple list of which MPI implementations are available:</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --list mympi-1.2.3 mympi-4.5.6
othermpi-7.8.9 shell$</p>

<p>Setting a default</p>

<p>By default, MPI selections are performed on a per-user
basis with the --set option, using a name from the list of
available MPI implementa- tions (which can be obtained via
the --list command):</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --set mympi-4.5.6 shell$</p>

<p>Note that the default takes effect in the next shell
that is started; it does NOT take effect in the current
shell!</p>

<p>If a default MPI is already set, setting a new default
will cause an interactive confirmation prompt. This
interactive prompt can be avoided by using the --yes option,
which assumes a &quot;yes&quot; answer to all questions:</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --set mympi-4.5.6 shell$
mpi-selector --set mympi-4.5.6 --yes shell$</p>

<p>If the --system option is used, the site-wide default is
modified instead of the per-user default. Since this option
typically reqires writing files into protected areas, root
access may be required.</p>

<p>shell# mpi-selector --set mympi-4.5.6 --system
shell#</p>

<p>Unsetting a default</p>

<p>Unset the current default with the --unset option:</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --unset shell$</p>

<p>Similar to --set, the --system option can be used to
unset the site- wide default</p>

<p>shell# mpi-selector --unset --system shell#</p>

<p>Querying what the current default is</p>

<p>The --query option can be used to see what the current
MPI implementation is (more specifically, what the MPI
implementation will be for the next shell that is started).
It indicates both which MPI is the default and at what level
the default was set (per-user vs. site-wide):</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --set mympi-1.2.3 shell$
mpi-selector --query default:mympi-1.2.3 level:user
shell$</p>

<p>Note that if there is no per-user default, the system
default will be shown:</p>

<p>shell# mpi-selector --set othermpi-7.8.9 --system</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --unset shell$ mpi-selector --query
default:othermpi-7.8.9 level:system shell$ mpi-selector
--set mympi-1.2.3 shell$ mpi-selector --query
default:mympi-1.2.3 level:user shell$</p>

<p>If there is no per-user default and no site-wide
default, --query will return silently:</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --query shell$</p>

<p>Examples for MPI Implementations</p>

<p>Registering and unregistering typically writes files
into protected areas, and therefore usually requires root
access.</p>

<p>If there are no MPI implementations registered, --list
will return silently:</p>

<p>shell# mpi-selector --list shell#</p>

<p>An MPI with mpivars.sh and mpivars.csh in /opt/mympi/bin
can be regis- tered as follows:</p>

<p>shell# mpi-selector --register mympi-1.2.3 --source-dir
/opt/mympi/bin shell# mpi-selector --list mympi-1.2.3
shell#</p>

<p>Note that re-registering the same &lt;name&gt; will
cause an interactive con- firmation prompt; the --yes option
can be supplied to assume &quot;yes&quot; to all questions
asked:</p>

<p>shell# mpi-selector --list mympi-1.2.3 shell#
mpi-selector --register mympi-1.2.3 --source-dir
/opt/mympi/bin --yes mympi-1.2.3 is already registered.
Overwriting previously registered files. shell# mpi-selector
--list mympi-1.2.3 shell#</p>

<p>Unregistering is also simple:</p>

<p>shell# mpi-selector --list mympi-1.2.3 shell#
mpi-selector --unregister mympi-1.2.3 shell# mpi-selector
--list shell#</p>

<p>Registering and Unregistering in RPMs</p>

<p>Registering and unregistering via RPM is unfortunately
more complicated than it needs to be because of the
following issues:</p>

<p>1. Although RPM obeys dependency ordering of &quot;rpm
-i a b c&quot;. That is, c will be installed before a if a
requires c. Regardless, RPM s must know a) that the
mpi-selector command is installed, and b) be able to find it
in its path.</p>

<p>2. RPM does not obey dependency ordering of &quot;rpm -e
a b c&quot;. That is, c may be uninstalled before a, even if
a requires c. Hence, the mpi-select command may disappear
before an RPM using the mpi-select command in a scriptlet is
uninstalled.</p>

<p>3. &quot;Updating&quot; RPMs will first uninstall the
old RPM and then re-install the new one.</p>

<p>Additionally, the staged installations (such as the OFED
installer) require telling the mpi-selector command
additional information so that various internal data files
can be found.</p>

<p>In general, MPI installations via RPMs should register
during the %post scriptlet and unregister during the %preun
scriptlet (not during the %postun scriptlet!).</p>

<p>If RPMs &quot;require&quot; the mpi-selector RPM, they
can be assured that the mpi-selector command will exist and
be installed properly, but they still need to be able to
find mpi-selector in their PATH. Hence, if mpi-selector is
not installed into a default PATH location, the %post
scriptlet won t be able to find it, and the registration
call will fail. The simplest workaround (at least for the
moment) is to set the PATH to where mpi-selector is
installed before installing any RPMs that use it.</p>

<p>With that in mind, here is a possible %post scriptlet
for OFED- installed RPMS:</p>

<p>mpi-selector --register &lt;name&gt; --source-dir
&lt;source_dir&gt; --yes --silent</p>

<p>Note the following:</p>

<p>1. The --yes option forces an overwrite if, for some
reason, a previous MPI of the name name is already
registered.</p>

<p>2. The --silent option makes mpi-selector run silently,
since RPMs are supposed to install with no output.</p>

<p>Here is a possible %preun scriptlet for OFED-installed
RPMs:</p>

<p>mpi-selector --unregister &lt;name&gt; --yes /bin/true
&gt; /dev/null 2&gt; /dev/null</p>

<p>Note the following:</p>

<p>1. We use %preun instead of %postun because of RPM s
upgrade behavior.</p>

<p>2. Since RPM does not honor dependencies when
uninstalling, it is possible that mpi-selector is no longer
installed, and therefore the command may fail. However,
since mpi-selector is no longer installed, we dont care that
it failed (i.e., there s nothing to unregister from), so
just redirect all output to /dev/null and ensure that the
return code from the overall command is &quot;true&quot;
(RPM will abort if any individual scriptlet command
fails).</p>

<p>KNOWN LIMITATIONS The main known limitation of
mpi-selector is that it only affects future shells --
running it does not affect the current shell. After you run
mpi-selector to set a new default MPI (regardless of whether
it is a system-level or user-specific default), that default
will not take effect until you start a new shell -- even
though --query will report the new default.</p>

<p>This behavior is because mpi-selector defaults are only
read during shell startup. It was an intentional design
decision -- mpi-selector is intended to be a simplistic
tool, and an all-encompassing solution.</p>

<p>Other solutions for modifying the current environment
exist, such as the Environment Modules package
(&lt;http://modules.sourceforge.net/&gt;) and SoftEnv from
Argonne National Laboratory (and probably others). Using
these tools, you can immediately change the environment of
the current shell (to include switching to use a different
MPI implementation). As such, these already-existing, mature
tools are better suited for such usage patterns;
mpi-selector is not intended to replace them.</p>

<p>For rsh/ssh-based parallel environments, switching
defaults frequently should be done with care. Specifically,
rsh/ssh-based launchers may depends on a common environment
across all nodes (e.g., to find helper executables and/or
libraries for a specific MPI). Consider the follow- ing
example:</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --set mympi-1.2.3 shell$ mpicc
my_mpi_app.c -o my_mpi_app shell$ mpirun -np 32 --hostfile
myhosts my_mpi_app</p>

<p>While my_mpi_app is starting, it may be dangerous to
switch the mpi- selector default (perhaps in a different
window) because the rsh and/or ssh commands currently
executing may be relying on finding the same MPI
implementation on all nodes. Changing the default while the
applica- tion is launching may cause a different MPI
implementation to be found on some nodes, thereby causing
undefined behavior.</p>
