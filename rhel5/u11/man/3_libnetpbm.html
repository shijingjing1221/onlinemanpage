<p>NAME libnetpbm - general introduction to the netpbm
library</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION libnetpbm is a C programming library for
reading, writing, and manipu- lating Netpbm images. It also
contains a few general graphics manipu- lation tools, but it
is not intended to be a graphics tools library. For graphics
tools, Netpbm expects you to run the Netpbm programs. From a
C program, the libnetpbm function pm_system() makes this
easy. However, since it creates a process and execs a
program, this may be too heavyweight for some
applications.</p>

<p>To use libnetpbm services in your C program, #include
the pam.h inter- face header file. For historical reasons,
you can also get by in some cases with pbm.h, pgm.h, ppm.h,
or pnm.h, but there s really no point to that anymore.</p>

<p>The libnetpbm functions are divided into these
categories:</p>

<p>&middot; PBM functions. These have names that start with
pbm and work only on PBM images.</p>

<p>&middot; PGM functions. These have names that start with
pgm and work only on PGM images.</p>

<p>&middot; PPM functions. These have names that start with
ppm and work only on PPM images.</p>

<p>&middot; PNM functions. These have names that start with
pnm and work on PBM, PGM, and PPM images.</p>

<p>&middot; PAM functions. These also have names that start
with pnm and work on all the Netpbm image types.</p>

<p>&middot; PM functions. These are utility functions that
arent specific to any particular image format.</p>

<p>For new programming, you rarely need to concern yourself
with the PBM, PGM, PPM, and PNM functions, because the newer
PAM functions do the same thing and are easier to use. For
certain processing of bi-level images, the PBM functions are
significantly more efficient, though.</p>

<p>libnetpbm has a backward compatibility feature that
means a function designed to read one format can read some
others too, converting on the fly. In particular, a function
that reads a PGM image will also read a PBM image, but
converts it as it reads it so that for programming pur-
poses, it is a PGM image. Similarly, a function that reads
PPM can read PBM and PGM as well. And a function that reads
PBM, PGM, or PPM can read a PAM that has an equivalent tuple
type.</p>

<p>For each of the five classes of libnetpbm image
processing functions, libnetpbm has in in-memory
representation for a pixel, a row, and a whole image. Do not
confuse this format with the actual image format, as you
would see in a file. The libnetpbm in-memory format is
designed to make programming very easy. It is sometimes
extremely inefficient, even more than the actual image
format. For example, a pixel that a PPM image represents
with 3 bytes, libnetpbm s PAM functions represent with 16
bytes. A pixel in a PBM image is represented by a single
bit, but the PNM functions represent that pixel in memory
with 96 bits.</p>

<p>See LibnetpbmUser sManual(1)forthe basics on using
libnetpbm in a pro- gram.</p>

<p>You can look up the reference information for a
particular function in ThelibnetpbmDirectory(1).</p>

<p>Before Netpbm release 10 (June 2002), this library was
split into four: libpbm, libpgm, libppm, and libpnm. That s
largely the reason for the multiple sets of functions and
scattered documentation.</p>
