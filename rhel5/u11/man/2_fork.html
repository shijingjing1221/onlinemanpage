<p>FORK(2) Linux Programmer s Manual FORK(2)</p>

<p>NAME fork - create a child process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>pid_t fork(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fork() creates a child process that differs
from the parent process only in its PID and PPID, and in the
fact that resource utilizations are set to 0. File locks and
pending signals are not inherited.</p>

<p>Under Linux, fork() is implemented using copy-on-write
pages, so the only penalty that it incurs is the time and
memory required to dupli- cate the parent s page tables, and
to create a unique task structure for the child.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, the PID of the child process is
returned in the parents thread of execution, and a 0 is
returned in the childs thread of exe- cution. On failure, a
-1 will be returned in the parent s context, no child
process will be created, and errno will be set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN fork() cannot allocate sufficient memory
to copy the parents page tables and allocate a task
structure for the child.</p>

<p>EAGAIN It was not possible to create a new process
because the callers RLIMIT_NPROC resource limit was
encountered. To exceed this limit, the process must have
either the CAP_SYS_ADMIN or the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE
capability.</p>

<p>ENOMEM fork() failed to allocate the necessary kernel
structures because memory is tight.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE See pipe(2) and wait(2).</p>
