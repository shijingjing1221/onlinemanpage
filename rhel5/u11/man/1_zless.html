<p>NAME zless - file perusal filter for crt viewing of
compressed text</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS zless [ name ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Zless is a filter which allows examination
of compressed or plain text files one screenful at a time on
a soft-copy terminal. It is the equivalent of setting the
environment variable LESSOPEN to &quot;|gzip -cdfq %s&quot;,
and then running less. However, enough people seem to think
that having the command zless available is important to be
worth providing it.</p>
