<p>NAME stdin, stdout, stderr - standard I/O streams</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; extern FILE *stdin;
extern FILE *stdout; extern FILE *stderr;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Under normal circumstances every Unix
program has three streams opened for it when it starts up,
one for input, one for output, and one for printing
diagnostic or error messages. These are typically attached
to the user s terminal (see tty(4)) but might instead refer
to files or other devices, depending on what the parent
process chose to set up. (See also the Redirection section
of sh(1) .)</p>

<p>The input stream is referred to as standard input; the
output stream is referred to as standard output; and the
error stream is referred to as standard error. These terms
are abbreviated to form the symbols used to refer to these
files, namely stdin, stdout, and stderr.</p>

<p>Each of these symbols is a stdio(3) macro of type
pointer to FILE, and can be used with functions like
fprintf(3) or fread(3).</p>

<p>Since FILEs are a buffering wrapper around Unix file
descriptors, the same underlying files may also be accessed
using the raw Unix file inter- face, that is, the functions
like read(2) and lseek(2).</p>

<p>On program startup, the integer file descriptors
associated with the streams stdin, stdout, and stderr are 0,
1, and 2, respectively. The preprocessor symbols
STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, and STDERR_FILENO are defined
with these values in &lt;unistd.h&gt;. (Applying freopen(3)
to one of these streams can change the file descriptor
number associated with the stream.)</p>

<p>Note that mixing use of FILEs and raw file descriptors
can produce unex- pected results and should generally be
avoided. (For the masochistic among you: POSIX.1, section
8.2.3, describes in detail how this interac- tion is
supposed to work.) A general rule is that file descriptors
are handled in the kernel, while stdio is just a library.
This means for example, that after an exec(), the child
inherits all open file descrip- tors, but all old streams
have become inaccessible.</p>

<p>Since the symbols stdin, stdout, and stderr are
specified to be macros, assigning to them is non-portable.
The standard streams can be made to refer to different files
with help of the library function freopen(3), specially
introduced to make it possible to reassign stdin, stdout,
and stderr. The standard streams are closed by a call to
exit(3) and by nor- mal program termination.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO sh(1), csh(1), open(2), fopen(3), stdio(3)</p>

<p>CONSIDERATIONS The stream stderr is unbuffered. The
stream stdout is line-buffered when it points to a terminal.
Partial lines will not appear until fflush(3) or exit(3) is
called, or a newline is printed. This can produce unexpected
results, especially with debugging output. The buffering
mode of the standard streams (or any other stream) can be
changed using the setbuf(3) or setvbuf(3) call. Note that in
case stdin is associated with a termi- nal, there may also
be input buffering in the terminal driver, entirely
unrelated to stdio buffering. (Indeed, normally terminal
input is line buffered in the kernel.) This kernel input
handling can be modified using calls like tcsetattr(3); see
also stty(1), and termios(3).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The stdin, stdout, and stderr macros
conform to ANSI X3.159-1989 (ANSI C), and this standard also
stipulates that these three streams shall be open at program
startup.</p>
