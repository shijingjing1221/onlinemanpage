<p>NAME tty - controlling terminal</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file /dev/tty is a character file with
major number 5 and minor number 0, usually of mode 0666 and
owner.group root.tty. It is a syn- onym for the controlling
terminal of a process, if any.</p>

<p>In addition to the ioctl() requests supported by the
device that tty refers to, the ioctl() request TIOCNOTTY is
supported.</p>

<p>TIOCNOTTY Detach the current process from its
controlling terminal.</p>

<p>If the process is the session leader, then SIGHUP and
SIGCONT signals are sent to the foreground process group and
all processes in the cur- rent session lose their
controlling tty.</p>

<p>This ioctl() call only works on file descriptors
connected to /dev/tty. It is used by daemon processes when
they are invoked by a user at a terminal. The process
attempts to open /dev/tty. If the open succeeds, it detaches
itself from the terminal by using TIOCNOTTY, while if the
open fails, it is obviously not attached to a terminal and
does not need to detach itself.</p>

<p>FILES /dev/tty</p>

<p>SEE ALSO chown(1), getty(1), mknod(1), ioctl(2),
