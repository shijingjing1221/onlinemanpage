<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>NAME yum - Yellowdog Updater Modified</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS yum [options] [command] [package ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION yum is an interactive, rpm based, package
manager. It can automatically perform system updates,
including dependency analysis and obsolete pro- cessing
based on &quot;repository&quot; metadata. It can also
perform installa- tion of new packages, removal of old
packages and perform queries on the installed and/or
available packages among many other commands/ser- vices (see
below). yum is similar to other high level package managers
like apt-get and smart.</p>

<p>While there are some graphical interfaces directly to
the yum code, more recent graphical interface development is
happening with Pack- ageKit and the gnome-packagekit
application.</p>

<p>command is one of: * install package1 [package2] [...] *
update [package1] [package2] [...] * update-to [package1]
[package2] [...] * check-update * upgrade [package1]
[package2] [...] * upgrade-to [package1] [package2] [...] *

<p>Unless the --help or -h option is given, one of the
above commands must be present.</p>

<p>Repository configuration is honored in all
operations.</p>

<p>install Is used to install the latest version of a
package or group of packages while ensuring that all
dependencies are satisfied. If no package matches the given
package name(s), they are assumed to be a shell glob and any
matches are then installed. If the name starts with an @
character the rest of the name is used as though passed to
the groupinstall command. If the name is a file, then
install works like localinstall. If the name doesnt match a
package, then package &quot;provides&quot; are searched (Eg.
&quot;_sqlitecache.so()(64bit)&quot;) as are filelists (Eg.
&quot;/usr/bin/yum&quot;). Also note that for filelists,
wildcards will match multiple packages.</p>

<p>update If run without any packages, update will update
every currently installed package. If one or more packages
or package globs are specified, Yum will only update the
listed packages. While updating packages, yum will ensure
that all dependencies are satisfied. If the packages or
globs specified match to packages which are not currently
installed then update will not install them. update operates
on groups, files, provides and filelists just like the
&quot;install&quot; command.</p>

<p>If the main obsoletes configure option is true (default)
or the --obsoletes flag is present yum will include package
obsoletes in its calculations - this makes it better for
distro-version changes, for example: upgrading from
somelinux 8.0 to somelinux 9.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;update&quot; works on installed packages
first, and only if there are no matches does it look for
available packages. The difference is most noticable when
you do &quot;update foo-1-2&quot; which will act exactly as
&quot;update foo&quot; if foo-1-2 is installed. You can use
the &quot;update-to&quot; if you d prefer that nothing
happen in the above case.</p>

<p>update-to This command works like &quot;update&quot; but
always specifies the ver- sion of the package we want to
update to.</p>

<p>check-update Implemented so you could know if your
machine had any updates that needed to be applied without
running it interactively. Returns exit value of 100 if there
are packages available for an update. Also returns a list of
the pkgs to be updated in list format. Returns 0 if no
packages are available for update. Returns 1 if an error
occurred. Running in verbose mode also shows obsoletes.</p>

<p>upgrade Is the same as the update command with the
--obsoletes flag set. See update for more details.</p>

<p>upgrade-to This command works like &quot;upgrade&quot;
but always specifies the ver- sion of the package we want to
update to.</p>

<p>remove or erase Are used to remove the specified
packages from the system as well as removing any packages
which depend on the package being removed. remove operates
on groups, files, provides and filelists just like the
&quot;install&quot; command.</p>

<p>list Is used to list various information about available
packages; more complete details are available in the List
Options section below.</p>

<p>provides or whatprovides Is used to find out which
package provides some feature or file. Just use a specific
name or a file-glob-syntax wildcards to list the packages
available or installed that provide that feature or
file.</p>

<p>search Is used to find any packages matching a string in
the descrip- tion, summary and package name fields of an
rpm. Useful for finding a package you do not know by name
but know by some word related to it.</p>

<p>info Is used to list a description and summary
information about available packages; takes the same
arguments as in the List Options section below.</p>

<p>clean Is used to clean up various things which
accumulate in the yum cache directory over time. More
complete details can be found in the Clean Options section
below.</p>

<p>makecache Is used to download and make usable all the
metadata for the currently enabled yum repos.</p>

<p>groupinstall Is used to install all of the individual
packages in a group, of the specified types (this works as
if you d taken each of those package names and put them on
the command line for a &quot;yum install&quot; command). The
group_package_types configuration option specifies which
types will be installed.</p>

<p>groupupdate Is just an alias for groupinstall, which
will do the right thing because &quot;yum install X&quot;
and &quot;yum update X&quot; do the same thing, when X is
already installed.</p>

<p>grouplist Is used to list the available groups from all
yum repos. Groups are marked as &quot;installed&quot; if all
mandatory packages are installed, or if a group doesn t have
any mandatory packages then it is installed if any of the
optional or default package are installed. The optional
&quot;hidden&quot; argument will also list groups marked as
not being &quot;user visible&quot;. If you pass the -v
option, to enable verbose mode, then the groupids are dis-
played.</p>

<p>groupremove Is used to remove all of the packages in a
group, unlike &quot;groupinstall&quot; this will remove
everything regardless of group_package_types. It is worth
pointing out that packages can be in more than one group, so
&quot;groupinstall X Y&quot; followed by &quot;groupremove
Y&quot; does not do give you the same result as
&quot;groupinstall X&quot;.</p>

<p>groupinfo Is used to give the description and package
list of a group (and which type those packages are marked
as). Note that you can use the yum-filter-data and
yum-list-data plugins to get/use the data the other way
around (Ie. what groups own packages need updating). If you
pass the -v option, to enable verbose mode, then the package
names are matched against installed/available packages
similar to the list command.</p>

<p>shell Is used to enter the yum shell, when a filename is
specified the contents of that file is executed in yum shell
mode. See yum-shell(8) for more info</p>

<p>resolvedep Is used to list packages providing the
specified dependencies, at most one package is listed per
dependency.</p>

<p>localinstall Is used to install a set of local rpm
files. If required the enabled repositories will be used to
resolve dependencies. Note that the install command will do
a local install, if given a filename.</p>

<p>localupdate Is used to update the system by specifying
local rpm files. Only the specified rpm files of which an
older version is already installed will be installed, the
remaining specified packages will be ignored. If required
the enabled repositories will be used to resolve
dependencies. Note that the update command will do a local
install, if given a filename.</p>

<p>reinstall Will reinstall the identically versioned
package as is currently installed. This does not work for
&quot;installonly&quot; packages, like Kernels. reinstall
operates on groups, files, provides and filelists just like
the &quot;install&quot; command.</p>

<p>downgrade Will try and downgrade a package from the
version currently installed to the previously highest
version (or the specified version). The depsolver will not
necessarily work, but if you specify all the packages it
should work (and thus. all the sim- ple cases will work).
Also this does not work for &quot;installonly&quot;
packages, like Kernels. downgrade operates on groups, files,
provides and filelists just like the &quot;install&quot;
command.</p>

<p>deplist Produces a list of all dependencies and what
packages provide those dependencies for the given
packages.</p>

<p>repolist Produces a list of configured repositories. The
default is to list all enabled repositories. If you pass -v,
for verbose mode, more information is listed. If the first
argument is enabled, disabled or all then the command will
list those types of repos.</p>

<p>You can pass repo id or name arguments, or wildcards
which to match against both of those. However if the ir or
name matches exactly then the repo will be listed even if
you are listing enabled repos. and it is disabled.</p>

<p>In non-verbose mode the first column will start with a *
if the repo. has metalink data and the latest metadata is
not local. For non-verbose mode the last column will also
display the number of packages in the repo. and (if there
are any user specified excludes) the number of packages
excluded.</p>

<p>One last special feature of repolist, is that if you are
in non- verbose mode then yum will ignore any repo errors
and output the information it can get (Eg. &quot;yum clean
all; yum -C repolist&quot; will output something, although
the package counts/etc. will be zeroed out).</p>

<p>help Produces help, either for all commands or if given
a command name then the help for that particular
command.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS Most command line options can be set
using the configuration file as well and the descriptions
indicate the necessary configuration option to set.</p>

<p>-h, --help Help; display a help message and then
quit.</p>

<p>-y Assume yes; assume that the answer to any question
which would be asked is yes. Configuration Option:
assumeyes</p>

<p>-c [config file] Specifies the config file location -
can take http, ftp urls and local file paths.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Run without output. Note that you likely
also want to use -y.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Run with a lot of debugging output.</p>

<p>-d [number] Sets the debugging level to [number] - turns
up or down the amount of things that are printed. Practical
range: 0 - 10 Configuration Option: debuglevel</p>

<p>-e [number] Sets the error level to [number] Practical
range 0 - 10. 0 means print only critical errors about which
you must be told. 1 means print all errors, even ones that
are not overly important. 1+ means print more errors (if
any) -e 0 is good for cron jobs. Configuration Option:
errorlevel</p>

<p>-R [time in minutes] Sets the maximum amount of time yum
will wait before performing a command - it randomizes over
the time.</p>

<p>-C Tells yum to run entirely from cache - does not
download or update any headers unless it has to to perform
the requested action.</p>

<p>--version Reports the yum version number and exits.</p>

<p>--showduplicates Doesnt limit packages to their latest
versions in the info, list and search commands (will also
affect plugins which use the doPackageLists() API).</p>

<p>--installroot=root Specifies an alternative installroot,
relative to which all packages will be installed.
Configuration Option: installroot</p>

<p>--enablerepo=repoidglob Enables specific repositories by
id or glob that have been dis- abled in the configuration
file using the enabled=0 option. Configuration Option:
enabled</p>

<p>--disablerepo=repoidglob Disables specific repositories
by id or glob. Configuration Option: enabled</p>

<p>--obsoletes This option only has affect for an update,
it enables yum&acute;s obsoletes processing logic. For more
information see the update command above. Configuration
Option: obsoletes</p>

<p>-x, --exclude=package Exclude a specific package by name
or glob from updates on all repositories. Configuration
Option: exclude</p>

<p>--color=[always|auto|never] Display colorized output
automatically, depending on the output terminal, always
(using ANSI codes) or never. Note that some commands (Eg.
list and info) will do a little extra work when color is
enabled. Configuration Option: color</p>

<p>--disableexcludes=[all|main|repoid] Disable the excludes
defined in your config files. Takes one of three options:
all == disable all excludes main == disable excludes defined
in [main] in yum.conf repoid == disable excludes defined for
that repo</p>

<p>--disableplugin=plugin Run with one or more plugins
disabled, the argument is a comma separated list of
wildcards to match against plugin names.</p>

<p>--noplugins Run with all plugins disabled. Configuration
Option: plugins</p>

<p>--nogpgcheck Run with gpg signature checking disabled.
Configuration Option: gpgcheck</p>

<p>--skip-broken Resolve depsolve problems by removing
packages that are causing problems from the transaction.
Configuration Option: skip_broken</p>

<p>-t, --tolerant This option currently does nothing.</p>

<p>LIST OPTIONS The following are the ways which you can
invoke yum in list mode. Note that all list commands include
information on the version of the pack- age.</p>

<p>yum list [all | glob_exp1] [glob_exp2] [...] List all
available and installed packages.</p>

<p>yum list available [glob_exp1] [...] List all packages
in the yum repositories available to be installed.</p>

<p>yum list updates [glob_exp1] [...] List all packages
with updates available in the yum reposito- ries.</p>

<p>yum list installed [glob_exp1] [...] List the packages
specified by args. If an argument does not match the name of
an available package, it is assumed to be a shell-style glob
and any matches are printed.</p>

<p>yum list extras [glob_exp1] [...] List the packages
installed on the system that are not available in any yum
repository listed in the config file.</p>

<p>yum list obsoletes [glob_exp1] [...] List the packages
installed on the system that are obsoleted by packages in
any yum repository listed in the config file.</p>

<p>yum list recent List packages recently added into the
repositories.</p>

<p>Specifying package names All the list options mentioned
above take file-glob-syntax wild- cards or package names as
arguments, for example yum list avail- ablefoo*will list all
available packages that match foo*. (The single quotes will
keep your shell from expanding the globs.)</p>

<p>CLEAN OPTIONS The following are the ways which you can
invoke yum in clean mode. Note that &quot;all files&quot; in
the commands below means &quot;all files in currently
enabled repositories&quot;. If you want to also clean any
(temporarily) disabled repositories you need to use
--enablerepo*option.</p>

<p>yum clean expire-cache Eliminate the local data saying
when the metadata and mir- rorlists were downloaded for each
repo. This means yum will revalidate the cache for each
repo. next time it is used. How- ever if the cache is still
valid, nothing significant was deleted.</p>

<p>yum clean packages Eliminate any cached packages from
the system. Note that pack- ages are not automatically
deleted after they are downloaded.</p>

<p>yum clean headers Eliminate all of the header files
which yum uses for dependency resolution.</p>

<p>yum clean metadata Eliminate all of the files which yum
uses to determine the remote availability of packages. Using
this option will force yum to download all the metadata the
next time it is run.</p>

<p>yum clean dbcache Eliminate the sqlite cache used for
faster access to metadata. Using this option will force yum
to recreate the cache the next time it is run.</p>

<p>yum clean all Runs yum clean packages and yum clean
headers, yum clean meta- data and yum clean dbcache as
above.</p>

<p>MISC Specifying package names A package can be referred
to for install,update,list,remove etc with any of the
following:</p>

<p>name name.arch name-ver name-ver-rel name-ver-rel.arch
name-epoch:ver-rel.arch epoch:name-ver-rel.arch</p>

<p>For example: yum remove kernel-2.4.1-10.i686</p>

<p>PLUGINS Yum can be extended through the use of plugins.
A plugin is a Python &quot;.py&quot; file which is installed
in one of the directories specified by the pluginpath option
in yum.conf. For a plugin to work, the following conditions
must be met:</p>

<p>1. The plugin module file must be installed in the
plugin path as just described.</p>

<p>2. The global plugins option in /etc/yum/yum.conf must
be set to 1.</p>

<p>3. A configuration file for the plugin must exist in
/etc/yum/plugin- conf.d/&lt;plugin_name&gt;.conf and the
enabled setting in this file must set to 1 . The minimal
content for such a configuration file is:</p>

<p>[main] enabled = 1</p>

<p>See the yum.conf(5) man page for more information on
plugin related configuration options.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/yum.conf /etc/yum.repos.d/
/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/ /var/cache/yum/</p>
