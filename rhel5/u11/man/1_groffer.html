<p>GROFFER(1) GROFFER(1)</p>

<p>NAME groffer - display groff files and man pages on X
and tty</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groffer [option...] [--] [filespec...] groffer
--apropos|--apropos-data|--apropos-devel|--apropos-progs
name groffer -h|--help groffer -v|--version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The groffer program is the easiest way to
use groff(1). It can display arbitrary documents written in
the groff(7) language or other roff(7) languages that are
compatible to the original troff language. The groffer
program also includes many of the features for finding and
dis- playing the UNIX manual pages (man pages), such that it
can be used as a replacement for a man(1) program. Moreover,
compressed files that can be handled by gzip(1) or bzip2(1)
are decompressed on-the-fly.</p>

<p>The normal usage is quite simple by supplying a file
name or name of a man page without further options. But the
option handling has many possibilities for creating special
behaviors. This can be done in con- figuration files, with
the shell environment variable $GROFFER_OPT, or on the
command line.</p>

<p>The output can be generated and viewed in several
different ways avail- able for groff. This includes the
groff native X viewer gxditview(1), each Postcript or dvi
display program, a web browser by generating html in
www-mode, or several text modes in text terminals.</p>

<p>Most of the options that must be named when running
groff directly are determined automatically for groffer, due
to the internal usage of the grog(1) program. But all parts
can also be controlled manually by ar- guments.</p>

<p>Several file names can be specified on the command line
arguments. They are transformed into a single document in
the normal way of groff.</p>

page name in the lowest man section.</p>

<p>OPTION DETAILS The groffer program can usually be run
with very few options. But for special purposes, it supports
many options. These can be classified in 5 option
classes.</p>

<p>All short options of groffer are compatible with the
short options of groff(1). All long options of groffer are
compatible with the long op- tions of man(1).</p>

<p>groffer breaking Options As soon as one of these options
is found on the command line it is exe- cuted, printed to
standard output, and the running groffer is terminat- ed
thereafter. All other arguments are ignored.</p>

<p>--apropos name Start the apropos(1) command for
searching within man page de- scriptions. That slightly
differs from the strange behavior of the --apropos program
of man(1), which has no argument of its own, but takes the
file arguments instead. Practically both concepts are
compatible.</p>

<p>--apropos-data name Show only the apropos(1)
descriptions for data documents, in the man(7) sections 4,
5, and 7.</p>

<p>--apropos-devel name Show only the apropos(1)
descriptions for development documents, in the man(7)
sections 2, 3, and 9.</p>

<p>--apropos-progs name Show only the apropos(1)
descriptions for documents on programs, in the man(7)
sections 1, 6, and 8.</p>

<p>-h | --help Print a helping information with a short
explanation of option sto standard output.</p>

<p>-v | --version Print version information to standard
output.</p>

<p>groffer Mode Options The display mode and the viewer
programs are determined by these op- tions. If none of these
mode and viewer options is specified groffer tries to find a
suitable display mode automatically.</p>

<p>--auto Equivalent to --mode=auto.</p>

<p>--default Reset all configuration from previously
processed command line options to the default values. This
is useful to wipe out all former options of the
configuration, in $GROFFER_OPT, and restart option
processing using only the rest of the command line.</p>

<p>--default-modes mode1,mode2,... Set the sequence of
modes for auto mode to the comma separated list given in the
argument. See --mode for details on modes. Display in the
default manner; actually, this means to try the modes x, ps,
and tty in this sequence.</p>

<p>--dvi Equivalent to --mode=dvi.</p>

<p>--dvi-viewer prog Set the viewer program for dvi mode.
This can be a file name or a program to be searched in
$PATH. Known dvi viewers inlude xd- vi(1) and dvilx(1) In
each case, arguments can be provided addi- tionally.</p>

<p>--groff Equivalent to --mode=groff.</p>

<p>--html Equivalent to --mode=html.</p>

<p>--html-viewer Equivalent to --www-viewer.</p>

<p>--mode value Set the display mode. The following mode
values are recognized:</p>

<p>auto Select the automatic determination of the display
mode. The sequence of modes that are tried can be set with
the --default-modes option. Useful for restoring the default
mode when a different mode was specified before.</p>

<p>dvi Display formatted input in a dvi viewer program. By
de- fault, the formatted input is displayed with the xdvi(1)
program. --dvi.</p>

<p>groff After the file determination, switch groffer to
process the input like groff(1) would do . This disables the
groffer viewing features.</p>

<p>html Translate the input into html format and display
the re- sult in a web browser program. By default, the
existence of a sequence of standard web browsers is tested,
start- ing with konqueror(1) and mozilla(1). The text html
viewer is lynx(1).</p>

<p>pdf Display formatted input in a PDF (Portable Document
For- mat) viewer program. By default, the input is formatted
by groff using the Postscript device, then it is trans-
formed into the PDF file format using gs(1), and finally
displayed either with the xpdf(1) or the acroread(1) pro-
gram. PDF has a big advantage because the text is dis-
played graphically and is searchable as well. But as the
transformation takes a considerable amount of time, this
mode is not suitable as a default device for the auto
mode.</p>

<p>ps Display formatted input in a Postscript viewer
program. By default, the formatted input is displayed with
the ghostview(1) program.</p>

<p>text Format in a groff text mode and write the result to
stan- dard output without a pager or viewer program. The
text device, latin1 by default, can be chosen with option
-T.</p>

<p>tty Format in a groff text mode and write the result to
stan- dard output using a text pager program, even when in X
Window.</p>

<p>www Equivalent to --www.</p>

<p>X Display formatted input in a native roff viewer. By
de- fault, the formatted input is displayed with the
gxditview(1) program, being distributed together with groff,
or with xditview(1), which is distributed as a standard X
tool.</p>

<p>x Equivalent to --mode=X.</p>

<p>The following modes do not use the groffer viewing
features. They are only interesting for advanced
applications.</p>

<p>groff Generate device output with plain groff without
using the special viewing features of groffer. If no device
was specified by option -T the groff default ps is
assumed.</p>

<p>source Display the source code of the input without
formatting; equivalent to -Q.</p>

<p>--pdf Equivalent to --mode=pdf.</p>

<p>--pdf-viewer prog Set the viewer program for pdf mode.
This can be a file name or a program to be searched in
$PATH. In each case, arguments can be provided
additionally.</p>

<p>--ps Equivalent to --mode=ps.</p>

<p>--ps-viewer prog Set the viewer program for ps mode.
This can be a file name or a program to be searched in
$PATH. Common Postscript viewers inlude gv(1), ghostview(1),
and gs(1), In each case, arguments can be provided
additionally.</p>

<p>--text Equivalent to --mode=text.</p>

<p>--tty Equivalent to --mode=tty.</p>

<p>--tty-viewer Choose tty display mode, that means
displaying in a text pager even when in X; eqivalent to
--mode=tty.</p>

<p>--www Equivalent to --mode=www.</p>

<p>--www-viewer prog Set the web browser program for
viewing in www mode. Each pro- gram that accepts html input
and allows the file://local- host/dir/file syntax on the
command line is suitable as viewer program; it can be the
path name of an executable file or a pro- gram in $PATH. In
each case, arguments can be provided addi- tionally.</p>

<p>-X | --X | --x Equivalent to --mode=X.</p>

<p>--X-viewer | --x-viewer prog Set the viewer program for
x mode. Suitable viewer programs are gxditview(1) and
xditview(1). But the argument can be any exe- cutable file
or a program in $PATH. In each case, arguments can be
provided additionally.</p>

<p>-- Signals the end of option processing; all remaining
arguments are interpreted as filespec parameters.</p>

<p>Besides these, groffer accepts all arguments that are
valid for the groff(1) program. All non-groffer options are
sent unmodified via grog to groff. Postprocessors, macro
packages, compatibility with classical troff, and much more
can be manually specified.</p>

<p>Options for Development --debug Print debugging
information for development only. Actually, a function call
stack is printed if an error occurs.</p>

<p>--shell shell_program Specify the shell under which the
groffer script should be run. The script first tests whether
this option is set (either by configuration, within
$GROFF_OPT or as a command line option); if so, the script
is rerun under the shell program specified with the option
argument.</p>

<p>-Q | --source Output the roff source code of the input
files without further processing. This is the equivalent
--mode=source.</p>

<p>Other useful debugging options are the groff options -V
and -Z and op- tion --mode=groff.</p>

<p>Options related to groff All short options of groffer
are compatible with the short options of groff(1). The
following of groff options have either an additional special
meaning within groffer or make sense for normal usage.</p>

<p>Because of the special outputting behavior of the groff
options -V and -Z groffer was designed to be switched into
groff mode by these; the groffer viewing features are
disabled there. The other groff options do not switch the
mode, but allow to customize the formatting process.</p>

<p>-a This generates an ascii approximation of output in
text modes. That could be important when the text pager has
problems with control sequences.</p>

<p>-m file Add file as a groff macro file. This is useful
in case it can- not be recognized automatically.</p>

<p>-P opt_or_arg Send the argument opt_or_arg as an option
or option argument to the actual groff postprocessor.</p>

<p>-T | --device devname This option determines groffs
output device. The most impor- tant devices are the text
output devices for referring to the different character
sets, such as ascii, utf8, latin1, and oth- ers. Each of
these arguments switches groffer into a text mode using this
device, to mode tty if the actual mode is not a text mode.
The following devname arguments are mapped to the corre-
sponding groffer --mode=devname option: dvi, html, and ps.
All X* arguments are mapped to mode X. Each other devname
argument switches to mode groff using this device.</p>

<p>-V Switch into groff mode and show only the groff
calling pipe without formatting the input. This an advanced
option from groff(1), only useful for debugging.</p>

<p>-X was made equivalent to --mode=x; this slightly
enhances the fa- cility of groffs option.</p>

<p>-Z | --intermediate-output | --ditroff Switch into groff
mode and format the input with groff interme- diate output
without postprocessing; see groff_out(1). This is equivalent
to option --ditroff of man, which can be used as well.</p>

<p>All other groff options are supported by groffer, but
they are just transparently transferred to groff without any
intervention. The op- tions that are not explicitly handled
by groffer are transparently passed to groff. Therefore
these transparent options are not document- ed here, but in
groff(1). Due to the automatism in groffer, none of these
groff options should be needed, except for advanced
usage.</p>

<p>X Window toolkit Options The following long options were
adapted from the corresponding X Toolk- it options. groffer
will pass them to the actual viewer program if it is an X
Window program. Otherwise these options are ignored.</p>

<p>Unfortunately these options use the old style of a
single minus for long options. For groffer that was changed
to the standard with using a double minus for long options,
for example, groffer uses the option --font for the X option
-font.</p>

<p>See X(1), X(7), and the documentation on the X toolkit
options for more details on these options and their
arguments.</p>

<p>--background color Set the background color of the
viewer window.</p>

<p>--bd pixels Specifies the color of the border
surrounding the viewer window.</p>

<p>--bg color This is equivalent to --background.</p>

<p>--bw pixels Specifies the width in pixels of the border
surrounding the viewer window.</p>

<p>--display X-display Set the X display on which the
viewer program shall be started, see the X Window
documentation for the syntax of the argument.</p>

<p>--foreground color Set the foreground color of the
viewer window.</p>

<p>--fg color This is equivalent to -foreground.</p>

<p>--font font_name Set the font used by the viewer window.
The argument is an X font name.</p>

<p>--ft font_name This is equivalent to --ft.</p>

<p>--geometry size_pos Set the geometry of the display
window, that means its size and its starting position. See
X(7) for the syntax of the argument.</p>

<p>--resolution value Set X resolution in dpi (dots per
inch) in some viewer programs. The only supported dpi values
are 75 and 100. Actually, the de- fault resolution for
groffer is set to 75.</p>

<p>--rv Reverse foreground and background color of the
viewer window.</p>

<p>--title some text_ Set the title for the viewer
window.</p>

<p>--xrm resource_ Set X resource.</p>

<p>Options from man The long options of groffer were
synchronized with the long options of GNUman. All long
options of GNU man are recognized, but not all of these
options are important to groffer, so most of them are just
ig- nored.</p>

<p>The following two options were added by groffer for
choosing whether the file name arguments are interpreted as
names for local files or as a search pattern for man pages.
The default is looking up for local files.</p>

<p>--man Check the non-option command line arguments
(filespecs) first on being man pages, then whether they
represent an existing file. By default, a filespec is first
tested whether it is an existing file.</p>

<p>--no-man | --local-file Do not check for man pages.
--local-file is the corresponding man option.</p>

<p>In the following, the man options that have a special
meaning for grof- fer are documented.</p>

<p>The full set of long and short options of the GNU man
program can be passed via the environment variable $MANOPT;
see man(1) if your system has GNU man installed.</p>

<p>--all In searching man pages, retrieve all suitable
documents instead of only one.</p>

<p>-7 | --ascii In text modes, display ASCII translation of
special characters.</p>

<p>--ditroff Eqivalent to groffer -Z.</p>

<p>--extension suffix Restrict man page search to file
names that have suffix appended to their section element.
For example, in the file name
/usr/share/man/man3/terminfo.3ncurses.gz the man page
extension is ncurses.</p>

<p>--locale language Set the language for man pages. This
has the same effect, but overwrites $LANG</p>

<p>--location Print the location of the retrieved files to
standard error.</p>

<p>--no-location Do not display the location of retrieved
files; this resets a former call to --location. This was
added by groffer.</p>

<p>--manpath dir1:dir2:..._ Use the specified search path
for retrieving man pages instead of the program defaults. If
the argument is set to the empty string &quot;&quot; the
search for man page is disabled.</p>

<p>--pager Set the pager program in tty mode; default is
less. This is equivalent to --tty-viewer.</p>

<p>--sections sec1:sec2:..._ Restrict searching for man
pages to the given sections, a colon- separated list.</p>

<p>--systems sys1,sys2,..._ Search for man pages for the
given operating systems; the argu- ment systems is a
comma-separated list.</p>

<p>--whatis Instead of displaying the content, get the
one-liner description from the retrieved man page files or
say that it is not a man page.</p>

<p>--where Eqivalent to --location.</p>

<p>Additionally, the following short option of man is
supported as well.</p>

<p>Filespec Arguments A filespec parameter is an argument
meaning an input source, such as a file name or template for
searching man pages. These input sources are collected and
composed into a single output file such as groff does.</p>

<p>The strange POSIX behavior that maps all arguments
behind the first non-option argument into filespec arguments
is ignored. The GNU behav- ior to recognize options even
when mixed with filespec arguments is used througout. But,
as usual, the double minus argument -- still takes all
following arguments as filespecs.</p>

<p>Each filespec parameters can have one of the following
forms.</p>

<p>No filespec parameters means that groffer waits for
standard input. The minus option - stands for standard
input, too, but can occur sever- al times. Next filespec is
tested whether it is the path name of an existing file.
Otherwise it is assumed as a searching pattern for a man
page.</p>

<p>On each system, the man pages are sorted according to
their content in- to several sections. The classical man
sections have a single-charac- ter name, either are a digit
from 1 to 9 or one of the characters n or o. In the
following, a stand-alone character s means this scheme.</p>

<p>The internal precedence of man for searching man pages
with the same name within several sections goes according to
the classical single- character sequence. On some systems,
this single character can be ex- tended by a following
string. But the special groffer man page facili- ty is based
on the classical single character sections.</p>

<p>man:name(section) and name(section) search the man page
name in man section section, where section can be any
string, but it must exist in the man system.</p>

<p>Next some patterns based on the classical man sections
were construct- ed. man:name.s and name.s search for a man
page name in man section s if s is a classical man section
mentioned above. Otherwise search for a man page named
name.s in the lowest man section.</p>

<p>Now man:name searches for a man page in the lowest man
section that has a document called name.</p>

<p>The pattern s name originates from a strange argument
parsing of the man program. If s is a classical man section
interpret it as a search for a man page called name in man
section s, otherwise interpret s as a file argument and name
as another filespec argument.</p>

<p>We are left with the argument name which is not an
existing file. So this searches for the man page called name
in the lowest man section that has a document for this
name.</p>

<p>Several file name arguments can be supplied. They are
mixed by groff into a single document. Note that the set of
option arguments must fit to all of these file arguments. So
they should have at least the same style of the groff
language.</p>

<p>OUTPUT MODES By default, the groffer program collects
all input into a single file, formats it with the groff
program for a certain device, and then choos- es a suitable
viewer program. The device and viewer process in groffer is
called a mode. The mode and viewer of a running groffer
program is selected automatically, but the user can also
choose it with options. The modes are selected by option the
arguments of --mode=anymode. Ad- ditionally, each of this
argument can be specified as an option of its own, such as
--anymode. Most of these modes have a viewer program, which
can be chosen by an option that is constructed like
--anymode- viewer.</p>

<p>Several different modes are offered, graphical X modes,
text modes, and some direct groff modes for debugging and
development.</p>

<p>By default, groffer first tries whether x mode is
possible, then ps mode, and finally tty mode. This mode
testing sequence for auto mode can be changed by specifying
a comma separated list of modes with the option
--default-modes.</p>

<p>The searching for man pages and the decompression of the
input are ac- tive in every mode.</p>

<p>Graphical Display Modes The graphical display modes work
only in the X Window environment (or similar implementations
within other windowing environments). The en- vironment
variable $DISPLAY and the option --display are used for
spec- ifying the X display to be used. If neither is given,
groffer assumes that no X and changes to one text mode. You
can change this automatic behavior by the option
--default-modes.</p>

<p>Known viewers for the graphical display modes and their
standard X Win- dow viewer progams are</p>

<p>&middot; X Window roff viewers such as gxditview(1) or
xditview(1) (in x or X mode),</p>

<p>&middot; in a Postscript viewer (ps mode),</p>

<p>&middot; in a dvi viewer program (dvi mode),</p>

<p>&middot; in a PDF viewer (pdf mode),</p>

<p>&middot; in a web browser (html or www mode),</p>

<p>The pdf mode has a major advantage it is the only
graphical diplay mode that allows to search for text within
the viewer; this can be a really important feature.
Unfortunately, it takes some time to trans- form the input
into the PDF format, so it was not chosen as the major
mode.</p>

<p>These graphical viewers can be customized by options of
the X Window Toolkit. But the groffer options use a leading
double minus instead of the single minus used by the X
Window Toolkit.</p>

<p>Text mode There are to modes for text output, mode text
for plain output without a pager and mode tty for a text
output on a text terminal using some pager program.</p>

<p>If the variable $DISPLAY is not set or empty, groffer
assumes that it should use tty mode.</p>

<p>In the actual implementation, the groff output device
latin1 is chosen for text modes. This can be changed by
specifying option -T or --device.</p>

<p>The pager to be used can be specified by one of the
options --pager and --tty-viewer, or by the environment
variable $PAGER. If all of this is not used the less(1)
program with the option -r for correctly display- ing
control sequences is used as the default pager.</p>

<p>Special Modes for Debugging and Development These modes
use the groffer file determination and decompression. This
is combined into a single input file that is fed directly
into groff with different strategy without the groffer
viewing facilities. These modes are regarded as advanced,
they are useful for debugging and de- velopment
purposes.</p>

<p>The source mode with just displays the generated input.
The groff mode passes the input to groff using only some
suitable options provided to groffer. This enables the user
to save the generated output into a file or pipe it into
another program.</p>

<p>In groff mode, the option -Z disables post-processing,
thus producing the groff intermediate output. In this mode,
the input is formatted, but not postprocessed; see
groff_out(5) for details.</p>

<p>All groff short options are supported by groffer.</p>

<p>MAN PAGE SEARCHING The default behavior of groffer is to
first test whether a file parame- ter represents a local
file; if it is not an existing file name, it is assumed to
represent a name of a man page. This behavior can be modi-
fied by the following options.</p>

<p>--man forces to interpret all file parameters as
filespecs for search- ing man pages.</p>

<p>--no-man --local-file disable the man searching; so only
local files are displayed.</p>

<p>If neither a local file nor a man page was retrieved for
some file pa- rameter a warning is issued on standard error,
but processing is con- tinued.</p>

<p>The groffer program provides a search facility for man
pages. All long options, all environment variables, and most
of the functionality of the GNU man(1) program were
implemented. This inludes the extended file names of man
pages, for example, the man page of groff in man sec- tion 7
may be stored under /usr/share/man/man7/groff.7.gz, where
/usr/share/man/ is part of the man path, the subdirectory
man7 and the file extension .7 refer to the man section 7;
.gz shows the compression of the file.</p>

<p>The cat pages (preformatted man pages) are intentionally
excluded from the search because groffer is a roff program
that wants to format by its own. With the excellent
performance of the actual computers, the preformatted man
pages arent necessary any longer.</p>

<p>The algorithm for retrieving man pages uses five search
methods. They are successively tried until a method
works.</p>

<p>&middot; The search path can be manually specified by
using the option --manpath. An empty argument disables the
man page searching. This overwrites the other methods.</p>

<p>&middot; If this is not available the environment
variable $MANPATH is searched.</p>

<p>&middot; If this is empty, the program tries to read it
from the environment variable $MANOPT.</p>

<p>&middot; If this does not work a reasonable default path
from $PATH is searched for man pages.</p>

<p>&middot; If this does not work, the manpath(1) program
for determining a path of man directories is tried.</p>

<p>After this, the path elements for the language (locale)
and operating system specific man pages are added to the man
path; their sequence is determined automatically. For
example, both /usr/share/man/linux/fr and
/usr/share/man/fr/linux for french linux man pages are
found. The language and operating system names are
determined from both environ- ment variables and command
line options.</p>

<p>The locale (language) is determined like in GNU man,
that is from high- est to lowest precedence:</p>

<p>&middot; --locale</p>

<p>&middot; $GROFFER_OPT</p>

<p>&middot; $MANOPT</p>

<p>&middot; $LCALL</p>

<p>&middot; $LC_MESSAGES</p>

<p>&middot; $LANG.</p>

<p>The language locale is usually specified in the POSIX
1003.1 based for- mat:</p>


<p>&lt;language&gt;[_&lt;territory&gt;[.&lt;character-set&gt;[,&lt;version&gt;]]],</p>

<p>but the two-letter code in &lt;language&gt; is
sufficient for most purposes.</p>

<p>If no man pages for a complicated locale are found the
country part consisting of the first two characters (without
the _, ., and ,, parts) of the locale is searched as
well.</p>

<p>If still not found the corresponding man page in the
default language is used instead. As usual, this default can
be specified by one of C or POSIX. The man pages in the
default language are usually in En- glish.</p>

<p>Several operating systems can be given by appending
their names, sepa- rated by a comma. This is then specified
by the environment variable $SYSTEM or by the command line
option --systems. The precedence is similar to the locale
case above from highest to lowest precedence: Topic
--systems</p>

<p>&middot; $GROFFER_OPT</p>

<p>&middot; $MANOPT</p>

<p>&middot; $SYSTEM.</p>

<p>When searching for man pages this man path with the
additional language and system specific directories is
used.</p>

<p>The search can further be restricted by limiting it to
certain sec- tions. A single section can be specified within
each filespec argu- ment, several sections as a
colon-separated list in command line option --sections or
environment variable $MANSECT. When no section was spec-
ified a set of standard sections is searched until a
suitable man page was found.</p>

<p>Finally, the search can be restricted to a so-called
extension. This is a postfix that acts like a subsection. It
can be specified by --extension or environment variable
$EXTENSION.</p>

<p>For further details on man page searching, see
man(1).</p>

<p>DECOMPRESSION The program has a decompression facility.
If standard input or a file that was retrieved from the
command line parameters is compressed with a format that is
supported by either gzip(1) or bzip2(1) it is decom- pressed
on-the-fly. This includes the GNU .gz, .bz2, and the tradi-
tional .Z compression. The program displays the
concatenation of all decompressed input in the sequence that
was specified on the command line.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The groffer programs supports many system
variables, most of them by courtesy of other programs. All
environment variables of groff(1) and GNU man(1) and some
standard system variables are honored.</p>

<p>Native groffer Variables $GROFFER_OPT Store options for
a run of groffer. The options specified in this variable are
overridden by the options given on the command line. The
content of this variable is run through the shell builtin
eval; so arguments containing white-space or special shell
characters should be quoted.</p>

<p>System Variables The groffer program is a shell script
that is run through /bin/sh, which can be internally linked
to programs like bash(1). The corre- sponding system
environment is automatically effective. The following
variables have a special meaning for groffer.</p>

<p>$DISPLAY If this variable is set this indicates that the
X Window system is running. Testing this variable decides on
whether graphical or text output is generated. This variable
should not be changed by the user carelessly, but it can be
used to start the graphical groffer on a remote X terminal.
For example, depend- ing on your system, groffer can be
started on the second monitor by the command sh#
DISPLAY=:0.1 groffer what.ever&amp;</p>

<p>$LC_ALL $LC_MESSAGES $LANG If one of these variables is
set (in the above sequence), its content is interpreted as
the locale, the language to be used, especially when
retrieving man pages. A locale name is typical- ly of the
form language[_territory[.codeset[@modifier]]], where
language is an ISO 639 language code, territory is an ISO
3166 country code, and codeset is a character set or
encoding identi- fier like ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8; see
setlocale(3). The locale values C and POSIX stand for the
default, i.e. the man page di- rectories without a language
prefix. This is the same behavior as when all 3 variables
are unset.</p>

<p>$PAGER This variable can be used to set the pager for
the tty output. For example, to disable the use of a pager
completely set this variable to the cat(1) program sh#
PAGER=cat groffer anything</p>

<p>$PATH All programs within the groffer shell script are
called without a fixed path. Thus this environment variable
determines the set of programs used within the run of
groffer.</p>

<p>$POSIXLY_CORRECT If set to a non-empty value this
chooses the POSIX mode. This is done internally by some
shells. groffer ignores the bad POSIX behavior for option
processing, that means that option processing will be
finished as soon as a non-option argument is found. Instead
the GNU behavior of freely mixing options and filespec
arguments is used in any case. Usually, you do not want to
set this environment variable externally.</p>

<p>Groff Variables The groffer program internally calls
groff, so all environment vari- ables documented in groff(1)
are internally used within groffer as well. The following
variables have a direct meaning for the groffer program.</p>

<p>$GROFF_TMPDIR If the value of this variable is an
existing, writable directo- ry, groffer uses it for storing
its temporary files, just as groff does.</p>

<p>Man Variables Parts of the functionality of the man
program were implemented in grof- fer; support for all
environment variables documented in man(1) was added to
groffer, but the meaning was slightly modified due to the
dif- ferent approach in groffer; but the user interface is
the same. The man environment variables can be overwritten
by options provided with $MANOPT, which in turn is
overwritten by the command line.</p>

<p>$EXTENSION Restrict the search for man pages to files
having this exten- sion. This is overridden by option
--extension; see there for details.</p>

<p>$MANOPT This variable contains options as a preset for
man(1). As not all of these are relevant for groffer only
the essential parts of its value are extracted. The options
specified in this vari- able overwrite the values of the
other environment variables taht are specific to man. All
options specified in this vari- able are overridden by the
options given on the command line.</p>

<p>$MANPATH If set, this variable contains the directories
in which the man page trees are stored. This is overridden
by option --manpath.</p>

<p>$MANSECT If this is a colon separated list of section
names, the search for man pages is restricted to those
manual sections in that or- der. This is overridden by
option --sections.</p>

<p>$SYSTEM If this is set to a comma separated list of
names these are in- terpreted as man page trees for
different operating systems. This variable can be
overwritten by option --systems; see there for details.</p>

<p>The environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is ignored by
groffer because the necessary preprocessors are determined
automatically.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILES The groffer program can be
preconfigured by two configuration files. This configuration
can be overridden at each program start by command line
options or by the environment variable $GROFFER_OPT.</p>

<p>/etc/groff/groffer.conf System-wide configuration file
for groffer.</p>

<p>$HOME/.groff/groffer.conf User-specific configuration
file for groffer, where $HOME de- notes the users home
directory. This script is called after the system-wide
configuration file to enable overriding by the user.</p>

<p>Their lines either start with a minus character or are
shell commands. Arbitrary spaces are allowed at the
beginning, they are just ignored. The lines with the
beginning minus are appended to the existing value of
$GROFFER_OPT. This easily allows to set general groffer
options that are used with any call of groffer.</p>

<p>After the transformation of the minus lines the emerging
shell scripts that are called by groffer using the .
filename syntax.</p>

<p>The only option that needs a minus line in the
configuration files is --shell. The reason is that its
argument must be called at a very ear- ly stage before the
whole syntax of the configuration can be trans- formed.</p>

<p>It makes sense to use these configuration files for the
following tasks:</p>

<p>&middot; Preset command line options by writing them
into lines starting with a minus sign.</p>

<p>&middot; Preset environment variables recognized by
groffer.</p>

<p>&middot; Write a function for calling a viewer program
for a special mode and feed this name into its corresponding
--mode-viewer option. Note that the name of such a function
must coincide with some existing program in the system path
$PATH in order to be recognized by grof- fer.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the following configuration file
in ~/.groff/groffer.conf, say.</p>

<p># groffer configuration file # # groffer options that
are used in each call of groffer --shell=/bin/bash
--resolution=100 --foreground=DarkBlue --x-viewer=gxditview
-geometry 850x800 # # some shell commands if test
&quot;$DISPLAY&quot; = &quot;&quot;; then
DISPLAY=localhost:0.0 fi date &gt;&gt;~/mygroffer.log</p>

<p>This configuration sets four groffer options and runs
two shell com- mands. This has the following effects:</p>

<p>&middot; Lines starting with a # character are</p>

<p>&middot; Use /bin/bash as the shell to run the groffer
script.</p>

<p>&middot; Take a resolution of 100 dpi and a text color
of DarkBlue in all viewers that support this.</p>

<p>&middot; Force gxditview(1) as the X-mode viewer using
the geometry option for setting the width to 850 dpi and the
height to 800 dpi.</p>

<p>&middot; The variable $DISPLAY is set to localhost:0.0
which allows to start groffer in the standard X display,
even when the program is called from a text console.</p>

<p>&middot; Just for fun, the date of each groffer start is
written to the file mygroffer.log in the home directory.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The usage of groffer is very easy. Usually, it
is just called with a file name or man page. The following
examples, however, show that groffer has much more fancy
capabilities.</p>

<p>sh# groffer /usr/local/share/doc/groff/meintro.ms.gz
Decompress, format and display the compressed file
meintro.ms.gz in the directory /usr/local/share/doc/groff,
using gxditview as graphical viewer when in X Window, or the
less(1) pager program when not in X.</p>

<p>sh# groffer groff If the file ./groff exists use it as
input. Otherwise interpret the argument as a search for the
man page named groff in the smallest possible man section,
being secion 1 in this case.</p>

<p>sh# groffer man:groff search for the man page of groff
even when the file ./groff ex- ists.</p>

<p>sh# groffer groff.7 sh# groffer 7 groff search the man
page of groff in man section 7. This section search works
only for a digit or a single character from a small set.</p>

<p>sh# groffer fb.modes If the file ./fb.modes does not
exist interpret this as a search for the man page of
fb.modes. As the extension modes is not a single character
in classical section style the argument is not split to a
search for fb.</p>

<p>sh# groffer groff troff(1) man:roff The arguments that
are not existing files are looked-up as the following man
pages: groff (automatic search, should be found in man
section 1), troff (in section 1), and roff (in the section
with the lowest number, being 7 in this case). The quotes
around _troff(1)_ are necessary because the paranthesis are
spe- cial shell characters; escaping them with a backslash
character ( and ) would be possible, too. The formatted
files are con- catenated and displayed in one piece.</p>

<p>sh# LANG=de groffer --man --www --www-viever=mozilla ls
Retrieve the German man page (language de) for the ls
program, decompress it, format it to html format (www mode)
and view the result in the web browser galeon . The option
--man guarantees that the man page is retrieved, even when a
local file ls exists in the actual directory.</p>

<p>sh# groffer --source man:roff(7) Get the man page called
roff in man section 7, decompress it, and print its
unformatted content, its source code.</p>

<p>sh# cat file.gz | groffer -Z -mfoo Decompress the
standard input, send this to groff intermediate mode without
post-processing (groff option -Z), using macro package by
foo (groff option -m)</p>

<p>sh# echo <tt><b>WOW! | &gt; groffer --x --bg red --fg
yellow --geometry 200x100 - Display the word WOW! in a small
window in constant-width bold font, using color yellow on
red background.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>COMPATIBILITY The groffer shell script is
compatible with both GNU and POSIX. POSIX compatibility
refers to IEEE P1003.2/D11.2 of September 1991, a very early
version of the POSIX standard that is still freely available
in the internet. Unfortunately, this version of the standard
has local for shell function variables removed. As local is
needed for serious programming this temporary POSIX
deprecation was ignored.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>Most GNU shells are compatible with this
interpretation of POSIX, but provide much more facilities.
Nevertheless this script uses only a re- stricted set of
shell language elements and shell builtins. The grof- fer
script should work on most actual free and commercial
operating systems.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>The groffer program provides its own parser for
command line options; it can handle option arguments and
file names containing white space and a large set of special
characters.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>The groffer shell script was tested with the
following common implemen- tations of the GNU shells: POSIX
sh(1), bash(1), and others. Free POSIX compatible shells and
shell utilities for most operating systems are available at
the GNU software archive http://
www.gnu.org/software/.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>The shell can be chosen by the option --shell.
This option can also be given to the environment variable
$GROFF_OPT. If you want to write it to one of the groffer
configuration files you must use the single op- tion style,
a line starting with --shell.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>The groffer program provides its own parser for
command line arguments that is compatible to both POSIX
getopts(1) and GNU getopt(1) except for shortcuts of long
options. The following standard types of options are
supported.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>&middot; A single minus always refers to single
character option or a combina- tion thereof, for example,
the groffer short option combination -Qmfoo is equivalent to
-Q -m foo.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>&middot; Long options are options with names
longer than one character; they are always prededed by a
double minus. An option argument can either go to the next
command line argument or be appended with an equal sign to
the argument; for example, --long=arg is equivalent to
--long arg .</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>&middot; An argument of -- ends option parsing;
all further command line argu- ments are interpreted as file
name arguments.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>&middot; By default, all command line arguments
that are neither options nor option arguments are
interpreted as filespec parameters and stored until option
parsing has finished. For example, the command line sh#
groffer file1 -a -o arg file2 is, by default, equivalent to
sh# groffer -a -o arg -- file1 file2</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>This behavior can be changed by setting the
environment variable $POSIXLY_CORRECT to a non-empty value.
Then the strange POSIX non-op- tion behavior is adopted, i.
e. option processing is stopped as soon as the first
non-option argument is found and each following argument is
taken as a file name. For example, in posixly correct mode,
the com- mand line sh# groffer file1 -a -o arg file 2 is
equivalent to sh# groffer -- file1 -a -o arg file 2 As this
leads to unwanted behavior in most cases, most people do not
want to set $POSIXLY_CORRECT.</b></tt></p>
