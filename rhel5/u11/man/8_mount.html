<p>MOUNT(8) Linux Programmer s Manual MOUNT(8)</p>

<p>NAME mount - mount a file system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mount [-lhV]</p>

<p>mount -a [-fFnrsvw] [-t vfstype] [-O optlist] mount
[-fnrsvw] [-o options [,...]] device | dir mount [-fnrsvw]
[-t vfstype] [-o options] device dir</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION All files accessible in a Unix system are
arranged in one big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at /.
These files can be spread out over sev- eral devices. The
mount command serves to attach the file system found on some
device to the big file tree. Conversely, the umount(8)
command will detach it again.</p>

<p>The standard form of the mount command, is mount -t type
device dir This tells the kernel to attach the file system
found on device (which is of type type) at the directory
dir. The previous contents (if any) and owner and mode of
dir become invisible, and as long as this file system
remains mounted, the pathname dir refers to the root of the
file system on device.</p>

<p>Three forms of invocation do not actually mount
anything: mount -h prints a help message; mount -V prints a
version string; and just mount [-l] [-t type] lists all
mounted file systems (of type type). The option -l adds the
(ext2, ext3, ext4 and XFS) labels in this listing. See
below.</p>

<p>Since Linux 2.4.0 it is possible to remount part of the
file hierarchy somewhere else. The call is mount --bind
olddir newdir After this call the same contents is
accessible in two places. One can also remount a single file
(on a single file).</p>

<p>This call attaches only (part of) a single filesystem,
not possible submounts. The entire file hierarchy including
submounts is attached a second place using mount --rbind
olddir newdir</p>

<p>Note that the filesystem mount options will remain the
same as those on the original mount point, and cannot be
changed by passing the -o option along with
--bind/--rbind.</p>

<p>All attribute changes (remount) to the bind mount will
propagate to the source mount. The read-only bind mounts are
implemented in since Linux 2.6.26.</p>

<p>Since Linux 2.5.1 it is possible to atomically move a
mounted tree to another place. The call is mount --move
olddir newdir</p>

<p>Since Linux 2.6.15 it is possible to mark a mount and
its submounts as shared, private, slave or unbindable. A
shared mount provides ability to create mirrors of that
mount such that mounts and umounts within any of the mirrors
propagate to the other mirror. A slave mount receives
propagation from its master, but any not vice-versa. A
private mount carries no propagation abilities. A unbindable
mount is a private mount which cannot cloned through a bind
operation. Detailed semantics is documented in
Documentation/sharedsubtree.txt file in the kernel source
tree. mount --make-shared mountpoint mount --make-slave
mountpoint mount --make-private mountpoint mount
--make-unbindable mountpoint</p>

<p>The following commands allows one to recursively change
the type of all the mounts under a given mountpoint. mount
--make-rshared mountpoint mount --make-rslave mountpoint
mount --make-rprivate mountpoint &quot;mount
--make-runbindable mountpoint&quot;</p>

<p>The proc file system is not associated with a special
device, and when mounting it, an arbitrary keyword, such as
proc can be used instead of a device specification. (The
customary choice none is less fortunate: the error message
none busy from umount can be confusing.)</p>

<p>Most devices are indicated by a file name (of a block
special device), like /dev/sda1, but there are other
possibilities. For example, in the case of an NFS mount,
device may look like knuth.cwi.nl:/dir. It is possible to
indicate a block special device using its volume label or
UUID (see the -L and -U options below).</p>

<p>The file /etc/fstab (see fstab(5)), may contain lines
describing what devices are usually mounted where, using
which options. This file is used in three ways:</p>

<p>(i) The command mount -a [-t type] [-O optlist] (usually
given in a bootscript) causes all file systems mentioned in
fstab (of the proper type and/or having or not having the
proper options) to be mounted as indicated, except for those
whose line con- tains the noauto keyword. Adding the -F
option will make mount fork, so that the filesystems are
mounted simultaneously.</p>

<p>(ii) When mounting a file system mentioned in fstab, it
suffices to give only the device, or only the mount
point.</p>

<p>(iii) Normally, only the superuser can mount file
systems. However, when fstab contains the user option on a
line, anybody can mount the corresponding system.</p>

<p>Thus, given a line /dev/cdrom /cd iso9660
ro,user,noauto,unhide any user can mount the iso9660 file
system found on his CDROM using the command mount /dev/cdrom
or mount /cd For more details, see fstab(5). Only the user
that mounted a filesys- tem can unmount it again. If any
user should be able to unmount, then use users instead of
user in the fstab line. The owner option is simi- lar to the
user option, with the restriction that the user must be the
owner of the special file. This may be useful e.g. for
/dev/fd if a login script makes the console user owner of
this device. The group option is similar, with the
restriction that the user must be member of the group of the
special file.</p>

<p>The programs mount and umount maintain a list of
currently mounted file systems in the file /etc/mtab. If no
arguments are given to mount, this list is printed.</p>

<p>When the proc filesystem is mounted (say at /proc), the
files /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts have very similar contents.
The former has somewhat more information, such as the mount
options used, but is not necessar- ily up-to-date (cf. the
-n option below). It is possible to replace /etc/mtab by a
symbolic link to /proc/mounts, and especially when you have
very large numbers of mounts things will be much faster with
that symlink, but some information is lost that way, and in
particular work- ing with the loop device will be less
convenient, and using the &quot;user&quot; option will
fail.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The full set of options used by an invocation of
mount is determined by first extracting the options for the
file system from the fstab table, then applying any options
specified by the -o argument, and finally applying a -r or
-w option, when present.</p>

<p>Options available for the mount command:</p>

<p>-V Output version.</p>

<p>-h Print a help message.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode.</p>

<p>-a Mount all filesystems (of the given types) mentioned
in fstab.</p>

<p>-F (Used in conjunction with -a.) Fork off a new
incarnation of mount for each device. This will do the
mounts on different devices or different NFS servers in
parallel. This has the advantage that it is faster; also NFS
timeouts go in parallel. A disadvantage is that the mounts
are done in undefined order. Thus, you cannot use this
option if you want to mount both /usr and /usr/spool.</p>

<p>-f Causes everything to be done except for the actual
system call; if its not obvious, this fakes mounting the
file system. This option is useful in conjunction with the
-v flag to deter- mine what the mount command is trying to
do. It can also be used to add entries for devices that were
mounted earlier with the -n option.</p>

<p>-i Dont call the /sbin/mount.&lt;filesystem&gt; helper
even if it exists.</p>

<p>-l Add the ext2, ext3, ext4 and XFS labels in the mount
output. Mount must have permission to read the disk device
(e.g. be suid root) for this to work. One can set such a
label for ext2, ext3 or ext4 using the e2label(8) utility,
or for XFS using xfs_admin(8), or for reiserfs using
reiserfstune(8).</p>

<p>-n Mount without writing in /etc/mtab. This is necessary
for exam- ple when /etc is on a read-only file system.</p>

<p>-p num In case of a loop mount with encryption, read the
passphrase from file descriptor num instead of from the
terminal.</p>

<p>-s Tolerate sloppy mount options rather than failing.
This will ignore mount options not supported by a filesystem
type. Not all filesystems support this option. This option
exists for support of the Linux autofs-based
automounter.</p>

<p>-r Mount the file system read-only. A synonym is -o
ro.</p>

<p>-w Mount the file system read/write. This is the
default. A synonym is -o rw.</p>

<p>-L label Mount the partition that has the specified
label.</p>

<p>-U uuid Mount the partition that has the specified uuid.
These two options require the file /proc/partitions (present
since Linux 2.1.116) to exist.</p>

<p>-t vfstype The argument following the -t is used to
indicate the file sys- tem type. The file system types which
are currently supported include: adfs, affs, autofs, cifs,
coda, coherent, cramfs, debugfs, devpts, efs, ext, ext2,
ext3, ext4, hfs, hpfs, iso9660, jfs, minix, msdos, ncpfs,
nfs, nfs4, ntfs, proc, qnx4, ramfs, reiserfs, romfs, smbfs,
sysv, tmpfs, udf, ufs, umsdos, usbfs, vfat, xenix, xfs,
xiafs. Note that coherent, sysv and xenix are equivalent and
that xenix and coherent will be removed at some point in the
future use sysv instead. Since kernel version 2.1.21 the
types ext and xiafs do not exist anymore. Earlier, usbfs was
known as usbdevfs.</p>

<p>For most types all the mount program has to do is issue
a simple mount(2) system call, and no detailed knowledge of
the filesys- tem type is required. For a few types however
(like nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, ncpfs) ad hoc code is
necessary. The nfs ad hoc code is built in, but cifs, smbfs,
and ncpfs have a separate mount program. In order to make it
possible to treat all types in a uniform way, mount will
execute the program /sbin/mount.TYPE (if that exists) when
called with type TYPE. Since various versions of the
smbmount program have different calling conventions,
/sbin/mount.smbfs may have to be a shell script that sets up
the desired call.</p>

<p>If no -t option is given, or if the auto type is
specified, mount will try to guess the desired type. If
mount was compiled with the blkid library, the guessing is
done by this library. Otherwise, mount guesses itself by
probing the superblock; if that does not turn up anything
that looks familiar, mount will try to read the file
/etc/filesystems, or, if that does not exist,
/proc/filesystems. All of the filesystem types listed there
will be tried, except for those that are labeled
&quot;nodev&quot; (e.g., devpts, proc, nfs, and nfs4). If
/etc/filesystems ends in a line with a single * only, mount
will read /proc/filesys- tems afterwards.</p>

<p>The auto type may be useful for user-mounted floppies.
Creating a file /etc/filesystems can be useful to change the
probe order (e.g., to try vfat before msdos or ext3 before
ext2) or if you use a kernel module autoloader. Warning: the
probing uses a heuristic (the presence of appropriate
magic), and could rec- ognize the wrong filesystem type,
possibly with catastrophic consequences. If your data is
valuable, don t ask mount to guess.</p>

<p>More than one type may be specified in a comma separated
list. The list of file system types can be prefixed with no
to specify the file system types on which no action should
be taken. (This can be meaningful with the -a option.)</p>

<p>For example, the command: mount -a -t nomsdos,ext mounts
all file systems except those of type msdos and ext.</p>

<p>-O Used in conjunction with -a, to limit the set of
filesystems to which the -a is applied. Like -t in this
regard except that it is useless except in the context of
-a. For example, the com- mand: mount -a -O no_netdev mounts
all file systems except those which have the option _net-
dev specified in the options field in the /etc/fstab
file.</p>

<p>It is different from -t in that each option is matched
exactly; a leading no at the beginning of one option does
not negate the rest.</p>

<p>The -t and -O options are cumulative in effect; that is,
the command mount -a -t ext2 -O _netdev mounts all ext2
filesystems with the _netdev option, not all filesystems
that are either ext2 or have the _netdev option
specified.</p>

<p>-o Options are specified with a -o flag followed by a
comma sepa- rated string of options. Some of these options
are only useful when they appear in the /etc/fstab file. The
following options apply to any file system that is being
mounted (but not every file system actually honors them -
e.g., the sync option today has effect only for ext2, ext3,
fat, vfat and ufs):</p>

<p>async All I/O to the file system should be done
asynchronously.</p>

<p>atime Update inode access time for each access. This is
the default.</p>

<p>auto Can be mounted with the -a option.</p>

<p>defaults Use default options: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto,
nouser, and async.</p>

<p>dev Interpret character or block special devices on the
file system.</p>

<p>exec Permit execution of binaries.</p>

<p>group Allow an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount
the file system if one of his groups matches the group of
the device. This option implies the options nosuid and nodev
(unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option
line group,dev,suid).</p>

<p>mand Allow mandatory locks on this filesystem. See
fcntl(2).</p>

<p>_netdev The filesystem resides on a device that requires
network access (used to prevent the system from attempting
to mount these filesystems until the network has been
enabled on the system).</p>

<p>noatime Do not update inode access times on this file
system (e.g, for faster access on the news spool to speed up
news servers).</p>

<p>nodiratime Do not update directory inode access times on
this filesystem.</p>

<p>noauto Can only be mounted explicitly (i.e., the -a
option will not cause the file system to be mounted).</p>

<p>nodev Do not interpret character or block special
devices on the file system.</p>

<p>noexec Do not allow direct execution of any binaries on
the mounted file system. (Until recently it was possible to
run binaries anyway using a command like /lib/ld*.so
/mnt/binary. This trick fails since Linux 2.4.25 /
2.6.0.)</p>

<p>nomand Do not allow mandatory locks on this
filesystem.</p>

<p>nosuid Do not allow set-user-identifier or
set-group-identifier bits to take effect. (This seems safe,
but is in fact rather unsafe if you have suidperl(1)
installed.)</p>

<p>nouser Forbid an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount
the file system. This is the default.</p>

<p>owner Allow an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount
the file system if he is the owner of the device. This
option implies the options nosuid and nodev (unless
overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line
owner,dev,suid).</p>

<p>remount Attempt to remount an already-mounted file
system. This is commonly used to change the mount flags for
a file system, especially to make a readonly file system
write- able. It does not change device or mount point.</p>

<p>ro Mount the file system read-only.</p>

<p>_rnetdev Like _netdev, except &quot;fsck -a&quot; checks
this filesystem during rc.sysinit.</p>

<p>rw Mount the file system read-write.</p>

<p>suid Allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier
bits to take effect.</p>

<p>sync All I/O to the file system should be done
synchronously. In case of media with limited number of write
cycles (e.g. some flash drives) &quot;sync&quot; may cause
life-cycle shortening.</p>

<p>dirsync All directory updates within the file system
should be done synchronously. This affects the following
system calls: creat, link, unlink, symlink, mkdir, rmdir,
mknod and rename.</p>

<p>user Allow an ordinary user to mount the file system.
The name of the mounting user is written to mtab so that he
can unmount the file system again. This option implies the
options noexec, nosuid, and nodev (unless overridden by
subsequent options, as in the option line
user,exec,dev,suid).</p>

<p>users Allow every user to mount and unmount the file
system. This option implies the options noexec, nosuid, and
nodev (unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the
option line users,exec,dev,suid).</p>

<p>context=context, fscontext=context and
defcontext=context The context= option is useful when
mounting filesystems that do not support extended
attributes, such as a floppy or hard disk formatted with
VFAT, or systems that are not normally running under
SELinux, such as an ext3 formatted disk from a non-SELinux
workstation. You can also use context= on filesystems you do
not trust, such as a floppy. It also helps in compatibility
with xattr-sup- porting filesystems on earlier 2.4.&lt;x&gt;
kernel versions. Even where xattrs are supported, you can
save time not having to label every file by assigning the
entire disk one security context.</p>

<p>A commonly used option for removable media is con-
text=system_u:object_r:removable_t.</p>

<p>Two other options are fscontext= and defcontext=, both
of which are mutually exclusive of the context option. This
means you can use fscontext and defcontext with each other,
but neither can be used with context.</p>

<p>The fscontext= option works for all filesystems, regard-
less of their xattr support. The fscontext option sets the
overarching filesystem label to a specific security context.
This filesystem label is separate from the indi- vidual
labels on the files. It represents the entire filesystem for
certain kinds of permission checks, such as during mount or
file creation. Individual file labels are still obtained
from the xattrs on the files them- selves. The context
option actually sets the aggregate context that fscontext
provides, in addition to supplying the same label for
individual files.</p>

<p>You can set the default security context for unlabeled
files using defcontext= option. This overrides the value set
for unlabeled files in the policy and requires a file system
that supports xattr labeling.</p>

<p>For more details see selinux(8)</p>

<p>--bind Remount a subtree somewhere else (so that its
contents are available in both places). See above.</p>

<p>--move Move a subtree to some other place. See
above.</p>

<p>FILESYSTEM SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS The following options
apply only to certain file systems. We sort them by file
system. They all follow the -o flag.</p>

<p>What options are supported depends a bit on the running
kernel. More info may be found in the kernel source
subdirectory Documenta- tion/filesystems.</p>

<p>Mount options for adfs uid=value and gid=value Set the
owner and group of the files in the file system (default:
uid=gid=0).</p>

<p>ownmask=value and othmask=value Set the permission mask
for ADFS owner permissions and other permissions,
respectively (default: 0700 and 0077, respec- tively). See
also /usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesys-
tems/adfs.txt.</p>

<p>Mount options for affs uid=value and gid=value Set the
owner and group of the root of the file system (default:
uid=gid=0, but with option uid or gid without specified
value, the uid and gid of the current process are
taken).</p>

<p>setuid=value and setgid=value Set the owner and group of
all files.</p>

<p>mode=value Set the mode of all files to value &amp; 0777
disregarding the orig- inal permissions. Add search
permission to directories that have read permission. The
value is given in octal.</p>

<p>protect Do not allow any changes to the protection bits
on the file sys- tem.</p>

<p>usemp Set uid and gid of the root of the file system to
the uid and gid of the mount point upon the first sync or
umount, and then clear this option. Strange...</p>

<p>verbose Print an informational message for each
successful mount.</p>

<p>prefix=string Prefix used before volume name, when
following a link.</p>

<p>volume=string Prefix (of length at most 30) used before
/ when following a symbolic link.</p>

<p>reserved=value (Default: 2.) Number of unused blocks at
the start of the device.</p>

<p>root=value Give explicitly the location of the root
block.</p>

<p>bs=value Give blocksize. Allowed values are 512, 1024,
2048, 4096.</p>

<p>grpquota / noquota / quota / usrquota These options are
accepted but ignored. (However, quota utili- ties may react
to such strings in /etc/fstab.)</p>

<p>Mount options for cifs See the options section of the
mount.cifs(8) man page (cifs-mount pack- age must be
installed).</p>

<p>Mount options for cifs Just like nfs or smbfs
implementation expects a binary argument to the mount system
call. This argument is constructed by mount.cifs(8) and the
current version of mount (2.12) does not know anything about
cifs.</p>

<p>Mount options for coherent None.</p>

<p>Mount options for debugfs The debugfs file system is a
pseudo file system, traditionally mounted on
/sys/kernel/debug. There are no mount options.</p>

<p>Mount options for devpts The devpts file system is a
pseudo file system, traditionally mounted on /dev/pts. In
order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process opens
/dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo terminal is then made
available to the process and the pseudo terminal slave can
be accessed as /dev/pts/&lt;number&gt;.</p>

<p>uid=value and gid=value This sets the owner or the group
of newly created PTYs to the specified values. When nothing
is specified, they will be set to the UID and GID of the
creating process. For example, if there is a tty group with
GID 5, then gid=5 will cause newly created PTYs to belong to
the tty group.</p>

<p>mode=value Set the mode of newly created PTYs to the
specified value. The default is 0600. A value of mode=620
and gid=5 makes &quot;mesg y&quot; the default on newly
created PTYs.</p>

<p>Mount options for ext None. Note that the ext file
system is obsolete. Dont use it. Since Linux version 2.1.21
extfs is no longer part of the kernel source.</p>

<p>Mount options for ext2 The ext2 file system is the
standard Linux file system. Since Linux 2.5.46, for most
mount options the default is determined by the filesystem
superblock. Set them with tune2fs(8).</p>

<p>acl / noacl Support POSIX Access Control Lists (or
not).</p>

<p>bsddf / minixdf Set the behaviour for the statfs system
call. The minixdf behaviour is to return in the f_blocks
field the total number of blocks of the file system, while
the bsddf behaviour (which is the default) is to subtract
the overhead blocks used by the ext2 file system and not
available for file storage. Thus</p>

<p>% mount /k -o minixdf; df /k; umount /k Filesystem
1024-blocks Used Available Capacity Mounted on /dev/sda6
2630655 86954 2412169 3% /k % mount /k -o bsddf; df /k;
umount /k Filesystem 1024-blocks Used Available Capacity
Mounted on /dev/sda6 2543714 13 2412169 0% /k</p>

<p>(Note that this example shows that one can add command
line options to the options given in /etc/fstab.)</p>

<p>check=none / nocheck No checking is done at mount time.
This is the default. This is fast. It is wise to invoke
e2fsck(8) every now and then, e.g. at boot time.</p>

<p>debug Print debugging info upon each (re)mount.</p>

<p>errors=continue / errors=remount-ro / errors=panic
Define the behaviour when an error is encountered. (Either
ignore errors and just mark the file system erroneous and
con- tinue, or remount the file system read-only, or panic
and halt the system.) The default is set in the filesystem
superblock, and can be changed using tune2fs(8).</p>

<p>grpid or bsdgroups / nogrpid or sysvgroups These options
define what group id a newly created file gets. When grpid
is set, it takes the group id of the directory in which it
is created; otherwise (the default) it takes the fsgid of
the current process, unless the directory has the setgid bit
set, in which case it takes the gid from the parent
directory, and also gets the setgid bit set if it is a
directory itself.</p>

<p>grpquota / noquota / quota / usrquota These options are
accepted but ignored.</p>

<p>nobh Do not attach buffer_heads to file pagecache.
(Since 2.5.49.)</p>

<p>nouid32 Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs. This is for
interoperability with older kernels which only store and
expect 16-bit values.</p>

<p>oldalloc or orlov Use old allocator or Orlov allocator
for new inodes. Orlov is default.</p>

<p>resgid=n and resuid=n The ext2 file system reserves a
certain percentage of the avail- able space (by default 5%,
see mke2fs(8) and tune2fs(8)). These options determine who
can use the reserved blocks. (Roughly: whoever has the
specified uid, or belongs to the specified group.)</p>

<p>sb=n Instead of block 1, use block n as superblock. This
could be useful when the filesystem has been damaged.
(Earlier, copies of the superblock would be made every 8192
blocks: in block 1, 8193, 16385, ... (and one got thousands
of copies on a big filesystem). Since version 1.08, mke2fs
has a -s (sparse superblock) option to reduce the number of
backup superblocks, and since version 1.15 this is the
default. Note that this may mean that ext2 filesystems
created by a recent mke2fs cannot be mounted r/w under Linux
2.0.*.) The block number here uses 1k units. Thus, if you
want to use logical block 32768 on a filesystem with 4k
blocks, use &quot;sb=131072&quot;.</p>

<p>user_xattr / nouser_xattr Support &quot;user.&quot;
extended attributes (or not).</p>

<p>Mount options for ext3 The ext3 file system is a version
of the ext2 file system which has been enhanced with
journalling. It supports the same options as ext2 as well as
the following additions:</p>

<p>journal=update Update the ext3 file systems journal to
the current format.</p>

<p>journal=inum When a journal already exists, this option
is ignored. Other- wise, it specifies the number of the
inode which will represent the ext3 file systems journal
file; ext3 will create a new journal, overwriting the old
contents of the file whose inode number is inum.</p>

<p>noload Do not load the ext3 file systems journal on
mounting.</p>

<p>data=journal / data=ordered / data=writeback Specifies
the journalling mode for file data. Metadata is always
journaled. To use modes other than ordered on the root file
system, pass the mode to the kernel as boot parameter, e.g.
rootflags=data=journal.</p>

<p>journal All data is committed into the journal prior to
being written into the main file system.</p>

<p>ordered This is the default mode. All data is forced
directly out to the main file system prior to its metadata
being committed to the journal.</p>

<p>writeback Data ordering is not preserved - data may be
written into the main file system after its metadata has
been commit- ted to the journal. This is rumoured to be the
highest- throughput option. It guarantees internal file
system integrity, however it can allow old data to appear in
files after a crash and journal recovery.</p>

<p>commit=nrsec Sync all data and metadata every nrsec
seconds. The default value is 5 seconds. Zero means
default.</p>

<p>Mount options for ext4 The ext4 is an an advanced level
of the ext3 filesystem which incor- porates scalability and
reliability enhancements for supporting large
filesystem.</p>

<p>The options journal_dev, noload, data, commit, orlov,
oldalloc, [no]user_xattr [no]acl, bsddf, minixdf, debug,
errors, data_err, grpid, bsdgroups, nogrpid sysvgroups,
resgid, resuid, sb, quota, noquota, grpquota, usrquota and
[no]bh are backwardly compatible with ext3 or ext2.</p>

<p>journal_checksum Enable checksumming of the journal
transactions. This will allow the recovery code in e2fsck
and the kernel to detect cor- ruption in the kernel. It is a
compatible change and will be ignored by older kernels.</p>

<p>journal_async_commit Commit block can be written to disk
without waiting for descrip- tor blocks. If enabled older
kernels cannot mount the device. This will enable</p>

<p>journal=update Update the ext4 file systems journal to
the current format.</p>

<p>barrier=0 / barrier=1 / barrier / nobarrier This
enables/disables the use of write barriers in the jbd code.
barrier=0 disables, barrier=1 enables. This also requires an
IO stack which can support barriers, and if jbd gets an
error on a barrier write, it will disable again with a
warning. Write bar- riers enforce proper on-disk ordering of
journal commits, making volatile disk write caches safe to
use, at some performance penalty. If your disks are
battery-backed in one way or another, disabling barriers may
safely improve performance. The mount options
&quot;barrier&quot; and &quot;nobarrier&quot; can also be
used to enable or disable barriers, for consistency with
other ext4 mount options.</p>

<p>inode_readahead=n This tuning parameter controls the
maximum number of inode table blocks that ext4s inode table
readahead algorithm will pre-read into the buffer cache. The
default value is 32 blocks.</p>

<p>stripe=n Number of filesystem blocks that mballoc will
try to use for allocation size and alignment. For RAID5/6
systems this should be the number of data disks * RAID chunk
size in file system blocks.</p>

<p>delalloc Deferring block allocation until write-out
time.</p>

<p>nodelalloc Disable delayed allocation. Blocks are
allocation when data is copied from user to page cache.</p>

<p>max_batch_time=usec Maximum amount of time ext4 should
wait for additional filesys- tem operations to be batch
together with a synchronous write operation. Since a
synchronous write operation is going to force a commit and
then a wait for the I/O complete, it doesnt cost much, and
can be a huge throughput win, we wait for a small amount of
time to see if any other transactions can piggyback on the
synchronous write. The algorithm used is designed to auto-
matically tune for the speed of the disk, by measuring the
amount of time (on average) that it takes to finish
committing a transaction. Call this time the &quot;commit
time&quot;. If the time that the transactoin has been
running is less than the commit time, ext4 will try sleeping
for the commit time to see if other oper- ations will join
the transaction. The commit time is capped by the
max_batch_time, which defaults to 15000us (15ms). This opti-
mization can be turned off entirely by setting
max_batch_time to 0.</p>

<p>min_batch_time=usec This parameter sets the commit time
(as described above) to be at least min_batch_time. It
defaults to zero microseconds. Increasing this parameter may
improve the throughput of multi- threaded, synchronous
workloads on very fast disks, at the cost of increasing
latency.</p>

<p>journal_ioprio=prio The I/O priority (from 0 to 7, where
0 is the highest priorty) which should be used for I/O
operations submitted by kjournald2 during a commit
operation. This defaults to 3, which is a slightly higher
priority than the default I/O priority.</p>

<p>auto_da_alloc / noauto_da_alloc Many broken applications
don t use fsync() when noauto_da_alloc replacing existing
files via patterns such as</p>

<p>fd = open(&quot;foo.new&quot;)/write(fd,..)/close(fd)/
rename(&quot;foo.new&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;)</p>

<p>or worse yet</p>

<p>fd = open(&quot;foo&quot;,
O_TRUNC)/write(fd,..)/close(fd).</p>

<p>If auto_da_alloc is enabled, ext4 will detect the
replace-via- rename and replace-via-truncate patterns and
force that any delayed allocation blocks are allocated such
that at the next journal commit, in the default data=ordered
mode, the data blocks of the new file are forced to disk
before the rename() operation is commited. This provides
roughly the same level of guarantees as ext3, and avoids the
&quot;zero-length&quot; problem that can happen when a
system crashes before the delayed allocation blocks are
forced to disk.</p>

<p>Mount options for fat (Note: fat is not a separate
filesystem, but a common part of the msdos, umsdos and vfat
filesystems.)</p>

<p>blocksize=512 / blocksize=1024 / blocksize=2048 Set
blocksize (default 512).</p>

<p>uid=value and gid=value Set the owner and group of all
files. (Default: the uid and gid of the current
process.)</p>

<p>umask=value Set the umask (the bitmask of the
permissions that are not present). The default is the umask
of the current process. The value is given in octal.</p>

<p>dmask=value Set the umask applied to directories only.
The default is the umask of the current process. The value
is given in octal.</p>

<p>fmask=value Set the umask applied to regular files only.
The default is the umask of the current process. The value
is given in octal.</p>

<p>check=value Three different levels of pickyness can be
chosen:</p>

<p>r[elaxed] Upper and lower case are accepted and
equivalent, long name parts are truncated (e.g.
verylongname.foobar becomes verylong.foo), leading and
embedded spaces are accepted in each name part (name and
extension).</p>

<p>n[ormal] Like &quot;relaxed&quot;, but many special
characters (*, ?, &lt;, spaces, etc.) are rejected. This is
the default.</p>

<p>s[trict] Like &quot;normal&quot;, but names may not
contain long parts and special characters that are sometimes
used on Linux, but are not accepted by MS-DOS are rejected.
(+, =, spaces, etc.)</p>

<p>codepage=value Sets the codepage for converting to
shortname characters on FAT and VFAT filesystems. By
default, codepage 437 is used.</p>

<p>conv=b[inary] / conv=t[ext] / conv=a[uto] The fat file
system can perform CRLF&lt;--&gt;NL (MS-DOS text format to
UNIX text format) conversion in the kernel. The following
conversion modes are available:</p>

<p>binary no translation is performed. This is the
default.</p>

<p>text CRLF&lt;--&gt;NL translation is performed on all
files.</p>

<p>auto CRLF&lt;--&gt;NL translation is performed on all
files that dont have a &quot;well-known binary&quot;
extension. The list of known extensions can be found at the
beginning of fs/fat/misc.c (as of 2.0, the list is: exe,
com, bin, app, sys, drv, ovl, ovr, obj, lib, dll, pif, arc,
zip, lha, lzh, zoo, tar, z, arj, tz, taz, tzp, tpz, gz, tgz,
deb, gif, bmp, tif, gl, jpg, pcx, tfm, vf, gf, pk, pxl,
dvi).</p>

<p>Programs that do computed lseeks won t like in-kernel
text con- version. Several people have had their data ruined
by this translation. Beware!</p>

<p>For file systems mounted in binary mode, a conversion
tool (fromdos/todos) is available.</p>

<p>cvf_format=module Forces the driver to use the CVF
(Compressed Volume File) module cvf_module instead of
auto-detection. If the kernel supports kmod, the
cvf_format=xxx option also controls on-demand CVF mod- ule
loading.</p>

<p>cvf_option=option Option passed to the CVF module.</p>

<p>debug Turn on the debug flag. A version string and a
list of file system parameters will be printed (these data
are also printed if the parameters appear to be
inconsistent).</p>

<p>fat=12 / fat=16 / fat=32 Specify a 12, 16 or 32 bit fat.
This overrides the automatic FAT type detection routine. Use
with caution!</p>

<p>iocharset=value Character set to use for converting
between 8 bit characters and 16 bit Unicode characters. The
default is iso8859-1. Long file- names are stored on disk in
Unicode format.</p>

<p>quiet Turn on the quiet flag. Attempts to chown or chmod
files do not return errors, although they fail. Use with
caution!</p>

<p>sys_immutable, showexec, dots, nodots, dotsOK=[yes|no]
Various misguided attempts to force Unix or DOS conventions
onto a FAT file system.</p>

<p>Mount options for hfs creator=cccc, type=cccc Set the
creator/type values as shown by the MacOS finder used for
creating new files. Default values: ????.</p>

<p>uid=n, gid=n Set the owner and group of all files.
(Default: the uid and gid of the current process.)</p>

<p>dir_umask=n, file_umask=n, umask=n Set the umask used
for all directories, all regular files, or all files and
directories. Defaults to the umask of the current
process.</p>

<p>session=n Select the CDROM session to mount. Defaults to
leaving that decision to the CDROM driver. This option will
fail with any- thing but a CDROM as underlying device.</p>

<p>part=n Select partition number n from the device. Only
makes sense for CDROMS. Defaults to not parsing the
partition table at all.</p>

<p>quiet Dont complain about invalid mount options.</p>

<p>Mount options for hpfs uid=value and gid=value Set the
owner and group of all files. (Default: the uid and gid of
the current process.)</p>

<p>umask=value Set the umask (the bitmask of the
permissions that are not present). The default is the umask
of the current process. The value is given in octal.</p>

<p>case=lower / case=asis Convert all files names to lower
case, or leave them. (Default: case=lower.)</p>

<p>conv=binary / conv=text / conv=auto For conv=text,
delete some random CRs (in particular, all fol- lowed by NL)
when reading a file. For conv=auto, choose more or less at
random between conv=binary and conv=text. For conv=binary,
just read what is in the file. This is the default.</p>

<p>nocheck Do not abort mounting when certain consistency
checks fail.</p>

<p>Mount options for iso9660 ISO 9660 is a standard
describing a filesystem structure to be used on CD-ROMs.
(This filesystem type is also seen on some DVDs. See also
the udf filesystem.)</p>

<p>Normal iso9660 filenames appear in a 8.3 format (i.e.,
DOS-like restrictions on filename length), and in addition
all characters are in upper case. Also there is no field for
file ownership, protection, number of links, provision for
block/character devices, etc.</p>

<p>Rock Ridge is an extension to iso9660 that provides all
of these unix like features. Basically there are extensions
to each directory record that supply all of the additional
information, and when Rock Ridge is in use, the filesystem
is indistinguishable from a normal UNIX file system (except
that it is read-only, of course).</p>

<p>norock Disable the use of Rock Ridge extensions, even if
available. Cf. map.</p>

<p>nojoliet Disable the use of Microsoft Joliet extensions,
even if avail- able. Cf. map.</p>

<p>check=r[elaxed] / check=s[trict] With check=relaxed, a
filename is first converted to lower case before doing the
lookup. This is probably only meaningful together with
norock and map=normal. (Default: check=strict.)</p>

<p>uid=value and gid=value Give all files in the file
system the indicated user or group id, possibly overriding
the information found in the Rock Ridge extensions.
(Default: uid=0,gid=0.)</p>

<p>map=n[ormal] / map=o[ff] / map=a[corn] For non-Rock
Ridge volumes, normal name translation maps upper to lower
case ASCII, drops a trailing ;1, and converts ; to .. With
map=off no name translation is done. See norock. (Default:
map=normal.) map=acorn is like map=normal but also apply
Acorn extensions if present.</p>

<p>mode=value For non-Rock Ridge volumes, give all files
the indicated mode. (Default: read permission for
everybody.) Since Linux 2.1.37 one no longer needs to
specify the mode in decimal. (Octal is indicated by a
leading 0.)</p>

<p>unhide Also show hidden and associated files. (If the
ordinary files and the associated or hidden files have the
same filenames, this may make the ordinary files
inaccessible.)</p>

<p>block=[512|1024|2048] Set the block size to the
indicated value. (Default: block=1024.)</p>

<p>conv=a[uto] / conv=b[inary] / conv=m[text] / conv=t[ext]
(Default: conv=binary.) Since Linux 1.3.54 this option has
no effect anymore. (And non-binary settings used to be very
dan- gerous, possibly leading to silent data
corruption.)</p>

<p>cruft If the high byte of the file length contains other
garbage, set this mount option to ignore the high order bits
of the file length. This implies that a file cannot be
larger than 16MB.</p>

<p>session=x Select number of session on multisession CD.
(Since 2.3.4.)</p>

<p>sbsector=xxx Session begins from sector xxx. (Since
2.3.4.)</p>

<p>The following options are the same as for vfat and
specifying them only makes sense when using discs encoded
using Microsoft s Joliet exten- sions.</p>

<p>iocharset=value Character set to use for converting 16
bit Unicode characters on CD to 8 bit characters. The
default is iso8859-1.</p>

<p>utf8 Convert 16 bit Unicode characters on CD to
UTF-8.</p>

<p>Mount options for jfs iocharset=name Character set to
use for converting from Unicode to ASCII. The default is to
do no conversion. Use iocharset=utf8 for UTF8 translations.
This requires CONFIG_NLS_UTF8 to be set in the kernel
.config file.</p>

<p>resize=value Resize the volume to value blocks. JFS only
supports growing a volume, not shrinking it. This option is
only valid during a remount, when the volume is mounted
read-write. The resize key- word with no value will grow the
volume to the full size of the partition.</p>

<p>nointegrity Do not write to the journal. The primary use
of this option is to allow for higher performance when
restoring a volume from backup media. The integrity of the
volume is not guaranteed if the system abnormally
abends.</p>

<p>integrity Default. Commit metadata changes to the
journal. Use this option to remount a volume where the
nointegrity option was pre- viously specified in order to
restore normal behavior.</p>

<p>errors=continue / errors=remount-ro / errors=panic
Define the behaviour when an error is encountered. (Either
ignore errors and just mark the file system erroneous and
con- tinue, or remount the file system read-only, or panic
and halt the system.)</p>

<p>noquota / quota / usrquota / grpquota These options are
accepted but ignored.</p>

<p>Mount options for minix None.</p>

<p>Mount options for msdos See mount options for fat. If
the msdos file system detects an incon- sistency, it reports
an error and sets the file system read-only. The file system
can be made writeable again by remounting it.</p>

<p>Mount options for ncpfs Just like nfs, the ncpfs
implementation expects a binary argument (a struct
ncp_mount_data) to the mount system call. This argument is
con- structed by ncpmount(8) and the current version of
mount (2.12) does not know anything about ncpfs.</p>

<p>Mount options for nfs Instead of a textual option
string, parsed by the kernel, the nfs file system expects a
binary argument of type struct nfs_mount_data. The program
mount itself parses the following options of the form
tag=value , and puts them in the structure mentioned:
rsize=n, wsize=n, timeo=n, retrans=n, acregmin=n,
acregmax=n, acdirmin=n, acdirmax=n, actimeo=n, retry=n,
port=n, mountport=n, mounthost=name, mountprog=n,
mountvers=n, nfsprog=n, nfsvers=n, namlen=n. The option
addr=n is accepted but ignored. Also the following Boolean
options, possibly preceded by no are recognized: bg, fg,
soft, hard, intr, posix, cto, ac, tcp, udp, lock. For
details, see nfs(5).</p>

<p>Especially useful options include</p>

<p>rsize=32768,wsize=32768 This causes the NFS client to
try to negotiate a buffer size up to the size specified. A
large buffer size does improve perfor- mance, but both the
server and client have to support it. In the case where one
of these does not support the size specified, the size
negotiated will be the largest that both support.</p>

<p>intr This will allow NFS operations (on hard mounts) to
be inter- rupted while waiting for a response from the
server.</p>

<p>nolock Do not use locking. Do not start lockd.</p>

<p>Mount options for nfs4 Instead of a textual option
string, parsed by the kernel, the nfs4 file system expects a
binary argument of type struct nfs4_mount_data. The program
mount itself parses the following options of the form
tag=value , and puts them in the structure mentioned:
rsize=n, wsize=n, timeo=n, retrans=n, acregmin=n,
acregmax=n, acdirmin=n, acdirmax=n, actimeo=n, retry=n,
port=n, proto=n, clientaddr=n, sec=n. The option addr=n is
accepted but ignored. Also the following Boolean options,
possibly preceded by no are recognized: bg, fg, soft, hard,
intr, cto, ac, For details, see nfs(5).</p>

<p>Especially useful options include</p>

<p>rsize=32768,wsize=32768 This causes the NFS4 client to
try to negotiate a buffer size up to the size specified. A
large buffer size does improve perfor- mance, but both the
server and client have to support it. In the case where one
of these does not support the size specified, the size
negotiated will be the largest that both support.</p>

<p>intr This will allow NFS4 operations (on hard mounts) to
be inter- rupted while waiting for a response from the
server.</p>

<p>Mount options for ntfs iocharset=name Character set to
use when returning file names. Unlike VFAT, NTFS suppresses
names that contain unconvertible characters. Deprecated.</p>

<p>nls=name New name for the option earlier called
iocharset.</p>

<p>utf8 Use UTF-8 for converting file names.</p>

<p>uni_xlate=[0|1|2] For 0 (or no or false ), do not use
escape sequences for unknown Unicode characters. For 1 (or
yes or true) or 2, use vfat-style 4-byte escape sequences
starting with &quot;:&quot;. Here 2 give a little-endian
encoding and 1 a byteswapped bigendian encoding.</p>

<p>posix=[0|1] If enabled (posix=1), the file system
distinguishes between upper and lower case. The 8.3 alias
names are presented as hard links instead of being
suppressed.</p>

<p>uid=value, gid=value and umask=value Set the file
permission on the filesystem. The umask value is given in
octal. By default, the files are owned by root and not
readable by somebody else.</p>

<p>Mount options for proc uid=value and gid=value These
options are recognized, but have no effect as far as I can
see.</p>

<p>Mount options for ramfs Ramfs is a memory based
filesystem. Mount it and you have it. Unmount it and it is
gone. Present since Linux 2.3.99pre4. There are no mount
options.</p>

<p>Mount options for reiserfs Reiserfs is a journaling
filesystem. The reiserfs mount options are more fully
described at http://www.namesys.com/mount-options.html.</p>

<p>conv Instructs version 3.6 reiserfs software to mount a
version 3.5 file system, using the 3.6 format for newly
created objects. This file system will no longer be
compatible with reiserfs 3.5 tools.</p>

<p>hash=rupasov / hash=tea / hash=r5 / hash=detect Choose
which hash function reiserfs will use to find files within
directories.</p>

<p>rupasov A hash invented by Yury Yu. Rupasov. It is fast
and pre- serves locality, mapping lexicographically close
file names to close hash values. This option should not be
used, as it causes a high probability of hash
collisions.</p>

<p>tea A Davis-Meyer function implemented by Jeremy
Fitzhardinge. It uses hash permuting bits in the name. It
gets high randomness and, therefore, low probability of hash
collisions at some CPU cost. This may be used if
EHASHCOLLISION errors are experienced with the r5 hash.</p>

<p>r5 A modified version of the rupasov hash. It is used by
default and is the best choice unless the file system has
huge directories and unusual file-name patterns.</p>

<p>detect Instructs mount to detect which hash function is
in use by examining the file system being mounted, and to
write this information into the reiserfs superblock. This is
only useful on the first mount of an old format file sys-
tem.</p>

<p>hashed_relocation Tunes the block allocator. This may
provide performance improve- ments in some situations.</p>

<p>no_unhashed_relocation Tunes the block allocator. This
may provide performance improve- ments in some
situations.</p>

<p>noborder Disable the border allocator algorithm invented
by Yury Yu. Rupasov. This may provide performance
improvements in some situations.</p>

<p>nolog Disable journalling. This will provide slight
performance improvements in some situations at the cost of
losing reiserfss fast recovery from crashes. Even with this
option turned on, reiserfs still performs all journalling
operations, save for actual writes into its journalling
area. Implementation of nolog is a work in progress.</p>

<p>notail By default, reiserfs stores small files and file
tails directly into its tree. This confuses some utilities
such as LILO(8). This option is used to disable packing of
files into the tree.</p>

<p>replayonly Replay the transactions which are in the
journal, but do not actually mount the file system. Mainly
used by reiserfsck.</p>

<p>resize=number A remount option which permits online
expansion of reiserfs par- titions. Instructs reiserfs to
assume that the device has num- ber blocks. This option is
designed for use with devices which are under logical volume
management (LVM). There is a special resizer utility which
can be obtained from
ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiserfsprogs.</p>

<p>Mount options for romfs None.</p>

<p>Mount options for smbfs Just like nfs, the smbfs
implementation expects a binary argument (a struct
smb_mount_data) to the mount system call. This argument is
con- structed by smbmount(8) and the current version of
mount (2.12) does not know anything about smbfs.</p>

<p>Mount options for sysv None.</p>

<p>Mount options for tmpfs The following parameters accept
a suffix k, m or g for Ki, Mi, Gi (binary kilo, mega and
giga) and can be changed on remount.</p>

<p>size=nbytes Override default maximum size of the
filesystem. The size is given in bytes, and rounded down to
entire pages. The default is half of the memory.</p>

<p>nr_blocks= Set number of blocks.</p>

<p>nr_inodes= Set number of inodes.</p>

<p>mode= Set initial permissions of the root directory.</p>

<p>Mount options for udf udf is the &quot;Universal Disk
Format&quot; filesystem defined by the Optical Storage
Technology Association, and is often used for DVD-ROM. See
also iso9660.</p>

<p>gid= Set the default group.</p>

<p>umask= Set the default umask. The value is given in
octal.</p>

<p>uid= Set the default user.</p>

<p>unhide Show otherwise hidden files.</p>

<p>undelete Show deleted files in lists.</p>

<p>nostrict Unset strict conformance.</p>

<p>iocharset Set the NLS character set.</p>

<p>bs= Set the block size. (May not work unless 2048.)</p>

<p>novrs Skip volume sequence recognition.</p>

<p>session= Set the CDROM session counting from 0. Default:
last session.</p>

<p>anchor= Override standard anchor location. Default:
256.</p>

<p>volume= Override the VolumeDesc location. (unused)</p>

<p>partition= Override the PartitionDesc location.
(unused)</p>

<p>lastblock= Set the last block of the filesystem.</p>

<p>fileset= Override the fileset block location.
(unused)</p>

<p>rootdir= Override the root directory location.
(unused)</p>

<p>Mount options for ufs ufstype=value UFS is a file system
widely used in different operating systems. The problem are
differences among implementations. Features of some
implementations are undocumented, so its hard to recognize
the type of ufs automatically. Thats why the user must
specify the type of ufs by mount option. Possible values
are:</p>

<p>old Old format of ufs, this is the default, read only.
(Dont forget to give the -r option.)</p>

<p>44bsd For filesystems created by a BSD-like system
(NetBSD,FreeBSD,OpenBSD).</p>

<p>sun For filesystems created by SunOS or Solaris on
Sparc.</p>

<p>sunx86 For filesystems created by Solaris on x86.</p>

<p>hp For filesystems created by HP-UX, read-only.</p>

<p>nextstep For filesystems created by NeXTStep (on NeXT
station) (currently read only).</p>

<p>nextstep-cd For NextStep CDROMs (block_size == 2048),
read-only.</p>

<p>openstep For filesystems created by OpenStep (currently
read only). The same filesystem type is also used by Mac OS
X.</p>

<p>onerror=value Set behaviour on error:</p>

<p>panic If an error is encountered, cause a kernel
panic.</p>

<p>[lock|umount|repair] These mount options don t do
anything at present; when an error is encountered only a
console message is printed.</p>

<p>Mount options for umsdos See mount options for msdos.
The dotsOK option is explicitly killed by umsdos.</p>

<p>Mount options for vfat First of all, the mount options
for fat are recognized. The dotsOK option is explicitly
killed by vfat. Furthermore, there are</p>

<p>uni_xlate Translate unhandled Unicode characters to
special escaped sequences. This lets you backup and restore
filenames that are created with any Unicode characters.
Without this option, a ? is used when no translation is
possible. The escape character is : because it is otherwise
illegal on the vfat filesystem. The escape sequence that
gets used, where u is the unicode charac- ter, is: :, (u
&amp; 0x3f), ((u&gt;&gt;6) &amp; 0x3f), (u&gt;&gt;12).</p>

<p>posix Allow two files with names that only differ in
case.</p>

<p>nonumtail First try to make a short name without
sequence number, before trying name~num.ext.</p>

<p>utf8 UTF8 is the filesystem safe 8-bit encoding of
Unicode that is used by the console. It can be be enabled
for the filesystem with this option or disabled with utf8=0,
utf8=no or utf8=false. If uni_xlate gets set, UTF8 gets
disabled.</p>

<p>shortname=[lower|win95|winnt|mixed]</p>

<p>Defines the behaviour for creation and display of
filenames which fit into 8.3 characters. If a long name for
a file exists, it will always be preferred display. There
are four modes:</p>

<p>lower Force the short name to lower case upon display;
store a long name when the short name is not all upper
case.</p>

<p>win95 Force the short name to upper case upon display;
store a long name when the short name is not all upper
case.</p>

<p>winnt Display the shortname as is; store a long name
when the short name is not all lower case or all upper
case.</p>

<p>mixed Display the short name as is; store a long name
when the short name is not all upper case.</p>

<p>The default is &quot;lower&quot;.</p>

<p>Mount options for usbfs devuid=uid and devgid=gid and
devmode=mode Set the owner and group and mode of the device
files in the usbfs file system (default: uid=gid=0,
mode=0644). The mode is given in octal.</p>

<p>busuid=uid and busgid=gid and busmode=mode Set the owner
and group and mode of the bus directories in the usbfs file
system (default: uid=gid=0, mode=0555). The mode is given in
octal.</p>

<p>listuid=uid and listgid=gid and listmode=mode Set the
owner and group and mode of the file devices (default:
uid=gid=0, mode=0444). The mode is given in octal.</p>

<p>Mount options for xenix None.</p>

<p>Mount options for xfs allocsize=size Sets the buffered
I/O end-of-file preallocation size when doing delayed
allocation writeout (default size is 64KiB). Valid val- ues
for this option are page size (typically 4KiB) through to
1GiB, inclusive, in power-of-2 increments.</p>

<p>attr2 / noattr2 The options enable/disable (default is
disabled for backward compatibility on-disk) an
&quot;opportunistic&quot; improvement to be made in the way
inline extended attributes are stored on-disk. When the new
form is used for the first time (by setting or removing
extended attributes) the on-disk superblock feature bit
field will be updated to reflect this format being in
use.</p>

<p>barrier Enables the use of block layer write barriers
for writes into the journal and unwritten extent conversion.
This allows for drive level write caching to be enabled, for
devices that sup- port write barriers.</p>

<p>dmapi Enable the DMAPI (Data Management API) event
callouts. Use with the mtpt option.</p>

<p>grpid / bsdgroups and nogrpid / sysvgroups These options
define what group ID a newly created file gets. When grpid
is set, it takes the group ID of the directory in which it
is created; otherwise (the default) it takes the fsgid of
the current process, unless the directory has the setgid bit
set, in which case it takes the gid from the parent
directory, and also gets the setgid bit set if it is a
directory itself.</p>

<p>ihashsize=value Sets the number of hash buckets
available for hashing the in- memory inodes of the specified
mount point. If a value of zero is used, the value selected
by the default algorithm will be displayed in
/proc/mounts.</p>

<p>ikeep / noikeep When inode clusters are emptied of
inodes, keep them around on the disk (ikeep) - this is the
traditional XFS behaviour and is still the default for now.
Using the noikeep option, inode clusters are returned to the
free space pool.</p>

<p>inode64 Indicates that XFS is allowed to create inodes
at any location in the filesystem, including those which
will result in inode numbers occupying more than 32 bits of
significance. This is provided for backwards compatibility,
but causes problems for backup applications that cannot
handle large inode numbers.</p>

<p>largeio / nolargeio If nolargeio is specified, the
optimal I/O reported in st_blk- size by stat(2) will be as
small as possible to allow user applications to avoid
inefficient read/modify/write I/O. If largeio is specified,
a filesystem that has a swidth specified will return the
swidth value (in bytes) in st_blksize. If the filesystem
does not have a swidth specified but does specify an
allocsize then allocsize (in bytes) will be returned
instead. If neither of these two options are specified, then
filesystem will behave as if nolargeio was specified.</p>

<p>logbufs=value Set the number of in-memory log buffers.
Valid numbers range from 2-8 inclusive. The default value is
8 buffers for filesys- tems with a blocksize of 64KiB, 4
buffers for filesystems with a blocksize of 32KiB, 3 buffers
for filesystems with a blocksize of 16KiB and 2 buffers for
all other configurations. Increasing the number of buffers
may increase performance on some workloads at the cost of
the memory used for the additional log buffers and their
associated control structures.</p>

<p>logbsize=value Set the size of each in-memory log
buffer. Size may be speci- fied in bytes, or in kilobytes
with a &quot;k&quot; suffix. Valid sizes for version 1 and
version 2 logs are 16384 (16k) and 32768 (32k). Valid sizes
for version 2 logs also include 65536 (64k), 131072 (128k)
and 262144 (256k). The default value for machines with more
than 32MiB of memory is 32768, machines with less mem- ory
use 16384 by default.</p>

<p>logdev=device and rtdev=device Use an external log
(metadata journal) and/or real-time device. An XFS
filesystem has up to three parts: a data section, a log
section, and a real-time section. The real-time section is
optional, and the log section can be separate from the data
sec- tion or contained within it. Refer to xfs(5).</p>

<p>mtpt=mountpoint Use with the dmapi option. The value
specified here will be included in the DMAPI mount event,
and should be the path of the actual mountpoint that is
used.</p>

<p>noalign Data allocations will not be aligned at stripe
unit boundaries.</p>

<p>noatime Access timestamps are not updated when a file is
read.</p>

<p>norecovery The filesystem will be mounted without
running log recovery. If the filesystem was not cleanly
unmounted, it is likely to be inconsistent when mounted in
norecovery mode. Some files or directories may not be
accessible because of this. Filesystems mounted norecovery
must be mounted read-only or the mount will fail.</p>

<p>nouuid Don t check for double mounted file systems using
the file sys- tem uuid. This is useful to mount LVM snapshot
volumes.</p>

<p>osyncisdsync Make O_SYNC writes implement true O_SYNC.
WITHOUT this option, Linux XFS behaves as if an osyncisdsync
option is used, which will make writes to files opened with
the O_SYNC flag set behave as if the O_DSYNC flag had been
used instead. This can result in better performance without
compromising data safety. However if this option is not in
effect, timestamp updates from O_SYNC writes can be lost if
the system crashes. If timestamp updates are critical, use
the osyncisosync option.</p>

<p>uquota / usrquota / uqnoenforce / quota User disk quota
accounting enabled, and limits (optionally) enforced. Refer
to xfs_quota(8) for further details.</p>

<p>gquota / grpquota / gqnoenforce Group disk quota
accounting enabled and limits (optionally) enforced. Refer
to xfs_quota(8) for further details.</p>

<p>pquota / prjquota / pqnoenforce Project disk quota
accounting enabled and limits (optionally) enforced. Refer
to xfs_quota(8) for further details.</p>

<p>sunit=value and swidth=value Used to specify the stripe
unit and width for a RAID device or a stripe volume. value
must be specified in 512-byte block units. If this option is
not specified and the filesystem was made on a stripe volume
or the stripe width or unit were specified for the RAID
device at mkfs time, then the mount system call will restore
the value from the superblock. For filesystems that are made
directly on RAID devices, these options can be used to
override the information in the superblock if the underlying
disk layout changes after the filesystem has been created.
The swidth option is required if the sunit option has been
speci- fied, and must be a multiple of the sunit value.</p>

<p>swalloc Data allocations will be rounded up to stripe
width boundaries when the current end of file is being
extended and the file size is larger than the stripe width
size.</p>

<p>Mount options for xiafs None. Although nothing is wrong
with xiafs, it is not used much, and is not maintained.
Probably one shouldnt use it. Since Linux version 2.1.21
xiafs is no longer part of the kernel source.</p>

<p>THE LOOP DEVICE One further possible type is a mount via
the loop device. For example, the command</p>

<p>mount /tmp/fdimage /mnt -t msdos -o
loop=/dev/loop3,blocksize=1024</p>

<p>will set up the loop device /dev/loop3 to correspond to
the file /tmp/fdimage, and then mount this device on
/mnt.</p>

<p>This type of mount knows about three options, namely
loop, offset and encryption, that are really options to
losetup(8). (These options can be used in addition to those
specific to the filesystem type.)</p>

<p>If no explicit loop device is mentioned (but just an
option -o loop is given), then mount will try to find some
unused loop device and use that. If you are not so unwise as
to make /etc/mtab a symbolic link to /proc/mounts then any
loop device allocated by mount will be freed by umount. You
can also free a loop device by hand, using losetup -d, see
losetup(8).</p>

<p>RETURN CODES mount has the following return codes (the
bits can be ORed):</p>

<p>0 success</p>

<p>1 incorrect invocation or permissions</p>

<p>2 system error (out of memory, cannot fork, no more loop
devices)</p>

<p>4 internal mount bug or missing nfs support in mount</p>

<p>8 user interrupt</p>

<p>16 problems writing or locking /etc/mtab</p>

<p>32 mount failure</p>

<p>64 some mount succeeded</p>

<p>FILES /etc/fstab file system table</p>

<p>/etc/mtab table of mounted file systems</p>

<p>/etc/mtab~ lock file</p>

<p>/etc/mtab.tmp temporary file</p>

<p>/etc/filesystems a list of filesystem types to try</p>

<p>SEE ALSO mount(2), umount(2), fstab(5), umount(8),
swapon(8), nfs(5), xfs(5), e2label(8), xfs_admin(8),
mountd(8), nfsd(8), mke2fs(8), tune2fs(8), losetup(8)</p>

<p>BUGS It is possible for a corrupted file system to cause
a crash.</p>

<p>Some Linux file systems don t support -o sync and -o
dirsync (the ext2, ext3, fat and vfat file systems do
support synchronous updates (a la BSD) when mounted with the
sync option).</p>

<p>The -o remount may not be able to change mount
parameters (all ext2fs- specific parameters, except sb, are
changeable with a remount, for example, but you cant change
gid or umask for the fatfs).</p>

<p>Mount by label or uuid will work only if your devices
have the names listed in /proc/partitions. In particular, it
may well fail if the kernel was compiled with devfs but
devfs is not mounted.</p>

<p>It is possible that files /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts don
t match. The first file is based only on the mount command
options, but the content of the second file also depends on
the kernel and others settings (e.g. remote NFS server. In
particular case the mount command may reports unreliable
information about a NFS mount point and the /proc/mounts
file usually contains more reliable information.)</p>

<p>Checking files on NFS filesystem referenced by file
descriptors (i.e. the fcntl and ioctl families of functions)
may lead to inconsistent result due to the lack of
consistency check in kernel even if noac is used.</p>

<p>HISTORY A mount command existed in Version 5 AT&amp;T
UNIX.</p>

<p>Linux 2.6 2004-12-16 MOUNT(8)</p>
