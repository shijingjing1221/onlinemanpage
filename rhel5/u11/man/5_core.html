<p>CORE(5) Linux Programmer s Manual CORE(5)</p>

<p>NAME core - core dump file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The default action of certain signals is to
cause a process to termi- nate and produce a core dump file,
a disk file containing an image of the processs memory at
the time of termination. A list of the signals which cause a
process to dump core can be found in signal(7).</p>

<p>A process can set its soft RLIMIT_CORE resource limit to
place an upper limit on the size of the core dump file that
will be produced if it receives a &quot;core dump&quot;
signal; see getrlimit(2) for details.</p>

<p>There are various circumstances in which a core dump
file is not pro- duced:</p>

<p>* The process does not have permission to write the core
file. (By default the core file is called core, and is
created in the current working directory. See below for
details on naming.) Writing the core file will fail if the
directory in which it is to be created is non-writable, or
if a file with the same name exists and is not writable or
is not a regular file (e.g., it is a directory or a symbolic
link).</p>

<p>* The directory in which the core dump file is to be
created does not exist.</p>

<p>* RLIMIT_CORE or RLIMIT_FSIZE resource limits for a
process are set to zero (see getrlimit(2)).</p>

<p>* The binary being executed by the process does not have
read per- mission enabled.</p>

<p>* The process is executing a set-user-ID (set-group-ID)
program that is owned by a user (group) other than the real
user (group) ID of the process. (However, see the
description of the prctl(2) PR_SET_DUMPABLE operation, and
the description of the /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable file in
proc(5).)</p>

<p>Naming of core dump files By default, a core dump file
is named core, but the /proc/sys/ker- nel/core_pattern file
(new in Linux 2.5) can be set to define a tem- plate that is
used to name core dump files. The template can contain %
specifiers which are substituted by the following values
when a core file is created:</p>

<p>%% A single % character %p PID of dumped process %u real
UID of dumped process %g real GID of dumped process %s
number of signal causing dump %t time of dump (seconds since
0:00h, 1 Jan 1970) %h hostname (same as nodename returned by
uname(2)) %e executable filename</p>

<p>A single % at the end of the template is dropped from
the core file- name, as is the combination of a % followed
by any character other than those listed above. All other
characters in the template become a lit- eral part of the
core filename. The template may include / charac- ters,
which are interpreted as delimiters for directory names. The
maximum size of the resulting core filename is 64 bytes. The
default value in this file is &quot;core&quot;. For backward
compatibility, if /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern does not
include &quot;%p&quot; and /proc/sys/ker- nel/core_uses_pid
(see below) is non-zero, then .PID will be appended to the
core filename.</p>

<p>Linux 2.4 does not provide
/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, but does pro- vide a more
primitive method of controlling the name of the core dump
file. If the /proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid file contains
the value 0, then a core dump file is simply named core. If
this file contains a non-zero value, then the core dump file
includes the process ID in a name of the form core.PID.</p>

<p>NOTES The gdb(1) gcore command can be used to obtain a
core dump of a running process.</p>

<p>If a multithreaded process (or, more precisely, a
process that shares its memory with another process by being
created with the CLONE_VM flag of clone(2)) dumps core, then
the process ID is always appended to the core filename,
unless the process ID was already included elsewhere in the
filename via a %p specification in
/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern.</p>
