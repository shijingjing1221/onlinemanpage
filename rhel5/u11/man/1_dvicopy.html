exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX

virtual fonts to base fonts, and writes the resulting DVI
file. Thus you can use vir- tual fonts even if your DVI
processor does not support them, by passing the documents
through dvicopy first.</p>
