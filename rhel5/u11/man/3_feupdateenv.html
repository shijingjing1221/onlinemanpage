feupdateenv(const fenv_t *envp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These eleven functions were defined in C99,
and describe the handling of floating point rounding and
exceptions (overflow, zero-divide etc.).</p>

<p>Exceptions The DivideByZero exception occurs when an
operation on finite numbers produces infinity as exact
answer.</p>

<p>The Overflow exception occurs when a result has to be
represented as a floating point number, but has (much)
larger absolute value than the largest (finite) floating
point number that is representable.</p>

<p>The Underflow exception occurs when a result has to be
represented as a floating point number, but has smaller
absolute value than the smallest positive normalized
floating point number (and would lose much accuracy when
represented as a denormalized number).</p>

<p>The Inexact exception occurs when the rounded result of
an operation is not equal to the infinite precision result.
It may occur whenever Overflow or Underflow occurs.</p>

<p>The Invalid exception occurs when there is no
well-defined result for an operation, as for 0/0 or infinity
- infinity or sqrt(-1).</p>

<p>Exception handling Exceptions are represented in two
ways: as a single bit (exception present/absent), and these
bits correspond in some implementation- defined way with bit
positions in an integer, and also as an opaque structure
that may contain more information about the exception (per-
haps the code address where it occurred).</p>

<p>Each of the macros FE_DIVBYZERO, FE_INEXACT, FE_INVALID,
FE_OVERFLOW, FE_UNDERFLOW is defined when the implementation
supports handling of the corresponding exception, and if so
then defines the corresponding bit(s), so that one can call
exception handling functions e.g. using the integer argument
FE_OVERFLOW|FE_UNDERFLOW. Other exceptions may be supported.
The macro FE_ALL_EXCEPT is the bitwise OR of all bits corre-
sponding to supported exceptions.</p>

<p>The feclearexcept() function clears the supported
exceptions represented by the bits in its argument.</p>

<p>The fegetexceptflag() function stores a representation
of the state of the exception flags represented by the
argument excepts in the opaque object *flagp.</p>

<p>The feraiseexcept() function raises the supported
exceptions repre- sented by the bits in excepts.</p>

<p>The fesetexceptflag() function sets the complete status
for the excep- tions represented by excepts to the value
*flagp. This value must have been obtained by an earlier
call of fegetexceptflag() with a last argu- ment that
contained all bits in excepts.</p>

<p>The fetestexcept() function returns a word in which the
bits are set that were set in the argument excepts and for
which the corresponding exception is currently set.</p>

<p>Rounding Each of the macros FE_DOWNWARD, FE_TONEAREST,
FE_TOWARDZERO, FE_UPWARD is defined when the implementation
supports getting and setting the corresponding rounding
direction.</p>

<p>The fegetround() function returns the macro
corresponding to the cur- rent rounding mode.</p>

<p>The fesetround() function sets the rounding mode as
specified by its argument and returns zero when it was
successful.</p>

<p>Floating point environment The entire floating point
environment, including control modes and sta- tus flags, can
be handled as one opaque object, of type fenv_t. The default
environment is denoted by FE_DFL_ENV (of type const fenv_t
*). This is the environment setup at program start and it is
defined by ISO C to have round to nearest, all exceptions
cleared and a non-stop (con- tinue on exceptions) mode.</p>

<p>The fegetenv() function saves the current floating point
environment in the object *envp.</p>

<p>The feholdexcept() function does the same, then clears
all exception flags, and sets a non-stop (continue on
exceptions) mode, if available. It returns zero when
successful.</p>

<p>The fesetenv() function restores the floating point
environment from the object *envp. This object must be known
to be valid, e.g., the result of a call to fegetenv() or
feholdexcept() or equal to FE_DFL_ENV. This call does not
raise exceptions.</p>

<p>The feupdateenv() function installs the floating-point
environment rep- resented by the object *envp, except that
currently raised exceptions are not cleared. After calling
this function, the raised exceptions will be a bitwise OR of
those previously set with those in *envp. As before, the
object *envp must be known to be valid.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE These functions return zero on success and
non-zero if an error occurred.</p>

<p>GNU DETAILS If possible, the GNU C Library defines a
macro FE_NOMASK_ENV which rep- resents an environment where
every exception raised causes a trap to occur. You can test
for this macro using #ifdef. It is only defined if
_GNU_SOURCE is defined. The C99 standard does not define a
way to set individual bits in the floating point mask, e.g.
to trap on spe- cific flags. glibc 2.2 supports the
functions feenableexcept() and fedisableexcept() to set
individual floating point traps, and fegetex- cept() to
query the state.</p>

<p>#define _GNU_SOURCE #include &lt;fenv.h&gt;</p>

<p>int feenableexcept (int excepts); int fedisableexcept
(int excepts); int fegetexcept (void);</p>

<p>The feenableexcept() and fedisableexcept() functions
enable (disable) traps for each of the exceptions
represented by excepts and return the previous set of
enabled exceptions when successful, and -1 otherwise. The
fegetexcept() function returns the set of all currently
enabled exceptions.</p>
