<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) bzip2(1) bzip2(1)</p>

<p>NAME bzip2, bunzip2 - a block-sorting file compressor,
v1.0.3 bzcat - decompresses files to stdout bzip2recover -
recovers data from damaged bzip2 files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS bzip2 [ -cdfkqstvzVL123456789 ] [ filenames ...
] bunzip2 [ -fkvsVL ] [ filenames ... ] bzcat [ -s ] [
filenames ... ] bzip2recover filename</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION bzip2 compresses files using the
Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression algorithm,
and Huffman coding. Compression is generally considerably
better than that achieved by more conventional
LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance
of the PPM family of statistical compressors.</p>

<p>The command-line options are deliberately very similar
to those of GNU gzip, but they are not identical.</p>

<p>bzip2 expects a list of file names to accompany the
command-line flags. Each file is replaced by a compressed
version of itself, with the name
&quot;original_name.bz2&quot;. Each compressed file has the
same modification date, permissions, and, when possible,
ownership as the corresponding original, so that these
properties can be correctly restored at decom- pression
time. File name handling is naive in the sense that there is
no mechanism for preserving original file names,
permissions, owner- ships or dates in filesystems which lack
these concepts, or have seri- ous file name length
restrictions, such as MS-DOS.</p>

<p>bzip2 and bunzip2 will by default not overwrite existing
files. If you want this to happen, specify the -f flag.</p>

<p>If no file names are specified, bzip2 compresses from
standard input to standard output. In this case, bzip2 will
decline to write compressed output to a terminal, as this
would be entirely incomprehensible and therefore
pointless.</p>

<p>bunzip2 (or bzip2 -d) decompresses all specified files.
Files which were not created by bzip2 will be detected and
ignored, and a warning issued. bzip2 attempts to guess the
filename for the decompressed file from that of the
compressed file as follows:</p>

<p>filename.bz2 becomes filename filename.bz becomes
filename filename.tbz2 becomes filename.tar filename.tbz
becomes filename.tar anyothername becomes
anyothername.out</p>

<p>If the file does not end in one of the recognised
endings, .bz2, .bz, .tbz2 or .tbz, bzip2 complains that it
cannot guess the name of the original file, and uses the
original name with .out appended.</p>

<p>As with compression, supplying no filenames causes
decompression from standard input to standard output.</p>

<p>bunzip2 will correctly decompress a file which is the
concatenation of two or more compressed files. The result is
the concatenation of the corresponding uncompressed files.
Integrity testing (-t) of concatenated compressed files is
also supported.</p>

<p>You can also compress or decompress files to the
standard output by giving the -c flag. Multiple files may be
compressed and decompressed like this. The resulting outputs
are fed sequentially to stdout. Com- pression of multiple
files in this manner generates a stream containing multiple
compressed file representations. Such a stream can be decom-
pressed correctly only by bzip2 version 0.9.0 or later.
Earlier ver- sions of bzip2 will stop after decompressing
the first file in the stream.</p>

<p>bzcat (or bzip2 -dc) decompresses all specified files to
the standard output.</p>

<p>bzip2 will read arguments from the environment variables
BZIP2 and BZIP, in that order, and will process them before
any arguments read from the command line. This gives a
convenient way to supply default arguments.</p>

<p>Compression is always performed, even if the compressed
file is slightly larger than the original. Files of less
than about one hun- dred bytes tend to get larger, since the
compression mechanism has a constant overhead in the region
of 50 bytes. Random data (including the output of most file
compressors) is coded at about 8.05 bits per byte, giving an
expansion of around 0.5%.</p>

<p>As a self-check for your protection, bzip2 uses 32-bit
CRCs to make sure that the decompressed version of a file is
identical to the origi- nal. This guards against corruption
of the compressed data, and against undetected bugs in bzip2
(hopefully very unlikely). The chances of data corruption
going undetected is microscopic, about one chance in four
billion for each file processed. Be aware, though, that the
check occurs upon decompression, so it can only tell you
that some- thing is wrong. It cant help you recover the
original uncompressed data. You can use bzip2recover to try
to recover data from damaged files.</p>

<p>Return values: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental
problems (file not found, invalid flags, I/O errors,
&amp;c), 2 to indicate a corrupt com- pressed file, 3 for an
internal consistency error (eg, bug) which caused bzip2 to
panic.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c --stdout Compress or decompress to standard
output.</p>

<p>-d --decompress Force decompression. bzip2, bunzip2 and
bzcat are really the same program, and the decision about
what actions to take is done on the basis of which name is
used. This flag overrides that mechanism, and forces bzip2
to decompress.</p>

<p>-z --compress The complement to -d: forces compression,
regardless of the invocation name.</p>

<p>-t --test Check integrity of the specified file(s), but
don t decompress them. This really performs a trial
decompression and throws away the result.</p>

<p>-f --force Force overwrite of output files. Normally,
bzip2 will not over- write existing output files. Also
forces bzip2 to break hard links to files, which it
otherwise wouldnt do.</p>

<p>bzip2 normally declines to decompress files which dont
have the correct magic header bytes. If forced (-f),
however, it will pass such files through unmodified. This is
how GNU gzip behaves.</p>

<p>-k --keep Keep (dont delete) input files during
compression or decompres- sion.</p>

<p>-s --small Reduce memory usage, for compression,
decompression and testing. Files are decompressed and tested
using a modified algorithm which only requires 2.5 bytes per
block byte. This means any file can be decompressed in 2300k
of memory, albeit at about half the normal speed.</p>

<p>During compression, -s selects a block size of 200k,
which lim- its memory use to around the same figure, at the
expense of your compression ratio. In short, if your machine
is low on memory (8 megabytes or less), use -s for
everything. See MEMORY MAN- AGEMENT below.</p>

<p>-q --quiet Suppress non-essential warning messages.
Messages pertaining to I/O errors and other critical events
will not be suppressed.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Verbose mode -- show the compression ratio
for each file pro- cessed. Further -vs increase the
verbosity level, spewing out lots of information which is
primarily of interest for diagnos- tic purposes.</p>

<p>-L --license -V --version Display the software version,
license terms and conditions.</p>

<p>-1 (or --fast) to -9 (or --best) Set the block size to
100 k, 200 k .. 900 k when compressing. Has no effect when
decompressing. See MEMORY MANAGEMENT below. The --fast and
--best aliases are primarily for GNU gzip compat- ibility.
In particular, --fast doesn t make things signifi- cantly
faster. And --best merely selects the default behaviour.</p>

<p>-- Treats all subsequent arguments as file names, even
if they start with a dash. This is so you can handle files
with names beginning with a dash, for example: bzip2 --
-myfilename.</p>

<p>--repetitive-fast --repetitive-best These flags are
redundant in versions 0.9.5 and above. They provided some
coarse control over the behaviour of the sorting algorithm
in earlier versions, which was sometimes useful. 0.9.5 and
above have an improved algorithm which renders these flags
irrelevant.</p>

<p>MEMORY MANAGEMENT bzip2 compresses large files in
blocks. The block size affects both the compression ratio
achieved, and the amount of memory needed for compression
and decompression. The flags -1 through -9 specify the block
size to be 100,000 bytes through 900,000 bytes (the default)
respectively. At decompression time, the block size used for
compres- sion is read from the header of the compressed
file, and bunzip2 then allocates itself just enough memory
to decompress the file. Since block sizes are stored in
compressed files, it follows that the flags -1 to -9 are
irrelevant to and so ignored during decompression.</p>

<p>Compression and decompression requirements, in bytes,
can be estimated as:</p>

<p>Compression: 400k + ( 8 x block size )</p>

<p>Decompression: 100k + ( 4 x block size ), or 100k + (
2.5 x block size )</p>

<p>Larger block sizes give rapidly diminishing marginal
returns. Most of the compression comes from the first two or
three hundred k of block size, a fact worth bearing in mind
when using bzip2 on small machines. It is also important to
appreciate that the decompression memory requirement is set
at compression time by the choice of block size.</p>

<p>For files compressed with the default 900k block size,
bunzip2 will require about 3700 kbytes to decompress. To
support decompression of any file on a 4 megabyte machine,
bunzip2 has an option to decompress using approximately half
this amount of memory, about 2300 kbytes. Decompression
speed is also halved, so you should use this option only
where necessary. The relevant flag is -s.</p>

<p>In general, try and use the largest block size memory
constraints allow, since that maximises the compression
achieved. Compression and decompression speed are virtually
unaffected by block size.</p>

<p>Another significant point applies to files which fit in
a single block -- that means most files youd encounter using
a large block size. The amount of real memory touched is
proportional to the size of the file, since the file is
smaller than a block. For example, compressing a file 20,000
bytes long with the flag -9 will cause the compressor to
allocate around 7600k of memory, but only touch 400k + 20000
* 8 = 560 kbytes of it. Similarly, the decompressor will
allocate 3700k but only touch 100k + 20000 * 4 = 180
kbytes.</p>

<p>Here is a table which summarises the maximum memory
usage for different block sizes. Also recorded is the total
compressed size for 14 files of the Calgary Text Compression
Corpus totalling 3,141,622 bytes. This column gives some
feel for how compression varies with block size. These
figures tend to understate the advantage of larger block
sizes for larger files, since the Corpus is dominated by
smaller files.</p>

<p>RECOVERING DATA FROM DAMAGED FILES bzip2 compresses
files in blocks, usually 900kbytes long. Each block is
handled independently. If a media or transmission error
causes a multi-block .bz2 file to become damaged, it may be
possible to recover data from the undamaged blocks in the
file.</p>

<p>The compressed representation of each block is delimited
by a 48-bit pattern, which makes it possible to find the
block boundaries with rea- sonable certainty. Each block
also carries its own 32-bit CRC, so dam- aged blocks can be
distinguished from undamaged ones.</p>

<p>bzip2recover is a simple program whose purpose is to
search for blocks in .bz2 files, and write each block out
into its own .bz2 file. You can then use bzip2 -t to test
the integrity of the resulting files, and decompress those
which are undamaged.</p>

<p>bzip2recover takes a single argument, the name of the
damaged file, and writes a number of files
&quot;rec00001file.bz2&quot;, &quot;rec00002file.bz2&quot;,
etc, containing the extracted blocks. The output filenames
are designed so that the use of wildcards in subsequent
processing -- for example, &quot;bzip2 -dc rec*file.bz2 &gt;
recovered_data&quot; -- processes the files in the correct
order.</p>

<p>bzip2recover should be of most use dealing with large
.bz2 files, as these will contain many blocks. It is clearly
futile to use it on dam- aged single-block files, since a
damaged block cannot be recov- ered. If you wish to minimise
any potential data loss through media or transmission
errors, you might consider compressing with a smaller block
size.</p>

<p>PERFORMANCE NOTES The sorting phase of compression
gathers together similar strings in the file. Because of
this, files containing very long runs of repeated symbols,
like &quot;aabaabaabaab ...&quot; (repeated several hundred
times) may compress more slowly than normal. Versions 0.9.5
and above fare much better than previous versions in this
respect. The ratio between worst-case and average-case
compression time is in the region of 10:1. For previous
versions, this figure was more like 100:1. You can use the
-vvvv option to monitor progress in great detail, if you
want.</p>

<p>Decompression speed is unaffected by these
phenomena.</p>

<p>bzip2 usually allocates several megabytes of memory to
operate in, and then charges all over it in a fairly random
fashion. This means that performance, both for compressing
and decompressing, is largely deter- mined by the speed at
which your machine can service cache misses. Because of
this, small changes to the code to reduce the miss rate have
been observed to give disproportionately large performance
improve- ments. I imagine bzip2 will perform best on
machines with very large caches.</p>

<p>CAVEATS I/O error messages are not as helpful as they
could be. bzip2 tries hard to detect I/O errors and exit
cleanly, but the details of what the problem is sometimes
seem rather misleading.</p>

<p>This manual page pertains to version 1.0.3 of bzip2.
Compressed data created by this version is entirely forwards
and backwards compatible with the previous public releases,
versions 0.1pl2, 0.9.0, 0.9.5, 1.0.0, 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, but
with the following exception: 0.9.0 and above can correctly
decompress multiple concatenated compressed files. 0.1pl2
cannot do this; it will stop after decompressing just the
first file in the stream.</p>

<p>bzip2recover versions prior to 1.0.2 used 32-bit
integers to represent bit positions in compressed files, so
they could not handle compressed files more than 512
megabytes long. Versions 1.0.2 and above use 64-bit ints on
some platforms which support them (GNU supported tar- gets,
and Windows). To establish whether or not bzip2recover was
built with such a limitation, run it without arguments. In
any event you can build yourself an unlimited version if you
can recompile it with May- beUInt64 set to be an unsigned
64-bit integer.</p>

<p>The ideas embodied in bzip2 are due to (at least) the
following people: Michael Burrows and David Wheeler (for the
block sorting transforma- tion), David Wheeler (again, for
the Huffman coder), Peter Fenwick (for the structured coding
model in the original bzip, and many refine- ments), and
Alistair Moffat, Radford Neal and Ian Witten (for the
arithmetic coder in the original bzip). I am much indebted
for their help, support and advice. See the manual in the
source distribution for pointers to sources of
documentation. Christian von Roques encour- aged me to look
for faster sorting algorithms, so as to speed up com-
pression. Bela Lubkin encouraged me to improve the
worst-case compres- sion performance. Donna Robinson XMLised
the documentation. The bz* scripts are derived from those of
GNU gzip. Many people sent patches, helped with portability
problems, lent machines, gave advice and were generally
helpful.</p>
