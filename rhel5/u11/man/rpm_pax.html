<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>DESCRIPTION pax will read, write, and list the members
of an archive file, and will copy directory hierarchies. pax
operation is independent of the specific archive format, and
supports a wide variety of different archive formats. A list
of supported archive formats can be found under the
description of the -x option.</p>

<p>The presence of the -r and the -w options specifies
which of the follow- ing functional modes pax will operate
under: list, read, write, and copy.</p>

<p>&lt;none&gt; List. pax will write to standard output a
table of contents of the members of the archive file read
from standard input, whose pathnames match the specified
patterns. The table of contents contains one filename per
line and is written using single line buffering.</p>

<p>-r Read. pax extracts the members of the archive file
read from the standard input, with pathnames matching the
specified patterns. The archive format and blocking is
automatically determined on input. When an extracted file is
a directory, the entire file hierarchy rooted at that
directory is extracted. All extracted files are created
relative to the current file hierarchy. The setting of
ownership, access and modification times, and file mode of
the extracted files are discussed in more detail under the
-p option.</p>

<p>-w Write. pax writes an archive containing the file
operands to standard output using the specified archive
format. When no file operands are specified, a list of files
to copy with one per line is read from standard input. When
a file operand is also a directory, the entire file
hierarchy rooted at that directory will be included.</p>

<p>-r -w Copy. pax copies the file operands to the
destination directory. When no file operands are specified,
a list of files to copy with one per line is read from the
standard input. When a file operand is also a directory the
entire file hierarchy rooted at that directory will be
included. The effect of the copy is as if the copied files
were written to an archive file and then subse- quently
extracted, except that there may be hard links between the
original and the copied files (see the -l option below).</p>

<p>Warning: The destination directory must not be one of
the file operands or a member of a file hierarchy rooted at
one of the file operands. The result of a copy under these
conditions is unpredictable.</p>

<p>While processing a damaged archive during a read or list
operation, pax will attempt to recover from media defects
and will search through the archive to locate and process
the largest number of archive members pos- sible (see the -E
option for more details on error handling).</p>

<p>The directory operand specifies a destination directory
pathname. If the directory operand does not exist, or it is
not writable by the user, or it is not of type directory,
pax will exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>The pattern operand is used to select one or more
pathnames of archive members. Archive members are selected
using the pattern matching nota- tion described by
fnmatch(3). When the pattern operand is not supplied, all
members of the archive will be selected. When a pattern
matches a directory, the entire file hierarchy rooted at
that directory will be selected. When a pattern operand does
not select at least one archive member, pax will write these
pattern operands in a diagnostic message to standard error
and then exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>The file operand specifies the pathname of a file to be
copied or archived. When a file operand does not select at
least one archive mem- ber, pax will write these file
operand pathnames in a diagnostic message to standard error
and then exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-r Read an archive file from standard input and extract
the speci- fied files. If any intermediate directories are
needed in order to extract an archive member, these
directories will be created as if mkdir(2) was called with
the bitwise inclusive OR of S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, and S_IRWXO as
the mode argument. When the selected archive format supports
the specification of linked files and these files cannot be
linked while the archive is being extracted, pax will write
a diagnostic message to standard error and exit with a
non-zero exit status at the completion of opera- tion.</p>

<p>-w Write files to the standard output in the specified
archive for- mat. When no file operands are specified,
standard input is read for a list of pathnames with one per
line without any leading or trailing blanks.</p>

<p>-a Append files to the end of an archive that was
previously writ- ten. If an archive format is not specified
with a -x option, the format currently being used in the
archive will be selected. Any attempt to append to an
archive in a format different from the format already used
in the archive will cause pax to exit immedi- ately with a
non-zero exit status. The blocking size used in the archive
volume where writing starts will continue to be used for the
remainder of that archive volume.</p>

<p>Warning: Many storage devices are not able to support
the opera- tions necessary to perform an append operation.
Any attempt to append to an archive stored on such a device
may damage the archive or have other unpredictable results.
Tape drives in par- ticular are more likely to not support
an append operation. An archive stored in a regular file
system file or on a disk device will usually support an
append operation.</p>

<p>-0 Use the NUL ( ) character as a pathname terminator,
instead of ). This applies only to the pathnames read from
newline ( 0 standard input in the write and copy modes, and
to the pathnames written to standard output in list mode.
This option is expected to be used in concert with the
-print0 function in find(1) or the -0 flag in xargs(1).</p>

<p>-b blocksize When writing an archive, block the output
at a positive decimal integer number of bytes per write to
the archive file. The blocksize must be a multiple of 512
bytes with a maximum of 64512 bytes. Archives larger than
32256 bytes violate the POSIX stan- dard and will not be
portable to all systems. A blocksize can end with k or b to
specify multiplication by 1024 (1K) or 512, respectively. A
pair of blocksizes can be separated by x to indicate a
product. A specific archive device may impose additional
restrictions on the size of blocking it will support. When
blocking is not specified, the default blocksize is depen-
dent on the specific archive format being used (see the -x
option).</p>

<p>-c Match all file or archive members except those
specified by the pattern and file operands.</p>

<p>-d Cause files of type directory being copied or
archived, or archive members of type directory being
extracted, to match only the directory file or archive
member and not the file hierarchy rooted at the
directory.</p>

<p>-f archive Specify archive as the pathname of the input
or output archive, overriding the default standard input
(for list and read) or standard output (for write). A single
archive may span multiple files and different archive
devices. When required, pax will prompt for the pathname of
the file or device of the next volume in the archive.</p>

<p>-i Interactively rename files or archive members. For
each archive member matching a pattern operand or each file
matching a file operand, pax will prompt to /dev/tty giving
the name of the file, its file mode, and its modification
time. pax will then read a line from /dev/tty. If this line
is blank, the file or archive member is skipped. If this
line consists of a single period, the file or archive member
is processed with no modification to its name. Otherwise,
its name is replaced with the contents of the line. pax will
immediately exit with a non-zero exit status if EOF is
encountered when reading a response or if /dev/tty cannot be
opened for reading and writing.</p>

<p>-k Do not overwrite existing files.</p>

<p>-l (The lowercase letter ell.) Link files. In the copy
mode (-r -w), hard links are made between the source and
destination file hierarchies whenever possible.</p>

<p>-n Select the first archive member that matches each
pattern operand. No more than one archive member is matched
for each pattern. When members of type directory are
matched, the file hierarchy rooted at that directory is also
matched (unless -d is also specified).</p>

<p>-o options Information to modify the algorithm for
extracting or writing archive files which is specific to the
archive format specified by -x. In general, options take the
form: name=value.</p>

<p>-p string Specify one or more file characteristic
options (privileges). The string option-argument is a string
specifying file character- istics to be retained or
discarded on extraction. The string consists of the
specification characters a, e, m, o, and p. Mul- tiple
characteristics can be concatenated within the same string
and multiple -p options can be specified. The meaning of the
specification characters are as follows:</p>

<p>a Do not preserve file access times. By default, file
access times are preserved whenever possible.</p>

<p>e Preserve everything, the user ID, group ID, file mode
bits, file access time, and file modification time. This is
intended to be used by root, someone with all the
appropriate privileges, in order to preserve all aspects of
the files as they are recorded in the archive. The e flag is
the sum of the o and p flags.</p>

<p>m Do not preserve file modification times. By default,
file modification times are preserved whenever possible.</p>

<p>o Preserve the user ID and group ID.</p>

<p>p Preserve the file mode bits. This is intended to be
used by a user with regular privileges who wants to preserve
all aspects of the file other than the ownership. The file
times are preserved by default, but two other flags are
offered to disable this and use the time of extraction
instead.</p>

<p>In the preceding list, preserve indicates that an
attribute stored in the archive is given to the extracted
file, subject to the permissions of the invoking process.
Otherwise the attribute of the extracted file is determined
as part of the normal file creation action. If neither the e
nor the o specification char- acter is specified, or the
user ID and group ID are not preserved for any reason, pax
will not set the S_ISUID (setuid) and S_ISGID (setgid) bits
of the file mode. If the preservation of any of these items
fails for any reason, pax will write a diagnostic message to
standard error. Failure to preserve these items will affect
the final exit status, but will not cause the extracted file
to be deleted. If the file characteristic letters in any of
the string option-arguments are duplicated or conflict with
each other, the one(s) given last will take precedence. For
example, if -p eme is specified, file modification times are
still preserved.</p>

<p>-s replstr Modify the file or archive member names
specified by the pattern or file operands according to the
substitution expression replstr, using the syntax of the
ed(1) utility regular expres- sions. The format of these
regular expressions are: /old/new/[gp] As in ed(1), old is a
basic regular expression and new can con- (where n is a
digit) back-refer- tain an ampersand ( &amp; ), 0 ences, or
subexpression matching. The old string may also con- tain
newline characters. Any non-null character can be used as a
delimiter ( / is shown here). Multiple -s expressions can be
specified. The expressions are applied in the order they are
specified on the command line, terminating with the first
suc- cessful substitution. The optional trailing g continues
to apply the substitution expression to the pathname
substring which starts with the first character following
the end of the last successful substitution. The first
unsuccessful substitution stops the operation of the g
option. The optional trailing p will cause the final result
of a successful substitution to be written to standard error
in the following format: &lt;original pathname&gt; &gt;&gt;
&lt;new pathname&gt; File or archive member names that
substitute to the empty string are not selected and will be
skipped.</p>

<p>-t Reset the access times of any file or directory read
or accessed by pax to be the same as they were before being
read or accessed by pax.</p>

<p>-u Ignore files that are older (having a less recent
file modifica- tion time) than a pre-existing file or
archive member with the same name. During read, an archive
member with the same name as a file in the file system will
be extracted if the archive member is newer than the file.
During write, a file system member with the same name as an
archive member will be written to the archive if it is newer
than the archive member. During copy, the file in the
destination hierarchy is replaced by the file in the source
hierarchy or by a link to the file in the source hierarchy
if the file in the source hierarchy is newer.</p>

<p>-v During a list operation, produce a verbose table of
contents using the format of the ls(1) utility with the -l
option. For pathnames representing a hard link to a previous
member of the archive, the output has the format: &lt;ls -l
listing&gt; == &lt;link name&gt; For pathnames representing
a symbolic link, the output has the format: &lt;ls -l
listing&gt; =&gt; &lt;link name&gt; Where &lt;ls -l
listing&gt; is the output format specified by the ls(1)
utility when used with the -l option. Otherwise for all the
other operational modes (read, write, and copy), pathnames
are written and flushed to standard error without a trailing
newline as soon as processing begins on that file or archive
member. The trailing newline is not buffered and is written
only after the file has been read or written.</p>

<p>-x format Specify the output archive format, with the
default format being ustar. pax currently supports the
following formats:</p>

<p>cpio The extended cpio interchange format specified in
the IEEE Std 1003.2 (POSIX.2 ) standard. The default
blocksize for this format is 5120 bytes. Inode and device
information about a file (used for detecting file hard links
by this format) which may be truncated by this format is
detected by pax and is repaired.</p>

<p>bcpio The old binary cpio format. The default blocksize
for this format is 5120 bytes. This format is not very
portable and should not be used when other formats are
available. Inode and device information about a file (used
for detecting file hard links by this format) which may be
truncated by this format is detected by pax and is
repaired.</p>

<p>sv4cpio The System V release 4 cpio. The default
blocksize for this format is 5120 bytes. Inode and device
information about a file (used for detecting file hard links
by this format) which may be truncated by this format is
detected by pax and is repaired.</p>

<p>sv4crc The System V release 4 cpio with file crc
checksums. The default blocksize for this format is 5120
bytes. Inode and device information about a file (used for
detecting file hard links by this format) which may be
truncated by this format is detected by pax and is
repaired.</p>

<p>tar The old BSD tar format as found in BSD4.3. The
default blocksize for this format is 10240 bytes. Pathnames
stored by this format must be 100 characters or less in
length (including the trailing character, which means that
filenames can have a maximum length of 99 charac- ters).
Only regular files, hard links, soft links, and directories
will be archived (other file system types are not
supported). For backwards compatibility with even older tar
formats, a -o option can be used when writing an archive to
omit the storage of directories. This option takes the form:
-o write_opt=nodir</p>

<p>ustar The extended tar interchange format specified in
the IEEE Std 1003.2 (POSIX.2) standard. The default
blocksize for this format is 10240 bytes. Filenames stored
by this format must be 100 characters or less in length
(including the trailing character, which means that
filenames can have a maximum length of 99 charac- ters).
Pathnames (directorynames + filenames) stored by this format
must be 250 characters or less in length.</p>

<p>pax will detect and report any file that it is unable to
store or extract as the result of any specific archive
format restric- tions. The individual archive formats may
impose additional restrictions on use. Typical archive
format restrictions include (but are not limited to): file
pathname length, file size, link pathname length, and the
type of the file.</p>

<p>-z Use gzip(1) to compress (decompress) the archive
while writing (reading). Incompatible with -a.</p>

<p>-B bytes Limit the number of bytes written to a single
archive volume to bytes. The bytes limit can end with m, k,
or b to specify multiplication by 1048576 (1M), 1024 (1K) or
512, respectively. A pair of bytes limits can be separated
by x to indicate a product.</p>

<p>Warning: Only use this option when writing an archive to
a device which supports an end of file read condition based
on last (or largest) write offset (such as a regular file or
a tape drive). The use of this option with a floppy or hard
disk is not recom- mended.</p>

<p>-D This option is the same as the -u option, except that
the file inode change time is checked instead of the file
modification time. The file inode change time can be used to
select files whose inode information (e.g., UID, GID, etc.)
is newer than a copy of the file in the destination
directory.</p>

<p>-E limit Limit the number of consecutive read faults
while trying to read a flawed archive to limit. With a
positive limit, pax will attempt to recover from an archive
read error and will continue processing starting with the
next file stored in the archive. A limit of 0 will cause pax
to stop operation after the first read error is detected on
an archive volume. A limit of NONE will cause pax to attempt
to recover from read errors forever. The default limit is a
small positive number of retries.</p>

<p>Warning: Using this option with NONE should be used with
extreme caution as pax may get stuck in an infinite loop on
a very badly flawed archive.</p>

<p>-G group Select a file based on its group name, or when
starting with a #, a numeric gid. A can be used to escape
the #. Multiple -G options may be supplied and checking
stops with the first match.</p>

<p>-H Follow only command-line symbolic links while
performing a physi- cal file system traversal.</p>

<p>-L Follow all symbolic links to perform a logical file
system traversal.</p>

<p>-O Force the archive to be one volume. If a volume ends
prema- turely, pax will not prompt for a new volume. This
option can be useful for automated tasks where error
recovery cannot be per- formed by a human.</p>

<p>-P Do not follow symbolic links, perform a physical file
system traversal. This is the default mode.</p>

<p>-T [from_date][,to_date][/[c][m]] Allow files to be
selected based on a file modification or inode change time
falling within a specified time range of from_date to
to_date (the dates are inclusive). If only a from_date is
sup- plied, all files with a modification or inode change
time equal to or younger are selected. If only a to_date is
supplied, all files with a modification or inode change time
equal to or older will be selected. When the from_date is
equal to the to_date, only files with a modification or
inode change time of exactly that time will be selected.</p>

<p>When pax is in the write or copy mode, the optional
trailing field [c][m] can be used to determine which file
time (inode change, file modification or both) are used in
the comparison. If neither is specified, the default is to
use file modification time only. The m specifies the
comparison of file modification time (the time when the file
was last written). The c specifies the comparison of inode
change time (the time when the file inode was last changed;
e.g., a change of owner, group, mode, etc). When c and m are
both specified, then the modification and inode change times
are both compared. The inode change time comparison is
useful in selecting files whose attributes were recently
changed or selecting files which were recently created and
had their modification time reset to an older time (as what
happens when a file is extracted from an archive and the
modification time is preserved). Time comparisons using both
file times is useful when pax is used to create a time based
incremental archive (only files that were changed during a
specified time range will be archived).</p>

<p>A time range is made up of six different fields and each
field must contain two digits. The format is:
[[[[[cc]yy]mm]dd]HH]MM[.SS] Where cc is the first two digits
of the year (the century), yy is the last two digits of the
year, the first mm is the month (from 01 to 12), dd is the
day of the month (from 01 to 31), HH is the hour of the day
(from 00 to 23), MM is the minute (from 00 to 59), and SS is
the seconds (from 00 to 59). The minute field MM is
required, while the other fields are optional and must be
added in the following order: HH, dd, mm, yy, cc. The SS
field may be added independently of the other fields. Time
ranges are relative to the current time, so -T 1234/cm would
select all files with a modification or inode change time of
12:34 PM today or later. Multiple -T time range can be sup-
plied and checking stops with the first match.</p>

<p>-U user Select a file based on its user name, or when
starting with a #, a numeric UID. A can be used to escape
the #. Multiple -U options may be supplied and checking
stops with the first match.</p>

<p>-X When traversing the file hierarchy specified by a
pathname, do not descend into directories that have a
different device ID. See the st_dev field as described in
stat(2) for more information about device IDs.</p>

<p>-Y This option is the same as the -D option, except that
the inode change time is checked using the pathname created
after all the file name modifications have completed.</p>

<p>-Z This option is the same as the -u option, except that
the modifi- cation time is checked using the pathname
created after all the file name modifications have
completed.</p>

<p>The options that operate on the names of files or
archive members (-c, -i, -n, -s, -u, -v, -D, -G, -T, -U, -Y,
and -Z) interact as follows.</p>

<p>When extracting files during a read operation, archive
members are selected , based only on the user specified
pattern operands as modified by the -c, -n, -u, -D, -G, -T,
-U options. Then any -s and -i options will modify in that
order, the names of these selected files. Then the -Y and -Z
options will be applied based on the final pathname.
Finally, the -v option will write the names resulting from
these modifications.</p>

<p>When archiving files during a write operation, or
copying files during a copy operation, archive members are
selected, based only on the user specified pathnames as
modified by the -n, -u, -D, -G, -T, and -U options (the -D
option only applies during a copy operation). Then any -s
and -i options will modify in that order, the names of these
selected files. Then during a copy operation the -Y and the
-Z options will be applied based on the final pathname.
Finally, the -v option will write the names resulting from
these modifications.</p>

<p>When one or both of the -u or -D options are specified
along with the -n option, a file is not considered selected
unless it is newer than the file to which it is
compared.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT TMPDIR Path in which to store temporary
files.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES $ pax -w -f /dev/rst0 .</p>

<p>Copies the contents of the current directory to the
device /dev/rst0.</p>

<p>$ pax -v -f filename</p>

<p>Gives the verbose table of contents for an archive
stored in filename.</p>

<p>$ mkdir newdir; cd olddir; pax -rw . newdir</p>

<p>This sequence of commands will copy the entire olddir
directory hierarchy to newdir.</p>

<p>$ pax -r -s ,^//*usr//*,, -f a.pax</p>

<p>Reads the archive a.pax, with all files rooted in /usr
into the archive extracted relative to the current
directory.</p>

<p>$ pax -rw -i . dest_dir</p>

<p>Can be used to interactively select the files to copy
from the current directory to dest_dir.</p>

<p>$ pax -r -pe -U root -G bin -f a.pax</p>

<p>Extract all files from the archive a.pax which are owned
by root with group bin and preserve all file
permissions.</p>

<p>$ pax -r -w -v -Y -Z home /backup</p>

<p>Update (and list) only those files in the destination
directory /backup which are older (less recent inode change
or file modification times) than files with the same name
found in the source file tree home.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS pax will exit with one of the following
values:</p>

<p>0 All files were processed successfully.</p>

<p>1 An error occurred.</p>

<p>Whenever pax cannot create a file or a link when reading
an archive or cannot find a file when writing an archive, or
cannot preserve the user ID, group ID, or file mode when the
-p option is specified, a diagnostic message is written to
standard error and a non-zero exit status will be returned,
but processing will continue. In the case where pax cannot
create a link to a file, pax will not create a second copy
of the file.</p>

<p>If the extraction of a file from an archive is
prematurely terminated by a signal or error, pax may have
only partially extracted a file the user wanted.
Additionally, the file modes of extracted files and
directories may have incorrect file bits, and the
modification and access times may be wrong.</p>

<p>If the creation of an archive is prematurely terminated
by a signal or error, pax may have only partially created
the archive which may violate the specific archive format
specification.</p>

<p>If while doing a copy, pax detects a file is about to
overwrite itself, the file is not copied, a diagnostic
message is written to standard error and when pax completes
it will exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>
