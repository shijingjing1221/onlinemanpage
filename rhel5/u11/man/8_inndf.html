<p>INNDF(8) InterNetNews Documentation INNDF(8)</p>

<p>NAME inndf - Report free disk, inodes, and overview
information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS inndf [-Fhi] [-f filename] directory [directory
...]</p>

<p>inndf -n</p>

<p>inndf -o</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION inndf was originally a replacement for
&quot;df awk&quot; in innwatch.ctl(5) and innstat(8), and
now also reports various other usage information about INN s
storage that df(1) doesnt understand. inndf doesnt sync,
forks less, and is generally less complicated than
df(1).</p>

<p>Its default behavior is to report free kilobytes (not
disk blocks), or free inodes if -i is used, in the file
systems holding the directories given on the command line.
(A kilobyte in this case is 1024 bytes.) If only one
directory is given, the output will be a simple number; if
more than one directory is given, the output will be
formatted for human readability.</p>

<p>If enableoverview is set to true in inn.conf, inndf can
also be used to get information about the overview database.
With the -n option, it reports a count of the total number
of overview records stored. With -o, it reports the
percentage of space used in the overview database (for those
overview methods where this is meaningful data).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f filename filename should contain a list of
directories to use in addition to those given by the
arguments, one per line. Blank lines and any- thing after
&quot;#&quot; on any line are ignored.</p>

<p>-F Like -f execpt that the filename is
pathetc/filesystems and it is not an error if this file
doesnt exist. (This option is used pri- marily by such
things as innstat(8), so that the news administrator can add
additional file systems to check to pathetc/filesystems
without having to modify the script.)</p>

<p>-h Print a usage message and exit.</p>

<p>-i Report the number of free inodes rather than the
amount of free disk space.</p>

<p>-n Report the total number of records in the overview
database. Note that crossposted articles will have one
overview record for each newsgroup theyre posted to.</p>

<p>-o Report the percentage usage of the overview database
space. This is only meaningful for overview methods that
pre-allocate a certain amount of space rather than grow to
accomodate more records. Cur- rently, this flag is only
useful for the buffindexed overview method.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Print the free kilobytes in /news/spool as a
simple number:</p>

<p>inndf /news/spool</p>

<p>Report the free inodes in /usr/local/news and
/news/spool in a format designed for human readability:</p>

<p>inndf -i /usr/local/news /news/spool</p>

<p>The same, but also add in all file systems in
pathetc/filesystems:</p>

<p>inndf -i -F /usr/local/news /news/spool</p>

<p>Print out the number of overview records and the
percentage space used by a buffindexed overview
database:</p>

<p>inndf -no</p>
