<p>EMACS(1) EMACS(1)</p>

<p>NAME emacs - GNU project Emacs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS emacs [ command-line switches ] [ files ...
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION GNU Emacs is a version of Emacs, written by
the author of the original (PDP-10) Emacs, Richard Stallman.
The primary documentation of GNU Emacs is in the GNU Emacs
Manual, which you can read on line using Info, a subsystem
of Emacs. Please look there for complete and up-to-date
documentation. This man page is updated only when someone
volunteers to do so; the Emacs maintainers priority goal is
to minimize the amount of time this man page takes away from
other more useful projects. The user functionality of GNU
Emacs encompasses everything other Emacs editors do, and it
is easily extensible since its editing commands are written
in Lisp.</p>

<p>Emacs has an extensive interactive help facility, but
the facility assumes that you know how to manipulate Emacs
windows and buffers. CTRL-h (backspace or CTRL-h) enters the
Help facility. Help Tutorial (CTRL-h t) requests an
interactive tutorial which can teach beginners the
fundamentals of Emacs in a few minutes. Help Apropos (CTRL-h
a) helps you find a command given its functionality, Help
Character (CTRL- h c) describes a given character s effect,
and Help Function (CTRL-h f) describes a given Lisp function
specified by name.</p>

<p>Emacss Undo can undo several steps of modification to
your buffers, so it is easy to recover from editing
mistakes.</p>

<p>GNU Emacss many special packages handle mail reading
(RMail) and send- ing (Mail), outline editing (Outline),
compiling (Compile), running subshells within Emacs windows
(Shell), running a Lisp read-eval-print loop
(Lisp-Interaction-Mode), and automated psychotherapy
(Doctor).</p>

<p>There is an extensive reference manual, but users of
other Emacses should have little trouble adapting even
without a copy. Users new to Emacs will be able to use basic
features fairly rapidly by studying the tutorial and using
the self-documentation features.</p>

<p>Emacs Options</p>

<p>The following options are of general interest:</p>

<p>file Edit file.</p>

<p>+number Go to the line specified by number (do not
insert a space between the &quot;+&quot; sign and the
number).</p>

<p>-q Do not load an init file.</p>

<p>-u user Load users init file.</p>

<p>-t file Use specified file as the terminal instead of
using stdin/std- out. This must be the first argument
specified in the command line.</p>

<p>The following options are lisp-oriented (these options
are processed in the order encountered):</p>

<p>-f function Execute the lisp function function.</p>

<p>-l file Load the lisp code in the file file.</p>

<p>The following options are useful when running Emacs as a
batch editor:</p>

<p>-batch Edit in batch mode. The editor will send messages
to stderr. This option must be the first in the argument
list. You must use -l and -f options to specify files to
execute and functions to call.</p>

<p>-kill Exit Emacs while in batch mode.</p>

<p>Using Emacs with X</p>

<p>Emacs has been tailored to work well with the X window
system. If you run Emacs from under X windows, it will
create its own X window to dis- play in. You will probably
want to start the editor as a background process so that you
can continue using your original window.</p>

<p>Emacs can be started with the following X switches:</p>

<p>-name name Specifies the name which should be assigned
to the initial Emacs window. This controls looking up X
resources as well as the window title.</p>

<p>-title name Specifies the title for the initial X
window.</p>

<p>-r Display the Emacs window in reverse video.</p>

<p>-i Use the &quot;kitchen sink&quot; bitmap icon when
iconifying the Emacs window.</p>

<p>-font font, -fn font Set the Emacs windows font to that
specified by font. You will find the various X fonts in the
/usr/lib/X11/fonts direc- tory. Note that Emacs will only
accept fixed width fonts. Under the X11 Release 4
font-naming conventions, any font with the value
&quot;m&quot; or &quot;c&quot; in the eleventh field of the
font name is a fixed width font. Furthermore, fonts whose
name are of the form widthxheight are generally fixed width,
as is the font fixed. See xlsfonts(1) for more
information.</p>

<p>When you specify a font, be sure to put a space between
the switch and the font name.</p>

<p>-bw pixels Set the Emacs windows border width to the
number of pixels specified by pixels. Defaults to one pixel
on each side of the window.</p>

<p>-ib pixels Set the window s internal border width to the
number of pixels specified by pixels. Defaults to one pixel
of padding on each side of the window.</p>

<p>-geometry geometry Set the Emacs windows width, height,
and position as speci- fied. The geometry specification is
in the standard X format; see X(1) for more information. The
width and height are speci- fied in characters; the default
is 80 by 24.</p>

<p>-fg color On color displays, sets the color of the
text.</p>

<p>See the file /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt for a list of valid
color names.</p>

<p>-bg color On color displays, sets the color of the
window s background.</p>

<p>-bd color On color displays, sets the color of the
windows border.</p>

<p>-cr color On color displays, sets the color of the
window s text cursor.</p>

<p>-ms color On color displays, sets the color of the
windows mouse cursor.</p>

<p>-d displayname, -display displayname Create the Emacs
window on the display specified by display- name. Must be
the first option specified in the command line.</p>

<p>-nw Tells Emacs not to use its special interface to X.
If you use this switch when invoking Emacs from an xterm(1)
window, dis- play is done in that window. This must be the
first option specified in the command line.</p>

<p>You can set X default values for your Emacs windows in
your .Xresources file (see xrdb(1)). Use the following
format:</p>

<p>emacs.keyword:value</p>

<p>where value specifies the default value of keyword.
Emacs lets you set default values for the following
keywords:</p>

<p>font (class Font) Sets the windows text font.</p>

<p>reverseVideo (class ReverseVideo) If reverseVideos value
is set to on, the window will be dis- played in reverse
video.</p>

<p>bitmapIcon (class BitmapIcon) If bitmapIcons value is
set to on, the window will iconify into the &quot;kitchen
sink.&quot;</p>

<p>borderWidth (class BorderWidth) Sets the windows border
width in pixels.</p>

<p>internalBorder (class BorderWidth) Sets the windows
internal border width in pixels.</p>

<p>foreground (class Foreground) For color displays, sets
the windows text color.</p>

<p>background (class Background) For color displays, sets
the window s background color.</p>

<p>borderColor (class BorderColor) For color displays, sets
the color of the windows border.</p>

<p>cursorColor (class Foreground) For color displays, sets
the color of the window s text cursor.</p>

<p>pointerColor (class Foreground) For color displays, sets
the color of the windows mouse cur- sor.</p>

<p>geometry (class Geometry) Sets the geometry of the Emacs
window (as described above).</p>

<p>title (class Title) Sets the title of the Emacs
window.</p>

<p>iconName (class Title) Sets the icon name for the Emacs
window icon.</p>

<p>If you try to set color values while using a black and
white display, the windows characteristics will default as
follows: the foreground color will be set to black, the
background color will be set to white, the border color will
be set to grey, and the text and mouse cursors will be set
to black.</p>

<p>Using the Mouse</p>

<p>The following lists the mouse button bindings for the
Emacs window under X11.</p>

<p>MOUSE BUTTON FUNCTION left Set point. middle Paste text.
right Cut text into X cut buffer. SHIFT-middle Cut text into
X cut buffer. SHIFT-right Paste text. CTRL-middle Cut text
into X cut buffer and kill it. CTRL-right Select this
window, then split it into two win- dows. Same as typing
CTRL-x 2. CTRL-SHIFT-left X buffer menu--hold the buttons
and keys down, wait for menu to appear, select buffer, and
release. Move mouse out of menu and release to cancel.
CTRL-SHIFT-middle X help menu--pop up index card menu for
Emacs help. CTRL-SHIFT-right Select window with mouse, and
delete all other windows. Same as typing CTRL-x 1.</p>

<p>MANUALS You can order printed copies of the GNU Emacs
Manual from the Free Software Foundation, which develops GNU
software. See the file ORDERS for ordering information. Your
local Emacs maintainer might also have copies available. As
with all software and publications from FSF, everyone is
permitted to make and distribute copies of the Emacs manual.
The TeX source to the man- ual is also included in the Emacs
source distribution.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/local/info - files for the Info documentation
browser (a subsystem of Emacs) to refer to. Currently not
much of Unix is documented here, but the complete text of
the Emacs reference manual is included in a convenient tree
structured form.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/src - C source files and
object files</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/lisp - Lisp source files
and compiled files that define most editing commands. Some
are preloaded; others are autoloaded from this directory
when used.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc - various programs
that are used with GNU Emacs, and some files of
information.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/DOC.* - contains the
documentation strings for the Lisp primitives and preloaded
Lisp functions of GNU Emacs. They are stored here to reduce
the size of Emacs proper.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/OTHER.EMACSES
discusses GNU Emacs vs. other versions of Emacs.
/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/SERVICE lists people
offering vari- ous services to assist users of GNU Emacs,
including education, trou- bleshooting, porting and
customization. These files also have information useful to
anyone wishing to write programs in the Emacs Lisp extension
language, which has not yet been fully documented.</p>

<p>/usr/local/com/emacs/lock - holds lock files that are
made for all files being modified in Emacs, to prevent
simultaneous modification of one file by two users.</p>

<p>/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt - list of valid X color names.</p>

<p>BUGS There is a mailing list,
bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu on the internet
(ucbvax!prep.ai.mit.edu!bug-gnu-emacs on UUCPnet), for
reporting Emacs bugs and fixes. But before reporting
something as a bug, please try to be sure that it really is
a bug, not a misunderstanding or a deliberate feature. We
ask you to read the section Reporting Emacs Bugs near the
end of the reference manual (or Info system) for hints on
how and when to report bugs. Also, include the version
number of the Emacs you are running in every bug report that
you send in.</p>

<p>Do not expect a personal answer to a bug report. The
purpose of reporting bugs is to get them fixed for everyone
in the next release, if possible. For personal assistance,
look in the SERVICE file (see above) for a list of people
who offer it.</p>

<p>Please do not send anything but bug reports to this
mailing list. Send requests to be added to mailing lists to
the special list info-gnu- emacs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu (or
the corresponding UUCP address). For more information about
Emacs mailing lists, see the file
/usr/local/emacs/etc/MAILINGLISTS. Bugs tend actually to be
fixed if they can be isolated, so it is in your interest to
report them in such a way that they can be easily
reproduced.</p>

<p>Bugs that I know about are: shell will not work with
programs running in Raw mode on some Unix versions.</p>

<p>UNRESTRICTIONS Emacs is free; anyone may redistribute
copies of Emacs to anyone under the terms stated in the
Emacs General Public License, a copy of which accompanies
each copy of Emacs and which also appears in the reference
manual.</p>

<p>Copies of Emacs may sometimes be received packaged with
distributions of Unix systems, but it is never included in
the scope of any license covering those systems. Such
inclusion violates the terms on which distribution is
permitted. In fact, the primary purpose of the General
Public License is to prohibit anyone from attaching any
other restric- tions to redistribution of Emacs.</p>

<p>Richard Stallman encourages you to improve and extend
Emacs, and urges that you contribute your extensions to the
GNU library. Eventually GNU (Gnus Not Unix) will be a
complete replacement for Berkeley Unix. Everyone will be
free to use, copy, study and change the GNU system.</p>
