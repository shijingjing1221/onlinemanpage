<p>NAME newusers - update and create new users in batch</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS newusers [new_users]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION newusers reads a file of user name and
clear-text password pairs and uses this information to
update a group of existing users or to create new users.
Each line is in the same format as the standard password
file (see passwd(5)) with the following exceptions:</p>

<p>pw_passwd This field will be encrypted and used as the
new value of the encrypted password.</p>

<p>pw_age This field will be ignored for shadow passwords
if the user already exists.</p>

<p>pw_gid This field may be the name of an existing group,
in which case the named user will be added as a member. If a
non-existent numerical group is given, a new group will be
created having this number.</p>

<p>pw_dir This field will be checked for existence as a
directory and a new directory with the same name will be
created if it does not already exist. The ownership of the
directory will be set to be that of the user being created
or updated. Note that newusers does not create parent
directories of the new users home directory. The newusers
command will fail to create the home directory if the parent
directories do not exist, and will send a message to stderr
informing the user of the failure. The newusers command will
not halt or return a failure to the calling shell if it
fails to create the home directory, it will continue to
process the batch of new users specified.</p>

<p>This command is intended to be used in a large system
environment where many accounts are updated at a single
time.</p>

<p>CAVEATS The input file must be protected since it
contains unencrypted passwords.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/login.defs Shadow password suite
configuration.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO login.defs(5), passwd(1), useradd(8).</p>
