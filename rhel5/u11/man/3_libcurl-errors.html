<p>NAME libcurl-errors - error codes in libcurl</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This man page includes most, if not all,
available error codes in libcurl. Why they occur and
possibly what you can do to fix the prob- lem.</p>

<p>CURLcode Almost all &quot;easy&quot; interface functions
return a CURLcode error code. No matter what, using the
curl_easy_setopt(3) option CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER is a good
idea as it will give you a human readable error string that
may offer more details about the error cause than just the
error code does. curl_easy_strerror(3) can be called to get
an error string from a given CURLcode number.</p>

<p>CURLcode is one of the following:</p>

<p>CURLE_OK (0) All fine. Proceed as usual.</p>

<p>CURLE_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL (1) The URL you passed to
libcurl used a protocol that this libcurl does not support.
The support might be a compile-time option that you didnt
use, it can be a misspelled protocol string or just a
protocol libcurl has no code for.</p>

<p>CURLE_FAILED_INIT (2) Very early initialization code
failed. This is likely to be an internal error or
problem.</p>

<p>CURLE_URL_MALFORMAT (3) The URL was not properly
formatted.</p>

<p>CURLE_URL_MALFORMAT_USER (4) This is never returned by
current libcurl.</p>

<p>CURLE_COULDNT_RESOLVE_PROXY (5) Couldn t resolve proxy.
The given proxy host could not be resolved.</p>

<p>CURLE_COULDNT_RESOLVE_HOST (6) Couldnt resolve host. The
given remote host was not resolved.</p>

<p>CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT (7) Failed to connect() to host or
proxy.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_SERVER_REPLY (8) After connecting to an
FTP server, libcurl expects to get a cer- tain reply back.
This error code implies that it got a strange or bad reply.
The given remote server is probably not an OK FTP
server.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_ACCESS_DENIED (9) We were denied access when
trying to login to an FTP server or when trying to change
working directory to the one given in the URL.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_USER_PASSWORD_INCORRECT (10) This is never
returned by current libcurl.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_PASS_REPLY (11) After having sent the
FTP password to the server, libcurl expects a proper reply.
This error code indicates that an unexpected code was
returned.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_USER_REPLY (12) After having sent user
name to the FTP server, libcurl expects a proper reply. This
error code indicates that an unexpected code was
returned.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_PASV_REPLY (13) libcurl failed to get a
sensible result back from the server as a response to either
a PASV or a EPSV command. The server is flawed.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_227_FORMAT (14) FTP servers return a
227-line as a response to a PASV command. If libcurl fails
to parse that line, this return code is passed back.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_CANT_GET_HOST (15) An internal failure to
lookup the host used for the new connec- tion.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_CANT_RECONNECT (16) A bad return code on
either PASV or EPSV was sent by the FTP server, preventing
libcurl from being able to continue.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_SET_BINARY (17) Received an error when
trying to set the transfer mode to binary.</p>

<p>CURLE_PARTIAL_FILE (18) A file transfer was shorter or
larger than expected. This hap- pens when the server first
reports an expected transfer size, and then delivers data
that doesn t match the previously given size.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_RETR_FILE (19) This was either a weird
reply to a RETR command or a zero byte transfer
complete.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_WRITE_ERROR (20) After a completed file
transfer, the FTP server did not respond a proper</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_QUOTE_ERROR (21) When sending custom
&quot;QUOTE&quot; commands to the remote server, one of the
commands returned an error code that was 400 or higher.</p>

<p>CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR (22) This is returned if
CURLOPT_FAILONERROR is set TRUE and the HTTP server returns
an error code that is &gt;= 400.</p>

<p>CURLE_WRITE_ERROR (23) An error occurred when writing
received data to a local file, or an error was returned to
libcurl from a write callback.</p>

<p>CURLE_MALFORMAT_USER (24) This is never returned by
current libcurl.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_STOR_FILE (25) FTP couldnt STOR file.
The server denied the STOR operation. The error buffer
usually contains the servers explanation to this.</p>

<p>CURLE_READ_ERROR (26) There was a problem reading a
local file or an error returned by the read callback.</p>

<p>CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY (27) Out of memory. A memory
allocation request failed. This is seri- ous badness and
things are severely screwed up if this ever occur.</p>

<p>CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEOUTED (28) Operation timeout. The
specified time-out period was reached according to the
conditions.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_SET_ASCII (29) libcurl failed to set
ASCII transfer type (TYPE A).</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_PORT_FAILED (30) The FTP PORT command returned
error. This mostly happen when you havent specified a good
enough address for libcurl to use. See CURLOPT_FTPPORT.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_USE_REST (31) The FTP REST command
returned error. This should never happen if the server is
sane.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_GET_SIZE (32) The FTP SIZE command
returned error. SIZE is not a kosher FTP command, it is an
extension and not all servers support it. This is not a
surprising error.</p>

<p>CURLE_HTTP_RANGE_ERROR (33) The HTTP server does not
support or accept range requests.</p>

<p>CURLE_HTTP_POST_ERROR (34) This is an odd error that
mainly occurs due to internal confu- sion.</p>

<p>CURLE_SSL_CONNECT_ERROR (35) A problem occurred
somewhere in the SSL/TLS handshake. You really want the
error buffer and read the message there as it pinpoints the
problem slightly more. Could be certificates (file formats,
paths, permissions), passwords, and others.</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_BAD_DOWNLOAD_RESUME (36) Attempting FTP resume
beyond file size.</p>

<p>CURLE_FILE_COULDNT_READ_FILE (37) A file given with
FILE:// couldnt be opened. Most likely because the file path
doesnt identify an existing file. Did you check file
permissions?</p>

<p>CURLE_LDAP_CANNOT_BIND (38) LDAP cannot bind. LDAP bind
operation failed.</p>

<p>CURLE_LDAP_SEARCH_FAILED (39) LDAP search failed.</p>

<p>CURLE_LIBRARY_NOT_FOUND (40) Library not found. The LDAP
library was not found.</p>

<p>CURLE_FUNCTION_NOT_FOUND (41) Function not found. A
required LDAP function was not found.</p>

<p>CURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK (42) Aborted by callback. A
callback returned &quot;abort&quot; to libcurl.</p>

<p>CURLE_BAD_FUNCTION_ARGUMENT (43) Internal error. A
function was called with a bad parameter.</p>

<p>CURLE_BAD_CALLING_ORDER (44) This is never returned by
current libcurl.</p>

<p>CURLE_HTTP_PORT_FAILED (45) Interface error. A specified
outgoing interface could not be used. Set which interface to
use for outgoing connections source IP address with
CURLOPT_INTERFACE.</p>

<p>CURLE_BAD_PASSWORD_ENTERED (46) This is never returned
by current libcurl.</p>

<p>CURLE_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS (47) Too many redirects. When
following redirects, libcurl hit the maximum amount. Set
your limit with CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS.</p>

<p>CURLE_UNKNOWN_TELNET_OPTION (48) An option set with
CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS was not recog- nized/known. Refer to
the appropriate documentation.</p>

<p>CURLE_TELNET_OPTION_SYNTAX (49) A telnet option string
was Illegally formatted.</p>

<p>CURLE_OBSOLETE (50) This is not an error. This used to
be another error code in an old libcurl version and is
currently unused.</p>

<p>CURLE_SSL_PEER_CERTIFICATE (51) The remote servers SSL
certificate was deemed not OK.</p>

<p>CURLE_GOT_NOTHING (52) Nothing was returned from the
server, and under the circum- stances, getting nothing is
considered an error.</p>

engine wasnt found.</p>

<p>CURLE_SSL_ENGINE_SETFAILED (54) Failed setting the
selected SSL crypto engine as default!</p>

encoding</p>

<p>CURLE_FILESIZE_EXCEEDED (63) Maximum file size
exceeded</p>

<p>CURLE_FTP_SSL_FAILED (64) Requested FTP SSL level
failed</p>

<p>CURLE_SEND_FAIL_REWIND (65) When doing a send operation
curl had to rewind the data to retransmit, but the rewinding
operation failed</p>

<p>CURLE_SSL_ENGINE_INITFAILED (66) Initiating the SSL

<p>CURLMcode This is the generic return code used by
functions in the libcurl multi interface. Also consider
curl_multi_strerror(3).</p>

<p>CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM (-1) This is not really an
error. It means you should call curl_multi_perform(3) again
without doing select() or similar in between.</p>

<p>CURLM_OK (0) Things are fine.</p>

<p>CURLM_BAD_HANDLE (1) The passed-in handle is not a valid
