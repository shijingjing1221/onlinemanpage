<p>NAME grpck - verify integrity of group files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS grpck [-r] [group shadow]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION grpck verifies the integrity of the system
authentication information. All entries in the /etc/group
and /etc/gshadow are checked to see that the entry has the
proper format and valid data in each field. The user is
prompted to delete entries that are improperly formatted or
which have other uncorrectable errors.</p>

<p>Checks are made to verify that each entry has:</p>

<p>&middot; the correct number of fields</p>

<p>&middot; a unique group name</p>

<p>&middot; a valid list of members and administrators</p>

<p>The checks for correct number of fields and unique group
name are fatal. If the entry has the wrong number of fields,
the user will be prompted to delete the entire line. If the
user does not answer affirmatively, all further checks are
bypassed. An entry with a duplicated group name is prompted
for deletion, but the remaining checks will still be made.
All other errors are warnings and the user is encouraged to
run the groupmod command to correct the error.</p>

<p>The commands which operate on the /etc/group file are
not able to alter corrupted or duplicated entries. grpck
should be used in those circumstances to remove the
offending entry.</p>

<p>OPTIONS By default, grpck operates on the files
/etc/group and /etc/gshadow. The user may select alternate
files with the group and shadow parameters. Additionally,
the user may execute the command in read-only mode by
specifying the -r flag. This causes all questions regarding
changes to be answered no without user intervention. grpck
can also sort entries in /etc/group and /etc/gshadow by GID.
To run it in sort mode pass it -s flag. No checks are
performed then, it just sorts.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/gshadow Secure group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/passwd User account information.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO group(5), passwd(5), shadow(5),
groupmod(8).</p>

<p>EXIT VALUES The grpck command exits with the following
values:</p>

<p>0 success</p>

<p>1 invalid command syntax</p>

<p>2 one or more bad group entries</p>

<p>3 cant open group files</p>

<p>4 cant lock group files</p>

<p>5 cant update group files</p>
