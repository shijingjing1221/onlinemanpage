<p>NAME cmp - compare two files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cmp [-l | -s] file1 file2 [skip1 [skip2]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The cmp utility compares two files of any
type and writes the results to the standard output. By
default, cmp is silent if the files are the same; if they
differ, the byte and line number at which the first differ-
ence occurred is reported.</p>

<p>Bytes and lines are numbered beginning with one.</p>

<p>The following options are available:</p>

<p>-l Print the byte number (decimal) and the differing
byte values (octal) for each difference.</p>

<p>-s Print nothing for differing files; return exit status
only.</p>

<p>The optional arguments skip1 and skip2 are the byte
offsets from the beginning of file1 and file2, respectively,
where the comparison will begin. The offset is decimal by
default, but may be expressed as an hex- adecimal or octal
value by preceding it with a leading 0x or 0.</p>

<p>The cmp utility exits with one of the following
values:</p>

<p>0 The files are identical.</p>

<p>1 The files are different; this includes the case where
one file is identical to the first part of the other. In the
latter case, if the -s option has not been specified, cmp
writes to standard output that EOF was reached in the
shorter file (before any differences were found).</p>

<p>&gt;1 An error occurred.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO diff(1), diff3(1)</p>

<p>STANDARDS The cmp utility is expected to be IEEE Std
1003.2 (POSIX.2) compatible.</p>
