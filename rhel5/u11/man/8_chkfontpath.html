<p>CHKFONTPATH(8) Red Hat, Inc. CHKFONTPATH(8)</p>

<p>NAME chkfontpath - simple interface for adding,
removing, and listing direc- tories in the X font servers
path</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS chkfontpath [-lqfh] [-a name of directory to
add] [-r name of directory to remove]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION chkfontpath provides a simple method of
configuring the directories contained in the X font servers
path. As of Red Hat 6.0, all fonts in X are served via this
separate font server process, not through the main X server
process. This speeds up font rendering, and also allows use
of font servers which are not running on the local host.</p>

<p>chkfontpath is mainly used by rpm in its %post and
%postun sections to add and remove new directories to the
servers config file at installa- tion and de-installation
time of packages containing fonts.</p>

<p>-a, --add=name of directory to add Add a directory to
the font path.</p>

<p>-r, --remove=name of directory to remove Remove a
directory from the font path.</p>

<p>-l, --list List all directories in the font path.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Quiet operation; dont display any output to
the screen, even when there is an error during
operation.</p>

<p>-f, --first Requires usage of the add command; puts the
specified directory first in the font path, rather than
last.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show detailed help on the command line.</p>

<p>When directories are added to the path, some sanity
checking is per- formed to make sure you are not adding a
directory without the file fonts.dir contained in it, which
the server needs to be able to render fonts properly. When a
path is succesfully added or removed, the xfs process is
restarted if it is currently running.</p>

<p>RETURN CODES chkfontpath returns 0 on success, or 1 on
error.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/X11/fs/config Configuration file for the X
font server (xfs).</p>
