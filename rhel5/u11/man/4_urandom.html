<p>RANDOM(4) Linux Programmer s Manual RANDOM(4)</p>

<p>NAME random, urandom - kernel random number source
devices</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The character special files /dev/random and
/dev/urandom (present since Linux 1.3.30) provide an
interface to the kernels random number gener- ator. File
/dev/random has major device number 1 and minor device num-
ber 8. File /dev/urandom has major device number 1 and minor
device number 9.</p>

<p>The random number generator gathers environmental noise
from device drivers and other sources into an entropy pool.
The generator also keeps an estimate of the number of bits
of noise in the entropy pool. From this entropy pool random
numbers are created.</p>

<p>When read, the /dev/random device will only return
random bytes within the estimated number of bits of noise in
the entropy pool. /dev/random should be suitable for uses
that need very high quality randomness such as one-time pad
or key generation. When the entropy pool is empty, reads
from /dev/random will block until additional environmental
noise is gathered.</p>

<p>A read from the /dev/urandom device will not block
waiting for more entropy. As a result, if there is not
sufficient entropy in the entropy pool, the returned values
are theoretically vulnerable to a cryptographic attack on
the algorithms used by the driver. Knowledge of how to do
this is not available in the current non-classified liter-
ature, but it is theoretically possible that such an attack
may exist. If this is a concern in your application, use
/dev/random instead.</p>

<p>CONFIGURING If your system does not have /dev/random and
/dev/urandom created already, they can be created with the
following commands:</p>

<p>mknod -m 644 /dev/random c 1 8 mknod -m 644 /dev/urandom
c 1 9 chown root:root /dev/random /dev/urandom</p>

<p>When a Linux system starts up without much operator
interaction, the entropy pool may be in a fairly predictable
state. This reduces the actual amount of noise in the
entropy pool below the estimate. In order to counteract this
effect, it helps to carry entropy pool infor- mation across
shut-downs and start-ups. To do this, add the following
lines to an appropriate script which is run during the Linux
system start-up sequence:</p>

<p>echo &quot;Initializing random number generator...&quot;
random_seed=/var/run/random-seed # Carry a random seed from
start-up to start-up # Load and then save the whole entropy
pool if [ -f $random_seed ]; then cat $random_seed
&gt;/dev/urandom else touch $random_seed fi chmod 600
$random_seed poolfile=/proc/sys/kernel/random/poolsize [ -r
$poolfile ] &amp;&amp; bytes=cat $poolfile || bytes=512 dd
if=/dev/urandom of=$random_seed count=1 bs=$bytes</p>

<p>Also, add the following lines in an appropriate script
which is run during the Linux system shutdown:</p>

<p># Carry a random seed from shut-down to start-up # Save
the whole entropy pool echo &quot;Saving random
seed...&quot; random_seed=/var/run/random-seed touch
$random_seed chmod 600 $random_seed
poolfile=/proc/sys/kernel/random/poolsize [ -r $poolfile ]
&amp;&amp; bytes=cat $poolfile || bytes=512 dd
if=/dev/urandom of=$random_seed count=1 bs=$bytes</p>

<p>PROC INTERFACE The files in the directory
/proc/sys/kernel/random (present since 2.3.16) provide an
additional interface to the /dev/random device.</p>

<p>The read-only file entropy_avail gives the available
entropy. Normally, this will be 4096 (bits), a full entropy
pool.</p>

<p>The file poolsize gives the size of the entropy pool.
Normally, this will be 512 (bytes). It can be changed to any
value for which an algo- rithm is available. Currently the
choices are 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048.</p>

<p>The file read_wakeup_threshold contains the number of
bits of entropy required for waking up processes that sleep
waiting for entropy from /dev/random. The default is 64. The
file write_wakeup_threshold con- tains the number of bits of
entropy below which we wake up processes that do a select()
or poll() for write access to /dev/random. These values can
be changed by writing to the files.</p>

<p>The read-only files uuid and boot_id contain random
strings like 6fd5a44b-35f4-4ad4-a9b9-6b9be13e1fe9. The
former is generated afresh for each read, the latter was
generated once.</p>
