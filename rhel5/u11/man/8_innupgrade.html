<p>NAME innupgrade - Upgrade INN configuration files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS innupgrade directory</p>

<p>innupgrade [-t type] -f file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION innupgrade is intended to be run during a
major upgrade of INN to fix the configuration files with any
required changes. If given a direc- tory, it will scan that
directory for any files that it has updates defined for, try
to perform those updates, and replace the files with updated
versions if applying the updates resulted in any changes.
The old versions of the files will be saved with a
&quot;.OLD&quot; extension.</p>

<p>If the -f flag is used, only that file will be updated.
If the file name doesn t match the standard file name of an
INN configuration file, the optional -t flag may be given to
specify the type. See &quot;EXAMPLES&quot; for an example of
this.</p>

<p>Currently, innupgrade knows how to apply the following
updates:</p>

<p>&middot; inn.conf: Quote values with whitespace and
comment out keys with no values, required for the change in
configuration parsers introduced in INN 2.4. The new format
is not backward compatible with the pre- vious parser, since
the previous parser will include the double- quotes in the
value of the parameter.</p>

<p>Normally, innupgrade should be run on the pathetc
directory after any upgrade of INN other than a patch
release (any upgrade that changes the first or second
version numbers). This may occur automatically during the
upgrade process.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f file Only act on file rather than working on
an entire directory.</p>

<p>-t type For a file specified with -f, parse it and
upgrade it as if it were named type. Used for upgrading
files with the same syntax as nor- mal INN configuration
files but with different names. Only makes sense in
combination with -f.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Upgrade any configuration files found in
/usr/local/news/etc:</p>

<p>innupgrade /usr/local/news/etc</p>

<p>Upgrade only /news/etc/inn.conf:</p>

<p>innupgrade -f /news/etc/inn.conf</p>

<p>Upgrade a file named inn-special.conf that should have
the same syntax as inn.conf:</p>

<p>innupgrade -t inn.conf -f inn-special.conf</p>

<p>Any upgrade rules that apply to inn.conf will be applied
to the alter- nate file.</p>
