<p>UMOUNT.CIFS(8) System Administration tools
UMOUNT.CIFS(8)</p>

<p>NAME umount.cifs - for normal, non-root users, to
unmount their own Common Internet File System (CIFS)
mounts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS umount.cifs {mount-point} [-nVvhfle]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p>umount.cifs unmounts a Linux CIFS filesystem. It can be
invoked indirectly by the umount(8) command when umount.cifs
is in /sbin directory, unless you specify the &quot;-i&quot;
option to umount. Specifying -i to umount avoids execution
of umount helpers such as umount.cifs. The umount.cifs
command only works in Linux, and the kernel must support the
cifs filesystem. The CIFS protocol is the successor to the
SMB protocol and is supported by most Windows servers and
many other commercial servers and Network Attached Storage
appliances as well as by the popular Open Source server
Samba.</p>

<p>The umount.cifs utility detaches the local directory
mount-point from the corresponding UNC name (exported
network resource) and frees the associated kernel resources.
It is possible to set the mode for umount.cifs to setuid
root (or equivalently update the /etc/permissions file) to
allow non-root users to umount shares to directories for
which they have write permission. The umount.cifs utility is
typically not needed if unmounts need only be performed by
root users, or if user mounts and unmounts can rely on
specifying explicit entries in /etc/fstab See</p>

<p>fstab(5)</p>

<p>OPTIONS --verbose print additional debugging
information</p>

<p>--no-mtab Do not update the mtab even if unmount
completes successfully (/proc/mounts will still display the
correct information)</p>

<p>NOTES This command is normally intended to be installed
setuid (since root users can already run unmount). An
alternative to using umount.cifs is to add specfic entries
for the user mounts that you wish a particular user or users
to mount and unmount to /etc/fstab</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The primary mechanism for making
configuration changes and for reading debug information for
the cifs vfs is via the Linux /proc filesystem. In the
directory /proc/fs/cifs are various configuration files and
pseudo files which can display debug information. For more
information see the kernel file fs/cifs/README.</p>

<p>BUGS At this time umount.cifs does not lock the mount
table using the same lock as the umount utility does, so do
not attempt to do multiple unmounts from different processes
(and in particular unmounts of a cifs mount and another type
of filesystem mount at the same time).</p>

<p>If the same mount point is mounted multiple times by
cifs, umount.cifs will remove all of the matching entries
from the mount table (although umount.cifs will actually
only unmount the last one), rather than only removing the
last matching entry in /etc/mtab. The pseudofile
/proc/mounts will display correct information though, and
the lack of an entry in /etc/mtab does not prevent
subsequent unmounts.</p>

<p>Note that the typical response to a bug report is a
suggestion to try the latest version first. So please try
doing that first, and always include which versions you use
of relevant software when reporting bugs (minimum:
umount.cifs (try umount.cifs -V), kernel (see /proc/version)
and server type you are trying to contact.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 1.34 of the
cifs vfs filesystem (roughly Linux kernel 2.6.12).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO Documentation/filesystems/cifs.txt and
fs/cifs/README in the linux kernel source tree may contain
additional options and information.</p>

<p>AUTHOR Steve French</p>

<p>The syntax was loosely based on the umount utility and
the manpage was loosely based on that of mount.cifs.8. The
man page was created by Steve French</p>

<p>The maintainer of the Linux cifs vfs and the userspace
tool umount.cifs is Steve French. The Linux CIFS Mailing
list is the preferred place to ask questions regarding these
programs.</p>
