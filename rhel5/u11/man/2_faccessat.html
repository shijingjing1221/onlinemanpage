<p>FACCESSAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual FACCESSAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME faccessat - change permissions of a file relative
to a directory file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int faccessat(int dirfd, const char *path, int mode, int
flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The faccessat() system call operates in
exactly the same way as access(2), except for the
differences described in this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in path is relative, then it is
interpreted rela- tive to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor dirfd (rather than relative to the current
working directory of the calling process, as is done by
access(2) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in path is relative and dirfd is
the special value AT_FDCWD, then path is interpreted
relative to the current work- ing directory of the calling
process (like access(2)).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in path is absolute, then dirfd is
ignored.</p>

<p>flags is constructed by ORing together zero or more of
the following values:</p>

<p>AT_EACCESS Perform access checks using the effective
user and group IDs. By default, faccessat() uses the
effective IDs (like access(2)).</p>

<p>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW If path is a symbolic link, do not
dereference it: instead return information about the link
itself.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, faccessat() returns 0. On
error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for access(2) can also
occur for facces- sat(). The following additional errors can
occur for faccessat():</p>

<p>EBADF dirfd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid flag specified in flags.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR path is a relative path and dirfd is a file
descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
faccessat().</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is non-standard but is
proposed for inclusion in a future revision of POSIX.1.</p>

<p>GLIBC NOTES The AT_EACCESS and AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW flags
are actually implemented within the glibc wrapper function
for faccessat(). If either of these flags are specified,
then the wrapper function employs fstatat(2) to determine
access permissions.</p>

<p>VERSIONS faccessat() was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16.</p>
