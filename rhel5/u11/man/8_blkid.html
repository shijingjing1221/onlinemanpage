<p>NAME blkid - command-line utility to locate/print block
device attributes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS blkid [ -ghlv ] [ [ -c cachefile ] -w
writecachefile ] [ -o format ] [ -s tag ] [ -t NAME=value ]
[ device ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The blkid program is the command-line
interface to working with libu- uid(3) library. It can
determine the type of content (e.g. filesystem, swap) a
block device holds, and also attributes (tokens, NAME=value
pairs) from the content metadata (e.g. LABEL or UUID
fields).</p>

<p>blkid has two main forms of operation: either searching
for a device with a specific NAME=value pair, or displaying
NAME=value pairs for one or more devices.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Read from cachefile instead of reading from
the default cache file /etc/blkid/blkid.tab. If you want to
start with a clean cache (i.e. dont report devices
previously scanned but not nec- essarily available at this
time), specify /dev/null.</p>

<p>-g Perform a garbage collection pass on the blkid cache
to remove devices which no longer exist.</p>

<p>-h Display a usage message and exit.</p>

<p>-l Look up the device that matches the search parameter
specified using the -t option, assuming that there is only
one matching the search parameter. For a system with a large
number of disks, this will be more efficient by avoiding the
need to revalidate devices unless absolutely necessary. If
this option is not specified, blkid will use a less
efficient approach, which allows blkid to print all of the
devices that match the search parameter.</p>

<p>This option is best used for tag searches such as
LABEL=data_vol or UUID=e280469a-d06f-4c0b-b068-44f3b576029e.
If you want blkid to print all of the ext3 filesystems using
a search parameter such as TYPE=ext3, then this option
should not be used.</p>

<p>-o Display blkids output using the specified format. The
format parameter may be full, (the default), value, (only
print the value of any tags printed by blkid) or device
(only print the device name).</p>

<p>-s Show only the tags for each (specified) device that
match tag. It is possible to specify multiple -s options. If
no tag is specified, then all tokens are shown for all
(specified) devices. In order to just refresh the cache
without showing any tokens use -s none with no other
options.</p>

<p>-t Search for block devices with tokens named NAME that
have the value value, and display any devices which are
found. Common values for NAME include TYPE, LABEL, and UUID.
If there are no devices specified on the command line, all
block devices will be searched; otherwise, only search the
devices specified by the user.</p>

<p>-v Display version number and exit.</p>

<p>-w &lt;writecachefile&gt; Write the device cache to
writecachefile instead of writing it to the default cache
file /etc/blkid/blkid.tab. If you dont want to save the
cache to the default file, specify /dev/null. If not
specified it will be the same file as that given by the -c
option.</p>

<p>&lt;device&gt; Display tokens from only the specified
device. It is possible to give multiple &lt;device&gt;
options on the command line. If none is given, all devices
which appear in /proc/partitions are shown, if they are
recognized.</p>

<p>RETURN CODE If the specified token was found, or if any
tags were shown from (spec- ified) devices 0 is returned. If
the specified token was not found, or no (specified) devices
could be identified, an exit code of 2 is returned. For
usage or other errors, an exit code of 4 is returned.</p>
