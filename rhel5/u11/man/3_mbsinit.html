<p>NAME mbsinit - test for initial shift state</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mbsinit(const mbstate_t *ps);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Character conversion between the multibyte
representation and the wide character representation uses
conversion state, of type mbstate_t. Conversion of a string
uses a finite-state machine; when it is inter- rupted after
the complete conversion of a number of characters, it may
need to save a state for processing the remaining
characters. Such a conversion state is needed for the sake
of encodings such as ISO-2022 and UTF-7.</p>

<p>The initial state is the state at the beginning of
conversion of a string. There are two kinds of state: The
one used by multibyte to wide character conversion
functions, such as mbsrtowcs(), and the one used by wide
character to multibyte conversion functions, such as wcsr-
tombs(), but they both fit in a mbstate_t, and they both
have the same representation for an initial state.</p>

<p>For 8-bit encodings, all states are equivalent to the
initial state. For multibyte encodings like UTF-8, EUC-*,
BIG5 or SJIS, the wide char- acter to multibyte conversion
functions never produce non-initial states, but the
multibyte to wide character conversion functions like
mbrtowc() do produce non-initial states when interrupted in
the middle of a character.</p>

<p>One possible way to create an mbstate_t in initial state
is to set it to zero: mbstate_t state;
memset(&amp;state,0,sizeof(mbstate_t)); On Linux, the
following works as well, but might generate compiler
warnings: mbstate_t state = { 0 };</p>

<p>The function mbsinit() tests whether *ps corresponds to
an initial state.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE mbsinit() returns non-zero if *ps is an
initial state, or if ps is a null pointer. Otherwise it
returns 0.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99</p>

<p>NOTES The behaviour of mbsinit() depends on the LC_CTYPE
category of the cur- rent locale.</p>
