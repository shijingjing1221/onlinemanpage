<p>SGMLPRE(1) SGMLPRE(1)</p>

<p>NAME sgmlpre - handle SGML conditionalization for
SGML-tools</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sgmlpre [options] ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents briefly the
sgmlpre commands. This manual page was written for the
Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program
does not have a manual page for sgmlpre.</p>

<p>sgmlpre is a program that handle SGML conditionalization
for SGML-tools</p>

<p>It is used by other programs in sgml-tools (v1), and
usually normal user does not need to use this program
directly by himself.</p>

<p>Following is quoted from the header in the source
code.</p>

<p>(Begin Quotes) sgmlpre -- handle SGML conditionalization
for SGML-tools by Eric S. Raymond &lt;esr@thyrsus.com&gt;, 3
Nov 1997</p>

<p>Filter SGML according to conditionalizing markup. Argu-
ment/value pairs from the command line are matched against
the attributes of &lt;#if&gt; and &lt;#unless&gt; tags.
Spans between &lt;#if&gt;/&lt;/#if&gt; are passed through
unaltered if there is no attribute mismatch; spans between
&lt;#unless&gt;&lt;/#unless&gt; are passed if there is at
least one attribute mismatch. An attribute mis- match
happens if an attribute occurs in both the command-line
arguments and the tag, but the values do not match. Value
matching is by string equality, except that &quot;|&quot; is
interpreted as an alternation character. Even if a span is
not passed through, its newlines are (this to avoid messing
up the line numbers in error messages).</p>

<p>This lexer requires flex. Limitations; attribute names
may only be 256 chars long, values may be only 16384
(YY_BUF_SIZE) char- acters long. Doesnt do checking that
only &lt;/if&gt; matches &lt;if&gt; and &lt;/unless&gt;
matches &lt;unless&gt; (that would need a stack and
introduce another limit).</p>

<p>(End Quotes)</p>

<p>OPTIONS The program does not support normal command line
options.</p>
