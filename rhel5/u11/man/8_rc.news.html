<p>NAME rc.news - Start or stop INN daemons</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rc.news [start stop]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rc.news can be used to start or stop innd
and supporting programs. It checks to make sure INN is not
already running, handles cases of unclean shutdown, finishes
up tasks which might have been interrupted by the preceeding
shutdown, emails certain boot-time warnings to news- master
(as set in inn.conf), and is generally safer and easier than
starting and stopping everything directly. It needs to be
run as the news user so that files in pathrun are created
with the right ownership (though this is less important for
&quot;rc.news stop&quot;), and therefore requires that
inndstart be setuid root, see inndstart(8) for discus-
sion.</p>

<p>Programs run and stopped by this script include:</p>

<p>&middot; Always: inndstart is run, and innd is
stopped.</p>

<p>&middot; If doinnwatch is true in inn.conf: innwatch is
started and stopped.</p>

<p>&middot; If docnfsstat is true in inn.conf: ovdb_init is
run; ovdb_server and ovdb_monitor are stopped.</p>

<p>&middot; If rc.news.local exists in pathbin:
rc.news.local is run with argument &quot;start&quot; or
&quot;stop&quot; (to perform site-specific startup or
shutdown tasks).</p>

<p>OPTIONS &quot;start&quot; If the first argument is
&quot;start&quot;, or no first argument is given, rc.news
initiates INN startup.</p>

<p>&quot;stop&quot; If the first argument is
&quot;stop&quot;, rc.news initiates INN shutdown. It is
recommended to throttle the server first as described in
ctlinnd(8).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To start INN and leave certain error messages
going to the terminal:</p>

<p>su - news -c ~news/bin/rc.news</p>

<p>To run INN at startup time from appropriate system boot
scripts:</p>

<p>su - news -c ~news/bin/rc.news &gt;/dev/console</p>

<p>To stop INN (throttling first):</p>

<p>~news/bin/ctlinnd throttle reason su - news -c
~news/bin/rc.news stop</p>

<p>BUGS Running &quot;rc.news start&quot; as root is never
the right thing to do, so we should at minimum check for
this and error, or perhaps change effective user ID.</p>
