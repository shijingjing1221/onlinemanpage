<p>SYSTEM-AUTH(5) Linux-PAM Manual SYSTEM-AUTH(5)</p>

<p>NAME system-auth - Common configuration file for
PAMified services</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/pam.d/system-auth</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The purpose of this configuration file is to
provide common configura- tion file for all applications and
service daemons calling PAM library.</p>

<p>The system-auth configuration file is included from all
individual ser- vice configuration files with the help of
the include directive.</p>

<p>NOTES There should be no sufficient modules in the
session part of system- auth file because individual
services may add session modules after include of the
system-auth file. Execution of these modules would be
skipped if there were sufficient modules in system-auth
file.</p>

<p>Conversely there should not be any modules after include
directive in the individual service files in authaccount and
password sections oth- erwise they could be bypassed.</p>

<p>BUGS None known.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pam(8), config-util(5)</p>

module develop- ers, and application developers.</p>
