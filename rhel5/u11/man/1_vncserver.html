<p>vncserver(1) Virtual Network Computing vncserver(1)</p>

<p>NAME vncserver - start or stop a VNC server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vncserver [:display#] [-name desktop-name]
[-geometry widthxheight] [-depth depth] [-pixelformat
format] [Xvnc-options...] vncserver -kill :display#</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vncserver is used to start a VNC (Virtual
Network Computing) desktop. vncserver is a Perl script which
simplifies the process of starting an Xvnc server. It runs
Xvnc with appropriate options and starts some X applications
to be displayed in the VNC desktop.</p>

<p>vncserver can be run with no options at all. In this
case it will choose the first available display number
(usually :1), start Xvnc as that display, and run a couple
of basic applications to get you started. You can also
specify the display number, in which case it will use that
number if it is available and exit if not, eg:</p>

<p>vncserver :13</p>

<p>Editing the file $HOME/.vnc/xstartup allows you to
change the applica- tions run at startup (but note that this
will not affect an existing desktop).</p>

<p>OPTIONS You can get a list of options by giving -h as an
option to vncserver. In addition to the options listed
below, any unrecognised options will be passed to Xvnc - see
the Xvnc man page, or &quot;Xvnc -help&quot; for
details.</p>

<p>-name desktop-name Each desktop has a name which may be
displayed by the viewer. It defaults to &quot;host:display#
(username)&quot; but you can change it with this option. It
is passed in to the xstartup script via the $VNCDESKTOP
environment variable, allowing you to run a dif- ferent set
of applications according to the name of the desktop.</p>

<p>-geometry widthxheight Specify the size of the desktop
to be created. Default is 1024x768.</p>

<p>-depth depth Specify the pixel depth in bits of the
desktop to be created. Default is 16, other possible values
are 8, 15 and 24 - anything else is likely to cause strange
behaviour by applications.</p>

<p>-pixelformat format Specify pixel format for server to
use (BGRnnn or RGBnnn). The default for depth 8 is BGR233
(meaning the most significant two bits represent blue, the
next three green, and the least signif- icant three
represent red), the default for depth 16 is RGB565 and for
depth 24 is RGB888.</p>

<p>-cc 3 As an alternative to the default TrueColor visual,
this allows you to run an Xvnc server with a PseudoColor
visual (i.e. one which uses a colour map or palette), which
can be useful for running some old X applications which only
work on such a dis- play. Values other than 3 (PseudoColor)
and 4 (TrueColor) for the -cc option may result in strange
behaviour, and PseudoColor desktops must be 8 bits deep.</p>

<p>-nohttpd Do not instruct Xvnc to run a mini-httpd if the
VNC Java applet is found.</p>

<p>-kill :display# This kills a VNC desktop previously
started with vncserver. It does this by killing the Xvnc
process, whose process ID is stored in the file
&quot;$HOME/.vnc/host:display#.pid&quot;. It actually
ignores anything preceding a &quot;:&quot; in its argument.
This can be useful so you can write &quot;vncserver -kill
$DISPLAY&quot;, for example at the end of your xstartup file
after a particular application exits.</p>

<p>FILES Several VNC-related files are found in the
directory $HOME/.vnc:</p>

<p>$HOME/.vnc/xstartup A shell script specifying X
applications to be run when a VNC desktop is started. If it
doesnt exist, vncserver will create a new one which runs a
couple of basic applications.</p>

<p>$HOME/.vnc/passwd The VNC password file.</p>

<p>$HOME/.vnc/host:display#.log The log file for Xvnc and
applications started in xstartup.</p>

<p>$HOME/.vnc/host:display#.pid Identifies the Xvnc process
ID, used by the -kill option.</p>
