<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>DESCRIPTION dmraid discovers block and software RAID
devices (eg, ATARAID) by using multiple different metadata
format handlers which support various for- mats (eg,
Highpoint 37x series). It offers activating RAID sets made
up by 2 or more discovered RAID devices, display properties
of devices and sets (see option -l for supported metadata
formats). Block device access to activated RAID sets occurs
via device-mapper nodes /dev/map- per/RaidSetName.
RaidSetName starts with the format name (see -l option)
which can be used to access all RAID sets of a specific
format easily with certain options (eg, -a below).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a, --activate {y|n} [RAID set...] Activates or
deactivates all or particular software RAID set. In case
metadata format handlers are chosen with -f , only RAID sets
with such format(s) can be activated or deactivated. Use-
ful if devices have multiple metadata signatures. When
activat- ing RAID sets, -p disables the activation of
partitions on them, and -Z will make dmraid tell the kernel
to remove the partitions from the disks underlying the set,
ie if sda is part of the set, remove sda1, sda2, etc. This
prevents applications from directly accessiong the disks
bypassing dmraid. RAID set names given on command line dont
need to be fully specified (eg, &quot;dmraid -ay sil&quot;
would activate all discovered Silicon Image Medley RAID
sets). Option -u defers metadata update in case of rebuild
is triggered parallelly with activation. Awoids meta- data
update to &quot;OK&quot; state if volume is not registered
to the event monitoring. Useful if volume is activating at
early stage of booting process when registration to the
event monitoring is impossible.</p>

<p>{-b|--block_devices} [device-path...] List all or
particular discovered block devices with their prop- erties
(size, serial number). Add -c to display block device names
only and -cc for CSV column output of block device proper-
ties. See description of -c below for FIELD identifiers.</p>

<p>[-d|--debug]... Enable debugging output. Opion can be
given multiple times increasing the debug output level.</p>

<p>[-c|--display_columns][FIELD[,FIELD...]]... Display
properties of block devices, RAID sets and devices in
column(s). Optional list specifying which FIELDs to display.
For -b: d[evpath]|p[ath], sec[tors]|si[ze], ser[ialnumber].
For -r: de[vpath]|p[ath], f[ormat], r[aidname], t[ype],
st[atus], se[ctors]|si[ze], da[taoffset]|o[ffset]. For -s:
f[ormat], r[aidname], t[ype], sta[tus], str[ide],
se[ctors]|si[ze], su[bsets], d[evices], sp[ares].</p>

<p>[-f|--format FORMAT[,FORMAT...]] Use metadata format
handler(s) to discover RAID devices. See -l for a list of
supported format handler names. This is useful to select
particular formats in case multiple metadata signatures are
found on a device. A comma seperated list of format names
can be specified which may not contain white space.</p>

<p>{-h|--help} Display help text.</p>

<p>{-i|--ignorelocking} Don t take out any locks. Useful in
early boot where no read/write access to /var is
available.</p>

<p>{-l|--list_formats} List all available metadata format
handlers with their names and descriptions. Supported RAID
levels are listed in parenthesis:</p>

<p>S: Span (concatination) 0: RAID0 (stripe) 1: RAID1
(mirror) 10: RAID10 (mirror on top of stripes) 01: RAID10
(stripe on top of mirrors) Note: Intel OROM displays this as
RAID10</p>

<p>{-n|--native_log} [device-path...] Display metadata in
native, vendor-specific format. In case a metadata format
handler is chosen with -f only RAID devices with such format
will be displayed in native format. If device- path(s)
is/are given on the command line, native metadata output is
restricted to those listed.</p>

<p>[{-P|--partchar} CHAR] Use CHAR as the separator between
the device name and the parti- tion number.</p>

<p>{-R| --rebuild} RAID-set [device-path] Rebuild raid
array after a drive has failed and a new drive is added. For
Intel chipset based systems, there are two methods in which
a new drive is added to the system. Option -u defers
metadata update in case of rebuild is triggered. Awoids
meta- data update to &quot;OK&quot; state if volume is not
registered to the event monitoring.</p>

<p>1. Using OROM to identify a new drive During system
reboot, enter OROM and mark the new drive as the rebuild
drive. After booting to the OS, use the dmraid command to
rebuild.</p>

<p>Example: dmraid -R raid_set</p>

<p>2. Using dmraid to identify a new drive Boot to the OS
and use the dmraid command with the new drive as the second
parameter.</p>

<p>Example: dmraid -R raid_set /dev/sdc</p>

<p>3. Using hot spare drive Mark a drive as hot spare using
the &quot;dmraid -f isw -S&quot; com- mand. Then use the
dmraid command to start the rebuild.</p>

<p>Example: dmraid -R raid_set</p>

<p>{-x|--remove} [RAID-set] Delete one or all existing
software RAID devices from the meta- data.</p>

<p>-f FORMAT-handler {-C|--create} --type raidlevel
[--size=setsize --strip stripsize] --disk device-path,
device-path [,device-path] Delete one or all existing
Configure a software RAID device and store the configuration
data in a group of hard drive devices consisting of this
array. This command requires the following options:</p>

<p>-f FORMAT-handler metadata format (see &quot;dmraid
-l&quot;) --type digit[digit...] specify the raid level of
the software RAID set. 0: raid0 1: raid1 5: raid5 01: raid01
(isw raid10) --size: [digits[k|K|m|M|g|G][b|B]] specify the
size of the RAID set.The number is an integer followed by
[kKmMgG] and/or [bB]. b: byte (default) B: block (512 bytes)
K or K: on the base of 1024 m or M: on the base of 1024*1024
g or G: on the base of 1024*1024*1024 If this option is
missing, it s set to the default value pre- configured by
the vendor. Note that different vendors may apply different
constraints on the granularity of the size or the min- imal
value. --strip: [digits[k|K|m|M|g|G][b|B]] specify the strip
size of a RAID1, RAID5, and RAID10 RAID set (as above)
--disk: device-path[{,| }device-path...] specify the array
of the hard drives, e.g. /dev/sda.</p>

<p>-f FORMAT-handler -S -M device-path -S -M
device-path</p>

<p>This command adds hot spare support for one or more RAID
sets.</p>

<p>1. When used with a format handler, which supports hot
spare sets (e.g. isw), a hot spare is marked to be used when
rebuild- ing any RAID set of that format. 2. When used when
specifying a RAID set, the drive is added to that RAID set
and will be used only to rebuild that set. Note: If the
specified name does not match an existing RAID-set, a set
with the new name will be cre- ated.</p>

<p>{-r|--raid_devices} [device-path...] List all discovered
RAID devices with format, RAID level, sec- tors used and
data offset into the device. In case a metadata format
handler is chosen with -f , only RAID devices with such
format can be discovered. Useful if devices have multiple
meta- data signatures. If -D is added to -r the RAID
metadata gets dumped into a subdirectory named
dmraid.format_name (eg. for- mat_name = isw) in files named
devicename.dat. The byte offset where the metadata is
located on the device is written into files named
devicename.offset and the size of the device in sec- tors
into files named devicename.size.</p>

<p>If -E is added to -r the RAID metadata on the devices
gets con- ditionally erased. Useful to erase old metadata
after new one of different type has been stored on a device
in order to avoid discovering both. If you enter -E option
-D will be enforced in order to have a fallback in case the
wrong metadata got erased. Manual copying back onto the
device is needed to recover from erasing the wrong metadata
using the dumped files device- name_formatname.dat and
devicename_formatname.offset. Eg, to restore all *.dat files
in the working directory to the respec- tive devices:</p>

<p>for f in *.dat do dd if=$f of=/dev/${f%%.dat} seek=cat
${f%%dat}offset bs=1 done</p>

<p>If device-path(s) is/are given on the command line, the
above actions are restricted to those listed. Add -c to
display RAID device names only and -cc for CSV column output
of RAID device properties. See description of -c above for
FIELD identifiers.</p>

<p>--separator SEPARATOR Use SEPARATOR as a delimiter for
all options taking or display- ing lists.</p>

<p>-s... [a|i] [RAID-set...] Display properties of RAID
sets. Multiple RAID set names can be given on the command
line which dont need to be fully specified (eg, &quot;dmraid
-s hpt&quot; would display all discovered Highpoint RAID
sets). Enter -s twice to display RAID subsets too. Add -c to
display names of RAID sets only, -cc for CSV column output
of RAID set properties and -ccc for inclusion of block
devices in the listing. Doesn t imply -s -s to show RAID
subsets (implied for group sets, e.g. isw). Add -g to
include information about group RAID sets (as with Intel
Software RAID) in the listing. See description of -c above
for FIELD identifiers. Note: Size is given in sectors (not
bytes).</p>

<p>[-v|--verbose]... Enable verbose runtime information
output. Opion can be given multiple times increasing the
verbosity level.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES &quot;dmraid -l&quot; lists all supported
metadata formats with their names along with some
descriptive information, eg: hpt37x : (+) Highpoint HPT37X
hpt45x : (+) Highpoint HPT45X isw : (+) Intel Software RAID
lsi : (0) LSI Logic MegaRAID nvidia : (+) NVidia RAID pdc :
(+) Promise FastTrack sil : (+) Silicon Image(tm) Medley(tm)
via : (+) VIA Software RAID dos : (+) DOS partitions on SW
RAIDs (0): Discover, (+): Discover+Activate</p>

<p>&quot;dmraid -ay&quot; activates all software RAID sets
discovered.</p>

<p>&quot;dmraid -an&quot; deactivates all active software
RAID sets which are not open (eg, mounted filesystem on
them).</p>

<p>&quot;dmraid -ay -f pdc&quot; (pdc looked up from
&quot;dmraid -l&quot;) activates all software RAID sets with
Promise format discovered and ignores all other supported
formats.</p>

<p>&quot;dmraid -r&quot; discovers all software RAID
devices supported on your sys- tem, eg: /dev/dm-46: hpt45x,
&quot;hpt45x_chidjhaiaa-0&quot;, striped, ok, 320172928 sec-
tors, data@ 0 /dev/dm-50: hpt45x,
&quot;hpt45x_chidjhaiaa-0&quot;, striped, ok, 320172928 sec-
tors, data@ 0 /dev/dm-54: hpt45x,
&quot;hpt45x_chidjhaiaa-1&quot;, striped, ok, 320172928 sec-
tors, data@ 0 /dev/dm-58: hpt45x,
&quot;hpt45x_chidjhaiaa-1&quot;, striped, ok, 320172928 sec-
tors, data@ 0</p>

<p>&quot;dmraid -s -s hpt45x_chidjhaiaa&quot; displays
properties of set &quot;hpt45x_chidjhaiaa&quot;, eg: ***
Superset name : hpt45x_chidjhaiaa size : 640345856 stride :
128 type : raid10 status : ok subsets: 2 dev : 4 spare : 0
---&gt; Subset name : hpt45x_chidjhaiaa-0 size : 640345856
stride : 128 type : stripe status : ok subsets: 0 dev : 2
spare : 0 ---&gt; Subset name : hpt45x_chidjhaiaa-1 size :
640345856 stride : 128 type : stripe status : ok subsets: 0
dev : 2 spare : 0</p>

<p>&quot;dmraid -s -ccs hpt45&quot; displays properties in
column format of all sets and subsets with hpt45* format,
eg: hpt45x_chidjhaiaa,640345856,128,raid10,ok,4,0
hpt45x_chidjhaiaa-a,640345856,128,stripe,ok,2,0
hpt45x_chidjhaiaa-b,640345856,128,stripe,ok,2,0</p>

<p>&quot;dmraid -r --sep : -cpath:size&quot; display paths
and sizes in sectors for RAID devices in column format using
: as a delimiter, eg: /dev/dm-8:320173055
