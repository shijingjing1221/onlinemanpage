<p>NAME chdir, fchdir - change working directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int chdir(const char *path); int fchdir(int fd);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION chdir() changes the current working
directory to that specified in path.</p>

<p>fchdir() is identical to chdir(); the only difference is
that the directory is given as an open file descriptor.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS Depending on the file system, other errors can be
returned. The more general errors for chdir() are listed
below:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied for one of the
directories in the path prefix of path. (See also
path_resolution(2).)</p>

<p>EFAULT path points outside your accessible address
space.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
resolving path.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG path is too long.</p>

<p>ENOENT The file does not exist.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of path is not a directory.</p>

<p>The general errors for fchdir() are listed below:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission was denied on the directory
open on fd.</p>

<p>EBADF fd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>NOTES A child process created via fork(2) inherits its
parents current work- ing directory. The current working
directory is left unchanged by execve(2).</p>

<p>The prototype for fchdir() is only available if
_BSD_SOURCE is defined, or _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined with the
value 500.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.4BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>
