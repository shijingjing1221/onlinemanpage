<p>NAME numa_maps - information about numa memory</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/numa_maps
contrains information about each memory area used by a given
process allowing--among other information--the determination
of which nodes were used for the pages.</p>

<p>numa_maps is only read by programs or by shell commands,
and not writ- ten to. A read operation on the file will make
the kernel scan the memory area of a process to determine
how memory is used. One line is displayed for each memory
area of the process.</p>

<p>The numa_maps format is very simple. The first field
shown on each line is the starting address that allows a
correlation with output from /proc/&lt;pid/maps. The second
field shows the memory policy currently in effect for this
particular memory area.</p>

<p>The rest of the line contains series of informationi
items about the pages in the memory area.</p>

<p>Possible information items N&lt;node&gt;=&lt;pages&gt;
The number of pages used on a node. The number of pages
includes only pages mapped by this process. If this is a
shared mapping then other processes may have mapped dif-
ferent pages in a memory area. Note also that page migration
may have temporarily unmapped pages. These may only show up
again after the process has attempted to reference these
pages.</p>

<p>file=&lt;filename&gt; The file backing the memory area.
If COW (Copy-On-Write) pages were generated then the memory
area may contain additional anonymous pages.</p>

<p>heap Memory area is used for the heap.</p>

<p>stack Memory area is used for the stack.</p>

<p>huge Huge memory area. The page counts shown are huge
pages and not regular sized pages.</p>

<p>anon=&lt;pages&gt; The number of anonymous page in the
range.</p>

<p>dirty=&lt;pages&gt; Number of dirty pages</p>

<p>mapped=&lt;pages&gt; Number of mapped pages for file
backed files. Only shown if different from the count of
anonymous and dirty pages.</p>

<p>mapmax=&lt;count&gt; Maximum mapcount (number of
processes mapping a single page) encountered during scan.
This may be used as an indicator as to the sharing occuring
in a given memory area.</p>

<p>swapcache=&lt;count&gt; Number of pages that have an
associated entry on the swap device.</p>

<p>active=&lt;pages&gt; The number of pages on the active
list (only shown if different from the number of pages in
this area). If this item is shown then some inactive pages
exist in that particular memory area that may be removed
from memory by the swapper soon.</p>

<p>writeback=&lt;pages&gt; Number of pages that are
currently being written out to disk.</p>

<p>FILES /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/numa_maps</p>
