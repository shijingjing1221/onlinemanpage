<p>GETGRNAM(3) Linux Programmer s Manual GETGRNAM(3)</p>

<p>NAME getgrnam, getgrnam_r, getgrgid, getgrgid_r - get
group file entry</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;grp.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct group *getgrnam(const char *name);</p>

<p>struct group *getgrgid(gid_t gid);</p>

<p>int getgrnam_r(const char *name, struct group *gbuf,
char *buf, size_t buflen, struct group **gbufp);</p>

<p>int getgrgid_r(gid_t gid, struct group *gbuf, char *buf,
size_t buflen, struct group **gbufp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getgrnam() function returns a pointer to
a structure containing the broken-out fields of the record
in the group database (e.g., the local group file
/etc/group, NIS, and LDAP) that matches the group name
name.</p>

<p>The getgrgid() function returns a pointer to a structure
containing the broken-out fields of the record in the group
database that matches the group ID gid.</p>

<p>The getgrnam_r() and getgrgid_r() functions obtain the
same informa- tion, but store the retrieved group structure
in the space pointed to by gbuf. This group structure
contains pointers to strings, and these strings are stored
in the buffer buf of size buflen. A pointer to the result
(in case of success) or NULL (in case no entry was found or
an error occurred) is stored in *gbufp.</p>

<p>The group structure is defined in &lt;grp.h&gt; as
follows:</p>

<p>struct group { char *gr_name; /* group name */ char
*gr_passwd; /* group password */ gid_t gr_gid; /* group ID
*/ char **gr_mem; /* group members */ };</p>

<p>The maximum needed size for buf can be found using
sysconf(3) with the _SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX parameter.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The getgrnam() and getgrgid() functions
return a pointer to a group structure, or NULL if the
matching entry is not found or an error occurs. If an error
occurs, errno is set appropriately. If one wants to check
errno after the call, it should be set to zero before the
call.</p>

<p>The return value may point to static area, and may be
overwritten by subsequent calls to getgrent(), getgrgid(),
or getgrnam().</p>

<p>The getgrnam_r() and getgrgid_r() functions return zero
on success. In case of error, an error number is
returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS 0 or ENOENT or ESRCH or EBADF or EPERM or ... The
given name or gid was not found.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught.</p>

<p>EIO I/O error.</p>

<p>EMFILE The maximum number (OPEN_MAX) of files was open
already in the calling process.</p>

<p>ENFILE The maximum number of files was open already in
the system.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory to allocate group
structure.</p>

<p>ERANGE Insufficient buffer space supplied.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/group local group database file</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001</p>

<p>NOTES The formulation given above under &quot;RETURN
VALUE&quot; is from POSIX.1-2001. It does not call &quot;not
found&quot; an error, hence does not specify what value
errno might have in this situation. But that makes it
impossible to recognize errors. One might argue that
according to POSIX errno should be left unchanged if an
entry is not found. Experiments on vari- ous Unix-like
systems shows that lots of different values occur in this
situation: 0, ENOENT, EBADF, ESRCH, EWOULDBLOCK, EPERM and
probably others.</p>
