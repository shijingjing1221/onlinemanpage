<p>NAME ksoftirqd - Softirq daemon</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ksoftirqd is a per-cpu kernel thread that
runs when the machine is under heavy soft-interrupt load.
Soft interrupts are normally serviced on return from a hard
interrupt, but it s possible for soft interrupts to be
triggered more quickly than they can be serviced. If a soft
interrupt is triggered for a second time while soft
interrupts are being handled, the ksoftirq daemon is
triggered to handle the soft interrupts in process context.
If ksoftirqd is taking more than a tiny percentage of CPU
time, this indicates the machine is under heavy soft
interrupt load.</p>

<p>HISTORY ksoftirqd was introduced during the 2.3
development series as part of the softnet work by Alexey
Kuznetsov and David Miller.</p>
