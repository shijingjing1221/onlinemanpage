<p>NAME expireover - Expire entries from the news overview
database</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS expireover [-ekNpqs] [-f file] [-w offset] [-z
rmfile] [-Z lowmarkfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION expireover expires old entries from the news
overview database. It reads in a list of newsgroups (by
default from pathdb/active, but a different file can be
specified with the -f option) and then removes from the
overview database mentions of any articles that no longer
exist in the news spool.</p>

<p>If groupbaseexpiry in inn.conf is true, expireover also
removes old articles from the news spool according to the
expiration rules in expire.ctl. Otherwise it only removes
overview entries for articles that have already been removed
by some other process, and -e, -k, -N, -p, -q, -w, and -z
are all ignored.</p>

<p>When groupbaseexpiry is set, the default behavior of
expireover is to remove the article from the spool once it
expires out of all of the newsgroups to which it was
crossposted. The article is, however, removed from the
overview database of each newsgroup as soon as it expires
out of that individual newsgroup. The effect is that an
arti- cle crossposted to several groups will be removed from
the overview database from each group one-by-one as its age
passes the expiration threshold for that group as set in
expire.ctl, and then when it expires out of the last
newsgroup, it will be deleted from the news spool.</p>

<p>Articles that are stored in self-expiring storage
backends such as CNFS are normally treated differently and
not expired until they expire out of the backend regardless
of expire.ctl. See -N, however.</p>

<p>By default, expireover purges all overview information
for newsgroups that have been removed from the server; this
behavior is suppressed if -f is given.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -e Remove articles from the news spool and all
overview databases as soon as they expire out of any
newsgroup to which they are posted, rather than retain them
until they expire out of all newsgroups. -e and -k cannot be
used at the same time. This flag is ignored if
groupbaseexpiry is false.</p>

<p>-f file Use file as the newsgroup list instead of
pathdb/active. file can be &quot;-&quot; to indicate
standard input. Using this flag suppresses the normal purge
of all overview information from newsgroups that have been
removed from the server.</p>

<p>-k Retain all overview information for an article, as
well as the article itself, until it expires out of all
newsgroups to which it was posted. This can cause articles
to stick around in a newsgroup for longer than the
expire.ctl rules indicate, when theyre cross- posted. -e and
-k cannot be used at the same time. This flag is ignored if
groupbaseexpiry is false.</p>

<p>-N Apply expire.ctl rules to expire articles even from
storage methods that have self-expire functionality. This
may remove articles from self-expiring storage methods
before the articles &quot;naturally&quot; expire. This flag
is ignored if groupbaseexpiry is false.</p>

<p>-p By default, expireover bases decisions on whether to
remove an article on the arrival time on the server. This
means that arti- cles may be kept a little longer than if
the decision were based on the article s posting date. If
this option is given, expiration decisions are based on the
article posting date instead. This flag is ignored if
groupbaseexpiry is false.</p>

<p>-q expireover normally prints statistics at the end of
the expiration process. -q suppresses this report. This flag
is ignored if groupbaseexpiry is false.</p>

<p>-s expireover normally only checks the existence of
articles in the news spool if querying the storage method
for that article to see if it still exists is considered
&quot;inexpensive.&quot; To always check the existence of
all articles regardless of how resource-intensive this may
be, use the -s flag. See storage.conf(5) for more infor-
mation about this metric.</p>

<p>-w offset &quot;Warps&quot; time so that expireover
thinks that it s running at some time other than the current
time. This is occasionally useful to force groups to be
expired or not expired without changing expire.ctl for the
expire run. offset should be a signed floating point number
specifying the number of days difference from the cur- rent
time to use as &quot;now.&quot; This flag is ignored if
groupbaseexpiry is false.</p>

<p>-z rmfile Dont remove articles immediately but instead
write the path to the article or the token of the article to
rmfile, which is suitable input for fastrm(1). This can
substantially speed up deletion of expired articles for
those storage methods where each article is a single file
(such as tradspool and timehash). See the description of
delayrm in news.daily(8) for more details. This flag is
ignored if groupbaseexpiry is false.</p>

<p>-Z lowmarkfile Write the lowest article numbers for each
newsgroup as its expired to the specified file. This file is
then suitable for &quot;ctlinnd lowmark&quot;. See
ctlinnd(8) for more information.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Normally expireover is invoked from
news.daily(8), which handles such things as processing the
rmfile and lowmarkfile if necessary. Some- times its
convenient to manually expire a particular newsgroup, how-
ever. This can be done with a command like:</p>

<p>echo example.test expireover -f - -Z
/usr/local/news/tmp/lowmark ctlinnd lowmark
/usr/local/news/tmp/lowmark</p>

<p>This can be particularly useful if a lot of articles in
a particular group have expired but the overview information
is still present, caus- ing some clients to see a lot of
&quot;this article may have been cancelled&quot; messages
when they first enter the newsgroup.</p>
