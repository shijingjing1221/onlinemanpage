<p>DNSSEC-KEYGEN(8) BIND9 DNSSEC-KEYGEN(8)</p>

<p>NAME dnssec-keygen - DNSSEC key generation tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dnssec-keygen {-a algorithm} {-b keysize} {-n
nametype} [-c class] [-e] [-f flag] [-g generator] [-h] [-k]
[-p protocol] [-r randomdev] [-s strength] [-t type] [-v
level] {name}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dnssec-keygen generates keys for DNSSEC
(Secure DNS), as defined in RFC 2535 and RFC 4034. It can
also generate keys for use with TSIG (Transaction
Signatures), as defined in RFC 2845.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a algorithm Selects the cryptographic
algorithm. The value of algorithm must be one of RSAMD5
(RSA) or RSASHA1, DSA, DH (Diffie Hellman), or HMAC-MD5.
These values are case insensitive.</p>

<p>Note 1: that for DNSSEC, RSASHA1 is a mandatory to
implement algorithm, and DSA is recommended. For TSIG,
HMAC-MD5 is mandatory.</p>

<p>Note 2: HMAC-MD5 and DH automatically set the -k
flag.</p>

<p>-b keysize Specifies the number of bits in the key. The
choice of key size depends on the algorithm used. RSAMD5 /
RSASHA1 keys must be between 512 and 2048 bits. Diffie
Hellman keys must be between 128 and 4096 bits. DSA keys
must be between 512 and 1024 bits and an exact multiple of
64. HMAC-MD5 keys must be between 1 and 512 bits.</p>

<p>-n nametype Specifies the owner type of the key. The
value of nametype must either be ZONE (for a DNSSEC zone key
(KEY/DNSKEY)), HOST or ENTITY (for a key associated with a
host (KEY)), USER (for a key associated with a user(KEY)) or
OTHER (DNSKEY). These values are case insensitive.</p>

<p>-c class Indicates that the DNS record containing the
key should have the specified class. If not specified, class
IN is used.</p>

<p>-e If generating an RSAMD5/RSASHA1 key, use a large
exponent.</p>

<p>-f flag Set the specified flag in the flag field of the
KEY/DNSKEY record. The only recognized flag is KSK (Key
Signing Key) DNSKEY.</p>

<p>-g generator If generating a Diffie Hellman key, use
this generator. Allowed values are 2 and 5. If no generator
is specified, a known prime from RFC 2539 will be used if
possible; otherwise the default is 2.</p>

<p>-h Prints a short summary of the options and arguments
to dnssec-keygen.</p>

<p>-k Generate KEY records rather than DNSKEY records.</p>

<p>-p protocol Sets the protocol value for the generated
key. The protocol is a number between 0 and 255. The default
is 3 (DNSSEC). Other possible values for this argument are
listed in RFC 2535 and its successors.</p>

<p>-r randomdev Specifies the source of randomness. If the
operating system does not provide a /dev/random or
equivalent device, the default source of randomness is
keyboard input. randomdev specifies the name of a character
device or file containing random data to be used instead of
the default. The special value keyboard indicates that
keyboard input should be used.</p>

<p>-s strength Specifies the strength value of the key. The
strength is a number between 0 and 15, and currently has no
defined purpose in DNSSEC.</p>

<p>-t type Indicates the use of the key. type must be one
of AUTHCONF, NOAUTHCONF, NOAUTH, or NOCONF. The default is
AUTHCONF. AUTH refers to the ability to authenticate data,
and CONF the ability to encrypt data.</p>

<p>-v level Sets the debugging level.</p>

<p>GENERATED KEYS When dnssec-keygen completes
successfully, it prints a string of the form
Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii to the standard output. This is an
identification string for the key it has generated.</p>

<p>&middot; nnnn is the key name.</p>

<p>&middot; aaa is the numeric representation of the
algorithm.</p>

<p>&middot; iiiii is the key identifier (or footprint).</p>

<p>dnssec-keygen creates two files, with names based on the
printed string. Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key contains the public
key, and Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private contains the private
key.</p>

<p>The .key file contains a DNS KEY record that can be
inserted into a zone file (directly or with a $INCLUDE
statement).</p>

<p>The .private file contains algorithm-specific fields.
For obvious security reasons, this file does not have
general read permission.</p>

<p>Both .key and .private files are generated for symmetric
encryption algorithms such as HMAC-MD5, even though the
public and private key are equivalent.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE To generate a 768-bit DSA key for the domain
example.com, the following command would be issued:</p>

<p>dnssec-keygen -a DSA -b 768 -n ZONE example.com</p>

<p>The command would print a string of the form:</p>

<p>Kexample.com.+003+26160</p>

<p>In this example, dnssec-keygen creates the files
Kexample.com.+003+26160.key and
Kexample.com.+003+26160.private.</p>
