<p>PERLUTIL(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLUTIL(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlutil - utilities packaged with the Perl
distribution</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Along with the Perl interpreter itself, the
Perl distribution installs a range of utilities on your
system. There are also several utilities which are used by
the Perl distribution itself as part of the install process.
This document exists to list all of these utilities, explain
what they are for and provide pointers to each module s
documentation, if appropriate.</p>

<p>DOCUMENTATION</p>

<p>perldoc The main interface to Perls documentation is
&quot;perldoc&quot;, although if youre reading this, its
more than likely that you ve already found it. perldoc will
extract and format the documentation from any file in the
current directory, any Perl module installed on the system,
or any of the standard documentation pages, such as this
one. Use &quot;perldoc &lt;name&gt;&quot; to get information
on any of the utilities described in this document.</p>

<p>pod2man and pod2text If it s run from a terminal,
perldoc will usually call pod2man to translate POD (Plain
Old Documentation - see perlpod for an explana- tion) into a
manpage, and then run man to display it; if man isnt
available, pod2text will be used instead and the output
piped through your favourite pager.</p>

<p>pod2html and pod2latex As well as these two, there are
two other converters: pod2html will produce HTML pages from
POD, and pod2latex, which produces LaTeX files.</p>

<p>pod2usage If you just want to know how to use the
utilities described here, pod2usage will just extract the
&quot;USAGE&quot; section; some of the utili- ties will
automatically call pod2usage on themselves when you call
them with &quot;-help&quot;.</p>

<p>podselect pod2usage is a special case of podselect, a
utility to extract named sections from documents written in
POD. For instance, while utili- ties have &quot;USAGE&quot;
sections, Perl modules usually have &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot;
sections: &quot;podselect -s &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; ...&quot;
will extract this section for a given file.</p>

<p>podchecker If youre writing your own documentation in
POD, the podchecker utility will look for errors in your
markup.</p>

<p>splain splain is an interface to perldiag - paste in
your error message to it, and itll explain it for you.</p>

<p>roffitall The &quot;roffitall&quot; utility is not
installed on your system but lives in the pod/ directory of
your Perl source kit; it converts all the doc- umentation
from the distribution to *roff format, and produces a
typeset PostScript or text file of the whole lot.</p>

<p>CONVERTORS</p>

<p>To help you convert legacy programs to Perl, weve
included three con- version filters:</p>

<p>a2p a2p converts awk scripts to Perl programs; for
example, &quot;a2p -F:&quot; on the simple awk script
&quot;{print $2}&quot; will produce a Perl program based
around this code:</p>

<p>while (&lt;&gt;) { ($Fld1,$Fld2) = split(/[:0/, $_,
9999); print $Fld2; }</p>

<p>s2p Similarly, s2p converts sed scripts to Perl
programs. s2p run on &quot;s/foo/bar&quot; will produce a
Perl program based around this:</p>

<p>while (&lt;&gt;) { chomp; s/foo/bar/g; print if
$printit; }</p>

<p>find2perl Finally, find2perl translates &quot;find&quot;
commands to Perl equivalents which use the File::Find
module. As an example, &quot;find2perl . -user root -perm
4000 -print&quot; produces the following callback subroutine
for &quot;File::Find&quot;:</p>

<p>sub wanted { my ($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid);
(($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid) = lstat($_)) &amp;&amp;
$uid == $uid{root}) &amp;&amp; (($mode &amp; 0777) ==
04000); print(&quot;$name0); }</p>

<p>As well as these filters for converting other languages,
the pl2pm utility will help you convert old-style Perl 4
libraries to new-style Perl5 modules.</p>

<p>Administration</p>

<p>libnetcfg To display and change the libnet configuration
run the libnetcfg command.</p>

<p>Development</p>

<p>There are a set of utilities which help you in
developing Perl pro- grams, and in particular, extending
Perl with C.</p>

<p>perlbug perlbug is the recommended way to report bugs in
the perl inter- preter itself or any of the standard library
modules back to the developers; please read through the
documentation for perlbug thor- oughly before using it to
submit a bug report.</p>

<p>h2ph Back before Perl had the XS system for connecting
with C libraries, programmers used to get library constants
by reading through the C header files. You may still see
&quot;require &rsquo;syscall.ph&rsquo;&quot; or similar
around - the .ph file should be created by running h2ph on
the corresponding .h file. See the h2ph documentation for
more on how to convert a whole bunch of header files at
once.</p>

<p>c2ph and pstruct c2ph and pstruct, which are actually
the same program but behave differently depending on how
they are called, provide another way of getting at C with
Perl - theyll convert C structures and union dec- larations
to Perl code. This is deprecated in favour of h2xs these
days.</p>

<p>h2xs h2xs converts C header files into XS modules, and
will try and write as much glue between C libraries and Perl
modules as it can. Its also very useful for creating
skeletons of pure Perl modules.</p>

<p>dprofpp Perl comes with a profiler, the Devel::DProf
module. The dprofpp utility analyzes the output of this
profiler and tells you which subroutines are taking up the
most run time. See Devel::DProf for more information.</p>

<p>perlcc perlcc is the interface to the experimental Perl
compiler suite.</p>
