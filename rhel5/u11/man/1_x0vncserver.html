<p>NAME x0vncserver - VNC server which continuously polls
an X display</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS x0vncserver [parameters]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION x0vncserver is a VNC server which
continuously polls any X display, allowing it to be
controlled via VNC. How usable it will be depends a lot on
the machine its running on, and what youre expecting. It
wont be as fast as Xvnc or a native X server with VNC
support compiled in, but in many cases it is the best option
since it is just an ordi- nary X application requiring no
special installation.</p>

<p>It has many of the same parameters as Xvnc. Running
x0vncserver -h will give a list of parameters with
descriptions. Note that you need to explicitly specify an
appropriate password file using the Password- File
parameter.</p>
