<p>HISTORY(5) HISTORY(5)</p>

<p>NAME history - record of current and recently expired
Usenet articles</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file &lt;pathdb in inn.conf&gt;/history
keeps a record of all articles currently stored in the news
system, as well as those that have been received but since
expired. In a typical production environment, this file will
be many megabytes.</p>

<p>The file consists of text lines. Each line corresponds
to one article. The file is normally kept sorted in the
order in which articles are received, although this is not a
requirement. Innd(8) appends a new line each time it files
an article, and expire(8) builds a new version of the file
by removing old articles and purging old entries.</p>

<p>Each line consists of two or three fields separated by a
tab, shown below as t: [Hash] date [Hash] date token</p>

<p>The Hash field is the ASCII representation of the hash
of the Message- ID header. This is directly used for the key
of the dbz(3).</p>

<p>The date field consists of three sub-fields separated by
a tilde. All sub-fields are the text representation of the
number of seconds since the epoch i.e., a time_t; see
gettimeofday(2). The first sub-field is the article s
arrival date. If copies of the article are still present
then the second sub-field is either the value of the
articles Expires header, or a hyphen if no expiration date
was specified. If an article has been expired then the
second sub-field will be a hyphen. The third sub-field is
the value of the articles Date header, record- ing when the
article was posted.</p>

<p>The token field is a token of the article. This field is
empty if the article has been expired.</p>

<p>For example, an article whose Message-ID was
&lt;7q2saq$sal$1@isrv4.pa.vix.com&gt;, posted on 26 Aug 1999
08:02:34 GMT and recieved at 26 Aug 1999 08:06:54 GMT, could
have a history line (broken into three lines for display)
like the following: [E6184A5BC2898A35A3140B149DE91D5C]
935678987~-~935678821
@030154574F00000000000007CE3B000004BA@</p>

<p>In addition to the text file, there is a dbz(3) database
associated with the file that uses the Message-ID field as a
key to determine the offset in the text file where the
associated line begins. For histori- cal reasons, the key
includes the trailing byte (which is not stored in the text
file).</p>
