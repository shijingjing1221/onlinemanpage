<p>NAME inews - Post a Usenet article to the local news
server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS inews [-ADhNORSVW] [-acdeFfnortwx value] [-p
port] [file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION inews reads a Usenet news article, perhaps
with headers, from file or standard input if no file is
given. It adds some headers and performs some consistency
checks. If the article does not meet those checks, the
article is rejected. If it passes the checks, inews sends
the article to the local news server as specified in
inn.conf.</p>

<p>By default, if a file named .signature exists in the
home directory of the posting user, it is appended to the
post, preceeded by a line that contains only &quot;--
&quot;. Signatures are not allowed to be more than four
lines long.</p>

<p>Cancel messages can only be posted with inews if the
sender of the can- cel message matches the sender of the
original message being cancelled. The same check is also
applied to Supersedes. Sender in this case means the
contents of the Sender header if present, otherwise the From
header.</p>

<p>Control messages other than cancel messages are only
allowed if inews is being run by the news user or by a user
in the news group and if the control message is recognized.
If the article contains a Distribution header with a
distribution that matches one of the bad distribution
patterns in inn/options.h (anything containing a period by
default), the message will be rejected. The message will
also be rejected if checkincludedtext is true in inn.conf,
it contains more quoted text than original text, and it is
over 40 lines long.</p>

<p>If not provided, the Path header of an article is
constructed as fol- lows: The basic Path header will be
&quot;not-for-mail&quot;. If pathhost is specified in
inn.conf, it will be added to the beginning Path. Other-
wise, if server is specified, the full domain of the local
host will be added to the beginning of the Path. Then, if -x
was given, its value will be added to the beginning of the
Path.</p>

<p>If posting fails, a copy of the failed post will be
saved in a file named dead.article in the home directory of
the user running inews. inews exits with a non-zero status
if posting failed or with a zero status if posting was
successful.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Most of the options to inews take a single value
and set the corre- sponding header in the message that is
posted. If the value is more than one word or contains any
shell metacharacters, it must be quoted to protect it from
the shell. Here are all the options that set header fields
and the corresponding header:</p>

<p>-a Approved -c Control -d Distribution -e Expires -F
References -f From -n Newsgroups -o Organization -r Reply-To
-t Subject -w Followup-To -x Path prefix</p>

<p>The -x argument will be added to the beginning of the
normal Path header; it will not replace it.</p>

<p>-A, -V, -W Accepted for compatibility with C News. These
options have no affect.</p>

<p>-D, -N Perform the consistency checks and add headers
where appropriate, but then print the article to standard
output rather than sending it to the server. -N is accepted
as as synonym for compatibility with C News.</p>

<p>-h Normally, this flag should always be given. It
indicates that the article consists of headers, a blank
line, and then the message body. If it is omitted, the input
is taken to be just the body of the message, and any desired
headers have to be specified with com- mand-line options as
described above.</p>

<p>-O By default, an Organization header will be added if
none is present in the article. To prevent adding the
default (from organization in inn.conf), use this flag.</p>

<p>-p port Connect to the specified port on the server
rather than to the default (port 119).</p>

<p>-R Reject all control messages.</p>

<p>-S Do not attempt to append ~/.signature to the message,
even if it exists.</p>

<p>NOTES If the NNTP server requests authentication, inews
will try to read passwd.nntp to get the username and
password to use and will therefore need read access to that
file. This is typically done by making that file
group-readable and adding all users who should be able to
use inews to post to that server to the appropriate
group.</p>

<p>inews used to do even more than it does now, and all of
the remaining checks that are not dependent on the user
running inews should probably be removed in favor of letting
the news server handle them.</p>

<p>Since INN s inews uses inn.conf and some other corners
of an INN installation, it s not very appropriate as a
general stand-alone inews program for general use on a
system thats not running a news server. Other, more suitable
versions of inews are available as part of various Unix news
clients or by themselves.</p>
