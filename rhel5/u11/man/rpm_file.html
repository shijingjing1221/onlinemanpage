<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>NAME file - determine file type</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS file [ -bchikLnNprsvz ] [ -f namefile ] [ -F
separator ] [ -m magic- files ] file ... file -C [ -m
magicfile ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents version 4.17 of
the file command.</p>

<p>File tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.
There are three sets of tests, performed in this order:
filesystem tests, magic number tests, and language tests.
The first test that succeeds causes the file type to be
printed.</p>

<p>The type printed will usually contain one of the words
text (the file contains only printing characters and a few
common control characters and is probably safe to read on an
ASCII terminal), executable (the file contains the result of
compiling a program in a form understand- able to some UNIX
kernel or another), or data meaning anything else (data is
usually binary or non-printable). Exceptions are well-known
file formats (core files, tar archives) that are known to
contain binary data. When modifying the file
/usr/share/file/magic or the pro- gram itself, preserve
these keywords . People depend on knowing that all the
readable files in a directory have the word text printed.
Dont do as Berkeley did and change shell commands text to
shell script. Note that the file /usr/share/file/magic is
built mechani- cally from a large number of small files in
the subdirectory Magdir in the source distribution of this
program.</p>

<p>The filesystem tests are based on examining the return
from a stat(2) system call. The program checks to see if the
file is empty, or if its some sort of special file. Any
known file types appropriate to the system you are running
on (sockets, symbolic links, or named pipes (FIFOs) on those
systems that implement them) are intuited if they are
defined in the system header file &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;.</p>

<p>The magic number tests are used to check for files with
data in partic- ular fixed formats. The canonical example of
this is a binary exe- cutable (compiled program) a.out file,
whose format is defined in a.out.h and possibly exec.h in
the standard include directory. These files have a magic
number stored in a particular place near the beginning of
the file that tells the UNIX operating system that the file
is a binary executable, and which of several types thereof.
The concept of magic number has been applied by extension to
data files. Any file with some invariant identifier at a
small fixed offset into the file can usually be described in
this way. The information identi- fying these files is read
from the compiled magic file /usr/share/file/magic.mgc , or
/usr/share/file/magic if the compile file does not exist. In
addition file will look in $HOME/.magic.mgc , or
$HOME/.magic for magic entries.</p>

<p>If a file does not match any of the entries in the magic
file, it is examined to see if it seems to be a text file.
ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non- ISO 8-bit extended-ASCII character
sets (such as those used on Macin- tosh and IBM PC systems),
UTF-8-encoded Unicode, UTF-16-encoded Uni- code, and EBCDIC
character sets can be distinguished by the different ranges
and sequences of bytes that constitute printable text in
each set. If a file passes any of these tests, its character
set is reported. ASCII, ISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and
extended-ASCII files are iden- tified as text because they
will be mostly readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and
EBCDIC are only character data because, while they contain
text, it is text that will require translation before it can
be read. In addition, file will attempt to determine other
charac- teristics of text-type files. If the lines of a file
are terminated by CR, CRLF, or NEL, instead of the
Unix-standard LF, this will be reported. Files that contain
embedded escape sequences or overstriking will also be
identified.</p>

<p>Once file has determined the character set used in a
text-type file, it will attempt to determine in what
language the file is written. The language tests look for
particular strings (cf names.h) that can appear anywhere in
the first few blocks of a file. For example, the keyword .br
indicates that the file is most likely a troff(1) input
file, just as the keyword struct indicates a C program.
These tests are less reliable than the previous two groups,
so they are performed last. The language test routines also
test for some miscellany (such as tar(1) archives).</p>

<p>Any file that cannot be identified as having been
written in any of the character sets listed above is simply
said to be data.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b, --brief Do not prepend filenames to output
lines (brief mode).</p>

<p>-c, --checking-printout Cause a checking printout of the
parsed form of the magic file. This is usually used in
conjunction with -m to debug a new magic file before
installing it.</p>

<p>-C, --compile Write a magic.mgc output file that
contains a pre-parsed ver- sion of file.</p>

<p>-f, --files-from namefile Read the names of the files to
be examined from namefile (one per line) before the argument
list. Either namefile or at least one filename argument must
be present; to test the stan- dard input, use - as a
filename argument.</p>

<p>-F, --separator separator Use the specified string as
the separator between the filename and the file result
returned. Defaults to :.</p>

<p>-h, --no-dereference option causes symlinks not to be
followed (on systems that sup- port symbolic links). This is
the default if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is
not defined.</p>

<p>-i, --mime Causes the file command to output mime type
strings rather than the more traditional human readable
ones. Thus it may say text/plain; charset=us-ascii rather
than ASCII text. In order for this option to work, file
changes the way it han- dles files recognised by the command
itself (such as many of the text file types, directories
etc), and makes use of an alternative magic file. (See FILES
section, below).</p>

<p>-k, --keep-going Dont stop at the first match, keep
going.</p>

<p>-L, --dereference option causes symlinks to be followed,
as the like-named option in ls(1) (on systems that support
symbolic links). This is the default if the environment
variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined.</p>

<p>-m, --magic-file list Specify an alternate list of files
containing magic numbers. This can be a single file, or a
colon-separated list of files. If a compiled magic file is
found alongside, it will be used instead. With the -i or
--mime option, the program adds &quot;.mime&quot; to each
file name.</p>

<p>-n, --no-buffer Force stdout to be flushed after
checking each file. This is only useful if checking a list
of files. It is intended to be used by programs that want
filetype output from a pipe.</p>

<p>-N, --no-pad Don t pad filenames so that they align in
the output.</p>

<p>-p, --preserve-date On systems that support utime(2) or
utimes(2), attempt to pre- serve the access time of files
analyzed, to pretend that file(2) never read them.</p>

<p>-r, --raw Don t translate unprintable characters to .
Normally file translates unprintable characters to their
octal representa- tion.</p>

<p>-s, --special-files Normally, file only attempts to read
and determine the type of argument files which stat(2)
reports are ordinary files. This prevents problems, because
reading special files may have pecu- liar consequences.
Specifying the -s option causes file to also read argument
files which are block or character special files. This is
useful for determining the filesystem types of the data in
raw disk partitions, which are block special files. This
option also causes file to disregard the file size as
reported by stat(2) since on some systems it reports a zero
size for raw disk partitions.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print the version of the program and
exit.</p>

<p>-z, --uncompress Try to look inside compressed
files.</p>

<p>--help Print a help message and exit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variable MAGIC can be used
to set the default magic number file name. If that variable
is set, then file will not attempt to open $HOME/.magic .
file adds &quot;.mime&quot; and/or &quot;.mgc&quot; to the
value of this variable as appropriate. The environment
variable POSIXLY_CORRECT controls (on systems that support
symbolic links), if file will attempt to follow symlinks or
not. If set, then file follows symlink, otherwise it does
not. This is also controlled by the L and h options.</p>

<p>STANDARDS CONFORMANCE This program is believed to exceed
the System V Interface Definition of FILE(CMD), as near as
one can determine from the vague language con- tained
therein. Its behaviour is mostly compatible with the System
V program of the same name. This version knows more magic,
however, so it will produce different (albeit more accurate)
output in many cases.</p>

<p>The one significant difference between this version and
System V is that this version treats any white space as a
delimiter, so that spaces in pattern strings must be
escaped. For example, &gt;10 string language impress
(imPRESS data) in an existing magic file would have to be
changed to &gt;10 string language impress (imPRESS data) In
addition, in this version, if a pattern string contains a
backslash, it must be escaped. For example g i n d a 0
string tw Toolkit document a A n d r in an existing magic
file would have to be changed to 0 string \begindata Andrew
Toolkit document</p>

<p>SunOS releases 3.2 and later from Sun Microsystems
include a file(1) command derived from the System V one, but
with some extensions. My version differs from Sun s only in
minor ways. It includes the exten- sion of the &amp;
operator, used as, for example, &gt;16 long&amp;0x7fffffff
&gt;0 not stripped</p>

<p>MAGIC DIRECTORY The magic file entries have been
collected from various sources, mainly USENET, and
contributed by various authors. Christos Zoulas (address
below) will collect additional or corrected magic file
entries. A con- solidation of magic file entries will be
distributed periodically.</p>

<p>The order of entries in the magic file is significant.
Depending on what system you are using, the order that they
are put together may be incorrect. If your old file command
uses a magic file, keep the old magic file around for
comparison purposes (rename it to
/usr/share/file/magic.orig).</p>

<p>HISTORY There has been a file command in every UNIX
since at least Research Version 4 (man page dated November,
1973). The System V version intro- duced one significant
major change: the external list of magic number types. This
slowed the program down slightly but made it a lot more
flexible.</p>

<p>This program, based on the System V version, was written
by Ian Darwin &lt;ian@darwinsys.com&gt; without looking at
anybody else s source code.</p>

<p>John Gilmore revised the code extensively, making it
better than the first version. Geoff Collyer found several
inadequacies and provided some magic file entries.

<p>BUGS There must be a better way to automate the
construction of the Magic file from all the glop in magdir.
What is it? Better yet, the magic file should be compiled
into binary (say, ndbm(3) or, better yet, fixed-length ASCII
strings for use in heterogenous network environ- ments) for
faster startup. Then the program would run as fast as the
Version 7 program of the same name, with the flexibility of
the System V version.</p>

<p>File uses several algorithms that favor speed over
accuracy, thus it can be misled about the contents of text
files.</p>

<p>The support for text files (primarily for programming
languages) is simplistic, inefficient and requires
recompilation to update.</p>

<p>There should be an else clause to follow a series of
continuation lines.</p>

<p>The magic file and keywords should have regular
expression support. Their use of ASCII TAB as a field
delimiter is ugly and makes it hard to edit the files, but
is entrenched.</p>

<p>It might be advisable to allow upper-case letters in
keywords for e.g., troff(1) commands vs man page macros.
Regular expression support would make this easy.</p>

<p>The program doesn t grok FORTRAN. It should be able to
figure FORTRAN by seeing some keywords which appear indented
at the start of line. Regular expression support would make
this easy.</p>

<p>The list of keywords in ascmagic probably belongs in the
Magic file. This could be done by using some keyword like *
for the offset value.</p>

<p>Another optimisation would be to sort the magic file so
that we can just run down all the tests for the first byte,
first word, first long, etc, once we have fetched it.
Complain about conflicts in the magic file entries. Make a
rule that the magic entries sort based on file offset rather
than position within the magic file?</p>

<p>The program should provide a way to give an estimate of
how good a guess is. We end up removing guesses (e.g. From
as first 5 chars of file) because they are not as good as
other guesses (e.g. News- groups: versus Return-Path:).
Still, if the others dont pan out, it should be possible to
use the first guess.</p>

<p>This program is slower than some vendors file commands.
The new sup- port for multiple character codes makes it even
slower.</p>

<p>This manual page, and particularly this section, is too
long.</p>

<p>RETURN CODE Returns 0 on success, and non-zero on
error.</p>

<p>If the file named by the file operand does not exist,
cannot be read, or the type of the file named by the file
operand cannot be determined, this is not be considered an
error that affects the exit status.</p>
