<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

INTRO(3TIFF)</p>

<p>NAME libtiff - introduction to libtiff, a library for
reading and writing TIFF files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</p>

<p>cc file.c -ltiff</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION libtiff is a library for reading and writing
data files encoded with the Tag Image File format, Revision
6.0 (or revision 5.0 or revision 4.0). This file format is
suitable for archiving multi-color and monochromatic image
data.</p>

<p>The library supports several compression algorithms, as
indicated by the Compression field, including: no
compression (1), CCITT 1D Huffman compression (2), CCITT
Group 3 Facsimile compression (3), CCITT Group 4 Facsimile
compression (4), Lempel-Ziv &amp; Welch compression (5),
baseline JPEG compression (7), word-aligned 1D Huffman
compression (32771), and PackBits compression (32773). In
addition, several nonstandard com- pression algorithms are
supported: the 4-bit compression algorithm used by the
ThunderScan program (32809) (decompression only), NeXTs
2-bit compression algorithm (32766) (decompression only), an
experimental LZ- style algorithm known as Deflate (32946),
and an experimental CIE LogLuv compression scheme designed
for images with high dynamic range (32845 for LogL and 32845
for LogLuv). Directory information may be in either little-
or big-endian byte order-byte swapping is automatically done
by the library. Data bit ordering may be either Most
Significant Bit (MSB) to Least Significant Bit (LSB) or LSB
to MSB. Finally, the library does not support files in which
the BitsPerSample, Compression, MinSampleValue, or
MaxSampleValue fields are defined differently on a
per-sample basis (in Rev. 6.0 the Compression tag is not
defined on a per-sample basis, so this is immaterial).</p>

<p>DATA TYPES The library makes extensive use of C typedefs
to promote portability. Two sets of typedefs are used, one
for communication with clients of the library and one for
internal data structures and parsing of the TIFF format. The
following typedefs are exposed to users either through
function definitions or through parameters passed through
the varargs interfaces. typedef unsigned short uint16;
16-bit unsigned integer typedef unsigned &lt;thing&gt;
uint32; 32-bit unsigned integer typedef unsigned int ttag_t;
directory tag typedef uint16 tdir_t; directory index typedef
uint16 tsample_t; sample number typedef uint32 tstrip_t;
strip number typedef uint32 ttile_t; tile number typedef
int32 tsize_t; i/o size in bytes typedef void* tdata_t;
image data ref typedef void* thandle_t; client data handle
typedef int32 toff_t; file offset Note that tstrip_t,
ttile_t, and tsize_t are constrained to be no more than
32-bit quantities by 32-bit fields they are stored in in the
TIFF image. Likewise tsample_t is limited by the 16-bit
field used to store the SamplesPerPixel tag. tdir_t
constrains the maximum number of IFDs that may appear in an
image and may be an arbitrary size (w/o penalty). ttag_t
must be either int, unsigned int, pointer, or double because
the library uses a varargs interface and ANSI C restricts
the type of the parameter before an ellipsis to be a
promoted type. toff_t is defined as int32 because TIFF file
offsets are (unsigned) 32-bit quantities. A signed value is
used because some interfaces return -1 on error. Finally,
note that user-specified data references are passed as
opaque handles and only cast at the lowest layers where
their type is pre- sumed.</p>

<p>TAG USAGE The table below lists the TIFF tags that are
recognized and handled by the library. If no use is
indicated in the table, then the library reads and writes
the tag, but does not use it internally. Note that some tags
are meaningful only when a particular compression scheme is
being used; e.g. Group3Options is only useful if Compression
is set to CCITT Group 3 encoding. Tags of this sort are
considered codec-spe- cific tags and the library does not
recognize them except when the Com- pression tag has been
previously set to the relevant compression scheme.</p>

<p>PSEUDO TAGS In addition to the normal TIFF tags the
library supports a collection of tags whose values lie in a
range outside the valid range of TIFF tags. These tags are
termed pseud-tags and are used to control various
codec-specific functions within the library. The table below
summa- rizes the defined pseudo-tags.</p>

<p>Tag Name Codec R/W Library Use/Notes TIFFTAG_FAXMODE G3
R/W general codec operation TIFFTAG_FAXFILLFUNC G3/G4 R/W
bitmap fill function TIFFTAG_JPEGQUALITY JPEG R/W
compression quality control TIFFTAG_JPEGCOLORMODE JPEG R/W
control colorspace conversions TIFFTAG_JPEGTABLESMODE JPEG
R/W control contents of JPEGTables tag TIFFTAG_ZIPQUALITY
Deflate R/Wcompression quality level TIFFTAG_PIXARLOGDATAFMT
PixarLog R/Wuser data format TIFFTAG_PIXARLOGQUALITY
PixarLog R/Wcompression quality level TIFFTAG_SGILOGDATAFMT
SGILog R/W user data format</p>

<p>TIFFTAG_FAXMODE Control the operation of the Group 3
codec. Possible values (independent bits that can be
combined by oring them together) are: FAXMODE_CLASSIC
(enable old-style format in which the RTC is written at the
end of the last strip), FAXMODE_NORTC (oppo- site of
FAXMODE_CLASSIC; also called FAXMODE_CLASSF), FAX-
MODE_NOEOL (do not write EOL codes at the start of each row
of data), FAXMODE_BYTEALIGN (align each encoded row to an
8-bit boundary), FAXMODE_WORDALIGN (align each encoded row
to an 16-bit boundary), The default value is dependent on
the compres- sion scheme; this pseudo-tag is used by the
various G3 and G4 codecs to share code.</p>

<p>TIFFTAG_FAXFILLFUNC Control the function used to convert
arrays of black and white runs to packed bit arrays. This
hook can be used to image decoded scanlines in multi-bit
depth rasters (e.g. for display in colormap mode) or for
other purposes. The default value is a pointer to a builtin
function that images packed bilevel data.</p>

<p>TIFFTAG_IPTCNEWSPHOTO Tag contaings image metadata per
the IPTC newsphoto spec: Head- line, captioning, credit,
etc... Used by most wire services.</p>

<p>TIFFTAG_PHOTOSHOP Tag contains Photoshop captioning
information and metadata. Pho- toshop uses in parallel and
redundantly alongside IPTCNEWSPHOTO information.</p>

<p>TIFFTAG_JPEGQUALITY Control the compression quality
level used in the baseline algo- rithm. Note that quality
levels are in the range 0-100 with a default value of
75.</p>

<p>TIFFTAG_JPEGCOLORMODE Control whether or not conversion
is done between RGB and YCbCr colorspaces. Possible values
are: JPEGCOLORMODE_RAW (do not convert), and
JPEGCOLORMODE_RGB (convert to/from RGB) The default value is
JPEGCOLORMODE_RAW.</p>

<p>TIFFTAG_JPEGTABLESMODE Control the information written
in the JPEGTables tag. Possible values (independent bits
that can be combined by oring them together) are:
JPEGTABLESMODE_QUANT (include quantization tables), and
JPEGTABLESMODE_HUFF (include Huffman encoding tables). The
default value is JPEGTABLESMODE_QUANT|JPEGTA-
BLESMODE_HUFF.</p>

<p>TIFFTAG_ZIPQUALITY Control the compression technique
used by the Deflate codec. Quality levels are in the range
1-9 with larger numbers yielding better compression at the
cost of more computation. The default quality level is 6
which yields a good time-space tradeoff.</p>

<p>TIFFTAG_PIXARLOGDATAFMT Control the format of user data
passed in to the PixarLog codec when encoding and passed out
from when decoding. Possible values are:
PIXARLOGDATAFMT_8BIT for 8-bit unsigned pixels,
PIXARLOGDATAFMT_8BITABGR for 8-bit unsigned ABGR-ordered
pixels, PIXARLOGDATAFMT_11BITLOG for 11-bit log-encoded raw
data, PIXAR- LOGDATAFMT_12BITPICIO for 12-bit
PICIO-compatible data, PIXAR- LOGDATAFMT_16BIT for 16-bit
signed samples, and PIXARLOG- DATAFMT_FLOAT for 32-bit IEEE
floating point samples.</p>

<p>TIFFTAG_PIXARLOGQUALITY Control the compression
technique used by the PixarLog codec. This value is treated
identically to TIFFTAG_ZIPQUALITY; see the above
description.</p>

<p>TIFFTAG_SGILOGDATAFMT Control the format of client data
passed in to the SGILog codec when encoding and passed out
from when decoding. Possible val- ues are:
SGILOGDATAFMT_FLTXYZ for converting between LogLuv and
32-bit IEEE floating valued XYZ pixels,
SGILOGDATAFMT_16BITLUV for 16-bit encoded Luv pixels,
SGILOGDATAFMT_32BITRAW and SGILOGDATAFMT_24BITRAW for no
conversion of data, SGILOG- DATAFMT_8BITRGB for returning
8-bit RGB data (valid only when decoding LogLuv-encoded
data), SGILOGDATAFMT_FLTY for converting between LogL and
32-bit IEEE floating valued Y pixels, SGILOG- DATAFMT_16BITL
for 16-bit encoded L pixels, and SGILOG- DATAFMT_8BITGRY for
returning 8-bit greyscale data (valid only when decoding
LogL-encoded data).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error messages are directed through the
TIFFError routine. By default messages are directed to
stderr in the form: module: messagen. Warning messages are
likewise directed through the TIFFWarning routine.</p>
