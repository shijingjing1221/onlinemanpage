<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) LOGROTATE(8) System
Administrator s Manual LOGROTATE(8)</p>

<p>NAME logrotate - rotates, compresses, and mails system
logs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS logrotate [-dv] [-f|--force] [-s|--state file]
config_file+</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION logrotate is designed to ease administration
of systems that generate large numbers of log files. It
allows automatic rotation, compression, removal, and mailing
of log files. Each log file may be handled daily, weekly,
monthly, or when it grows too large.</p>

<p>Normally, logrotate is run as a daily cron job. It will
not modify a log multiple times in one day unless the
criterium for that log is based on the logs size and
logrotate is being run multiple times each day, or unless
the -f or --force option is used.</p>

<p>Any number of config files may be given on the command
line. Later con- fig files may override the options given in
earlier files, so the order in which the logrotate config
files are listed in is important. Nor- mally, a single
config file which includes any other config files which are
needed should be used. See below for more information on how
to use the include directive to accomplish this. If a
directory is given on the command line, every file in that
directory is used as a config file.</p>

<p>If no command line arguments are given, logrotate will
print version and copyright information, along with a short
usage summary. If any errors occur while rotating logs,
logrotate will exit with non-zero status.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --?, --help -Prints help message.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Turn on verbose mode.</p>

<p>-d, --debug Turns on debug mode and implies -v. In debug
mode, no changes will be made to the logs or to the
logrotate state file.</p>

<p>-f, --force Tells logrotate to force the rotation, even
if it doesnt think this is necessary. Sometimes this is
useful after adding new entries to logrotate, or if old log
files have been removed by hand, as the new files will be
created, and logging will con- tinue correctly.</p>

<p>-m, --mail &lt;command&gt; Tells logrotate which command
to use when mailing logs. This command should accept two
arguments: 1) the subject of the mes- sage, and 2) the
recipient. The command must then read a message on standard
input and mail it to the recipient. The default mail command
is /bin/mail -s.</p>

<p>-s, --state &lt;statefile&gt; Tells logrotate to use an
alternate state file. This is useful if logrotate is being
run as a different user for various sets of log files. The
default state file is /var/lib/logrotate.sta- tus.</p>

<p>--usage Prints a short usage message.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE logrotate reads everything about the
log files it should be handling from the series of
configuration files specified on the command line. Each
configuration file can set global options (local definitions
over- ride global ones, and later definitions override
earlier ones) and specify logfiles to rotate. A simple
configuration file looks like this:</p>

<p># sample logrotate configuration file compress</p>

<p>/var/log/messages { rotate 5 weekly postrotate
/sbin/killall -HUP syslogd endscript }</p>

<p>&quot;/var/log/httpd/access.log&quot;
/var/log/httpd/error.log { rotate 5 mail www@my.org size
100k sharedscripts postrotate /sbin/killall -HUP httpd
endscript }</p>

<p>/var/log/news/* { monthly rotate 2 olddir
/var/log/news/old missingok postrotate kill -HUP cat
/var/run/inn.pid endscript nocompress }</p>

<p>The first few lines set global options; in the example,
logs are com- pressed after they are rotated. Note that
comments may appear anywhere in the config file as long as
the first non-whitespace character on the line is a #.</p>

<p>The next section of the config files defined how to
handle the log file /var/log/messages. The log will go
through five weekly rotations before being removed. After
the log file has been rotated (but before the old version of
the log has been compressed), the command /sbin/killall -HUP
syslogd will be executed.</p>

<p>The next section defines the parameters for both
/var/log/httpd/access.log and /var/log/httpd/error.log. They
are rotated whenever it grows over 100k in size, and the old
logs files are mailed (uncompressed) to www@my.org after
going through 5 rotations, rather then being removed. The
sharedscripts means that the postrotate script will only be
run once, not once for each log which is rotated. Note that
the double quotes around the first filename at the beginning
of this section allows logrotate to rotate logs with spaces
in the name. Normal shell quoting rules apply, with ,
&quot;, and characters supported.</p>

<p>The last section defines the parameters for all of the
files in /var/log/news. Each file is rotated on a monthly
basis. This is con- sidered a single rotation directive and
if errors occur for more then one file, the log files are
not compressed.</p>

<p>Please use wildcards with caution. If you specify *,
logrotate will rotate all files, including previously
rotated ones. A way around this is to use the olddir
directive or a more exact wildcard (such as *.log).</p>

<p>Here is more information on the directives which may be
included in a logrotate configuration file:</p>

<p>compress Old versions of log files are compressed with
gzip by default. See also nocompress.</p>

<p>compresscmd Specifies which command to use to compress
log files. The default is gzip. See also compress.</p>

<p>uncompresscmd Specifies which command to use to
uncompress log files. The default is gunzip.</p>

<p>compressext Specifies which extension to use on
compressed logfiles, if com- pression is enabled. The
default follows that of the configured compression
command.</p>

<p>compressoptions Command line options may be passed to
the compression program, if one is in use. The default, for
gzip, is &quot;-9&quot; (maximum com- pression).</p>

<p>copy Make a copy of the log file, but dont change the
original at all. This option can be used, for instance, to
make a snapshot of the current log file, or when some other
utility needs to truncate or pare the file. When this option
is used, the create option will have no effect, as the old
log file stays in place.</p>

<p>copytruncate Truncate the original log file in place
after creating a copy, instead of moving the old log file
and optionally creating a new one, It can be used when some
program can not be told to close its logfile and thus might
continue writing (appending) to the previous log file
forever. Note that there is a very small time slice between
copying the file and truncating it, so some log- ging data
might be lost. When this option is used, the create option
will have no effect, as the old log file stays in place.</p>

<p>create mode owner group Immediately after rotation
(before the postrotate script is run) the log file is
created (with the same name as the log file just rotated).
mode specifies the mode for the log file in octal (the same
as chmod(2)), owner specifies the user name who will own the
log file, and group specifies the group the log file will
belong to. Any of the log file attributes may be omitted, in
which case those attributes for the new file will use the
same values as the original log file for the omitted
attributes. This option can be disabled using the nocreate
option.</p>

<p>daily Log files are rotated every day.</p>

<p>dateext Archive old versions of log files adding a daily
extension like YYYYMMDD instead of simply adding a
number.</p>

<p>delaycompress Postpone compression of the previous log
file to the next rota- tion cycle. This has only effect when
used in combination with compress. It can be used when some
program can not be told to close its logfile and thus might
continue writing to the previ- ous log file for some
time.</p>

<p>extension ext Log files with ext extension can keep it
after the rotation. If compression is used, the compression
extension (normally .gz) appears after ext. For example you
have a logfile named mylog.foo and want to rotate it to
mylog.1.foo.gz instead of mylog.foo.1.gz.</p>

<p>ifempty Rotate the log file even if it is empty,
overiding the notifempty option (ifempty is the
default).</p>

<p>include file_or_directory Reads the file given as an
argument as if it was included inline where the include
directive appears. If a directory is given, most of the
files in that directory are read in alphabetic order before
processing of the including file continues. The only files
which are ignored are files which are not regular files
(such as directories and named pipes) and files whose names
end with one of the taboo extensions, as specified by the
tabooext directive. The include directive may not appear
inside of a log file definition.</p>

<p>mail address When a log is rotated out-of-existence, it
is mailed to address. If no mail should be generated by a
particular log, the nomail directive may be used.</p>

<p>mailfirst When using the mail command, mail the
just-rotated file, instead of the about-to-expire file.</p>

<p>maillast When using the mail command, mail the
about-to-expire file, instead of the just-rotated file (this
is the default).</p>

<p>maxage count Remove rotated logs older than
&lt;count&gt; days. The age is only checked if the logfile
is to be rotated. The files are mailed to the configured
address if maillast and mail are configured.</p>

<p>minsize size Log files are rotated when they grow bigger
then size bytes, but not before the additionally specified
time interval (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly). The
related size option is similar except that it is mutually
exclusive with the time interval options, and it causes log
files to be rotated without regard for the last rotation
time. When minsize is used, both the size and timestamp of a
log file are considered.</p>

<p>missingok If the log file is missing, go on to the next
one without issu- ing an error message. See also
nomissingok.</p>

<p>monthly Log files are rotated the first time logrotate
is run in a month (this is normally on the first day of the
month).</p>

<p>nocompress Old versions of log files are not compressed
with gzip. See also compress.</p>

<p>nocopy Do not copy the original log file and leave it in
place. (this overrides the copy option).</p>

<p>nocopytruncate Do not truncate the original log file in
place after creating a copy (this overrides the copytruncate
option).</p>

<p>nocreate New log files are not created (this overrides
the create option).</p>

<p>nodelaycompress Do not postpone compression of the
previous log file to the next rotation cycle (this overrides
the delaycompress option).</p>

<p>nodateext Do not archive old versions of log files with
date extension (this overrides the dateext option).</p>

<p>nomail Dont mail old log files to any address.</p>

<p>nomissingok If a log file does not exist, issue an
error. This is the default.</p>

<p>noolddir Logs are rotated in the same directory the log
normally resides in (this overrides the olddir option).</p>

<p>nosharedscripts Run prerotate and postrotate scripts for
every log file which is rotated (this is the default, and
overrides the sharedscripts option). The absolute path to
the log file is passed as first argument to the script. If
the scripts exit with error, the remaining actions will not
be executed for the affected log only.</p>

<p>notifempty Do not rotate the log if it is empty (this
overrides the ifempty option).</p>

<p>olddir directory Logs are moved into directory for
rotation. The directory must be on the same physical device
as the log file being rotated, and is assumed to be relative
to the directory holding the log file unless an absolute
path name is specified. When this option is used all old
versions of the log end up in directory. This option may be
overriden by the noolddir option.</p>

<p>postrotate/endscript The lines between postrotate and
endscript (both of which must appear on lines by themselves)
are executed (using /bin/sh) after the log file is rotated.
These directives may only appear inside a log file
definition. Normally, the absolute path to the log file is
passed as first argument to the script. If shared- scripts
is specified, whole pattern is passed to the script See
prerotate as well.</p>

<p>prerotate/endscript The lines between prerotate and
endscript (both of which must appear on lines by themselves)
are executed (using /bin/sh) before the log file is rotated
and only if the log will actually be rotated. These
directives may only appear inside a log file definition.
Normally, the absolute path to the log file is passed as
first argument to the script. If sharedscripts is specified,
whole pattern is passed to the script. See also
postrotate.</p>

<p>firstaction/endscript The lines between firstaction and
endscript (both of which must appear on lines by themselves)
are executed (using /bin/sh) once before all log files that
match the wildcarded pattern are rotated, before prerotate
script is run and only if at least one log will actually be
rotated. These directives may only appear inside a log file
definition. Whole pattern is passed to the script as first
argument. If the script exits with error, no further
processing is done. See also lastaction.</p>

<p>lastaction/endscript The lines between lastaction and
endscript (both of which must appear on lines by themselves)
are executed (using /bin/sh) once after all log files that
match the wildcarded pattern are rotated, after postrotate
script is run and only if at least one log is rotated. These
directives may only appear inside a log file definition.
Whole pattern is passed to the script as first argument. If
the script exits with error, just an error message is shown
(as this is the last action). See also firstaction.</p>

<p>rotate count Log files are rotated &lt;count&gt; times
before being removed or mailed to the address specified in a
mail directive. If count is 0, old versions are removed
rather then rotated.</p>

<p>size size Log files are rotated only if they grow bigger
then size bytes. If size is followed by M, the size if
assumed to be in megabytes. If the k is used, the size is in
kilobytes. So size 100, size 100k, and size 100M are all
valid.</p>

<p>sharedscripts Normally, prescript and postscript scripts
are run for each log which is rotated and the absolute path
to the log file is passed as first argument to the script.
That means a single script may be run multiple times for log
file entries which match multiple files (such as the
/var/log/news/* example). If sharedscripts is specified, the
scripts are only run once, no matter how many logs match the
wildcarded pattern, and whole pattern is passed to them.
However, if none of the logs in the pattern require
rotating, the scripts will not be run at all. This option
over- rides the nosharedscripts option and implies create
option.</p>

<p>start count This is the number to use as the base for
rotation. For example, if you specify 0, the logs will be
created with a .0 extension as they are rotated from the
original log files. If you specify 9, log files will be
created with a .9, skipping 0-8. Files will still be rotated
the number of times specified with the count directive.</p>

<p>tabooext [+] list The current taboo extension list is
changed (see the include directive for information on the
taboo extensions). If a + pre- cedes the list of extensions,
the current taboo extension list is augmented, otherwise it
is replaced. At startup, the taboo extension list contains
.rpmsave, .rpmorig, ~, ,v, .disabled, .dpkg-old, .dpkg-dist,
.dpkg-new, .cfsaved, .ucf-old, .ucf-dist, .ucf-new, .rpmnew,
.swp, .cfsaved and .rhn-cfg-tmp-*.</p>

<p>weekly Log files are rotated if the current weekday is
less then the weekday of the last rotation or if more then a
week has passed since the last rotation. This is normally
the same as rotating logs on the first day of the week, but
it works better if logro- tate is not run every night.</p>

<p>yearly Log files are rotated if the current year is not
the same as the last rotation.</p>

<p>FILES /var/lib/logrotate.status Default state file.
/etc/logrotate.conf Configuration options.</p>
