<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) MINICOM(1)
MINICOM(1)</p>

<p>NAME minicom - friendly serial communication program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS minicom [-somMlwz8] [-c on|off] [-S script] [-d
entry] [-a on|off] [-t term] [-p pty] [-C capturefile]
[configuration]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION minicom is a communication program which
somewhat resembles the share- ware program TELIX but is free
with source code and runs under most unices. Features
include dialing directory with auto-redial, support for
UUCP-style lock files on serial devices, a seperate script
language interpreter, capture to file, multiple users with
individual configura- tions, and more.</p>

<p>COMMAND-LINE -s Setup. Root edits the system-wide
defaults in /etc/minirc.dfl with this option. When it is
used, minicom does not initialize, but puts you directly
into the configuration menu. This is very handy if minicom
refuses to start up because your system has changed, or for
the first time you run minicom. For most systems, reasonable
defaults are already compiled in.</p>

<p>-o Do not initialize. Minicom will skip the
initialization code. This option is handy if you quitted
from minicom without reset- ting, and then want to restart a
session. It is potentially dan- gerous though: no check for
lock files etc. is made, so a normal user could interfere
with things like uucp... Maybe this will be taken out later.
For now it is assumed, that users who are given access to a
modem are responsible enough for their actions.</p>

<p>-m Override command-key with the Meta or ALT key. This
is the default in 1.80 and it can also be configured in one
of minicoms menus, but if you use different terminals all
the time, of which some don t have a Meta or ALT key, its
handy to set the default com- mand key to Ctrl-A and use
this option when you have a keyboard supporting Meta or ALT
keys. Minicom assumes that your Meta key sends the ESC
prefix, not the other variant that sets the highest bit of
the character.</p>

<p>-M Same as -m, but assumes that your Meta key sets the
8th bit of the character high (sends 128 + character
code).</p>

<p>-z Use terminal status line. This only works on
terminals that sup- port it and that have the relevant
information in their termcap or terminfo database entry.</p>

<p>-l Literal translation of characters with the high bit
set. With this flag on, minicom will not try to translate
the IBM line characters to ASCII, but passes them straight
trough. Many PC-unix clones will display them correctly
without translation (Linux in a spe- cial mode, Coherent and
Sco).</p>

<p>-L Ditto but assume screen uses an ISO8859 character
set.</p>

<p>-w Turns linewrap on at startup by default.</p>

<p>-a Attribute usage. Some terminals, notably televideos,
have a rot- ten attribute handling (serial instead of
parallel). By default, minicom uses -a on , but if you are
using such a terminal you can (must!) supply the option -a
off. The trailing on or off is needed.</p>

<p>-t Terminal type. With this flag, you can override the
environment TERM variable. This is handy for use in the
MINICOM environment variable; one can create a special
termcap entry for use with minicom on the console, that
initializes the screen to raw mode so that in conjunction
with the -l flag, the IBM line characters are displayed
untranslated.</p>

<p>-c Color usage. Some terminals (such as the Linux
console) support color with the standard ANSI escape
sequences. Because there is apparently no termcap support
for color, these escape sequences are hard-coded into
minicom. Therefore this option is off by default. You can
turn it on with -c on . This, and the -m option, are good
candidates to put into the MINICOM environment variable.</p>

<p>-S script. Run the named script at startup. So far,
passing username and password to a startup script is not
supported. If you also use the -d option to start dialing at
startup, the -S script will be run BEFORE dialing the
entries specified with -d.</p>

<p>-d Dial an entry from the dialing directory on startup.
You can spec- ify an index number, but also a substring of
the name of the entry. If you specify a name that has
multiple entries in the directory, they are all tagged for
dialing. You can also specify multiple names or index
numbers by separating them with commas. The dialing will
start from the first entry specified after all other program
initialization procedures are completed.</p>

<p>-p Pseudo terminal to use. This overrrides the terminal
port defined in the configuration files, but only if it is a
pseudo tty. The filename supplied must be of the form
(/dev/)tty[p-z/][0-f], (/dev/)pts[p-z/][0-f] or
(/dev/)pty[p-z/][0-f]. For example, /dev/ttyp1, pts/0 or
/dev/ptyp2.</p>

<p>-C filename. Open capture file at startup.</p>

<p>-T Disable the display of the online time in the status
bar.</p>

<p>-8 8bit characters pass through without any
modification. Continu- ous means no locate/attribute control
sequences are inserted without real change of
locate/attribute. This mode is to display 8bit multibyte
characters such as Japanese. Not needed in every language
with 8bit characters. (For example displaying Finnish text
doesnt need this.)</p>

<p>When minicom starts, it first searches the MINICOM
environment variable for command-line arguments, which can
be over-ridden on the command line. Thus, if you have
done</p>

<p>MINICOM=-m -c on export MINICOM</p>

<p>or the equivalent, and start minicom, minicom will
assume that your terminal has a Meta or &lt;ALT&gt; key and
that color is supported. If you then log in from a terminal
without color support, and you have set MINICOM in your
startup (.profile or equivalent) file, and dont want to
re-set your environment variable, you can type minicom -c
off and run without color support for that session.</p>

<p>configuration The configuration argument is more
interesting. Normally, minicom gets its defaults from a file
called &quot;minirc.dfl&quot;. If you however give an
argument to minicom, it will try to get its defaults from a
file called &quot;minirc.configuration&quot;. So it is
possible to create multiple configuration files, for
different ports, different users etc. Most sensible is to
use device names, such as tty1, tty64, sio2 etc. If a user
creates his own configuration file, it will show up in his
home directory as .minirc.dfl.</p>

<p>USE Minicom is window based. To popup a window with the
function you want, press Control-A (from now on, we will use
C-A to mean Control-A), and then the function key (a-z or
A-Z). By pressing C-A first and then z, a help screen comes
up with a short summary of all commands. This escape key can
be altered when minicom is configured (-s option or C-A O),
but well stick to Control-A for now.</p>

<p>For every menu the next keys can be used: UP arrow-up or
k DOWN arrow-down or j LEFT arrow-left or h RIGHT
arrow-right or l CHOOSE Enter CANCEL ESCape.</p>

<p>The screen is divided into two portions: the upper 24
lines are the terminal-emulator screen. In this window, ANSI
or VT100 escape sequences are interpreted. If there is a
line left at the bottom, a status line is placed there. If
this is not possible the status line will be showed every
time you press C-A. On terminals that have a spe- cial
status line that will be used if the termcap information is
com- plete and the -k flag has been given.</p>

<p>Possible commands are listed next, in alphabetical
order. C-A Pressing C-A a second time will just send a C-A
to the remote sys- tem. If you have changed your
&quot;escape character&quot; to something other than C-A,
this works analogously for that character. A Toggle Add
Linefeed on/off. If it is on, a linefeed is added before
every carriage return displayed on the screen. B Gives you a
scroll back buffer. You can scroll up with u, down with d, a
page up with b, a page down with f, and if you have them the
arrow and page up/page down keys can also be used. You can
search for text in the buffer with s (case-sensitive) or S
(case- insensitive). N will find the next occurrence of the
string. c will enter citation mode. A text cursor appears
and you specify the start line by hitting Enter key. Then
scroll back mode will finish and the contents with prefix
&gt; will be sent. C Clears the screen. D Dial a number, or
go to the dialing directory. E Toggle local echo on and off
(if your version of minicom supports it). F A break signal
is sent to the modem. G Run script (Go). Runs a login
script. H Hangup. I Toggle the type of escape sequence that
the cursor keys send between normal and applications mode.
(See also the comment about the status line below). J Jump
to a shell. On return, the whole screen will be redrawn. K
Clears the screen, runs kermit and redraws the screen upon
return. L Turn Capture file on off. If turned on, all output
sent to the screen will be captured in the file too. M Sends
the modem initialization string. If you are online and the
DCD line setting is on, you are asked for confirmation
before the modem is initialized. O Configure minicom. Puts
you in the configuration menu. P Communication Parameters.
Allows you to change the bps rate, par- ity and number of
bits. Q Exit minicom without resetting the modem. If macros
changed and were not saved, you will have a chance to do so.
R Receive files. Choose from various protocols (external).
If you have the filename selection window and the prompt for
download directory enabled, youll get a selection window for
choosing the directory for downloading. Otherwise the
download directory defined in the Filenames and paths menu
will be used. S Send files. Choose the protocol like you do
with the receive com- mand. If you dont have the filename
selection window enabled (in the File transfer protocols
menu), youll just have to write the filename(s) in a dialog
window. If you have the selection window enabled, a window
will pop up showing the filenames in your upload directory.
You can tag and untag filenames by pressing spacebar, and
move the cursor up and down with the cursor keys or j/k. The
selected filenames are shown highlighted. Directory names
are shown [within brackets] and you can move up or down in
the direc- tory tree by pressing the spacebar twice.
Finally, send the files by pressing ENTER or quit by
pressing ESC. T Choose Terminal emulation: Ansi(color) or
vt100. You can also change the backspace key here, turn the
status line on or off, and define delay (in milliseconds)
after each newline if you need that. W Toggle linewrap
on/off. X Exit minicom, reset modem. If macros changed and
were not saved, you will have a chance to do so. Z Pop up
the help screen.</p>

<p>DIALING DIRECTORY By pressing C-A D the program puts you
in the dialing directory. Select a command by pressing the
capitalized letter or moving cursor right/left with the
arrow keys or the h/l keys and pressing Enter. You can add,
delete or edit entries and move them up and down in the
direc- tory list. By choosing &quot;dial&quot; the phone
numbers of the tagged entries, or if nothing is tagged, the
number of the highlighted entry will be dialed. While the
modem is dialing, you can press escape to cancel dialing.
Any other key will close the dial window, but won t cancel
the dialing itself. Your dialing directory will be saved
into a the file &quot;.dialdir&quot; in your home directory.
You can scroll up and down with the arrow keys, but you can
also scroll complete pages by pressing the PageUp or
PageDown key. If you don t have those, use Control-B (Back-
ward) and Control-F (Forward). You can use the space bar to
tag a num- ber of entries and minicom will rotate trough
this list if a connection cant be made. A &gt; symbol is
drawn in the directory before the names of the tagged
entries.</p>

<p>The &quot;edit&quot; menu speaks for itself, but I will
discuss it briefly here. A - Name The name for this entry B
- Number and its telephone number. C - Dial string # Which
specific dial string you want to use to connect. There are
three different dial strings (prefixes and suffixes) that
can be configured in the Modem and dialing menu. D - Local
echo can be on or off for this system (if your version of
minicom supports it). E - Script The script that must be
executed after a succesfull connec- tion is made (see the
manual for runscript) F - Username The username that is
passed to the runscript program. It is passed in the
environment string &quot;$LOGIN&quot;. G - Password The
password is passed as &quot;$PASS&quot;. H - Terminal
Emulation Use ANSI or VT100 emulation. I - Backspace key
sends What code (Backspace or Delete) the backspace key
sends. J - Linewrap Can be on or off. K - Line settings Bps
rate, bits, parity and number of stop bits to use for this
connection. You can choose current for the speed, so that it
will use whatever speed is being used at that moment (useful
if you have multiple modems). L - Conversion table You may
spacify a character conversion table to be loaded whenever
this entry answers, before running the login script. If this
field is blank, the conversion table stays unchanged. The
edit menu also shows the latest date and time when you
called this entry and the total number of calls there, but
doesnt let you change them. They are updated automatically
when you connect.</p>

<p>The moVe command lets you move the highlighted entry up
or down in the dialing directory with the up/down arrow keys
or the k and j keys. Press Enter or ESC to end moving the
entry.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION By pressing C-A O you will be thrown into
the setup menu. Most settings there can be changed by
everyone, but some are restricted to root only. Those
priviliged settings are marked with a star (*) here.</p>

<p>Filenames and paths This menu defines your default
directories. A - Download directory where the downloaded
files go to. B - Upload directory where the uploaded files
are read from. C - Script directory Where you keep your
login scripts. D - Script program Which program to use as
the script interpreter. Defaults to the program
&quot;runscript&quot;, but if you want to use something else
(eg, /bin/sh or &quot;expect&quot;) it is possible. Stdin
and stdout are con- nected to the modem, stderr to the
screen. If the path is relative (ie, does not start with a
slash) then it s relative to your home directory, except for
the script interpreter. E - Kermit program Where to find the
executable for kermit, and it s options. Some simple macro s
can be used on the command line: %l is expanded to the
complete filename of the dial out-device, %f is expanded to
the serial port file descriptor and %b is expanded to the
current serial port speed. F - Logging options Options to
configure the logfile writing.</p>

<p>A - File name Here you can enter the name of the
logfile. The file will be written in your home directory,
and the default value is &quot;minicom.log&quot;. If you
blank the name, all logging is turned off.</p>

<p>B - Log connects and hangups This option defines whether
or not the logfile is written when the remote end answers
the call or hangs up. Or when you give the hangup command
yourself or leave minicom without hangup while online.</p>

<p>C - Log file transfers Do you want log entries of
receiving and sending files. The log command in the scripts
is not affected by logging options B and C. It is always
executed, if you just have the name of the log file
defined.</p>

<p>File Transfer Protocols Protocols defined here will show
up when C-A s/r is pressed. &quot;Name&quot; in the
beginning of the line is the name that will show up in the
menu. &quot;Program&quot; is the path to the protocol.
&quot;Name&quot; after that defines if the program needs an
argument, eg. a file to be transmit- ted. U/D defines if
this entry should show up in the upload or the download
menu. Fullscr defines if the program should run full screen,
or that minicom will only show its stderr in a window. IO-
Red defines if minicom should attach the program s standard
in and output to the modem port or not. &quot;Multi&quot;
tells the filename selec- tion window whether or not the
protocol can send multiple files with one command. It has no
effect on download protocols, and it is also ignored with
upload protocols if you don t use the filename selec- tion
window. The old sz and rz are not full screen, and have
IO-Red set. However, there are curses based versions of at
least rz that do not want their stdin and stdout redirected,
and run full screen. All file transfer protocols are run
with the UID of the user, and not with UID=root. %l, %f and
%b can be used on the command line as with kermit. Within
this menu you can also define if you want to use the
filename selection window when prompted for files to upload,
and if you like to be prompted for the download directory
every time the automatic download is started. If you leave
the down- load directory prompt disabled, the download
directory defined in the file and directory menu is
used.</p>

<p>Serial port setup *A - Serial device /dev/tty1 or
/dev/ttyS1 for most people. /dev/cua&lt;n&gt; is still
possible under linux, but not recommended any more because
these devices are obsolete and many newly installed systems
with kernel 2.2.x or newer dont have them. Use
/dev/ttyS&lt;n&gt; instead. You may also have /dev/modem as
a symlink to the real device. If you have modems connected
to two or more serial ports, you may specify all of them
here in a list separated by space, comma or semicolon. When
Minicom starts, it checks the list until it finds an
available modem and uses that one. (However, you cant
specify different init strings to them ..at least not yet.)
To use a UNIX socket for communication the device name must
be prefixed with &quot;unix#&quot; following by the full
path and the file- name of the socket. Minicom will then try
to connect to this socket as a client. As long as it cannot
connect to the socket it stays offline. As soon as the
connection establishes, minicom goes online. If the server
closes the socket, minicom switches to offline again. *B -
Lock file location On most systems This should be
/usr/spool/uucp. Linux systems use /var/lock. If this
directory does not exist, minicom will not attempt to use
lockfiles. *C - Callin program If you have a uugetty or
something on your serial port, it could be that you want a
program to be run to switch the modem cq. port into
dialin/dialout mode. This is the program to get into dialin
mode. *D - Callout program And this to get into dialout
mode. E - Bps/Par/Bits Default parameters at startup.</p>

<p>If one of the entries is left blank, it will not be
used. So if you don t care about locking, and dont have a
getty running on your modemline, entries B - D should be
left blank. Be warned! The callin and callout programs are
run with the effective user id of &quot;root&quot;, eg
0!</p>

<p>Modem and Dialing Here, the parameters for your modem
are defined. I will not explain this further because the
defaults are for generic Hayes modems, and should work
always. This file is not a Hayes tutorial :-) The only
things worth noticing are that control characters can be
sent by prefixing them with a ^, in which ^^ means ^ itself,
and the character must also be doubled as \, because
backslash is used specially in the macro definitions. Some
options however, don t have much to do with the modem but
more with the behaviour of minicom itself: M - Dial time The
number of seconds before minicom times out if no connection
is established. N - Delay before redial Minicom will redial
if no connection was made, but it first waits some time. O -
Number of tries Maximum number of times that minicom
attempts to dial. P - Drop DTR time If you set this to 0,
minicom hangs up by sending a Hayes-type hangup sequence. If
you specify a non-zero value, the hangup will be done by
dropping the DTR line. The value tells in sec- onds how long
DTR will be kept down. Q - Auto bps detect If this is on,
minicom tries to match the dialed partys speed. With most
modern modems this is NOT desirable, since the modem buffers
the data and converts the speed. R - Modem has DCD line If
your modem, and your O/S both support the DCD line (that
goes high when a connection is made) minicom will use it.
When you have this option on, minicom will also NOT start
dial- ing while you are already online. S - Status line
shows DTE speed / line speed You can toggle the status line
to show either the DTE speed (the speed which minicom uses
to communicate with your modem) or the line speed (the speed
that your modem uses on the line to communicate with the
other modem). Notice that the line speed may change during
the connection, but you will still only see the initial
speed that the modems started the connection with. This is
because the modem doesnt tell the program if the speed is
changed. Also, to see the line speed, you need to have the
modem set to show it in the connect string. Otherwise you
will only see 0 as the line speed. T - Multi-line untag You
can toggle the feature to untag entries from the dialing
directory when a connection is established to a multi-line
BBS. All the tagged entries that have the same name are
untagged.</p>

<p>Note that a special exception is made for this menu:
every user can change all parameters here, but some of them
will not be saved.</p>

<p>Screen and keyboard A - Command key is the Hot Key that
brings you into command mode. If this is set to ALT or meta
key, you can directly call commands by alt- key instead of
HotKey-key. B - Backspace key sends There still are some
systems that want a VT100 to send DEL instead of BS. With
this option you can enable that stupidity. (Eh, its even on
by default...) C - Status line is Enabled or disabled. Some
slow terminals (for example, X-termi- nals) cause the status
line to jump &quot;up and down&quot; when scrolling, so you
can turn it off if desired. It will still be shown in
command-mode. D - Alarm sound If turned on, minicom will
sound an alarm (on the console only) after a succesfull
connection and when up/downloading is com- plete. E -
Foreground Color (menu) indicates the foreground color to
use for all the configuration windows in minicom. F -
Background Color (menu) indicates the background color to
use for all the configuration windows in minicom. Note that
minicom will not allow you to set forground and background
colors to the same value. G - Foreground Color (term)
indicates the foreground color to use in the terminal
window. H - Background Color (term) indicates the background
color to use in the terminal window. Note that minicom will
not allow you to set forground and background colors to the
same value. I - Foreground Color (stat) indicates the
foreground color to use in for the status bar. J -
Background Color (stat) indicates the color to use in for
the status bar. Note that minicom will allow you to set the
status bars forground and background colors to the same
value. This will effectively make the status bar invisible
but if these are your intensions, please see the option K -
History buffer size The number of lines to keep in the
history buffer (for backscrolling). L - Macros file is the
full path to the file that holds macros. Macros allow you to
define a string to be sent when you press a certain key. In
minicom, you may define F1 through F10 to send up to 256
characters [this is set at compile time]. The filename you
specify is verified as soon as you hit ENTER. If you do not
have permissions to create the specified file, an error
message will so indicate and you will be forced to re-edit
the file- name. If you are permitted to create the file,
minicom checks to see if it already exists. If so, it
assumes its a macro file and reads it in. If it isnt, well,
its your problem :-) If the file does not exist, the
filename is accepted. M - Edit Macros opens up a new window
which allows you to edit the F1 through F10 macros. N -
Macros enabled - Yes or No. If macros are disabled, the
F1-F10 keys will just send the VT100/VT220 function key
escape sequences. O - Character conversion The active
conversion table filename is shown here. If you can see no
name, no conversion is active. Pressing O, you will see the
conversion table edit menu.</p>

<p>Edit Macros Here, the macros for F1 through F10 are
defined. The bottom of the window shows a legend of
character combinations that have special meaning. They allow
you to enter special con- trol characters with plain text by
prefixing them with a ^, in which ^^ means ^ itself. You can
send a 1 second delay with the ^~ code. This is useful when
you are trying to login after ftping or telneting somewhere.
You can also include your current username and password from
the phone directory in the macros with and , respectively.
If you need the backslash character in the macro, write it
dou- bled as \. To edit a macro, press the number (or letter
for F10) and you will be moved to the end of the macro. When
editing the line, you may use the left &amp; right arrows,
Home &amp; End keys, Delete &amp; BackSpace, and ESC and
RETURN. ESC can- cels any changes made while ENTER accepts
the changes.</p>

<p>Character conversion Here you can edit the character
conversion table. If you are not an American, you know that
in many languages there are characters that are not included
in the ASCII character set, and in the old times they may
have replaced some less impor- tant characters in ASCII and
now they are often represented with character codes above
127. AND there are various differ- ent ways to represent
them. This is where you may edit con- version tables for
systems that use a character set different from the one on
your computer.</p>

<p>A - Load table You probably guessed it. This command
loads a table from the disk. You are asked a file name for
the table. Pre- defined tables .mciso, .mcpc8 and .mcsf7
should be included with the program. Table .mciso does no
conver- sion, .mcpc8 is to be used for connections with
systems that use the 8-bit pc character set, and .mcsf7 is
for compatibility with the systems that uses the good old
7-bit coding to replace the characters {|}[] with the
diacritical characters used in Finnish and Swedish.</p>

<p>B - Save table This one saves the active table on the
filename you spec- ify.</p>

<p>C - edit char This is where you can make your own
modifications to the existing table. First you are asked the
character value (in decimal) whose conversion you want to
change. Next you ll say which character you want to see on
your screen when that character comes from the outside
world. And then you ll be asked what you want to be sent out
when you enter that character from your keyboard.</p>

<p>D - next screen</p>

<p>E - prev screen Yeah, you probably noticed that this
screen shows you what kind of conversions are active. The
screen just is (usu- ally) too small to show the whole table
at once in an easy-to-understand format. This is how you can
scroll the table left and right.</p>

<p>F - convert capture Toggles whether or not the character
conversion table is used when writing the capture file.</p>

<p>Save setup as dfl Save the parameters as the default for
the next time the program is started. Instead of dfl, any
other parameter name may appear, depending on which one was
used when the program was started.</p>

<p>Save setup as.. Save the parameters under a special
name. Whenever Minicom is started with this name as an
argument, it will use these parameters. This option is of
course priviliged to root.</p>

<p>Exit Escape from this menu without saving. This can also
be done with ESC.</p>

<p>Exit from minicom Only root will see this menu entry, if
he/she started minicom with the -s option. This way, it is
possible to change the configura- tion without actually
running minicom.</p>

<p>STATUS LINE The status line has several indicators, that
speak for themselves. The mysterious APP or NOR indicator
probably needs explanation. The VT100 cursor keys can be in
two modes: applications mode and cursor mode. This is
controlled by an escape sequence. If you find that the
cursor keys do not work in, say, vi when youre logged in
using minicom then you can see with this indicator whether
the cursor keys are in applica- tions or cursor mode. You
can toggle the two with the C-A I key. If the cursor keys
then work, it s probably an error in the remote systems
termcap initialization strings (is).</p>

<p>LOCALES Minicom has now support for local languages.
This means you can change most of the English messages and
other strings to another language by setting the environment
variable LANG. On September 2001 the supported languages are
Brazilian Portuguese, Finnish, Japanese, French, Polish,
Czech, Russian and Spanish. Turkish is under
construction.</p>

<p>SECURITY ISSUES Since Minicom is run setuid root on some
computers, you probably want to restrict access to it. This
is possible by using a configuration file in the same
directory as the default files, called &quot;mini-
com.users&quot;. The syntax of this file is as
following:</p>

<p>&lt;username&gt; &lt;configuration&gt;
[configuration...]</p>

<p>To allow user miquels to use the default configuration,
enter the following line into &quot;minicom.users&quot;:</p>

<p>miquels dfl</p>

<p>If you want users to be able to use more than the
default configura- tions, just add the names of those
configurations behind the user name. If no configuration is
given behind the username, minicom assumes that the user has
access to all configurations.</p>

<p>MISC If minicom is hung, kill it with SIGTERM . (This
means kill -15, or since sigterm is default, just plain
&quot;kill &lt;minicompid&gt;&quot;. This will cause a
graceful exit of minicom, doing resets and everything. You
may kill minicom from a script with the command &quot;!
killall -9 minicom&quot; without hanging up the line.
Without the -9 parameter, minicom first hangs up before
exiting.</p>

<p>Since a lot of escape sequences begin with ESC (Arrow up
is ESC [ A), Minicom does not know if the escape character
it gets is you pressing the escape key, or part of a
sequence.</p>

<p>An old version of Minicom, V1.2, solved this in a rather
crude way: to get the escape key, you had to press it
twice.</p>

<p>As of release 1.3 this has bettered a little: now a
1-second timeout is builtin, like in vi. For systems that
have the select() system call the timeout is 0.5 seconds.
And... surprise: a special Linux-dependant hack :-) was
added. Now, minicom can separate the escape key and escape-
sequences. To see how dirty this was done, look into
wkeys.c. But it works like a charm!</p>

<p>FILES Minicom keeps it s configuration files in one
directory, usually /var/lib/minicom, /usr/local/etc or /etc.
To find out what default directory minicom has compiled in,
issue the command minicom -h. You ll probably also find the
demo files for runscript(1), and the examples of character
conversion tables either there or in the subdi- rectories of
/usr/doc/minicom*. The conversion tables are named some-
