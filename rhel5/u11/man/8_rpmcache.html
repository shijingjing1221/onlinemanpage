<p>NAME rpmcache - Cache RPM Package Headers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rpmcache [ PACKAGE_NAME ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rpmcache walks a file tree, possibly
remotely using FTP, filtering paths using glob(7)
expressions, reading rpm package headers. The lat- est (i.e.
comparing package epoch/version/release for identical
package names and using the build time as a tie breaker)
package headers, if they are unique, are cached in an rpm
database. The rpm database cache can be used to provide
suggested paths to packages that resolve unknown
dependencies.</p>

<p>There are no rpmcache specific options, only common rpm
options. See the rpmcache usage message for what is
currently implemented.</p>

<p>The file tree path to be searched is configured using
rpm macros. The final path is the concatenation of 5
individual elements. Here are the macro names used to
configure rpmcache, in the same order that they will be
concatenated to build the file tree path that will be
walked:</p>

<p>%_bhpath The &quot;path&quot; level contains the leading
part of the file tree path (or URL) for the file tree to be
walked. No glob(7) expres- sions, here, please.</p>

<p>%_bhcoll The &quot;collection&quot; level contains a
string (or glob(7) expression) to match sub-directories of
%_bhpath.</p>

<p>%_bhN The &quot;name&quot; level contains a string (or
glob(7) expression) to match sub-directories of %_bhcoll.
The PACKAGE_NAME arguments are used to construct a glob(7)
expression that will match any of specific package names
within the Red Hat build system, and are almost certainly
not of use to anyone outside of Red Hat.</p>

<p>%_bhVR The &quot;version-release&quot; level contains a
string (or glob(7) expression) to match sub-directories of
%_bhN.</p>

<p>%_bhA The &quot;arch&quot; level contains a string (or
glob(7) expression) to match sub-directories of %_bhVR.</p>

<p>The location of the cache database is also configured
using an rpm macro:</p>

<p>%_cache_dbpath The location of the cache database. The
default value is /var/spool/up2date/cache.</p>

<p>The cache database is identical in format to an rpm
database, and can be used with rpm from the command line.
For example, to use the cache database to provide
suggestions for packages that provide dependencies needed by
a package install, the following macro should be configured
in either /etc/rpm/macros or ~/.rpmmacros:</p>

<p>%_solve_dbpath The location of the database that is used
to provide suggested dependency resolutions.</p>

<p>Example (minimal) configuration for a Red Hat beehive
tree: %_cache_dbpath /var/spool/up2date/cache %_solve_dbpath
%{_cache_dbpath} %_bhpath
file://localhost/mnt/redhat/beehive/comps/dist %_bhcoll 7.3
%_bhN
@(basesystem|bash|filesystem|glibc-common|glibc|ldconfig|libtermcap|mktemp|setup|termcap)
%_bhVR * %_bhA @(i[3456]86|noarch)</p>

<p>Example (minimal) configuration for a Red Hat FTP tree:
%_cache_dbpath /var/spool/up2date/cache %_solve_dbpath
%{_cache_dbpath} %_bhpath ftp://localhost/mnt/dist %_bhcoll
@(7.3|7.2|7.1|7.0|6.2|6.1|6.0|5.2|5.1|5.0) %_bhN @(%{_arch})
%_bhVR * %_bhA @(i[3456]86|noarch)</p>

<p>BUGS Yup. Please file bug reports and RFEs against the
rpm-devel package using bugzilla:
