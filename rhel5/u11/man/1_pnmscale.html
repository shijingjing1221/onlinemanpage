<p>NAME pnmscale - scale a PNM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmscale [ scale_factor | -xysize cols rows |
-reduce reduction_factor | [-xsize=cols | -width=cols |
-xscale=factor] [-ysize=rows | -height=rows |
-yscale=factor] | -pixels n ] [-verbose] [-nomix]
[pnmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmscale was obsoleted by
pamscale(1),introducedwithNetpbm10.20 (Jan- uary 2004).
pamscale is backward compatible with pnmscale, plus adds
many additional functions, including the ability to process
PAM images, and tends to produce better results.</p>

<p>pnmscale remains in the current Netpbm package because
it probably has fewer bugs for now than pamscale, and may
have superior performance characteristics in some cases.
Some day, pnmscale will probably become an alias for
pamscale.</p>

<p>You can use the pamscale documentation for pnmscale,
considering the following differences:</p>

<p>&middot; pnmscale options are a subset of pamscales, as
documented above.</p>

<p>&middot; pnmscale always assumes the input is linear, as
pamscale does when you specify its -linear option.</p>

<p>&middot; pnmscale cannot process PAM images.</p>
