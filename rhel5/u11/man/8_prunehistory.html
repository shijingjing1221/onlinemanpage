<p>PRUNEHISTORY(8) PRUNEHISTORY(8)</p>

<p>NAME prunehistory - remove tokens from Usenet history
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS prunehistory [ -f filename ] [ -p ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Prunehistory modifies a history(5)-format
text file to remove a set of tokens from it. The tokens are
removed by overwriting them with spaces, so that the size
and position of any following entries does not change. This
has an effect similar to expiring the article, in that it is
still mentioned in the history database but cannot be
retrieved.</p>

<p>Prunehistory reads the standard input. The input is
taken as a set of lines. Blank lines and lines starting with
a number sign (#) are ignored. All other lines are should
consist of a Message-ID followed by zero or more other
fields (which are ignored).</p>

<p>The Message-ID is used as the dbz(3) key to get an
offset into the text file.</p>

<p>Since innd(8) only appends to the text file,
prunehistory does not need to have any interaction with
it.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p Prunehistory will normally complain about
lines that do not fol- low the correct format. If the -p
flag is used, then the program will silently print any
invalid lines on its standard output. (Blank lines and
comment lines are also passed through.) This can be useful
when prunehistory is used as a filter for other programs
such as reap.</p>

<p>-f filename The default name of the history file is
&lt;pathdb in inn.conf&gt;/history; to specify a different
name, use the -f flag.</p>
