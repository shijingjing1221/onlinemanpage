<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

STUNNEL(8)</p>

<p>NAME stunnel - universal SSL tunnel</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Unix: stunnel [&lt;filename&gt;] -fd n -help
-version -sockets</p>

<p>WIN32: stunnel [ [-install -uninstall -start -stop]
[-quiet] [&lt;filename&gt;] ] -help -version -sockets</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The stunnel program is designed to work as
SSL encryption wrapper between remote clients and local
(inetd-startable) or remote servers. The concept is that
having non-SSL aware daemons running on your system you can
easily set them up to communicate with clients over secure
SSL channels.</p>

<p>stunnel can be used to add SSL functionality to commonly
used Inetd daemons like POP-2, POP-3, and IMAP servers, to
standalone daemons like NNTP, SMTP and HTTP, and in
tunneling PPP over network sockets without changes to the
source code.</p>

<p>This product includes cryptographic software written by
Eric Young (eay@cryptsoft.com)</p>

<p>&middot; an option_name = option_value pair</p>

<p>&middot; [service_name] indicating a start of a service
definition</p>

<p>GLOBAL OPTIONS</p>

<p>chroot = directory (Unix only) directory to chroot
stunnel process</p>

<p>chroot keeps stunnel in chrooted jail. CApath, CRLpath,
pid and exec are located inside the jail and the patches
have to be rela- tive to the directory specified with
chroot.</p>

<p>To have libwrap (TCP Wrappers) control effective in a
chrooted environment you also have to copy its configuration
files (/etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny) there.</p>

<p>compression = zlib rle select data compression
algorithm</p>

<p>default: no compression</p>

<p>debug = [facility.]level debugging level</p>

<p>Level is a one of the syslog level names or numbers
emerg (0), alert (1), crit (2), err (3), warning (4), notice
(5), info (6), or debug (7). All logs for the specified
level and all levels numeri- cally less than it will be
shown. Use debug = debug or debug = 7 for greatest debugging
output. The default is notice (5).</p>

<p>The syslog facility authpriv will be used unless a
facility name is supplied. (Facilities are not supported on
Win32.)</p>

<p>Case is ignored for both facilities and levels.</p>

<p>EGD = egd path (Unix only) path to Entropy Gathering
Daemon socket</p>

<p>Entropy Gathering Daemon socket to use to feed OpenSSL
random num- ber generator. (Available only if compiled with
OpenSSL 0.9.5a or higher)</p>

<p>engine = auto &lt;engine id&gt; select hardware
engine</p>

<p>default: software-only cryptography</p>

<p>foreground = yes no (Unix only) foreground mode</p>

<p>Stay in foreground (don t fork) and log to stderr
instead of via syslog (unless output is specified).</p>

<p>default: background in daemon mode</p>

<p>output = file append log messages to a file instead of
using syslog</p>

<p>/dev/stdout device can be used to redirect log messages
to the standard output (for example to log them with
daemontools splog- ger).</p>

<p>pid = file (Unix only) pid file location</p>

<p>If the argument is empty, then no pid file will be
created.</p>

<p>pid path is relative to chroot directory if
specified.</p>

<p>RNDbytes = bytes bytes to read from random seed
files</p>

<p>Number of bytes of data read from random seed files.
With SSL ver- sions less than 0.9.5a, also determines how
many bytes of data are considered sufficient to seed the
PRNG. More recent OpenSSL ver- sions have a builtin function
to determine when sufficient random- ness is available.</p>

<p>RNDfile = file path to file with random seed data</p>

<p>The SSL library will use data from this file first to
seed the ran- dom number generator.</p>

<p>RNDoverwrite = yes no overwrite the random seed files
with new random data</p>

<p>default: yes</p>

<p>service = servicename use specified string as the
service name</p>

<p>On Unix: inetd mode service name for TCP Wrapper
library.</p>

<p>On NT/2000/XP: NT service name in the Control Panel.</p>

<p>default: stunnel</p>

<p>setgid = groupname (Unix only) setgid() to groupname in
daemon mode and clears all other groups</p>

<p>setuid = username (Unix only) setuid() to username in
daemon mode</p>

<p>socket = alr:option=value[:value] Set an option on
accept/local/remote socket</p>

<p>The values for linger option are l_onof:l_linger. The
values for time are tv_sec:tv_usec.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>socket = l:SO_LINGER=1:60 set one minute timeout for
closing local socket socket = r:TCP_NODELAY=1 turn off the
Nagle algorithm for remote sockets socket = r:SO_OOBINLINE=1
place out-of-band data directly into the receive data stream
for remote sockets socket = a:SO_REUSEADDR=0 disable address
reuse (enabled by default) socket = a:SO_BINDTODEVICE=lo
only accept connections on loopback interface</p>

<p>taskbar = yes no (WIN32 only) enable the taskbar
icon</p>

<p>default: yes</p>

<p>SERVICE-LEVEL OPTIONS</p>

<p>Each configuration section begins with service name in
square brackets. The service name is used for libwrap (TCP
Wrappers) access control and lets you distinguish stunnel
services in your log files.</p>

<p>Note that if you wish to run stunnel in inetd mode
(where it is pro- vided a network socket by a server such as
inetd, xinetd, or tcpserver) then you should read the
section entitled INETD MODE below.</p>

<p>accept = [host:]port accept connections on specified
host:port</p>

<p>If no host specified, defaults to all IP addresses for
the local host.</p>

<p>CApath = directory Certificate Authority directory</p>

<p>This is the directory in which stunnel will look for
certificates when using the verify. Note that the
certificates in this directory should be named XXXXXXXX.0
where XXXXXXXX is the hash value of the cert.</p>

<p>CApath path is relative to chroot directory if
specified.</p>

<p>CAfile = certfile Certificate Authority file</p>

<p>This file contains multiple CA certificates, used with
the verify.</p>

<p>cert = pemfile certificate chain PEM file name</p>

<p>A PEM is always needed in server mode. Specifying this
flag in client mode will use this certificate chain as a
client side cer- tificate chain. Using client side certs is
optional. The certifi- cates must be in PEM format and must
be sorted starting with the certificate to the highest level
(root CA).</p>

<p>ciphers = cipherlist Select permitted SSL ciphers</p>

<p>A colon delimited list of the ciphers to allow in the
SSL connec- tion. For example DES-CBC3-SHA:IDEA-CBC-MD5</p>

<p>client = yes no client mode (remote service uses
SSL)</p>

<p>default: no (server mode)</p>

<p>connect = [host:]port connect to remote host:port</p>

<p>If no host specified, defaults to localhost.</p>

<p>CRLpath = directory Certificate Revocation Lists
directory</p>

<p>This is the directory in which stunnel will look for
CRLs when using the verify. Note that the CRLs in this
directory should be named XXXXXXXX.0 where XXXXXXXX is the
hash value of the CRL.</p>

<p>CRLpath path is relative to chroot directory if
specified.</p>

<p>CRLfile = certfile Certificate Revocation Lists file</p>

<p>This file contains multiple CRLs, used with the
verify.</p>

<p>delay = yes no delay DNS lookup for connect option</p>

<p>exec = executable_path (Unix only) execute local
inetd-type program</p>

<p>exec path is relative to chroot directory if
specified.</p>

<p>execargs = $0 $1 $2 ... (Unix only) arguments for exec
including program name ($0)</p>

<p>Quoting is currently not supported. Arguments are
separated with arbitrary number of whitespaces.</p>

<p>ident = username use IDENT (RFC 1413) username
checking</p>

<p>key = keyfile private key for certificate specified with
cert option</p>

<p>Private key is needed to authenticate certificate owner.
Since this file should be kept secret it should only be
readable to its owner. On Unix systems you can use the
following command:</p>

<p>chmod 600 keyfile</p>

<p>default: value of cert option</p>

<p>local = host IP of the outgoing interface is used as
source for remote connec- tions. Use this option to bind a
static local IP address, instead.</p>

<p>options = SSL_options OpenSSL library options</p>

<p>The parameter is the OpenSSL option name as described in
the SSL_CTX_set_options(3ssl) manual, but without SSL_OP_
prefix. Sev- eral options can be used to specify multiple
options.</p>

<p>For example for compatibility with erroneous Eudora SSL
implementa- tion the following option can be used:</p>

<p>options = DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS</p>

<p>protocol = proto application protocol to negotiate
SSL</p>

<p>currently supported: cifs, connect, nntp, pop3, smtp</p>

<p>protocolCredentials = username:password credentials for
protocol negotiations</p>

<p>protocolHost = host:port destination address for
protocol negotiations</p>

<p>pty = yes no (Unix only) allocate pseudo terminal for
exec option</p>

<p>session = timeout session cache timeout</p>

<p>TIMEOUTbusy = seconds time to wait for expected data</p>

<p>TIMEOUTclose = seconds time to wait for close_notify
(set to 0 for buggy MSIE)</p>

<p>TIMEOUTconnect = seconds time to wait to connect a
remote host</p>

<p>TIMEOUTidle = seconds time to keep an idle
connection</p>

<p>transparent = yes no (Unix only) transparent proxy
mode</p>

<p>Re-write address to appear as if wrapped daemon is
connecting from the SSL client machine instead of the
machine running stunnel. This option is only available in
local mode (exec option) by LD_PRELOADing env.so shared
library or in remote mode (connect option) on Linux 2.2
kernel compiled with transparent proxy option and then only
in server mode. Note that this option will not com- bine
with proxy mode (connect) unless the client s default route
to the target machine lies through the host running stunnel,
which cannot be localhost.</p>

<p>verify = level verify peer certificate</p>

<p>level 1 - verify peer certificate if present level 2 -
verify peer certificate level 3 - verify peer with locally
installed certificate default - no verify</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE stunnel returns zero on success, non-zero
on error.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES In order to provide SSL encapsulation to your
local imapd service, use</p>

<p>[imapd] accept = 993 exec = /usr/sbin/imapd execargs =
imapd</p>

<p>If you want to provide tunneling to your pppd daemon on
port 2020, use something like</p>

<p>[vpn] accept = 2020 exec = /usr/sbin/pppd execargs =
pppd local pty = yes</p>

<p>If you want to use stunnel in inetd mode to launch your
imapd process, youd use this stunnel.conf. Note there must
be no [service_name] sec- tion.</p>

<p>exec = /usr/sbin/imapd execargs = imapd</p>

<p>FILES stunnel.conf stunnel configuration file</p>

<p>stunnel.pem stunnel certificate and private key</p>

<p>BUGS Option execargs does not support quoting.</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS stunnel cannot be used for the FTP daemon
because of the nature of the FTP protocol which utilizes
multiple ports for data transfers. There are available SSL
enabled versions of FTP and telnet daemons, however.</p>

<p>NOTES INETD MODE</p>

<p>The most common use of stunnel is to listen on a network
port and establish communication with either a new port via
the connect option, or a new program via the exec option.
However there is a special case when you wish to have some
other program accept incoming connections and launch
stunnel, for example with inetd, xinetd, or tcpserver.</p>

<p>For example, if you have the following line in
inetd.conf:</p>

<p>imaps stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/stunnel stunnel
/etc/stunnel/imaps.conf</p>

<p>In these cases, the inetd-style program is responsible
for binding a network socket (imaps above) and handing it to
stunnel when a connec- tion is received. Thus you do not
want stunnel to have any accept option. All the Service
Level Options should be placed in the global options
section, and no [service_name] section will be present. See
the EXAMPLES section for example configurations.</p>

<p>CERTIFICATES</p>

<p>Each SSL enabled daemon needs to present a valid X.509
certificate to the peer. It also needs a private key to
decrypt the incoming data. The easiest way to obtain a
certificate and a key is to generate them with the free
OpenSSL package. You can find more information on
certificates generation on pages listed below.</p>

<p>Two things are important when generating certificate-key
pairs for stunnel. The private key cannot be encrypted,
because the server has no way to obtain the password from
the user. To produce an unencrypted key add the -nodes
option when running the req command from the OpenSSL
kit.</p>

<p>The order of contents of the .pem file is also
important. It should contain the unencrypted private key
first, then a signed certificate (not certificate request).
There should be also empty lines after cer- tificate and
private key. Plaintext certificate information appended on
the top of generated certificate should be discarded. So the
file should look like this:</p>

<p>-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- [encoded key] -----END
RSA PRIVATE KEY----- [empty line] -----BEGIN
CERTIFICATE----- [encoded certificate] -----END
CERTIFICATE----- [empty line]</p>

<p>RANDOMNESS</p>

<p>stunnel needs to seed the PRNG (pseudo random number
generator) in order for SSL to use good randomness. The
following sources are loaded in order until sufficient
random data has been gathered:</p>

<p>&middot; The file specified with the RNDfile flag.</p>

<p>&middot; The file specified by the RANDFILE environment
variable, if set.</p>

<p>&middot; The file .rnd in your home directory, if
RANDFILE not set.</p>

<p>&middot; The file specified with --with-random at
compile time.</p>

<p>&middot; The contents of the screen if running on
Windows.</p>

<p>&middot; The egd socket specified with the EGD flag.</p>

<p>&middot; The egd socket specified with --with-egd-sock
at compile time.</p>

<p>&middot; The /dev/urandom device.</p>

<p>With recent (&gt;=OpenSSL 0.9.5a) version of SSL it will
stop loading ran- dom data automatically when sufficient
entropy has been gathered. With previous versions it will
continue to gather from all the above sources since no SSL
function exists to tell when enough data is available.</p>

<p>Note that on Windows machines that do not have console
user interaction (mouse movements, creating windows, etc)
the screen contents are not variable enough to be
sufficient, and you should provide a random file for use
with the RNDfile flag.</p>

<p>Note that the file specified with the RNDfile flag
should contain random data -- that means it should contain
different information each time stunnel is run. This is
handled automatically unless the RNDover- write flag is
used. If you wish to update this file manually, the openssl
rand command in recent versions of OpenSSL, would be
useful.</p>

<p>One important note -- if /dev/urandom is available,
OpenSSL has a habit of seeding the PRNG with it even when
checking the random state, so on systems with /dev/urandom
you re likely to use it even though its listed at the very
bottom of the list above. This isn t stunnes behaviour, its
OpenSSLs.</p>
