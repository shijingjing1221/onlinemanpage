<p>NAME cupsdisable, cupsenable - stop/start printers and
classes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cupsdisable [ -E ] [-U username ] [ -c ] [ -h
server[:port] ] [ -r rea- son ] destination(s) cupsenable [
-E ] [-U username ] [ -c ] [ -h server[:port] ] destina-
tion(s)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cupsenable starts the named printers or
classes.</p>

<p>cupsdisable stops the named printers or classes. The
following options may be used:</p>

<p>-E Forces encryption of the connection to the
server.</p>

<p>-U username Uses the specified username when connecting
to the server.</p>

<p>-c Cancels all jobs on the named destination.</p>

<p>-h server[:port] Uses the specified server and port.</p>

<p>-r &quot;reason&quot; Sets the message associated with
the stopped state. If no reason is specified then the
message is set to &quot;Reason Unknown&quot;.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS
allows printer names to con- tain any printable character
except SPACE, TAB, &quot;/&quot;, or &quot;#&quot;. Also,
printer and class names are not case-sensitive.</p>

<p>The System V versions of these commands are disable and
enable. They have been renamed to avoid conflicts with the
bash(1) build-in command of the same name.</p>

<p>The CUPS versions of disable and enable may ask the user
for an access password depending on the printing system
configuration. This differs from the System V versions which
require the root user to execute these commands.</p>
