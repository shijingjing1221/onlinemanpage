<p>sane-lexmark(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-lexmark(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-lexmark - SANE backend for Lexmark X1100
Series scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-lexmark library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
the scanner part of Lexmark X1100 AIOs. This backend should
be considered beta-quality software!</p>

<p>The scanners that should work with this backend are:</p>

<p>Vendor Model status ---------------------- -----------
Lexmark X1110 untested Lexmark X1140 untested Lexmark X1150
untested Lexmark X1170 untested Lexmark X1180 basic Lexmark
X1185 basic</p>

<p>The options the backend supports can either be selected
through command line options to programs like scanimage or
through GUI elements in xscanimage or xsane.</p>

<p>If you have any strange behavior, please report to the
backend main- tainer or to the SANE mailing list.</p>

<p>Valid command line options and their syntax can be
listed by using scanimage --help -d lexmark:usb:&lt;usb
port&gt;</p>

<p>Scan Mode Options</p>

<p>--mode selects the basic mode of operation of the
scanner valid choices are Color, Gray and Lineart The
default mode is Color. The Lin- eart mode is black and white
only (1 bit). Grayscale will pro- duce 256 levels of gray (8
bits). Color mode allows for over 16 million different
colors produced from 24 bits of color informa- tion.</p>

<p>--resolution selects the resolution for a scan. The
horizontal and vertical resolutions are set by the value of
this option. The scanner is capable of the following
resolutions for the specified option value:</p>

<p>Value Hor. Resolution Vert. Resolution -----
--------------- ------------------- 75 75dpi 75dpi 150
150dpi 150dpi 300 300dpi 300dpi 600 600dpi 600dpi 1200
600dpi 1200dpi</p>

<p>--preview requests a preview scan. The resolution used
for that scan is 75 dpi and the scan area and the scan mode
are as specified through their options, or the default if
not specified. The default value for preview mode is
&quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>--paper-size selects the size of the area to be scanned.
Valid sizes are Wal- let, 3x5, 4x6, 5x7, 8x10, Letter, the
default size is 3x5.</p>

<p>--threshold selects the minimum-brightness to get a
white point. The threshold is only used with Lineart mode
scans. It is specified as a percentage in the range 0..100%
(in steps of 1). The default value of the threshold option
is 50.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
/etc/sane.d/lexmark.conf contains only the usb device id (eg
usb 0x043d 0x007c).</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib*/sane/libsane-lexmark.a The static
library implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib*/sane/libsane-lexmark.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_LEXMARK If the library was
compiled with debug support enabled, this environment
variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
Smaller levels reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The windows TWAIN driver has many more
options than this SANE backend. However they are only
software adjustments. This backend only imple- ments what
the scanner can support.</p>

<p>BUGS Jerky movement on 600dpi gray 8x10 scan. Color
calibration not implemented. Dark compensation not
implemented.</p>
