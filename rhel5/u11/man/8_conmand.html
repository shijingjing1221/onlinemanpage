<p>NAME conmand - ConMan daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS conmand [OPTION]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION conmand is the daemon responsible for
managing consoles defined by its configuration file as well
as listening for connections from clients.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c file Specify a configuration file, overriding
the default location [/etc/conman.conf].</p>

<p>-h Display a summary of the command-line options.</p>

<p>-k Send a SIGTERM to the conmand process associated with
the speci- fied configuration, thereby killing the daemon.
Returns 0 if the daemon was successfully signaled;
otherwise, returns 1.</p>

<p>-L Display license information.</p>

<p>-p port Specify the port on which conmand will listen
for clients, over- riding both the default port [7890] and
the port specified in the configuration file.</p>

<p>-q Displays the PID of the conmand process associated
with the specified configuration if it appears active.
Returns 0 if the configuration appears active; otherwise,
returns 1.</p>

<p>-r Send a SIGHUP to the conmand process associated with
the speci- fied configuration, thereby re-opening both that
daemons log file and individual console log files. Returns 0
if the daemon was successfully signaled; otherwise, returns
1.</p>

<p>-v Enable verbose mode.</p>

<p>-V Display version information.</p>

<p>-z Truncate both the daemons log file and individual
console log files at start-up.</p>

<p>SIGNALS SIGHUP Close and re-open both the daemons log
file and the indi- vidual console log files. Conversion
specifiers within filenames will be re-evaluated. This is
useful for logro- tate configurations.</p>

<p>SIGTERM Terminate the daemon.</p>

<p>SECURITY The client/server communications are not yet
encrypted.</p>

<p>NOTES Log messages are sent to standard-error until
after the configuration file has been read, at which time
future messages are discarded unless either the logfile or
syslog keyword has been specified (cf, con-
man.conf(5)).</p>

<p>If the configuration file is modified while the daemon
is running and a pidfile was not originally specified, the
-k and -r options may be unable to identify the daemon
process; consequently, the appropriate signal may need to be
sent to the daemon manually.</p>
