<p>GETPAGESIZE(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
GETPAGESIZE(2)</p>

<p>NAME getpagesize - get memory page size</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getpagesize(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The function getpagesize() returns the
number of bytes in a page, where a &quot;page&quot; is the
thing used where it says in the description of mmap(2) that
files are mapped in page-sized units.</p>

<p>The size of the kind of pages that mmap() uses, is found
using</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; long sz =
sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);</p>

<p>(where some systems also allow the synonym _SC_PAGE_SIZE
for _SC_PAGE- SIZE), or</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; int sz = getpagesize();</p>

<p>HISTORY This call first appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.4BSD, SUSv2. In SUSv2 the
getpagesize() call is labeled LEGACY, and in POSIX.1-2001 it
has been dropped. HP-UX does not have this call.</p>

<p>NOTES Whether getpagesize() is present as a Linux system
call depends on the architecture. If it is, it returns the
kernel symbol PAGE_SIZE, which is architecture and machine
model dependent. Generally, one uses bina- ries that are
architecture but not machine model dependent, in order to
have a single binary distribution per architecture. This
means that a user program should not find PAGE_SIZE at
compile time from a header file, but use an actual system
call, at least for those architectures (like sun4) where
this dependency exists. Here libc4, libc5, glibc 2.0 fail
because their getpagesize() returns a statically derived
value, and does not use a system call. Things are OK in
glibc 2.1.</p>
