<p>NAME radius.conf - Configuration for nnrpd RADIUS
authenticator</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This describes the format and attributes of
the configuration file for the nnrpd RADIUS authenticator.
See radius(1) for more information about the authenticator
program. The default location for this file is radius.conf
in pathetc.</p>

<p>Blank lines and lines beginning with &quot;#&quot; are
ignored, as is anything after a &quot;#&quot; on a line. All
other lines should begin with a parameter name followed by a
colon and the value of that key, except that each section of
configuration for a particular server should be enclosed
in:</p>

<p>server &lt;name&gt; { # parameters... }</p>

<p>where &lt;name&gt; is just some convenient label for
that server.</p>

<p>The available parameters are:</p>

<p>radhost The hostname of the RADIUS server to use for
authentication. This parameter must be set.</p>

<p>radport The port to query on the RADIUS server. Defaults
to 1645 if not set.</p>

<p>lochost The hostname or IP address making the request.
The RADIUS server expects an IP address; a hostname will be
translated into an IP address with gethostbyname(). If not
given, this information isnt included in the request (not
all RADIUS setups require this infor- mation).</p>

<p>locport The port the client being authenticated is
connecting to. If not given, defaults to 119. This doesnt
need to be set unless readers are connecting to a
non-standard port.</p>

<p>secret The shared secret with the RADIUS server. If your
secret includes spaces, tabs, or &quot;#&quot;, be sure to
include it in double quotes. This parameter must be set.</p>

<p>prefix Prepend the value of this parameter to all
usernames before passing them to the RADIUS server. Can be
used to prepend something like &quot;news-&quot; to all
usernames in order to put news users into a differ- ent
namespace from other accounts served by the same server. If
not set, nothing is prepended.</p>

<p>suffix Append the value of this parameter to all
usernames before passing them to the RADIUS server. This is
often something like &quot;@exam- ple.com&quot;, depending
on how your RADIUS server is set up. If not set, nothing is
appended.</p>

<p>ignore-source Can be set to &quot;true&quot; or
&quot;false&quot;. If set to false, the RADIUS authenticator
will check to ensure that the response it receives is from
the same IP address as it sent the request to (for some
added security). If set to true, it will skip this
verification check (if your RADIUS server has multiple IP
addresses or if other odd things are going on, it may be
perfectly normal for the response to come from a different
IP address).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Here is a configuration for a news server named
news.example.com, authenticating users against
radius.example.com and appending &quot;@exam- ple.com&quot;
to all client-supplied usernames before passing them to the
RADIUS server:</p>

<p>server example { radhost: radius.example.com lochost:
news.example.com secret: IamARADIUSsecRET suffix:
@example.com }</p>

<p>The shared secret with the RADIUS server is
&quot;IamARADIUSsecRET&quot;.</p>
