<p>NAME initlog - log messages and events to the system
logger</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS initlog [-cefnpqrs] [--cmd=ARG] [--event=ARG]
[--facility=ARG] [--name=ARG] [--priority=ARG] [--run=ARG]
[--string=ARG]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION initlog logs messages and events to the
system logger. It is mainly designed for use in init
scripts. initlog reads a configuration file
/etc/initlog.conf by default, to determine its settings. Any
line pre- ceded with a # is a comment, and the following
configuration directives are recognized:</p>

<p>facility &lt;logging facility&gt; Sets the default
logging facility</p>

<p>priority &lt;logging priority&gt; Sets the default
logging priority</p>

<p>ignore &lt;regexp&gt; Messages that match the regular
expression will not be logged.</p>

<p>initlog behavior can also be configured by command-line
options.</p>

<p>Note that initlog is deprecated and will be removed in a
future release.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c, --cmd=[program] Execute the specified
program, logging anything output to stdout or stderr.</p>

<p>-e, --event=[number] Logs that the specified event
happened. Used in conjunction with --name. Currently
specified events are: 1 the action completed successfully 2
the action failed 3 the action was cancelled at user request
4 the action failed due to the failure of a dependent
action</p>

<p>-f, --facility=[facility] Log at the specified syslog
facility. The default is daemon (see syslog(3)).</p>

<p>-n, --name=[string] Log the event under the specified
string, such as &quot;inetd&quot;.</p>

<p>-p, --priority=[priority] Log at the specified syslog
priority. The default is notice (see syslog(3)).</p>

<p>-q Do not print the programs output, unless it exits
with a non- zero exit code.</p>

<p>-r, --run=[program] Execute the specified program, with
an open file descriptor so that the program can pass back
commands to initlog.</p>

<p>-s, --string=[string] Log the specified string to the
logger.</p>

<p>--conf=[file] Specifies an alternate configuration
file.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/initlog.conf</p>
