<p>NAME perlhack - How to hack at the Perl internals</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document attempts to explain how Perl
development takes place, and ends with some suggestions for
people wanting to become bona fide porters.</p>

<p>The perl5-porters mailing list is where the Perl
standard distribution is maintained and developed. The list
can get anywhere from 10 to 150 messages a day, depending on
the heatedness of the debate. Most days there are two or
three patches, extensions, features, or bugs being discussed
at a time.</p>

<p>A searchable archive of the list is at either:</p>


<p>http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/</p>

<p>or</p>


<p>http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/</p>

<p>List subscribers (the porters themselves) come in
several flavours. Some are quiet curious lurkers, who rarely
pitch in and instead watch the ongoing development to ensure
theyre forewarned of new changes or features in Perl. Some
are representatives of vendors, who are there to make sure
that Perl continues to compile and work on their plat-
forms. Some patch any reported bug that they know how to
fix, some are actively patching their pet area (threads,
Win32, the regexp engine), while others seem to do nothing
but complain. In other words, its your usual mix of
technical people.</p>

<p>Over this group of porters presides Larry Wall. He has
the final word in what does and does not change in the Perl
language. Various releases of Perl are shepherded by a
&quot;pumpking&quot;, a porter responsible for gathering
patches, deciding on a patch-by-patch, feature-by-feature
basis what will and will not go into the release. For
instance, Gurusamy Sarathy was the pumpking for the 5.6
release of Perl, and Jarkko Hietaniemi was the pumpking for
the 5.8 release, and Rafael Gar- cia-Suarez holds the
pumpking crown for the 5.10 release.</p>

<p>In addition, various people are pumpkings for different
things. For instance, Andy Dougherty and Jarkko Hietaniemi
did a grand job as the Configure pumpkin up till the 5.8
release. For the 5.10 release H.Mer- ijn Brand took
over.</p>

<p>Larry sees Perl development along the lines of the US
government: theres the Legislature (the porters), the
Executive branch (the pump- kings), and the Supreme Court
(Larry). The legislature can discuss and submit patches to
the executive branch all they like, but the executive branch
is free to veto them. Rarely, the Supreme Court will side
with the executive branch over the legislature, or the
legislature over the executive branch. Mostly, however, the
legislature and the executive branch are supposed to get
along and work out their differences without impeachment or
court cases.</p>

<p>You might sometimes see reference to Rule 1 and Rule 2.
Larrys power as Supreme Court is expressed in The Rules:</p>

<p>1 Larry is always by definition right about how Perl
should behave. This means he has final veto power on the
core functionality.</p>

<p>2 Larry is allowed to change his mind about any matter
at a later date, regardless of whether he previously invoked
Rule 1.</p>

<p>Got that? Larry is always right, even when he was wrong.
Its rare to see either Rule exercised, but they are often
alluded to.</p>

<p>New features and extensions to the language are
contentious, because the criteria used by the pumpkings,
Larry, and other porters to decide which features should be
implemented and incorporated are not codified in a few small
design goals as with some other languages. Instead, the
heuristics are flexible and often difficult to fathom. Here
is one persons list, roughly in decreasing order of
importance, of heuristics that new features have to be
weighed against:</p>

<p>Does concept match the general goals of Perl? These
haven t been written anywhere in stone, but one
approximation is:</p>

<p>1. Keep it fast, simple, and useful. 2. Keep
features/concepts as orthogonal as possible. 3. No arbitrary
limits (platforms, data sizes, cultures). 4. Keep it open
and exciting to use/patch/advocate Perl everywhere. 5.
Either assimilate new technologies, or build bridges to
them.</p>

<p>Where is the implementation? All the talk in the world
is useless without an implementation. In almost every case,
the person or people who argue for a new feature will be
expected to be the ones who implement it. Porters capable of
coding new features have their own agendas, and are not
avail- able to implement your (possibly good) idea.</p>

<p>Backwards compatibility Its a cardinal sin to break
existing Perl programs. New warnings are contentious--some
say that a program that emits warnings is not broken, while
others say it is. Adding keywords has the potential to break
programs, changing the meaning of existing token sequences
or functions might break programs.</p>

<p>Could it be a module instead? Perl 5 has extension
mechanisms, modules and XS, specifically to avoid the need
to keep changing the Perl interpreter. You can write modules
that export functions, you can give those functions
prototypes so they can be called like built-in functions,
you can even write XS code to mess with the runtime data
structures of the Perl interpreter if you want to implement
really complicated things. If it can be done in a module
instead of in the core, its highly unlikely to be added.</p>

<p>Is the feature generic enough? Is this something that
only the submitter wants added to the lan- guage, or would
it be broadly useful? Sometimes, instead of adding a feature
with a tight focus, the porters might decide to wait until
someone implements the more generalized feature. For
instance, instead of implementing a &quot;delayed
evaluation&quot; feature, the porters are waiting for a
macro system that would permit delayed evaluation and much
more.</p>

<p>Does it potentially introduce new bugs? Radical rewrites
of large chunks of the Perl interpreter have the potential
to introduce new bugs. The smaller and more localized the
change, the better.</p>

<p>Does it preclude other desirable features? A patch is
likely to be rejected if it closes off future avenues of
development. For instance, a patch that placed a true and
final interpretation on prototypes is likely to be rejected
because there are still options for the future of prototypes
that havent been addressed.</p>

<p>Is the implementation robust? Good patches (tight code,
complete, correct) stand more chance of going in. Sloppy or
incorrect patches might be placed on the back burner until
the pumpking has time to fix, or might be discarded
altogether without further notice.</p>

<p>Is the implementation generic enough to be portable? The
worst patches make use of a system-specific features. Its
highly unlikely that nonportable additions to the Perl
language will be accepted.</p>

<p>Is the implementation tested? Patches which change
behaviour (fixing bugs or introducing new fea- tures) must
include regression tests to verify that everything works as
expected. Without tests provided by the original author, how
can anyone else changing perl in the future be sure that
they havent unwittingly broken the behaviour the patch
implements? And without tests, how can the patchs author be
confident that his/her hard work put into the patch won t be
accidentally thrown away by someone in the future?</p>

<p>Is there enough documentation? Patches without
documentation are probably ill-thought out or incomplete.
Nothing can be added without documentation, so submit- ting
a patch for the appropriate manpages as well as the source
code is always a good idea.</p>

<p>Is there another way to do it? Larry said &quot;Although
the Perl Slogan is There_s More Than One Way to Do It, I
hesitate to make 10 ways to do something&quot;. This is a
tricky heuristic to navigate, though--one man s essential
addition is another mans pointless cruft.</p>

<p>Does it create too much work? Work for the pumpking,
work for Perl programmers, work for module authors, ... Perl
is supposed to be easy.</p>

<p>Patches speak louder than words Working code is always
preferred to pie-in-the-sky ideas. A patch to add a feature
stands a much higher chance of making it to the language
than does a random feature request, no matter how fer-
vently argued the request might be. This ties into
&quot;Will it be useful?&quot;, as the fact that someone
took the time to make the patch demonstrates a strong desire
for the feature.</p>

<p>If you re on the list, you might hear the word
&quot;core&quot; bandied around. It refers to the standard
distribution. &quot;Hacking on the core&quot; means you re
changing the C source code to the Perl interpreter. &quot;A
core module&quot; is one that ships with Perl.</p>

<p>Keeping in sync</p>

<p>The source code to the Perl interpreter, in its
different versions, is kept in a repository managed by a
revision control system ( which is currently the Perforce
program, see http://perforce.com/ ). The pump- kings and a
few others have access to the repository to check in
changes. Periodically the pumpking for the development
version of Perl will release a new version, so the rest of
the porters can see whats changed. The current state of the
main trunk of repository, and patches that describe the
individual changes that have happened since the last public
release are available at this location:</p>

<p>http://public.activestate.com/pub/apc/
ftp://public.activestate.com/pub/apc/</p>

<p>If youre looking for a particular change, or a change
that affected a particular set of files, you may find the
Perl Repository Browser use- ful:</p>

<p>http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse</p>

<p>You may also want to subscribe to the perl5-changes
mailing list to receive a copy of each patch that gets
submitted to the maintenance and development
&quot;branches&quot; of the perl repository. See
http://lists.perl.org/ for subscription information.</p>

<p>If you are a member of the perl5-porters mailing list,
it is a good thing to keep in touch with the most recent
changes. If not only to verify if what you would have posted
as a bug report isn t already solved in the most recent
available perl development branch, also known as
perl-current, bleading edge perl, bleedperl or
bleadperl.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the source code in perl-current is
usually in a per- petual state of evolution. You should
expect it to be very buggy. Do not use it for any purpose
other than testing and development.</p>

<p>Keeping in sync with the most recent branch can be done
in several ways, but the most convenient and reliable way is
using rsync, avail- able at ftp://rsync.samba.org/pub/rsync/
. (You can also get the most recent branch by FTP.)</p>

<p>If you choose to keep in sync using rsync, there are two
approaches to doing so:</p>

<p>rsyncing the source tree Presuming you are in the
directory where your perl source resides and you have rsync
installed and available, you can &quot;upgrade&quot; to the
bleadperl using:</p>

<p># rsync -avz
rsync://public.activestate.com/perl-current/ .</p>

<p>This takes care of updating every single item in the
source tree to the latest applied patch level, creating
files that are new (to your distribution) and setting
date/time stamps of existing files to reflect the bleadperl
status.</p>

<p>Note that this will not delete any files that were in .
before the rsync. Once you are sure that the rsync is
running correctly, run it with the --delete and the
--dry-run options like this:</p>

<p># rsync -avz --delete --dry-run
rsync://public.activestate.com/perl-current/ .</p>

<p>This will simulate an rsync run that also deletes files
not present in the bleadperl master copy. Observe the
results from this run closely. If you are sure that the
actual run would delete no files precious to you, you could
remove the --dry-run option.</p>

<p>You can than check what patch was the latest that was
applied by looking in the file .patch, which will show the
number of the lat- est patch.</p>

<p>If you have more than one machine to keep in sync, and
not all of them have access to the WAN (so you are not able
to rsync all the source trees to the real source), there are
some ways to get around this problem.</p>

<p>Using rsync over the LAN Set up a local rsync server
which makes the rsynced source tree available to the LAN and
sync the other machines against this directory.</p>

<p>From http://rsync.samba.org/README.html :</p>

<p>&quot;Rsync uses rsh or ssh for communication. It does
not need to be setuid and requires no special privileges for
installation. It does not require an inetd entry or a
daemon. You must, however, have a working rsh or ssh system.
Using ssh is recommended for its security
features.&quot;</p>

<p>Using pushing over the NFS Having the other systems
mounted over the NFS, you can take an active pushing
approach by checking the just updated tree against the other
not-yet synced trees. An example would be</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/perl -w</p>

<p>use strict; use File::Copy;</p>

<p>my %MF = map { m/()/; $1 =&gt; [ (stat $1)[2, 7, 9] ]; #
mode, size, mtime } cat MANIFEST;</p>

<p>my %remote = map { $_ =&gt;
&quot;/$_/pro/3gl/CPAN/perl-5.7.1&quot; } qw(host1
host2);</p>

<p>foreach my $host (keys %remote) { unless (-d
$remote{$host}) { print STDERR &quot;Cannot Xsync for host
$host0; next; } foreach my $file (keys %MF) { my $rfile =
&quot;$remote{$host}/$file&quot;; my ($mode, $size, $mtime)
= (stat $rfile)[2, 7, 9]; defined $size or ($mode, $size,
$mtime) = (0, 0, 0); $size == $MF{$file}[1] &amp;&amp;
$mtime == $MF{$file}[2] and next; printf &quot;%4s %-34s %8d
%9d %8d %9d0, $host, $file, $MF{$file}[1], $MF{$file}[2],
$size, $mtime; unlink $rfile; copy ($file, $rfile); utime
time, $MF{$file}[2], $rfile; chmod $MF{$file}[0], $rfile; }
}</p>

<p>though this is not perfect. It could be improved with
checking file checksums before updating. Not all NFS systems
support reliable utime support (when used over the NFS).</p>

<p>rsyncing the patches The source tree is maintained by
the pumpking who applies patches to the files in the tree.
These patches are either created by the pumpking himself
using &quot;diff -c&quot; after updating the file manually
or by applying patches sent in by posters on the
perl5-porters list. These patches are also saved and
rsyncable, so you can apply them yourself to the source
files.</p>

<p>Presuming you are in a directory where your patches
reside, you can get them in sync with</p>

<p># rsync -avz
rsync://public.activestate.com/perl-current-diffs/ .</p>

<p>This makes sure the latest available patch is downloaded
to your patch directory.</p>

<p>It s then up to you to apply these patches, using
something like</p>

<p># last=ls -t *.gz sed q # rsync -avz
rsync://public.activestate.com/perl-current-diffs/ . # find
. -name *.gz -newer $last -exec gzcat {} ; &gt;blead.patch #
cd ../perl-current # patch -p1 -N
&lt;../perl-current-diffs/blead.patch</p>

<p>or, since this is only a hint towards how it works, use
CPAN- patchaperl from Andreas K&ouml;nig to have better
control over the patching process.</p>

<p>Why rsync the source tree</p>

<p>Its easier to rsync the source tree Since you dont have
to apply the patches yourself, you are sure all files in the
source tree are in the right state.</p>

<p>Its more reliable While both the rsync-able source and
patch areas are automatically updated every few minutes,
keep in mind that applying patches may sometimes mean
careful hand-holding, especially if your version of the
&quot;patch&quot; program does not understand how to deal
with new files, files with 8-bit characters, or files
without trailing newlines.</p>

<p>Why rsync the patches</p>

<p>Its easier to rsync the patches If you have more than
one machine that you want to keep in track with bleadperl,
its easier to rsync the patches only once and then apply
them to all the source trees on the different machines.</p>

<p>In case you try to keep in pace on 5 different machines,
for which only one of them has access to the WAN, rsync ing
all the source trees should than be done 5 times over the
NFS. Having rsynced the patches only once, I can apply them
to all the source trees auto- matically. Need you say more
;-)</p>

<p>Its a good reference If you do not only like to have the
most recent development branch, but also like to fix bugs,
or extend features, you want to dive into the sources. If
you are a seasoned perl core diver, you dont need no
manuals, tips, roadmaps, perlguts.pod or other aids to find
your way around. But if you are a starter, the patches may
help you in finding where you should start and how to change
the bits that bug you.</p>

<p>The file Changes is updated on occasions the pumpking
sees as his own little sync points. On those occasions, he
releases a tar-ball of the current source tree (i.e.
perl@7582.tar.gz), which will be an excellent point to start
with when choosing to use the rsync the patches scheme.
Starting with perl@7582, which means a set of source files
on which the latest applied patch is number 7582, you apply
all succeeding patches available from then on (7583, 7584,
...).</p>

<p>You can use the patches later as a kind of search
archive.</p>

<p>Finding a start point If you want to fix/change the
behaviour of function/feature Foo, just scan the patches for
patches that mention Foo either in the subject, the
comments, or the body of the fix. A good chance the patch
shows you the files that are affected by that patch which
are very likely to be the starting point of your journey
into the guts of perl.</p>

<p>Finding how to fix a bug If youve found where the
function/feature Foo misbehaves, but you don t know how to
fix it (but you do know the change you want to make), you
can, again, peruse the patches for similar changes and look
how others apply the fix.</p>

<p>Finding the source of misbehaviour When you keep in sync
with bleadperl, the pumpking would love to see that the
community efforts really work. So after each of his sync
points, you are to make test to check if everything is still
in working order. If it is, you do make ok, which will send
an OK report to perlbug@perl.org. (If you do not have access
to a mailer from the system you just finished success- fully
make test , you can do make okfile, which creates the file
&quot;perl.ok&quot;, which you can than take to your
favourite mailer and mail yourself).</p>

<p>But of course, as always, things will not always lead to
a suc- cess path, and one or more test do not pass the make
test. Before sending in a bug report (using make nok or make
nok- file), check the mailing list if someone else has
reported the bug already and if so, confirm it by replying
to that message. If not, you might want to trace the source
of that misbehaviour before sending in the bug, which will
help all the other porters in finding the solution.</p>

<p>Here the saved patches come in very handy. You can check
the list of patches to see which patch changed what file and
what change caused the misbehaviour. If you note that in the
bug report, it saves the one trying to solve it, looking for
that point.</p>

<p>If searching the patches is too bothersome, you might
consider using perl s bugtron to find more information about
discussions and ramblings on posted bugs.</p>

<p>If you want to get the best of both worlds, rsync both
the source tree for convenience, reliability and ease and
rsync the patches for reference.</p>

<p>Working with the source</p>

<p>Because you cannot use the Perforce client, you cannot
easily generate diffs against the repository, nor will
merges occur when you update via rsync. If you edit a file
locally and then rsync against the latest source, changes
made in the remote copy will overwrite your local ver-
sions!</p>

<p>The best way to deal with this is to maintain a tree of
symlinks to the rsync d source. Then, when you want to edit
a file, you remove the symlink, copy the real file into the
other tree, and edit it. You can then diff your edited file
against the original to generate a patch, and you can safely
update the original tree.</p>

<p>Perls Configure script can generate this tree of
symlinks for you. The following example assumes that you
have used rsync to pull a copy of the Perl source into the
perl-rsync directory. In the directory above that one, you
can execute the following commands:</p>

<p>mkdir perl-dev cd perl-dev ../perl-rsync/Configure
-Dmksymlinks -Dusedevel -D&quot;optimize=-g&quot;</p>

<p>This will start the Perl configuration process. After a
few prompts, you should see something like this:</p>

<p>Symbolic links are supported.</p>

<p>Checking how to test for symbolic links... Your builtin
test -h may be broken. Trying external /usr/bin/test -h. You
can test for symbolic links with /usr/bin/test -h.</p>

<p>Creating the symbolic links... (First creating the
subdirectories...) (Then creating the symlinks...)</p>

<p>The specifics may vary based on your operating system,
of course. After you see this, you can abort the Configure
script, and you will see that the directory you are in has a
tree of symlinks to the perl- rsync directories and
files.</p>

<p>If you plan to do a lot of work with the Perl source,
here are some Bourne shell script functions that can make
your life easier:</p>

<p>function edit { if [ -L $1 ]; then mv $1 $1.orig cp
$1.orig $1 vi $1 else /bin/vi $1 fi }</p>

<p>function unedit { if [ -L $1.orig ]; then rm $1 mv
$1.orig $1 fi }</p>

<p>Replace &quot;vi&quot; with your favorite flavor of
editor.</p>

<p>Here is another function which will quickly generate a
patch for the files which have been edited in your symlink
tree:</p>

<p>mkpatchorig() { local diffopts for f in find . -name
*.orig sed s,^./,, do case echo $f sed s,.orig$,,;s,.*.,, in
c) diffopts=-p ;; pod) diffopts=-F^= ;; *) diffopts= ;; esac
diff -du $diffopts $f echo $f sed s,.orig$,, done }</p>

<p>This function produces patches which include enough
context to make your changes obvious. This makes it easier
for the Perl pumpking(s) to review them when you send them
to the perl5-porters list, and that means theyre more likely
to get applied.</p>

<p>This function assumed a GNU diff, and may require some
tweaking for other diff variants.</p>

<p>Perlbug administration</p>

<p>There is a single remote administrative interface for
modifying bug status, category, open issues etc. using the
RT bugtracker system, maintained by Robert Spier. Become an
administrator, and close any bugs you can get your sticky
mitts on:</p>

<p>http://rt.perl.org</p>

<p>The bugtracker mechanism for perl5 bugs in particular is
at:</p>

<p>http://bugs6.perl.org/perlbug</p>

<p>To email the bug system administrators:</p>

<p>&quot;perlbug-admin&quot;
&lt;perlbug-admin@perl.org&gt;</p>

<p>Submitting patches</p>

<p>Always submit patches to perl5-porters@perl.org. If
youre patching a core module and theres an author listed,
send the author a copy (see &quot;Patching a core
module&quot;). This lets other porters review your patch,
which catches a surprising number of errors in patches.
Either use the diff program (available in source code form
from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ , or use Johan Vromans
makepatch (available from CPAN/authors/id/JV/). Unified
diffs are preferred, but context diffs are accepted. Do not
send RCS-style diffs or diffs without con- text lines. More
information is given in the Porting/patching.pod file in the
Perl source distribution. Please patch against the latest
development version (e.g., if youre fixing a bug in the
5.005 track, patch against the latest 5.005_5x version).
Only patches that survive the heat of the development branch
get applied to maintenance versions.</p>

<p>Your patch should update the documentation and test
suite. See &quot;Writ- ing a test&quot;.</p>

<p>To report a bug in Perl, use the program perlbug which
comes with Perl (if you can t get Perl to work, send mail to
the address perl- bug@perl.org or perlbug@perl.com).
Reporting bugs through perlbug feeds into the automated
bug-tracking system, access to which is pro- vided through
the web at http://bugs.perl.org/ . It often pays to check
the archives of the perl5-porters mailing list to see
whether the bug youre reporting has been reported before,
and if so whether it was considered a bug. See above for the
location of the searchable archives.</p>

<p>The CPAN testers ( http://testers.cpan.org/ ) are a
group of volunteers who test CPAN modules on a variety of
platforms. Perl Smokers (
http://archives.develooper.com/daily-build@perl.org/ )
automatically tests Perl source releases on platforms with
various configurations. Both efforts welcome volunteers.</p>

<p>Its a good idea to read and lurk for a while before
chipping in. That way you ll get to see the dynamic of the
conversations, learn the per- sonalities of the players, and
hopefully be better prepared to make a useful contribution
when do you speak up.</p>

<p>If after all this you still think you want to join the
perl5-porters mailing list, send mail to
perl5-porters-subscribe@perl.org. To unsub- scribe, send
mail to perl5-porters-unsubscribe@perl.org.</p>

<p>To hack on the Perl guts, youll need to read the
following things:</p>

<p>perlguts This is of paramount importance, since it s the
documentation of what goes where in the Perl source. Read it
over a couple of times and it might start to make sense -
don t worry if it doesnt yet, because the best way to study
it is to read it in conjunction with poking at Perl source,
and well do that later on.</p>

<p>You might also want to look at Gisle Aas s illustrated
perlguts - there s no guarantee that this will be absolutely
up-to-date with the latest documentation in the Perl core,
but the fundamentals will be right. (
http://gisle.aas.no/perl/illguts/ )</p>

<p>perlxstut and perlxs A working knowledge of XSUB
programming is incredibly useful for core hacking; XSUBs use
techniques drawn from the PP code, the por- tion of the guts
that actually executes a Perl program. Its a lot gentler to
learn those techniques from simple examples and explana-
tion than from the core itself.</p>

<p>perlapi The documentation for the Perl API explains what
some of the inter- nal functions do, as well as the many
macros used in the source.</p>

<p>Porting/pumpkin.pod This is a collection of words of
wisdom for a Perl porter; some of it is only useful to the
pumpkin holder, but most of it applies to anyone wanting to
go about Perl development.</p>

<p>The perl5-porters FAQ This should be available from
http://simon-cozens.org/writ- ings/p5p-faq ; alternatively,
you can get the FAQ emailed to you by sending mail to
&quot;perl5-porters-faq@perl.org&quot;. It contains hints on
reading perl5-porters, information on how perl5-porters
works and how Perl development in general works.</p>

<p>Finding Your Way Around</p>

<p>Perl maintenance can be split into a number of areas,
and certain peo- ple (pumpkins) will have responsibility for
each area. These areas sometimes correspond to files or
directories in the source kit. Among the areas are:</p>

<p>Core modules Modules shipped as part of the Perl core
live in the lib/ and ext/ subdirectories: lib/ is for the
pure-Perl modules, and ext/ contains the core XS
modules.</p>

<p>Tests There are tests for nearly all the modules,
built-ins and major bits of functionality. Test files all
have a .t suffix. Module tests live in the lib/ and ext/
directories next to the module being tested. Others live in
t/. See &quot;Writing a test&quot;</p>

<p>Documentation Documentation maintenance includes looking
after everything in the pod/ directory, (as well as
contributing new documentation) and the documentation to the
modules in core.</p>

<p>Configure The configure process is the way we make Perl
portable across the myriad of operating systems it supports.
Responsibility for the con- figure, build and installation
process, as well as the overall portability of the core code
rests with the configure pumpkin - oth- ers help out with
individual operating systems.</p>

<p>The files involved are the operating system directories,
(win32/, os2/, vms/ and so on) the shell scripts which
generate config.h and Makefile, as well as the metaconfig
files which generate Configure. (metaconfig isnt included in
the core distribution.)</p>

<p>Interpreter And of course, theres the core of the Perl
interpreter itself. Lets have a look at that in a little
more detail.</p>

<p>Before we leave looking at the layout, though, dont
forget that MANI- FEST contains not only the file names in
the Perl distribution, but short descriptions of whats in
them, too. For an overview of the important files, try
this:</p>

<p>perl -lne print if /^[^]+.[ch] MANIFEST</p>

<p>Elements of the interpreter</p>

<p>The work of the interpreter has two main stages:
compiling the code into the internal representation, or
bytecode, and then executing it. &quot;Compiled code&quot;
in perlguts explains exactly how the compilation stage
happens.</p>

<p>Here is a short breakdown of perls operation:</p>

<p>Startup The action begins in perlmain.c. (or
miniperlmain.c for miniperl) This is very high-level code,
enough to fit on a single screen, and it resembles the code
found in perlembed; most of the real action takes place in
perl.c</p>

<p>First, perlmain.c allocates some memory and constructs a
Perl inter- preter:</p>

<p>1 PERL_SYS_INIT3(&amp;argc,&amp;argv,&amp;env); 2 3 if
(!PL_do_undump) { 4 my_perl = perl_alloc(); 5 if (!my_perl)
6 exit(1); 7 perl_construct(my_perl); 8
PL_perl_destruct_level = 0; 9 }</p>

<p>Line 1 is a macro, and its definition is dependent on
your operating system. Line 3 references
&quot;PL_do_undump&quot;, a global variable - all global
variables in Perl start with &quot;PL_&quot;. This tells you
whether the current running program was created with the
&quot;-u&quot; flag to perl and then undump, which means its
going to be false in any sane con- text.</p>

<p>Line 4 calls a function in perl.c to allocate memory for
a Perl interpreter. Its quite a simple function, and the
guts of it looks like this:</p>

<p>my_perl =
(PerlInterpreter*)PerlMem_malloc(sizeof(PerlInterpreter));</p>

<p>Here you see an example of Perls system abstraction,
which well see later: &quot;PerlMem_malloc&quot; is either
your system s &quot;malloc&quot;, or Perl s own
&quot;malloc&quot; as defined in malloc.c if you selected
that option at configure time.</p>

<p>Next, in line 7, we construct the interpreter; this sets
up all the special variables that Perl needs, the stacks,
and so on.</p>

<p>Now we pass Perl the command line options, and tell it
to go:</p>

<p>exitstatus = perl_parse(my_perl, xs_init, argc, argv,
(char **)NULL); if (!exitstatus) { exitstatus =
perl_run(my_perl); }</p>

<p>&quot;perl_parse&quot; is actually a wrapper around
&quot;S_parse_body&quot;, as defined in perl.c, which
processes the command line options, sets up any statically
linked XS modules, opens the program and calls
&quot;yyparse&quot; to parse it.</p>

<p>Parsing The aim of this stage is to take the Perl
source, and turn it into an op tree. Well see what one of
those looks like later. Strictly speaking, theres three
things going on here.</p>

<p>&quot;yyparse&quot;, the parser, lives in perly.c,
although youre better off reading the original YACC input in
perly.y. (Yes, Virginia, there is a YACC grammar for Perl!)
The job of the parser is to take your code and
&quot;understand&quot; it, splitting it into sentences,
deciding which operands go with which operators and so
on.</p>

<p>The parser is nobly assisted by the lexer, which chunks
up your input into tokens, and decides what type of thing
each token is: a variable name, an operator, a bareword, a
subroutine, a core func- tion, and so on. The main point of
entry to the lexer is &quot;yylex&quot;, and that and its
associated routines can be found in toke.c. Perl isnt much
like other computer languages; it s highly context sensi-
tive at times, it can be tricky to work out what sort of
token some- thing is, or where a token ends. As such, theres
a lot of interplay between the tokeniser and the parser,
which can get pretty frighten- ing if youre not used to
it.</p>

<p>As the parser understands a Perl program, it builds up a
tree of operations for the interpreter to perform during
execution. The rou- tines which construct and link together
the various operations are to be found in op.c, and will be
examined later.</p>

<p>Optimization Now the parsing stage is complete, and the
finished tree represents the operations that the Perl
interpreter needs to perform to execute our program. Next,
Perl does a dry run over the tree looking for optimisations:
constant expressions such as &quot;3 + 4&quot; will be
computed now, and the optimizer will also see if any
multiple operations can be replaced with a single one. For
instance, to fetch the variable $foo, instead of grabbing
the glob *foo and looking at the scalar component, the
optimizer fiddles the op tree to use a function which
directly looks up the scalar in question. The main optimizer
is &quot;peep&quot; in op.c, and many ops have their own
optimizing functions.</p>

<p>Running Now we re finally ready to go: we have compiled
Perl byte code, and all thats left to do is run it. The
actual execution is done by the &quot;runops_standard&quot;
function in run.c; more specifically, its done by these
three innocent looking lines:</p>

<p>while ((PL_op = CALL_FPTR(PL_op-&gt;op_ppaddr)(aTHX))) {
PERL_ASYNC_CHECK(); }</p>

<p>You may be more comfortable with the Perl version of
that:</p>

<p>PERL_ASYNC_CHECK() while $Perl::op =
&amp;{$Perl::op-&gt;{function}};</p>

<p>Well, maybe not. Anyway, each op contains a function
pointer, which stipulates the function which will actually
carry out the operation. This function will return the next
op in the sequence - this allows for things like
&quot;if&quot; which choose the next op dynamically at run
time. The &quot;PERL_ASYNC_CHECK&quot; makes sure that
things like signals interrupt execution if required.</p>

<p>The actual functions called are known as PP code, and
theyre spread between four files: pp_hot.c contains the
&quot;hot&quot; code, which is most often used and highly
optimized, pp_sys.c contains all the system- specific
functions, pp_ctl.c contains the functions which implement
control structures (&quot;if&quot;, &quot;while&quot; and
the like) and pp.c contains everything else. These are, if
you like, the C code for Perls built-in functions and
operators.</p>

<p>Note that each &quot;pp_&quot; function is expected to
return a pointer to the next op. Calls to perl subs (and
eval blocks) are handled within the same runops loop, and do
not consume extra space on the C stack. For example,
&quot;pp_entersub&quot; and &quot;pp_entertry&quot; just
push a &quot;CxSUB&quot; or &quot;CxEVAL&quot; block struct
onto the context stack which contain the address of the op
following the sub call or eval. They then return the first
op of that sub or eval block, and so execution continues of
that sub or block. Later, a &quot;pp_leavesub&quot; or
&quot;pp_leavetry&quot; op pops the &quot;CxSUB&quot; or
&quot;CxEVAL&quot;, retrieves the return op from it, and
returns it.</p>

<p>Exception handing Perl s exception handing (i.e.
&quot;die&quot; etc) is built on top of the low-level
&quot;setjmp()&quot;/&quot;longjmp()&quot; C-library
functions. These basi- cally provide a way to capture the
current PC and SP registers and later restore them; i.e. a
&quot;longjmp()&quot; continues at the point in code where a
previous &quot;setjmp()&quot; was done, with anything
further up on the C stack being lost. This is why code
should always save val- ues using &quot;SAVE_FOO&quot;
rather than in auto variables.</p>

<p>The perl core wraps &quot;setjmp()&quot; etc in the
macros &quot;JMPENV_PUSH&quot; and &quot;JMPENV_JUMP&quot;.
The basic rule of perl exceptions is that &quot;exit&quot;,
and &quot;die&quot; (in the absence of &quot;eval&quot;)
perform a JMPENV_JUMP(2), while &quot;die&quot; within
&quot;eval&quot; does a JMPENV_JUMP(3).</p>

<p>At entry points to perl, such as
&quot;perl_parse()&quot;, &quot;perl_run()&quot; and
&quot;call_sv(cv, G_EVAL)&quot; each does a
&quot;JMPENV_PUSH&quot;, then enter a runops loop or
whatever, and handle possible exception returns. For a 2
return, final cleanup is performed, such as popping stacks
and call- ing &quot;CHECK&quot; or &quot;END&quot; blocks.
Amongst other things, this is how scope cleanup still occurs
during an &quot;exit&quot;.</p>

<p>If a &quot;die&quot; can find a &quot;CxEVAL&quot; block
on the context stack, then the stack is popped to that level
and the return op in that block is assigned to
&quot;PL_restartop&quot;; then a JMPENV_JUMP(3) is
performed. This normally passes control back to the guard.
In the case of &quot;perl_run&quot; and &quot;call_sv&quot;,
a non-null &quot;PL_restartop&quot; triggers re- entry to
the runops loop. The is the normal way that &quot;die&quot;
or &quot;croak&quot; is handled within an
&quot;eval&quot;.</p>

<p>Sometimes ops are executed within an inner runops loop,
such as tie, sort or overload code. In this case, something
like</p>

<p>sub FETCH { eval { die } }</p>

<p>would cause a longjmp right back to the guard in
&quot;perl_run&quot;, popping both runops loops, which is
clearly incorrect. One way to avoid this is for the tie code
to do a &quot;JMPENV_PUSH&quot; before executing
&quot;FETCH&quot; in the inner runops loop, but for
efficiency reasons, perl in fact just sets a flag, using
&quot;CATCH_SET(TRUE)&quot;. The &quot;pp_require&quot;,
&quot;pp_entereval&quot; and &quot;pp_entertry&quot; ops
check this flag, and if true, they call &quot;docatch&quot;,
which does a &quot;JMPENV_PUSH&quot; and starts a new runops
level to execute the code, rather than doing it on the cur-
rent loop.</p>

<p>As a further optimisation, on exit from the eval block
in the &quot;FETCH&quot;, execution of the code following
the block is still carried on in the inner loop. When an
exception is raised, &quot;docatch&quot; com- pares the
&quot;JMPENV&quot; level of the &quot;CxEVAL&quot; with
&quot;PL_top_env&quot; and if they differ, just re-throws
the exception. In this way any inner loops get popped.</p>

<p>Heres an example.</p>

<p>1: eval { tie @a, A }; 2: sub A::TIEARRAY { 3: eval {
die }; 4: die; 5: }</p>

<p>To run this code, &quot;perl_run&quot; is called, which
does a &quot;JMPENV_PUSH&quot; then enters a runops loop.
This loop executes the eval and tie ops on line 1, with the
eval pushing a &quot;CxEVAL&quot; onto the context
stack.</p>

<p>The &quot;pp_tie&quot; does a
&quot;CATCH_SET(TRUE)&quot;, then starts a second runops
loop to execute the body of &quot;TIEARRAY&quot;. When it
executes the entertry op on line 3, &quot;CATCH_GET&quot; is
true, so &quot;pp_entertry&quot; calls &quot;docatch&quot;
which does a &quot;JMPENV_PUSH&quot; and starts a third
runops loop, which then executes the die op. At this point
the C call stack looks like this:</p>

<p>Perl_pp_die Perl_runops # third loop S_docatch_body
S_docatch Perl_pp_entertry Perl_runops # second loop
S_call_body Perl_call_sv Perl_pp_tie Perl_runops # first
loop S_run_body perl_run main</p>

<p>and the context and data stacks, as shown by
&quot;-Dstv&quot;, look like:</p>

<p>STACK 0: MAIN CX 0: BLOCK =&gt; CX 1: EVAL =&gt; AV()
PV(&quot;A&quot; ) retop=leave STACK 1: MAGIC CX 0: SUB
=&gt; retop=(null) CX 1: EVAL =&gt; * retop=nextstate</p>

<p>The die pops the first &quot;CxEVAL&quot; off the
context stack, sets &quot;PL_restartop&quot; from it, does a
JMPENV_JUMP(3), and control returns to the top
&quot;docatch&quot;. This then starts another third-level
runops level, which executes the nextstate, pushmark and die
ops on line 4. At the point that the second
&quot;pp_die&quot; is called, the C call stack looks exactly
like that above, even though we are no longer within an
inner eval; this is because of the optimization mentioned
ear- lier. However, the context stack now looks like this,
ie with the top CxEVAL popped:</p>

<p>STACK 0: MAIN CX 0: BLOCK =&gt; CX 1: EVAL =&gt; AV()
PV(&quot;A&quot; ) retop=leave STACK 1: MAGIC CX 0: SUB
=&gt; retop=(null)</p>

<p>The die on line 4 pops the context stack back down to
the CxEVAL, leaving it as:</p>

<p>STACK 0: MAIN CX 0: BLOCK =&gt;</p>

<p>As usual, &quot;PL_restartop&quot; is extracted from the
&quot;CxEVAL&quot;, and a JMPENV_JUMP(3) done, which pops
the C stack back to the docatch:</p>

<p>S_docatch Perl_pp_entertry Perl_runops # second loop
S_call_body Perl_call_sv Perl_pp_tie Perl_runops # first
loop S_run_body perl_run main</p>

<p>In this case, because the &quot;JMPENV&quot; level
recorded in the &quot;CxEVAL&quot; differs from the current
one, &quot;docatch&quot; just does a JMPENV_JUMP(3) and the
C stack unwinds to:</p>

<p>perl_run main</p>

<p>Because &quot;PL_restartop&quot; is non-null,
&quot;run_body&quot; starts a new runops loop and execution
continues.</p>

<p>Internal Variable Types</p>

<p>You should by now have had a look at perlguts, which
tells you about Perls internal variable types: SVs, HVs, AVs
and the rest. If not, do that now.</p>

<p>These variables are used not only to represent
Perl-space variables, but also any constants in the code, as
well as some structures com- pletely internal to Perl. The
symbol table, for instance, is an ordi- nary Perl hash. Your
code is represented by an SV as its read into the parser;
any program files you call are opened via ordinary Perl
file- handles, and so on.</p>

<p>The core Devel::Peek module lets us examine SVs from a
Perl program. Lets see, for instance, how Perl treats the
constant &quot;hello&quot;.</p>

<p>% perl -MDevel::Peek -e Dump(&quot;hello&quot;) 1 SV =
PV(0xa041450) at 0xa04ecbc 2 REFCNT = 1 3 FLAGS =
(POK,READONLY,pPOK) 4 PV = 0xa0484e0 &quot;hello&quot; 5 CUR
= 5 6 LEN = 6</p>

<p>Reading &quot;Devel::Peek&quot; output takes a bit of
practise, so lets go through it line by line.</p>

<p>Line 1 tells us were looking at an SV which lives at
0xa04ecbc in mem- ory. SVs themselves are very simple
structures, but they contain a pointer to a more complex
structure. In this case, it s a PV, a struc- ture which
holds a string value, at location 0xa041450. Line 2 is the
reference count; there are no other references to this data,
so its 1.</p>

<p>Line 3 are the flags for this SV - its OK to use it as a
PV, its a read-only SV (because its a constant) and the data
is a PV internally. Next we ve got the contents of the
string, starting at location 0xa0484e0.</p>

<p>Line 5 gives us the current length of the string - note
that this does not include the null terminator. Line 6 is
not the length of the string, but the length of the
currently allocated buffer; as the string grows, Perl
automatically extends the available storage via a routine
called &quot;SvGROW&quot;.</p>

<p>You can get at any of these quantities from C very
easily; just add &quot;Sv&quot; to the name of the field
shown in the snippet, and youve got a macro which will
return the value: &quot;SvCUR(sv)&quot; returns the current
length of the string, &quot;SvREFCOUNT(sv)&quot; returns the
reference count, &quot;SvPV(sv, len)&quot; returns the
string itself with its length, and so on. More macros to
manipulate these properties can be found in perlguts.</p>

<p>Let s take an example of manipulating a PV, from
&quot;sv_catpvn&quot;, in sv.c</p>

<p>1 void 2 Perl_sv_catpvn(pTHX_ register SV *sv, register
const char *ptr, register STRLEN len) 3 { 4 STRLEN tlen; 5
char *junk;</p>

<p>6 junk = SvPV_force(sv, tlen); 7 SvGROW(sv, tlen + len +
1); 8 if (ptr == junk) 9 ptr = SvPVX(sv); 10
Move(ptr,SvPVX(sv)+tlen,len,char); 11 SvCUR(sv) += len; 12
*SvEND(sv) = ; 13 (void)SvPOK_only_UTF8(sv); /* validate
pointer */ 14 SvTAINT(sv); 15 }</p>

<p>This is a function which adds a string, &quot;ptr&quot;,
of length &quot;len&quot; onto the end of the PV stored in
&quot;sv&quot;. The first thing we do in line 6 is make sure
that the SV has a valid PV, by calling the
&quot;SvPV_force&quot; macro to force a PV. As a side
effect, &quot;tlen&quot; gets set to the current value of
the PV, and the PV itself is returned to
&quot;junk&quot;.</p>

<p>In line 7, we make sure that the SV will have enough
room to accommo- date the old string, the new string and the
null terminator. If &quot;LEN&quot; isnt big enough,
&quot;SvGROW&quot; will reallocate space for us.</p>

<p>Now, if &quot;junk&quot; is the same as the string were
trying to add, we can grab the string directly from the SV;
&quot;SvPVX&quot; is the address of the PV in the SV.</p>

<p>Line 10 does the actual catenation: the &quot;Move&quot;
macro moves a chunk of memory around: we move the string
&quot;ptr&quot; to the end of the PV - thats the start of
the PV plus its current length. Were moving &quot;len&quot;
bytes of type &quot;char&quot;. After doing so, we need to
tell Perl we ve extended the string, by altering
&quot;CUR&quot; to reflect the new length. &quot;SvEND&quot;
is a macro which gives us the end of the string, so that
needs to be a &quot; &quot;.</p>

<p>Line 13 manipulates the flags; since weve changed the
PV, any IV or NV values will no longer be valid: if we have
&quot;$a=10; $a.=&quot;6&quot;;&quot; we dont want to use
the old IV of 10. &quot;SvPOK_only_utf8&quot; is a special
UTF-8-aware version of &quot;SvPOK_only&quot;, a macro which
turns off the IOK and NOK flags and turns on POK. The final
&quot;SvTAINT&quot; is a macro which launders tainted data
if taint mode is turned on.</p>

<p>AVs and HVs are more complicated, but SVs are by far the
most common variable type being thrown around. Having seen
something of how we manipulate these, lets go on and look at
how the op tree is con- structed.</p>

<p>Op Trees</p>

<p>First, what is the op tree, anyway? The op tree is the
parsed represen- tation of your program, as we saw in our
section on parsing, and its the sequence of operations that
Perl goes through to execute your pro- gram, as we saw in
&quot;Running&quot;.</p>

<p>An op is a fundamental operation that Perl can perform:
all the built- in functions and operators are ops, and there
are a series of ops which deal with concepts the interpreter
needs internally - entering and leaving a block, ending a
statement, fetching a variable, and so on.</p>

<p>The op tree is connected in two ways: you can imagine
that there are two &quot;routes&quot; through it, two orders
in which you can traverse the tree. First, parse order
reflects how the parser understood the code, and secondly,
execution order tells perl what order to perform the opera-
tions in.</p>

<p>The easiest way to examine the op tree is to stop Perl
after it has finished parsing, and get it to dump out the
tree. This is exactly what the compiler backends B::Terse,
B::Concise and B::Debug do.</p>

<p>Lets have a look at how Perl sees &quot;$a = $b +
$c&quot;:</p>

<p>% perl -MO=Terse -e $a=$b+$c 1 LISTOP (0x8179888) leave
2 OP (0x81798b0) enter 3 COP (0x8179850) nextstate 4 BINOP
(0x8179828) sassign 5 BINOP (0x8179800) add [1] 6 UNOP
(0x81796e0) null [15] 7 SVOP (0x80fafe0) gvsv GV (0x80fa4cc)
*b 8 UNOP (0x81797e0) null [15] 9 SVOP (0x8179700) gvsv GV
(0x80efeb0) *c 10 UNOP (0x816b4f0) null [15] 11 SVOP
(0x816dcf0) gvsv GV (0x80fa460) *a</p>

<p>Lets start in the middle, at line 4. This is a BINOP, a
binary opera- tor, which is at location 0x8179828. The
specific operator in question is &quot;sassign&quot; -
scalar assignment - and you can find the code which
implements it in the function &quot;pp_sassign&quot; in
pp_hot.c. As a binary operator, it has two children: the add
operator, providing the result of &quot;$b+$c&quot;, is
uppermost on line 5, and the left hand side is on line
10.</p>

<p>Line 10 is the null op: this does exactly nothing. What
is that doing there? If you see the null op, its a sign that
something has been optimized away after parsing. As we
mentioned in &quot;Optimization&quot;, the optimization
stage sometimes converts two operations into one, for
example when fetching a scalar variable. When this happens,
instead of rewriting the op tree and cleaning up the
dangling pointers, its eas- ier just to replace the
redundant operation with the null op. Origi- nally, the tree
would have looked like this:</p>

<p>10 SVOP (0x816b4f0) rv2sv [15] 11 SVOP (0x816dcf0) gv GV
(0x80fa460) *a</p>

<p>That is, fetch the &quot;a&quot; entry from the main
symbol table, and then look at the scalar component of it:
&quot;gvsv&quot; (&quot;pp_gvsv&quot; into pp_hot.c) happens
to do both these things.</p>

<p>The right hand side, starting at line 5 is similar to
what weve just seen: we have the &quot;add&quot; op
(&quot;pp_add&quot; also in pp_hot.c) add together two
&quot;gvsv&quot;s.</p>

<p>Now, whats this about?</p>

<p>1 LISTOP (0x8179888) leave 2 OP (0x81798b0) enter 3 COP
(0x8179850) nextstate</p>

<p>&quot;enter&quot; and &quot;leave&quot; are scoping ops,
and their job is to perform any housekeeping every time you
enter and leave a block: lexical variables are tidied up,
unreferenced variables are destroyed, and so on. Every
program will have those first three lines: &quot;leave&quot;
is a list, and its children are all the statements in the
block. Statements are delimited by &quot;nextstate&quot;, so
a block is a collection of &quot;nextstate&quot; ops, with
the ops to be performed for each statement being the
children of &quot;nextstate&quot;. &quot;enter&quot; is a
single op which functions as a marker.</p>

<p>Thats how Perl parsed the program, from top to
bottom:</p>

<p>Program Statement = / / $a + / $b $c</p>

<p>However, its impossible to perform the operations in
this order: you have to find the values of $b and $c before
you add them together, for instance. So, the other thread
that runs through the op tree is the execution order: each
op has a field &quot;op_next&quot; which points to the next
op to be run, so following these pointers tells us how perl
executes the code. We can traverse the tree in this order
using the &quot;exec&quot; option to
&quot;B::Terse&quot;:</p>

<p>% perl -MO=Terse,exec -e $a=$b+$c 1 OP (0x8179928) enter
2 COP (0x81798c8) nextstate 3 SVOP (0x81796c8) gvsv GV
(0x80fa4d4) *b 4 SVOP (0x8179798) gvsv GV (0x80efeb0) *c 5
BINOP (0x8179878) add [1] 6 SVOP (0x816dd38) gvsv GV
(0x80fa468) *a 7 BINOP (0x81798a0) sassign 8 LISTOP
(0x8179900) leave</p>

<p>This probably makes more sense for a human: enter a
block, start a statement. Get the values of $b and $c, and
add them together. Find $a, and assign one to the other.
Then leave.</p>

<p>The way Perl builds up these op trees in the parsing
process can be unravelled by examining perly.y, the YACC
grammar. Lets take the piece we need to construct the tree
for &quot;$a = $b + $c&quot;</p>

<p>1 term : term ASSIGNOP term 2 { $$ =
newASSIGNOP(OPf_STACKED, $1, $2, $3); } 3 term ADDOP term 4
{ $$ = newBINOP($2, 0, scalar($1), scalar($3)); }</p>

<p>If youre not used to reading BNF grammars, this is how
it works: Youre fed certain things by the tokeniser, which
generally end up in upper case. Here, &quot;ADDOP&quot;, is
provided when the tokeniser sees &quot;+&quot; in your code.
&quot;ASSIGNOP&quot; is provided when &quot;=&quot; is used
for assigning. These are &quot;terminal symbols&quot;,
because you cant get any simpler than them.</p>

<p>The grammar, lines one and three of the snippet above,
tells you how to build up more complex forms. These complex
forms, &quot;non-terminal sym- bols&quot; are generally
placed in lower case. &quot;term&quot; here is a
non-terminal symbol, representing a single expression.</p>

<p>The grammar gives you the following rule: you can make
the thing on the left of the colon if you see all the things
on the right in sequence. This is called a
&quot;reduction&quot;, and the aim of parsing is to
completely reduce the input. There are several different
ways you can perform a reduction, separated by vertical
bars: so, &quot;term&quot; followed by &quot;=&quot; fol-
lowed by &quot;term&quot; makes a &quot;term&quot;, and
&quot;term&quot; followed by &quot;+&quot; followed by
&quot;term&quot; can also make a &quot;term&quot;.</p>

<p>So, if you see two terms with an &quot;=&quot; or
&quot;+&quot;, between them, you can turn them into a single
expression. When you do this, you execute the code in the
block on the next line: if you see &quot;=&quot;, you ll do
the code in line 2. If you see &quot;+&quot;, youll do the
code in line 4. Its this code which contributes to the op
tree.</p>

<p>term ADDOP term { $$ = newBINOP($2, 0, scalar($1),
scalar($3)); }</p>

<p>What this does is creates a new binary op, and feeds it
a number of variables. The variables refer to the tokens: $1
is the first token in the input, $2 the second, and so on -
think regular expression backref- erences. $$ is the op
returned from this reduction. So, we call &quot;new-
BINOP&quot; to create a new binary operator. The first
parameter to &quot;new- BINOP&quot;, a function in op.c, is
the op type. It s an addition operator, so we want the type
to be &quot;ADDOP&quot;. We could specify this directly, but
its right there as the second token in the input, so we use
$2. The second parameter is the op s flags: 0 means
&quot;nothing special&quot;. Then the things to add: the
left and right hand side of our expression, in scalar
context.</p>

<p>Stacks</p>

<p>When perl executes something like &quot;addop&quot;, how
does it pass on its results to the next op? The answer is,
through the use of stacks. Perl has a number of stacks to
store things its currently working on, and well look at the
three most important ones here.</p>

<p>Argument stack Arguments are passed to PP code and
returned from PP code using the argument stack,
&quot;ST&quot;. The typical way to handle arguments is to
pop them off the stack, deal with them how you wish, and
then push the result back onto the stack. This is how, for
instance, the cosine operator works:</p>

<p>NV value; value = POPn; value = Perl_cos(value);
XPUSHn(value);</p>

<p>Well see a more tricky example of this when we consider
Perls macros below. &quot;POPn&quot; gives you the NV
(floating point value) of the top SV on the stack: the $x in
&quot;cos($x)&quot;. Then we compute the cosine, and push
the result back as an NV. The &quot;X&quot; in
&quot;XPUSHn&quot; means that the stack should be extended
if necessary - it can t be neces- sary here, because we know
theres room for one more item on the stack, since weve just
removed one! The &quot;XPUSH*&quot; macros at least
guarantee safety.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can fiddle with the stack directly:
&quot;SP&quot; gives you the first element in your portion
of the stack, and &quot;TOP*&quot; gives you the top
SV/IV/NV/etc. on the stack. So, for instance, to do unary
negation of an integer:</p>

<p>SETi(-TOPi);</p>

<p>Just set the integer value of the top stack entry to its
negation.</p>

<p>Argument stack manipulation in the core is exactly the
same as it is in XSUBs - see perlxstut, perlxs and perlguts
for a longer descrip- tion of the macros used in stack
manipulation.</p>

<p>Mark stack I say &quot;your portion of the stack&quot;
above because PP code doesnt nec- essarily get the whole
stack to itself: if your function calls another function,
you ll only want to expose the arguments aimed for the
called function, and not (necessarily) let it get at your
own data. The way we do this is to have a
&quot;virtual&quot; bottom-of-stack, exposed to each
function. The mark stack keeps bookmarks to loca- tions in
the argument stack usable by each function. For instance,
when dealing with a tied variable, (internally, something
with &quot;P&quot; magic) Perl has to call methods for
accesses to the tied variables. However, we need to separate
the arguments exposed to the method to the argument exposed
to the original function - the store or fetch or whatever it
may be. Heres how the tied &quot;push&quot; is implemented;
see &quot;av_push&quot; in av.c:</p>

<p>1 PUSHMARK(SP); 2 EXTEND(SP,2); 3
PUSHs(SvTIED_obj((SV*)av, mg)); 4 PUSHs(val); 5 PUTBACK; 6
ENTER; 7 call_method(&quot;PUSH&quot;, G_SCALARG_DISCARD); 8
LEAVE; 9 POPSTACK;</p>

<p>The lines which concern the mark stack are the first,
fifth and last lines: they save away, restore and remove the
current position of the argument stack.</p>

<p>Lets examine the whole implementation, for practice:</p>

<p>1 PUSHMARK(SP);</p>

<p>Push the current state of the stack pointer onto the
mark stack. This is so that when weve finished adding items
to the argument stack, Perl knows how many things weve added
recently.</p>

<p>2 EXTEND(SP,2); 3 PUSHs(SvTIED_obj((SV*)av, mg)); 4
PUSHs(val);</p>

<p>Were going to add two more items onto the argument
stack: when you have a tied array, the &quot;PUSH&quot;
subroutine receives the object and the value to be pushed,
and thats exactly what we have here - the tied object,
retrieved with &quot;SvTIED_obj&quot;, and the value, the SV
&quot;val&quot;.</p>

<p>5 PUTBACK;</p>

<p>Next we tell Perl to make the change to the global stack
pointer: &quot;dSP&quot; only gave us a local copy, not a
reference to the global.</p>

<p>6 ENTER; 7 call_method(&quot;PUSH&quot;,
G_SCALARG_DISCARD); 8 LEAVE;</p>

<p>&quot;ENTER&quot; and &quot;LEAVE&quot; localise a block
of code - they make sure that all variables are tidied up,
everything that has been localised gets its previous value
returned, and so on. Think of them as the &quot;{&quot; and
&quot;}&quot; of a Perl block.</p>

<p>To actually do the magic method call, we have to call a
subroutine in Perl space: &quot;call_method&quot; takes care
of that, and it s described in perlcall. We call the
&quot;PUSH&quot; method in scalar context, and were going to
discard its return value.</p>

<p>9 POPSTACK;</p>

<p>Finally, we remove the value we placed on the mark
stack, since we dont need it any more.</p>

<p>Save stack C doesn t have a concept of local scope, so
perl provides one. Weve seen that &quot;ENTER&quot; and
&quot;LEAVE&quot; are used as scoping braces; the save stack
implements the C equivalent of, for example:</p>

<p>{ local $foo = 42; ... }</p>

<p>See &quot;Localising Changes&quot; in perlguts for how
to use the save stack.</p>

<p>Millions of Macros</p>

<p>One thing youll notice about the Perl source is that it
s full of macros. Some have called the pervasive use of
macros the hardest thing to understand, others find it adds
to clarity. Let s take an example, the code which implements
the addition operator:</p>

<p>1 PP(pp_add) 2 { 3 dSP; dATARGET;
tryAMAGICbin(add,opASSIGN); 4 { 5 dPOPTOPnnrl_ul; 6 SETn(
left + right ); 7 RETURN; 8 } 9 }</p>

<p>Every line here (apart from the braces, of course)
contains a macro. The first line sets up the function
declaration as Perl expects for PP code; line 3 sets up
variable declarations for the argument stack and the target,
the return value of the operation. Finally, it tries to see
if the addition operation is overloaded; if so, the
appropriate subrou- tine is called.</p>

<p>Line 5 is another variable declaration - all variable
declarations start with &quot;d&quot; - which pops from the
top of the argument stack two NVs (hence &quot;nn&quot;) and
puts them into the variables &quot;right&quot; and
&quot;left&quot;, hence the &quot;rl&quot;. These are the
two operands to the addition operator. Next, we call
&quot;SETn&quot; to set the NV of the return value to the
result of adding the two values. This done, we return - the
&quot;RETURN&quot; macro makes sure that our return value is
properly handled, and we pass the next opera- tor to run
back to the main run loop.</p>

<p>Most of these macros are explained in perlapi, and some
of the more important ones are explained in perlxs as well.
Pay special attention to &quot;Background and
PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT&quot; in perlguts for information on
the &quot;[pad]THX_?&quot; macros.</p>

<p>The .i Targets</p>

<p>You can expand the macros in a foo.c file by saying</p>

<p>make foo.i</p>

<p>which will expand the macros using cpp. Dont be scared
by the results.</p>

<p>Poking at Perl</p>

<p>To really poke around with Perl, youll probably want to
build Perl for debugging, like this:</p>

<p>./Configure -d -D optimize=-g make</p>

<p>&quot;-g&quot; is a flag to the C compiler to have it
produce debugging informa- tion which will allow us to step
through a running program. Configure will also turn on the
&quot;DEBUGGING&quot; compilation symbol which enables all
the internal debugging code in Perl. There are a whole bunch
of things you can debug with this: perlrun lists them all,
and the best way to find out about them is to play about
with them. The most useful options are probably</p>

<p>l Context (loop) stack processing t Trace execution o
Method and overloading resolution c String/numeric
conversions</p>

<p>Some of the functionality of the debugging code can be
achieved using XS modules.</p>

<p>-Dr =&gt; use re debug -Dx =&gt; use O Debug</p>

<p>Using a source-level debugger</p>

<p>If the debugging output of &quot;-D&quot; doesnt help
you, its time to step through perls execution with a
source-level debugger.</p>

<p>&middot; Well use &quot;gdb&quot; for our examples here;
the principles will apply to any debugger, but check the
manual of the one youre using.</p>

<p>To fire up the debugger, type</p>

<p>gdb ./perl</p>

<p>Youll want to do that in your Perl source tree so the
debugger can read the source code. You should see the
copyright message, followed by the prompt.</p>

<p>(gdb)</p>

<p>&quot;help&quot; will get you into the documentation,
but here are the most use- ful commands:</p>

<p>run [args] Run the program with the given arguments.</p>

<p>break function_name break source.c:xxx Tells the
debugger that well want to pause execution when we reach
either the named function (but see &quot;Internal
Functions&quot; in perlguts!) or the given line in the named
source file.</p>

<p>step Steps through the program a line at a time.</p>

<p>next Steps through the program a line at a time, without
descending into functions.</p>

<p>continue Run until the next breakpoint.</p>

<p>finish Run until the end of the current function, then
stop again.</p>

<p>enter Just pressing Enter will do the most recent
operation again - its a blessing when stepping through miles
of source code.</p>

<p>print Execute the given C code and print its results.
WARNING: Perl makes heavy use of macros, and gdb does not
necessarily support macros (see later &quot;gdb macro
support&quot;). You ll have to substitute them yourself, or
to invoke cpp on the source code files (see &quot;The .i
Targets&quot;) So, for instance, you cant say</p>

<p>print SvPV_nolen(sv)</p>

<p>but you have to say</p>

<p>print Perl_sv_2pv_nolen(sv)</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to have a &quot;macro
dictionary&quot;, which you can produce by saying &quot;cpp
-dM perl.c sort&quot;. Even then, cpp wont recur- sively
apply those macros for you.</p>

<p>gdb macro support</p>

<p>Recent versions of gdb have fairly good macro support,
but in order to use it youll need to compile perl with macro
definitions included in the debugging information. Using gcc
version 3.1, this means configur- ing with
&quot;-Doptimize=-g3&quot;. Other compilers might use a
different switch (if they support debugging macros at
all).</p>

<p>Dumping Perl Data Structures</p>

<p>One way to get around this macro hell is to use the
dumping functions in dump.c; these work a little like an
internal Devel::Peek, but they also cover OPs and other
structures that you cant get at from Perl. Lets take an
example. Well use the &quot;$a = $b + $c&quot; we used
before, but give it a bit of context: &quot;$b =
&quot;6XXXX&quot;; $c = 2.3;&quot;. Where s a good place to
stop and poke around?</p>

<p>What about &quot;pp_add&quot;, the function we examined
earlier to implement the &quot;+&quot; operator:</p>

<p>(gdb) break Perl_pp_add Breakpoint 1 at 0x46249f: file
pp_hot.c, line 309.</p>

<p>Notice we use &quot;Perl_pp_add&quot; and not
&quot;pp_add&quot; - see &quot;Internal Functions&quot; in
perlguts. With the breakpoint in place, we can run our
program:</p>

<p>(gdb) run -e $b = &quot;6XXXX&quot;; $c = 2.3; $a = $b +
$c</p>

<p>Lots of junk will go past as gdb reads in the relevant
source files and libraries, and then:</p>

<p>Breakpoint 1, Perl_pp_add () at pp_hot.c:309 309 dSP;
dATARGET; tryAMAGICbin(add,opASSIGN); (gdb) step 311
dPOPTOPnnrl_ul; (gdb)</p>

<p>We looked at this bit of code before, and we said that
&quot;dPOPTOPnnrl_ul&quot; arranges for two &quot;NV&quot;s
to be placed into &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; -
lets slightly expand it:</p>

<p>#define dPOPTOPnnrl_ul NV right = POPn; SV *leftsv =
TOPs; NV left = USE_LEFT(leftsv) ? SvNV(leftsv) : 0.0</p>

<p>&quot;POPn&quot; takes the SV from the top of the stack
and obtains its NV either directly (if &quot;SvNOK&quot; is
set) or by calling the &quot;sv_2nv&quot; function.
&quot;TOPs&quot; takes the next SV from the top of the stack
- yes, &quot;POPn&quot; uses &quot;TOPs&quot; - but doesnt
remove it. We then use &quot;SvNV&quot; to get the NV from
&quot;leftsv&quot; in the same way as before - yes,
&quot;POPn&quot; uses &quot;SvNV&quot;.</p>

<p>Since we dont have an NV for $b, well have to use
&quot;sv_2nv&quot; to convert it. If we step again, well
find ourselves there:</p>

<p>Perl_sv_2nv (sv=0xa0675d0) at sv.c:1669 1669 if (!sv)
(gdb)</p>

<p>We can now use &quot;Perl_sv_dump&quot; to investigate
the SV:</p>

<p>SV = PV(0xa057cc0) at 0xa0675d0 REFCNT = 1 FLAGS =
(POK,pPOK) PV = 0xa06a510 &quot;6XXXX&quot; CUR = 5 LEN = 6
$1 = void</p>

<p>We know were going to get 6 from this, so lets finish
the subroutine:</p>

<p>(gdb) finish Run till exit from #0 Perl_sv_2nv
(sv=0xa0675d0) at sv.c:1671 0x462669 in Perl_pp_add () at
pp_hot.c:311 311 dPOPTOPnnrl_ul;</p>

<p>We can also dump out this op: the current op is always
stored in &quot;PL_op&quot;, and we can dump it with
&quot;Perl_op_dump&quot;. This ll give us simi- lar output
to B::Debug.</p>

<p>{ 13 TYPE = add ===&gt; 14 TARG = 1 FLAGS =
(SCALAR,KIDS) { TYPE = null ===&gt; (12) (was rv2sv) FLAGS =
(SCALAR,KIDS) { 11 TYPE = gvsv ===&gt; 12 FLAGS = (SCALAR)
GV = main::b } }</p>

<p># finish this later #</p>

<p>Patching</p>

<p>All right, weve now had a look at how to navigate the
Perl sources and some things youll need to know when
fiddling with them. Lets now get on and create a simple
patch. Here s something Larry suggested: if a &quot;U&quot;
is the first active format during a &quot;pack&quot;, (for
example, &quot;pack &quot;U3C8&quot;, @stuff&quot;) then the
resulting string should be treated as UTF-8 encoded.</p>

<p>How do we prepare to fix this up? First we locate the
code in question - the &quot;pack&quot; happens at runtime,
so its going to be in one of the pp files. Sure enough,
&quot;pp_pack&quot; is in pp.c. Since were going to be
altering this file, lets copy it to pp.c~.</p>

<p>[Well, it was in pp.c when this tutorial was written. It
has now been split off with &quot;pp_unpack&quot; to its own
file, pp_pack.c]</p>

<p>Now lets look over &quot;pp_pack&quot;: we take a
pattern into &quot;pat&quot;, and then loop over the
pattern, taking each format character in turn into
&quot;datum_type&quot;. Then for each possible format
character, we swallow up the other arguments in the pattern
(a field width, an asterisk, and so on) and convert the next
chunk input into the specified format, adding it onto the
output SV &quot;cat&quot;.</p>

<p>How do we know if the &quot;U&quot; is the first format
in the &quot;pat&quot;? Well, if we have a pointer to the
start of &quot;pat&quot; then, if we see a &quot;U&quot; we
can test whether we re still at the start of the string. So,
heres where &quot;pat&quot; is set up:</p>

<p>STRLEN fromlen; register char *pat = SvPVx(*++MARK,
fromlen); register char *patend = pat + fromlen; register
I32 len; I32 datumtype; SV *fromstr;</p>

<p>Well have another string pointer in there:</p>

<p>STRLEN fromlen; register char *pat = SvPVx(*++MARK,
fromlen); register char *patend = pat + fromlen; + char
*patcopy; register I32 len; I32 datumtype; SV *fromstr;</p>

<p>And just before we start the loop, well set
&quot;patcopy&quot; to be the start of &quot;pat&quot;:</p>

<p>items = SP - MARK; MARK++; sv_setpvn(cat, &quot;&quot;,
0); + patcopy = pat; while (pat &lt; patend) {</p>

<p>Now if we see a &quot;U&quot; which was at the start of
the string, we turn on the &quot;UTF8&quot; flag for the
output SV, &quot;cat&quot;:</p>

<p>+ if (datumtype == U &amp;&amp; pat==patcopy+1) +
SvUTF8_on(cat); if (datumtype == #) { ) while (pat &lt;
patend &amp;&amp; *pat != 0 pat++;</p>

<p>Remember that it has to be &quot;patcopy+1&quot; because
the first character of the string is the &quot;U&quot; which
has been swallowed into &quot;datumtype!&quot;</p>

<p>Oops, we forgot one thing: what if there are spaces at
the start of the pattern? &quot;pack(&quot; U*&quot;,
@stuff)&quot; will have &quot;U&quot; as the first active
char- acter, even though its not the first thing in the
pattern. In this case, we have to advance
&quot;patcopy&quot; along with &quot;pat&quot; when we see
spaces:</p>

<p>if (isSPACE(datumtype)) continue;</p>

<p>needs to become</p>

<p>if (isSPACE(datumtype)) { patcopy++; continue; }</p>

<p>OK. That s the C part done. Now we must do two
additional things before this patch is ready to go: weve
changed the behaviour of Perl, and so we must document that
change. We must also provide some more regression tests to
make sure our patch works and doesnt create a bug somewhere
else along the line.</p>

<p>The regression tests for each operator live in t/op/,
and so we make a copy of t/op/pack.t to t/op/pack.t~. Now we
can add our tests to the end. First, we ll test that the
&quot;U&quot; does indeed create Unicode strings.</p>

<p>t/op/pack.t has a sensible ok() function, but if it didn
t we could use the one from t/test.pl.</p>

<p>require ./test.pl; plan( tests =&gt; 159 );</p>

<p>so instead of this:</p>

<p>print not unless &quot;1.20.300.4000&quot; eq sprintf
&quot;%vd&quot;, pack(&quot;U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000); print
&quot;ok $test0; $test++;</p>

<p>we can write the more sensible (see Test::More for a
full explanation of is() and other testing functions).</p>

<p>is( &quot;1.20.300.4000&quot;, sprintf &quot;%vd&quot;,
pack(&quot;U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000), &quot;U* produces
unicode&quot; );</p>

<p>Now we ll test that we got that space-at-the-beginning
business right:</p>

<p>is( &quot;1.20.300.4000&quot;, sprintf &quot;%vd&quot;,
pack(&quot; U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000), &quot; with spaces at
the beginning&quot; );</p>

<p>And finally well test that we dont make Unicode strings
if &quot;U&quot; is not the first active format:</p>

<p>isnt( v1.20.300.4000, sprintf &quot;%vd&quot;,
pack(&quot;C0U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000), &quot;U* not first isn
t unicode&quot; );</p>

<p>Mustn t forget to change the number of tests which
appears at the top, or else the automated tester will get
confused. This will either look like this:</p>

<p>print &quot;1..1560;</p>

<p>or this:</p>

<p>plan( tests =&gt; 156 );</p>

<p>We now compile up Perl, and run it through the test
suite. Our new tests pass, hooray!</p>

<p>Finally, the documentation. The job is never done until
the paperwork is over, so lets describe the change weve just
made. The relevant place is pod/perlfunc.pod; again, we make
a copy, and then well insert this text in the description of
&quot;pack&quot;:</p>

<p>=item *</p>

<p>If the pattern begins with a C&lt;U&gt;, the resulting
string will be treated as UTF-8-encoded Unicode. You can
force UTF-8 encoding on in a string with an initial
C&lt;U0&gt;, and the bytes that follow will be interpreted
as Unicode characters. If you dont want this to happen, you
can begin your pattern with C&lt;C0&gt; (or anything else)
to force Perl not to UTF-8 encode your string, and then
follow this with a C&lt;U*&gt; somewhere in your
pattern.</p>

<p>All done. Now lets create the patch.
Porting/patching.pod tells us that if were making major
changes, we should copy the entire directory to somewhere
safe before we begin fiddling, and then do</p>

<p>diff -ruN old new &gt; patch</p>

<p>However, we know which files weve changed, and we can
simply do this:</p>

<p>diff -u pp.c~ pp.c &gt; patch diff -u t/op/pack.t~
t/op/pack.t &gt;&gt; patch diff -u pod/perlfunc.pod~
pod/perlfunc.pod &gt;&gt; patch</p>

<p>We end up with a patch looking a little like this:</p>

<p>And finally, we submit it, with our rationale, to

<p>Patching a core module</p>

<p>This works just like patching anything else, with an
extra considera- tion. Many core modules also live on CPAN.
If this is so, patch the CPAN version instead of the core
and send the patch off to the module maintainer (with a copy
to p5p). This will help the module maintainer keep the CPAN
version in sync with the core version without constantly
scanning p5p.</p>

<p>The list of maintainers of core modules is usefully
documented in Port- ing/Maintainers.pl.</p>

<p>Adding a new function to the core</p>

<p>If, as part of a patch to fix a bug, or just because you
have an espe- cially good idea, you decide to add a new
function to the core, discuss your ideas on p5p well before
you start work. It may be that someone else has already
attempted to do what you are considering and can give lots
of good advice or even provide you with bits of code that
they already started (but never finished).</p>

<p>You have to follow all of the advice given above for
patching. It is extremely important to test any addition
thoroughly and add new tests to explore all boundary
conditions that your new function is expected to handle. If
your new function is used only by one module (e.g. toke),
then it should probably be named S_your_function (for
static); on the other hand, if you expect it to accessible
from other functions in Perl, you should name it
Perl_your_function. See &quot;Internal Func- tions&quot; in
perlguts for more details.</p>

<p>The location of any new code is also an important
consideration. Dont just create a new top level .c file and
put your code there; you would have to make changes to
Configure (so the Makefile is created prop- erly), as well
as possibly lots of include files. This is strictly pumpking
business.</p>

<p>It is better to add your function to one of the existing
top level source code files, but your choice is complicated
by the nature of the Perl distribution. Only the files that
are marked as compiled static are located in the perl
executable. Everything else is located in the shared library
(or DLL if you are running under WIN32). So, for exam- ple,
if a function was only used by functions located in toke.c,
then your code can go in toke.c. If, however, you want to
call the function from universal.c, then you should put your
code in another location, for example util.c.</p>

<p>In addition to writing your c-code, you will need to
create an appro- priate entry in embed.pl describing your
function, then run make regen_headers to create the entries
in the numerous header files that perl needs to compile
correctly. See &quot;Internal Functions&quot; in perlguts
for information on the various options that you can set in
embed.pl. You will forget to do this a few (or many) times
and you will get warn- ings during the compilation phase.
Make sure that you mention this when you post your patch to
P5P; the pumpking needs to know this.</p>

<p>When you write your new code, please be conscious of
existing code con- ventions used in the perl source files.
See perlstyle for details. Although most of the guidelines
discussed seem to focus on Perl code, rather than c, they
all apply (except when they don t ;). See also
Porting/patching.pod file in the Perl source distribution
for lots of details about both formatting and submitting
patches of your changes.</p>

<p>Lastly, TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST any code before posting
to p5p. Test on as many platforms as you can find. Test as
many perl Configure options as you can (e.g. MULTIPLICITY).
If you have profiling or mem- ory tools, see &quot;EXTERNAL
TOOLS FOR DEBUGGING PERL&quot; below for how to use them to
further test your code. Remember that most of the people on
P5P are doing this on their own time and don t have the time
to debug your code.</p>

<p>Writing a test</p>

<p>Every module and built-in function has an associated
test file (or should...). If you add or change
functionality, you have to write a test. If you fix a bug,
you have to write a test so that bug never comes back. If
you alter the docs, it would be nice to test what the new
documentation says.</p>

<p>In short, if you submit a patch you probably also have
to patch the tests.</p>

<p>For modules, the test file is right next to the module
itself. lib/strict.t tests lib/strict.pm. This is a recent
innovation, so there are some snags (and it would be
wonderful for you to brush them out), but it basically works
that way. Everything else lives in t/.</p>

<p>t/base/ Testing of the absolute basic functionality of
Perl. Things like &quot;if&quot;, basic file reads and
writes, simple regexes, etc. These are run first in the test
suite and if any of them fail, something is really
broken.</p>

<p>t/cmd/ These test the basic control structures,
&quot;if/else&quot;, &quot;while&quot;, subrou- tines,
etc.</p>

<p>t/comp/ Tests basic issues of how Perl parses and
compiles itself.</p>

<p>t/io/ Tests for built-in IO functions, including command
line arguments.</p>

<p>t/lib/ The old home for the module tests, you shouldn t
put anything new in here. There are still some bits and
pieces hanging around in here that need to be moved. Perhaps
you could move them? Thanks!</p>

<p>t/op/ Tests for perls built in functions that dont fit
into any of the other directories.</p>

<p>t/pod/ Tests for POD directives. There are still some
tests for the Pod modules hanging around in here that need
to be moved out into lib/.</p>

<p>t/run/ Testing features of how perl actually runs,
including exit codes and handling of PERL* environment
variables.</p>

<p>t/uni/ Tests for the core support of Unicode.</p>

<p>t/win32/ Windows-specific tests.</p>

<p>t/x2p A test suite for the s2p converter.</p>

<p>The core uses the same testing style as the rest of
Perl, a simple &quot;ok/not ok&quot; run through
Test::Harness, but there are a few special con-
siderations.</p>

<p>There are three ways to write a test in the core.
Test::More, t/test.pl and ad hoc &quot;print $test ?
&quot;ok 420 : &quot;not ok 420&quot;. The decision of which
to use depends on what part of the test suite youre working
on. This is a measure to prevent a high-level failure (such
as Config.pm breaking) from causing basic functionality
tests to fail.</p>

<p>t/base t/comp Since we don t know if require works, or
even subroutines, use ad hoc tests for these two. Step
carefully to avoid using the feature being tested.</p>

<p>t/cmd t/run t/io t/op Now that basic require() and
subroutines are tested, you can use the t/test.pl library
which emulates the important features of Test::More while
using a minimum of core features.</p>

<p>You can also conditionally use certain libraries like
Config, but be sure to skip the test gracefully if its not
there.</p>

<p>t/lib ext lib Now that the core of Perl is tested,
Test::More can be used. You can also use the full suite of
core modules in the tests.</p>

<p>When you say &quot;make test&quot; Perl uses the t/TEST
program to run the test suite (except under Win32 where it
uses t/harness instead.) All tests are run from the t/
directory, not the directory which contains the test. This
causes some problems with the tests in lib/, so heres some
opportunity for some patching.</p>

<p>You must be triply conscious of cross-platform concerns.
This usually boils down to using File::Spec and avoiding
things like &quot;fork()&quot; and &quot;system()&quot;
unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Special Make Test Targets</p>

<p>There are various special make targets that can be used
to test Perl slightly differently than the standard
&quot;test&quot; target. Not all them are expected to give a
100% success rate. Many of them have several aliases, and
many of them are not available on certain operating sys-
tems.</p>

<p>coretest Run perl on all core tests (t/* and lib/[a-z]*
pragma tests).</p>

<p>(Not available on Win32)</p>

<p>test.deparse Run all the tests through B::Deparse. Not
all tests will succeed.</p>

<p>(Not available on Win32)</p>

<p>test.taintwarn Run all tests with the -t command-line
switch. Not all tests are expected to succeed (until theyre
specifically fixed, of course).</p>

<p>(Not available on Win32)</p>

<p>minitest Run miniperl on t/base, t/comp, t/cmd, t/run,
t/io, t/op, and t/uni tests.</p>

<p>test.valgrind check.valgrind utest.valgrind
ucheck.valgrind (Only in Linux) Run all the tests using the
memory leak + naughty memory access tool
&quot;valgrind&quot;. The log files will be named test-
name.valgrind.</p>

<p>test.third check.third utest.third ucheck.third (Only in
Tru64) Run all the tests using the memory leak + naughty
memory access tool &quot;Third Degree&quot;. The log files
will be named perl.3log.testname.</p>

<p>test.torture torturetest Run all the usual tests and
some extra tests. As of Perl 5.8.0 the only extra tests are
Abigails JAPHs, t/japh/abigail.t.</p>

<p>You can also run the torture test with t/harness by
giving &quot;-tor- ture&quot; argument to t/harness.</p>

<p>utest ucheck test.utf8 check.utf8 Run all the tests with
-Mutf8. Not all tests will succeed.</p>

<p>(Not available on Win32)</p>

<p>minitest.utf16 test.utf16 Runs the tests with UTF-16
encoded scripts, encoded with different versions of this
encoding.</p>

<p>&quot;make utest.utf16&quot; runs the test suite with a
combination of &quot;-utf8&quot; and &quot;-utf16&quot;
arguments to t/TEST.</p>

<p>(Not available on Win32)</p>

<p>test_harness Run the test suite with the t/harness
controlling program, instead of t/TEST. t/harness is more
sophisticated, and uses the Test::Har- ness module, thus
using this test target supposes that perl mostly works. The
main advantage for our purposes is that it prints a detailed
summary of failed tests at the end. Also, unlike t/TEST, it
doesnt redirect stderr to stdout.</p>

<p>Note that under Win32 t/harness is always used instead
of t/TEST, so there is no special &quot;test_harness&quot;
target.</p>

<p>Under Win32 s &quot;test&quot; target you may use the
TEST_SWITCHES and TEST_FILES environment variables to
control the behaviour of t/har- ness. This means you can
say</p>

<p>nmake test TEST_FILES=&quot;op/*.t&quot; nmake test
TEST_SWITCHES=&quot;-torture&quot;
TEST_FILES=&quot;op/*.t&quot;</p>

<p>test-notty test_notty Sets PERL_SKIP_TTY_TEST to true
before running normal test.</p>

<p>Running tests by hand</p>

<p>You can run part of the test suite by hand by using one
the following commands from the t/ directory :</p>

<p>./perl -I../lib TEST list-of-.t-files</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>./perl -I../lib harness list-of-.t-files</p>

<p>(if you don t specify test scripts, the whole test suite
will be run.)</p>

<p>Using t/harness for testing</p>

<p>If you use &quot;harness&quot; for testing you have
several command line options available to you. The arguments
are as follows, and are in the order that they must appear
if used together.</p>

<p>harness -v -torture -re=pattern LIST OF FILES TO TEST
harness -v -torture -re LIST OF PATTERNS TO MATCH</p>

<p>If &quot;LIST OF FILES TO TEST&quot; is omitted the file
list is obtained from the manifest. The file list may
include shell wildcards which will be expanded out.</p>

<p>-v Run the tests under verbose mode so you can see what
tests were run, and debug outbut.</p>

<p>-torture Run the torture tests as well as the normal
set.</p>

<p>-re=PATTERN Filter the file list so that all the test
files run match PATTERN. Note that this form is distinct
from the -re LIST OF PATTERNS form below in that it allows
the file list to be provided as well.</p>

<p>-re LIST OF PATTERNS Filter the file list so that all
the test files run match /(LIST OF PATTERNS)/. Note that
with this form the patterns are joined by and you cannot
supply a list of files, instead the test files are obtained
from the MANIFEST.</p>

<p>You can run an individual test by a command similar
to</p>

<p>./perl -I../lib patho/to/foo.t</p>

<p>except that the harnesses set up some environment
variables that may affect the execution of the test :</p>

<p>PERL_CORE=1 indicates that were running this test part
of the perl core test suite. This is useful for modules that
have a dual life on CPAN.</p>

<p>PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 is set to 2 if it isn t set
already (see &quot;PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL&quot;)</p>

<p>PERL (used only by t/TEST) if set, overrides the path to
the perl exe- cutable that should be used to run the tests
(the default being ./perl).</p>

<p>PERL_SKIP_TTY_TEST if set, tells to skip the tests that
need a terminal. Its actually set automatically by the
Makefile, but can also be forced artifi- cially by running
make test_notty.</p>

<p>EXTERNAL TOOLS FOR DEBUGGING PERL Sometimes it helps to
use external tools while debugging and testing Perl. This
section tries to guide you through using some common test-
ing and debugging tools with Perl. This is meant as a guide
to inter- facing these tools with Perl, not as any kind of
guide to the use of the tools themselves.</p>

<p>NOTE 1: Running under memory debuggers such as Purify,
valgrind, or Third Degree greatly slows down the execution:
seconds become minutes, minutes become hours. For example as
of Perl 5.8.1, the ext/Encode/t/Unicode.t takes
extraordinarily long to complete under e.g. Purify, Third
Degree, and valgrind. Under valgrind it takes more than six
hours, even on a snappy computer-- the said test must be
doing something that is quite unfriendly for memory
debuggers. If you dont feel like waiting, that you can
simply kill away the perl process.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: To minimize the number of memory leak false
alarms (see &quot;PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL&quot; for more
information), you have to have environ- ment variable
PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL set to 2. The TEST and harness scripts
do that automatically. But if you are running some of the
tests manually-- for csh-like shells:</p>

<p>setenv PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL 2</p>

<p>and for Bourne-type shells:</p>

<p>PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 export PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL</p>

<p>or in UNIXy environments you can also use the
&quot;env&quot; command:</p>

<p>env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 valgrind ./perl -Ilib ...</p>

<p>NOTE 3: There are known memory leaks when there are
compile-time errors within eval or require, seeing
&quot;S_doeval&quot; in the call stack is a good sign of
these. Fixing these leaks is non-trivial, unfortunately, but
they must be fixed eventually.</p>

<p>Rational Softwars Purify</p>

<p>Purify is a commercial tool that is helpful in
identifying memory over- runs, wild pointers, memory leaks
and other such badness. Perl must be compiled in a specific
way for optimal testing with Purify. Purify is available
under Windows NT, Solaris, HP-UX, SGI, and Siemens Unix.</p>

<p>Purify on Unix</p>

<p>On Unix, Purify creates a new Perl binary. To get the
most benefit out of Purify, you should create the perl to
Purify using:</p>

<p>sh Configure -Accflags=-DPURIFY -Doptimize= -g
-Uusemymalloc -Dusemultiplicity</p>

<p>where these arguments mean:</p>

<p>-Accflags=-DPURIFY Disables Perls arena memory
allocation functions, as well as forc- ing use of memory
allocation functions derived from the system mal- loc.</p>

<p>-Doptimize=-g Adds debugging information so that you see
the exact source state- ments where the problem occurs.
Without this flag, all you will see is the source filename
of where the error occurred.</p>

<p>-Uusemymalloc Disable Perl s malloc so that Purify can
more closely monitor allo- cations and leaks. Using Perl s
malloc will make Purify report most leaks in the
&quot;potential&quot; leaks category.</p>

<p>-Dusemultiplicity Enabling the multiplicity option
allows perl to clean up thoroughly when the interpreter
shuts down, which reduces the number of bogus leak reports
from Purify.</p>

<p>Once you ve compiled a perl suitable for Purifying, then
you can just:</p>

<p>make pureperl</p>

<p>which creates a binary named pureperl that has been
Purify ed. This binary is used in place of the standard perl
binary when you want to debug Perl memory problems.</p>

<p>As an example, to show any memory leaks produced during
the standard Perl testset you would create and run the
Purifyed perl as:</p>

<p>make pureperl cd t ../pureperl -I../lib harness</p>

<p>which would run Perl on test.pl and report any memory
problems.</p>

<p>Purify outputs messages in &quot;Viewer&quot; windows by
default. If you dont have a windowing environment or if you
simply want the Purify output to unobtrusively go to a log
file instead of to the interactive window, use these
following options to output to the log file
&quot;perl.log&quot;:</p>

<p>setenv PURIFYOPTIONS &quot;-chain-length=25 -windows=no
-log-file=perl.log -append-logfile=yes&quot;</p>

<p>If you plan to use the &quot;Viewer&quot; windows, then
you only need this option:</p>

<p>setenv PURIFYOPTIONS &quot;-chain-length=25&quot;</p>

<p>In Bourne-type shells:</p>

<p>PURIFYOPTIONS=&quot;...&quot; export PURIFYOPTIONS</p>

<p>or if you have the &quot;env&quot; utility:</p>

<p>env PURIFYOPTIONS=&quot;...&quot; ../pureperl ...</p>

<p>Purify on NT</p>

<p>Purify on Windows NT instruments the Perl binary
perl.exe on the fly. There are several options in the
makefile you should change to get the most use out of
Purify:</p>

<p>DEFINES You should add -DPURIFY to the DEFINES line so
the DEFINES line looks something like:</p>

<p>DEFINES = -DWIN32 -D_CONSOLE -DNO_STRICT $(CRYPT_FLAG)
-DPURIFY=1</p>

<p>to disable Perls arena memory allocation functions, as
well as to force use of memory allocation functions derived
from the system malloc.</p>

<p>USE_MULTI = define Enabling the multiplicity option
allows perl to clean up thoroughly when the interpreter
shuts down, which reduces the number of bogus leak reports
from Purify.</p>

<p>#PERL_MALLOC = define Disable Perl s malloc so that
Purify can more closely monitor allo- cations and leaks.
Using Perl s malloc will make Purify report most leaks in
the &quot;potential&quot; leaks category.</p>

<p>CFG = Debug Adds debugging information so that you see
the exact source state- ments where the problem occurs.
Without this flag, all you will see is the source filename
of where the error occurred.</p>

<p>As an example, to show any memory leaks produced during
the standard Perl testset you would create and run Purify
as:</p>

<p>cd win32 make cd ../t purify ../perl -I../lib
harness</p>

<p>which would instrument Perl in memory, run Perl on
test.pl, then finally report any memory problems.</p>

<p>valgrind</p>

<p>The excellent valgrind tool can be used to find out both
memory leaks and illegal memory accesses. As of August 2003
it unfortunately works only on x86 (ELF) Linux. The special
&quot;test.valgrind&quot; target can be used to run the
tests under valgrind. Found errors and memory leaks are
logged in files named test.valgrind.</p>

<p>As system libraries (most notably glibc) are also
triggering errors, valgrind allows to suppress such errors
using suppression files. The default suppression file that
comes with valgrind already catches a lot of them. Some
additional suppressions are defined in t/perl.supp.</p>

<p>To get valgrind and for more information see</p>

<p>http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/</p>

<p>Compas/Digitas/Hs Third Degree</p>

<p>Third Degree is a tool for memory leak detection and
memory access checks. It is one of the many tools in the
ATOM toolkit. The toolkit is only available on Tru64
(formerly known as Digital UNIX formerly known as DEC
OSF/1).</p>

<p>When building Perl, you must first run Configure with
-Doptimize=-g and -Uusemymalloc flags, after that you can
use the make targets &quot;perl.third&quot; and
&quot;test.third&quot;. (What is required is that Perl must
be compiled using the &quot;-g&quot; flag, you may need to
re-Configure.)</p>

<p>The short story is that with &quot;atom&quot; you can
instrument the Perl exe- cutable to create a new executable
called perl.third. When the instru- mented executable is
run, it creates a log of dubious memory traffic in file
called perl.3log. See the manual pages of atom and third for
more information. The most extensive Third Degree
documentation is avail- able in the Compaq &quot;Tru64 UNIX
Programmers Guide&quot;, chapter &quot;Debugging Programs
with Third Degree&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;test.third&quot; leaves a lot of files named
foo_bar.3log in the t/ subdirectory. There is a problem with
these files: Third Degree is so effective that it finds
problems also in the system libraries. There- fore you
should used the Porting/thirdclean script to cleanup the
*.3log files.</p>

<p>There are also leaks that for given certain definition
of a leak, arent. See &quot;PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL&quot; for
more information.</p>

<p>PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL</p>

<p>If you want to run any of the tests yourself manually
using e.g. val- grind, or the pureperl or perl.third
executables, please note that by default perl does not
explicitly cleanup all the memory it has allo- cated (such
as global memory arenas) but instead lets the exit() of the
whole program &quot;take care&quot; of such allocations,
also known as &quot;global destruction of objects&quot;.</p>

<p>There is a way to tell perl to do complete cleanup: set
the environment variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL to a non-zero
value. The t/TEST wrapper does set this to 2, and this is
what you need to do too, if you dont want to see the
&quot;global leaks&quot;: For example, for
&quot;third-degreed&quot; Perl:</p>

<p>env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 ./perl.third -Ilib
t/foo/bar.t</p>

<p>(Note: the mod_perl apache module uses also this
environment variable for its own purposes and extended its
semantics. Refer to the mod_perl documentation for more
information. Also, spawned threads do the equiv- alent of
setting this variable to the value 1.)</p>

<p>If, at the end of a run you get the message N scalars
leaked, you can recompile with
&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;, which will cause the
addresses of all those leaked SVs to be dumped; it also
converts &quot;new_SV()&quot; from a macro into a real
function, so you can use your favourite debugger to discover
where those pesky SVs were allocated.</p>

<p>Profiling</p>

<p>Depending on your platform there are various of
profiling Perl.</p>

<p>There are two commonly used techniques of profiling
executables: sta- tistical time-sampling and basic-block
counting.</p>

<p>The first method takes periodically samples of the CPU
program counter, and since the program counter can be
correlated with the code generated for functions, we get a
statistical view of in which functions the program is
spending its time. The caveats are that very small/fast
functions have lower probability of showing up in the
profile, and that periodically interrupting the program
(this is usually done rather fre- quently, in the scale of
milliseconds) imposes an additional overhead that may skew
the results. The first problem can be alleviated by run-
ning the code for longer (in general this is a good idea for
profil- ing), the second problem is usually kept in guard by
the profiling tools themselves.</p>

<p>The second method divides up the generated code into
basic blocks. Basic blocks are sections of code that are
entered only in the begin- ning and exited only at the end.
For example, a conditional jump starts a basic block. Basic
block profiling usually works by instru- menting the code by
adding enter basic block #nnnn book-keeping code to the
generated code. During the execution of the code the basic
block counters are then updated appropriately. The caveat is
that the added extra code can skew the results: again, the
profiling tools usually try to factor their own effects out
of the results.</p>

<p>Gprof Profiling</p>

<p>gprof is a profiling tool available in many UNIX
platforms, it uses statistical time-sampling.</p>

<p>You can build a profiled version of perl called
&quot;perl.gprof&quot; by invok- ing the make target
&quot;perl.gprof&quot; (What is required is that Perl must
be compiled using the &quot;-pg&quot; flag, you may need to
re-Configure). Run- ning the profiled version of Perl will
create an output file called gmon.out is created which
contains the profiling data collected during the
execution.</p>

<p>The gprof tool can then display the collected data in
various ways. Usually gprof understands the following
options:</p>

<p>-a Suppress statically defined functions from the
profile.</p>

<p>-b Suppress the verbose descriptions in the profile.</p>

<p>-e routine Exclude the given routine and its descendants
from the profile.</p>

<p>-f routine Display only the given routine and its
descendants in the profile.</p>

<p>-s Generate a summary file called gmon.sum which then
may be given to subsequent gprof runs to accumulate data
over several runs.</p>

<p>-z Display routines that have zero usage.</p>

<p>For more detailed explanation of the available commands
and output for- mats, see your own local documentation of
gprof.</p>

<p>GCC gcov Profiling</p>

<p>Starting from GCC 3.0 basic block profiling is
officially available for the GNU CC.</p>

<p>You can build a profiled version of perl called
perl.gcov by invoking the make target &quot;perl.gcov&quot;
(what is required that Perl must be com- piled using gcc
with the flags &quot;-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage&quot;,
you may need to re-Configure).</p>

<p>Running the profiled version of Perl will cause profile
output to be generated. For each source file an accompanying
&quot;.da&quot; file will be created.</p>

<p>To display the results you use the &quot;gcov&quot;
utility (which should be installed if you have gcc 3.0 or
newer installed). gcov is run on source code files, like
this</p>

<p>gcov sv.c</p>

<p>which will cause sv.c.gcov to be created. The .gcov
files contain the source code annotated with relative
frequencies of execution indicated by &quot;#&quot;
markers.</p>

<p>Useful options of gcov include &quot;-b&quot; which will
summarise the basic block, branch, and function call
coverage, and &quot;-c&quot; which instead of relative
frequencies will use the actual counts. For more information
on the use of gcov and basic block profiling with gcc, see
the latest GNU CC manual, as of GCC 3.0 see</p>

<p>http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.0/gcc.html</p>

<p>and its section titled &quot;8. gcov: a Test Coverage
Program&quot;</p>


<p>http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.0/gcc_8.html#SEC132</p>

<p>Pixie Profiling</p>

<p>Pixie is a profiling tool available on IRIX and Tru64
(aka Digital UNIX aka DEC OSF/1) platforms. Pixie does its
profiling using basic-block counting.</p>

<p>You can build a profiled version of perl called
perl.pixie by invoking the make target
&quot;perl.pixie&quot; (what is required is that Perl must
be compiled using the &quot;-g&quot; flag, you may need to
re-Configure).</p>

<p>In Tru64 a file called perl.Addrs will also be silently
created, this file contains the addresses of the basic
blocks. Running the profiled version of Perl will create a
new file called &quot;perl.Counts&quot; which con- tains the
counts for the basic block for that particular program
execu- tion.</p>

<p>To display the results you use the prof utility. The
exact incantation depends on your operating system,
&quot;prof perl.Counts&quot; in IRIX, and &quot;prof -pixie
-all -L. perl&quot; in Tru64.</p>

<p>In IRIX the following prof options are available:</p>

<p>-h Reports the most heavily used lines in descending
order of use. Useful for finding the hotspot lines.</p>

<p>-l Groups lines by procedure, with procedures sorted in
descending order of use. Within a procedure, lines are
listed in source order. Useful for finding the hotspots of
procedures.</p>

<p>In Tru64 the following options are available:</p>

<p>-p[rocedures] Procedures sorted in descending order by
the number of cycles exe- cuted in each procedure. Useful
for finding the hotspot proce- dures. (This is the default
option.)</p>

<p>-h[eavy] Lines sorted in descending order by the number
of cycles executed in each line. Useful for finding the
hotspot lines.</p>

<p>-i[nvocations] The called procedures are sorted in
descending order by number of calls made to the procedures.
Useful for finding the most used procedures.</p>

<p>-l[ines] Grouped by procedure, sorted by cycles executed
per procedure. Useful for finding the hotspots of
procedures.</p>

<p>-testcoverage The compiler emitted code for these lines,
but the code was unexe- cuted.</p>

<p>-z[ero] Unexecuted procedures.</p>

<p>For further information, see your systems manual pages
for pixie and prof.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous tricks</p>

<p>&middot; Those debugging perl with the DDD frontend over
gdb may find the following useful:</p>

<p>You can extend the data conversion shortcuts menu, so
for example you can display an SV s IV value with one click,
without doing any typing. To do that simply edit ~/.ddd/init
file and add after:</p>

<p>! Display shortcuts. Ddd*gdbDisplayShortcuts: /t () //
Convert to Bin /d () // Convert to Dec /x () // Convert to
Hex /o () // Convert to Oct( the following two lines:</p>

<p>((XPV*) (())-&gt;sv_any )-&gt;xpv_pv // 2pvx ((XPVIV*)
(())-&gt;sv_any )-&gt;xiv_iv // 2ivx</p>

<p>so now you can do ivx and pvx lookups or you can plug
there the sv_peek &quot;conversion&quot;:</p>

<p>Perl_sv_peek(my_perl, (SV*)()) // sv_peek</p>

<p>(The my_perl is for threaded builds.) Just remember that
every line, but the last one, should end with Alternatively
edit the init file interactively via: 3rd mouse but- ton
-&gt; New Display -&gt; Edit Menu</p>

<p>Note: you can define up to 20 conversion shortcuts in
the gdb sec- tion.</p>

<p>&middot; If you see in a debugger a memory area
mysteriously full of 0xabababab, you may be seeing the
effect of the Poison() macro, see perlclib.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>Weve had a brief look around the Perl source, an
overview of the stages perl goes through when its running
your code, and how to use a debugger to poke at the Perl
guts. We took a very simple problem and demonstrated how to
solve it fully - with documentation, regression tests, and
finally a patch for submission to p5p. Finally, we talked
about how to use external tools to debug and test Perl.</p>

<p>I d now suggest you read over those references again,
and then, as soon as possible, get your hands dirty. The
best way to learn is by doing, so:</p>

<p>&middot; Subscribe to perl5-porters, follow the patches
and try and under- stand them; dont be afraid to ask if
theres a portion youre not clear on - who knows, you may
unearth a bug in the patch...</p>

<p>&middot; Keep up to date with the bleeding edge Perl
distributions and get familiar with the changes. Try and get
an idea of what areas people are working on and the changes
theyre making.</p>

<p>&middot; Do read the README associated with your
operating system, e.g. README.aix on the IBM AIX OS. Dont
hesitate to supply patches to that README if you find
anything missing or changed over a new OS release.</p>

<p>&middot; Find an area of Perl that seems interesting to
you, and see if you can work out how it works. Scan through
the source, and step over it in the debugger. Play, poke,
investigate, fiddle! Youll probably get to understand not
just your chosen area but a much wider range of perls
activity as well, and probably sooner than you d think.</p>

<p>The Road goes ever on and on, down from the door where
it began.</p>

<p>If you can do these things, youve started on the long
road to Perl porting. Thanks for wanting to help make Perl
better - and happy hack- ing!</p>
