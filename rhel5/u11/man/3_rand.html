<p>RAND(3) Linux Programmer s Manual RAND(3)</p>

<p>NAME rand, rand_r, srand - pseudo-random number
generator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int rand(void);</p>

<p>int rand_r(unsigned int *seedp);</p>

<p>void srand(unsigned int seed);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rand() function returns a pseudo-random
integer between 0 and RAND_MAX.</p>

<p>The srand() function sets its argument as the seed for a
new sequence of pseudo-random integers to be returned by
rand(). These sequences are repeatable by calling srand()
with the same seed value.</p>

<p>If no seed value is provided, the rand() function is
automatically seeded with a value of 1.</p>

<p>The function rand() is not reentrant or thread-safe,
since it uses hid- den state that is modified on each call.
This might just be the seed value to be used by the next
call, or it might be something more elabo- rate. In order to
get reproducible behaviour in a threaded application, this
state must be made explicit. The function rand_r() is
supplied with a pointer to an unsigned int, to be used as
state. This is a very small amount of state, so this
function will be a weak pseudo-random generator. Try
drand48_r(3) instead.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The rand() and rand_r() functions return a
value between 0 and RAND_MAX. The srand() function returns
no value.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE POSIX.1-2001 gives the following example of an
implementation of rand() and srand(), possibly useful when
one needs the same sequence on two different machines.</p>

<p>static unsigned long next = 1;</p>

<p>/* RAND_MAX assumed to be 32767 */ int myrand(void) {
next = next * 1103515245 + 12345;
return((unsigned)(next/65536) % 32768); }</p>

<p>void mysrand(unsigned seed) { next = seed; }</p>

<p>NOTES The versions of rand() and srand() in the Linux C
Library use the same random number generator as random() and
srandom(), so the lower-order bits should be as random as
the higher-order bits. However, on older rand()
implementations, and on current implementations on different
systems, the lower-order bits are much less random than the
higher- order bits. Do not use this function in applications
intended to be portable when good randomness is needed.</p>

<p>In Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific
Computing (William H. Press, Brian P. Flannery, Saul A.
Teukolsky, William T. Vetterling; New York: Cambridge
University Press, 1992 (2nd ed., p. 277)), the follow- ing
comments are made: &quot;If you want to generate a random
integer between 1 and 10, you should always do it by using
high-order bits, as in</p>

<p>j = 1 + (int) (10.0 * (rand() / (RAND_MAX + 1.0)));</p>

<p>and never by anything resembling</p>

<p>j = 1 + (rand() % 10);</p>

<p>(which uses lower-order bits).&quot;</p>

<p>Random-number generation is a complex topic. The
Numerical Recipes in C book (see reference above) provides
an excellent discussion of prac- tical random-number
generation issues in Chapter 7 (Random Numbers).</p>

<p>For a more theoretical discussion which also covers many
practical issues in depth, please see Chapter 3 (Random
Numbers) in Donald E. Knuth s The Art of Computer
Programming, volume 2 (Seminumerical Algo- rithms), 2nd ed.;
Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company,
1981.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The functions rand() and srand() conform
to SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C89, POSIX.1-2001. The function
rand_r() is from POSIX.1-2001.</p>
