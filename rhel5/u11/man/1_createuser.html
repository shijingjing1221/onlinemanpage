<p>CREATEUSER(1) PostgreSQL Client Applications
CREATEUSER(1)</p>

<p>NAME createuser - define a new PostgreSQL user
account</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS createuser [ option... ] [ username ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION createuser creates a new PostgreSQL user (or
more precisely, a role). Only superusers and users with
CREATEROLE privilege can create new users, so createuser
must be invoked by someone who can connect as a superuser or
a user with CREATEROLE privilege.</p>

<p>If you wish to create a new superuser, you must connect
as a superuser, not merely with CREATEROLE privilege. Being
a superuser implies the ability to bypass all access
permission checks within the database, so superuserdom
should not be granted lightly.</p>

<p>createuser is a wrapper around the SQL command CREATE
ROLE [cre- ate_role(7)]. There is no effective difference
between creating users via this utility and via other
methods for accessing the server.</p>

<p>OPTIONS createuser accepts the following command-line
arguments:</p>

<p>username Specifies the name of the PostgreSQL user to be
created. This name must be different from all existing roles
in this Post- greSQL installation.</p>

<p>-s</p>

<p>--superuser The new user will be a superuser.</p>

<p>-S</p>

<p>--no-superuser The new user will not be a superuser.
This is the default.</p>

<p>-d</p>

<p>--createdb The new user will be allowed to create
databases.</p>

<p>-D</p>

<p>--no-createdb The new user will not be allowed to create
databases. This is the default.</p>

<p>-r</p>

<p>--createrole The new user will be allowed to create new
roles (that is, this user will have CREATEROLE
privilege).</p>

<p>-R</p>

<p>--no-createrole The new user will not be allowed to
create new roles. This is the default.</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>--login The new user will be allowed to log in (that is,
the user name can be used as the initial session user
identifier). This is the default.</p>

<p>-L</p>

<p>--no-login The new user will not be allowed to log in.
(A role without login privilege is still useful as a means
of managing database permissions.)</p>

<p>-i</p>

<p>--inherit The new role will automatically inherit
privileges of roles it is a member of. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-I</p>

<p>--no-inherit The new role will not automatically inherit
privileges of roles it is a member of.</p>

<p>-c number</p>

<p>--connection-limit number Set a maximum number of
connections for the new user. The default is to set no
limit.</p>

<p>-P</p>

<p>--pwprompt If given, createuser will issue a prompt for
the password of the new user. This is not necessary if you
do not plan on using password authentication.</p>

<p>-E</p>

<p>--encrypted Encrypts the user s password stored in the
database. If not specified, the default password behavior is
used.</p>

<p>-N</p>

<p>--unencrypted Does not encrypt the users password stored
in the database. If not specified, the default password
behavior is used.</p>

<p>-e</p>

<p>--echo Echo the commands that createuser generates and
sends to the server.</p>

<p>-q</p>

<p>--quiet Do not display a response.</p>

<p>You will be prompted for a name and other missing
information if it is not specified on the command line.</p>

<p>createuser also accepts the following command-line
arguments for con- nection parameters:</p>

<p>-h host</p>

<p>--host host Specifies the host name of the machine on
which the server is running. If the value begins with a
slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain
socket.</p>

<p>-p port</p>

<p>--port port Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain
socket file exten- sion on which the server is listening for
connections.</p>

<p>-U username</p>

<p>--username username User name to connect as (not the
user name to create).</p>

<p>-W</p>

<p>--password Force password prompt (to connect to the
server, not for the password of the new user).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT PGHOST</p>

<p>PGPORT</p>

<p>PGUSER Default connection parameters</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS In case of difficulty, see CREATE ROLE
[create_role(7)] and psql(1) for discussions of potential
problems and error messages. The database server must be
running at the targeted host. Also, any default connec- tion
settings and environment variables used by the libpq
front-end library will apply.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To create a user joe on the default database
server:</p>

<p>$ createuser joe Shall the new role be a superuser?
(y/n) n Shall the new role be allowed to create databases?
(y/n) n Shall the new role be allowed to create more new
roles? (y/n) n CREATE USER</p>

<p>To create the same user joe using the server on host
eden, port 5000, avoiding the prompts and taking a look at
the underlying command:</p>

<p>$ createuser -h eden -p 5000 -S -D -R -e joe CREATE ROLE
joe NOSUPERUSER NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE INHERIT LOGIN;
CREATE ROLE</p>

<p>To create the user joe as a superuser, and assign a
password immedi- ately:</p>

<p>$ createuser -P -s -e joe Enter password for new role:
xyzzy Enter it again: xyzzy CREATE ROLE joe PASSWORD xyzzy
SUPERUSER CREATEDB CREATEROLE INHERIT LOGIN; CREATE ROLE</p>

<p>In the above example, the new password isnt actually
echoed when typed, but we show what was typed for clarity.
However the password will appear in the echoed command, as
illustrated so you dont want to use -e when assigning a
password, if anyone else can see your screen.</p>
