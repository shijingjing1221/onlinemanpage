<p>NAME lppasswd - add, change, or delete digest
passwords.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lppasswd [ username ] lppasswd -a [ -g
groupname ] username lppasswd -x username</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lppasswd adds, changes, or deletes passwords
in the CUPS digest pass- word file, passwd.md5. When run by
a normal user, lppasswd will prompt for the old and new
passwords. When run by the super-user, lppasswd can add new
accounts (-a username), change existing accounts (user-
name), or delete accounts (-x username) in the digest
password file. Digest usernames do not have to match local
UNIX usernames.</p>

<p>OPTIONS lppasswd supports the following options:</p>

<p>-g groupname Specifies a group other than the default
system group.</p>

<p>SECURITY ISSUES The lppasswd command is installed setuid
to root. While every attempt has been made to make it secure
against exploits that could grant super-user privileges to
unprivileged users, paranoid system adminis- trators may
wish to disable or change the ownership of the program to an
unprivileged account.</p>
