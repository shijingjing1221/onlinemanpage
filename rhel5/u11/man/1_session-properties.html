<p>NAME session-properties - a non-CORBA version of the
session-properties-cap- plet.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS session-properties [ --init-session-settings ]
[ --warner ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION session-properties monitors the state of
current GNOME running applica- tions and capplets. It allows
you to change the style and priority of each program. You
can shut down applications, if you wish, and those
applications will be removed from your GNOME session. You
can also use Session Properties to kill a GNOME application
and remove it from ses- sion management so it will not be
restarted when you log in next time. Of course, there are
other ways to kill an application, such as using an explicit
kill command, but they would not prevent an application from
being restarted if it has the Respawn Style. The only way to
per- manently remove such an application is with the Remove
button.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --init-session-settings Initialize session
settings.</p>

<p>--warner Only display warnings.</p>
