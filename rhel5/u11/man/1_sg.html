<p>NAME sg - execute command as different group ID</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg [-] [group [-c ] command]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sg command works similar to newgrp but
accepts a command. The command will be executed with the
/bin/sh shell. With most shells you may run sg from, you
need to enclose multi-word commands in quotes. Another
difference between newgrp and sg is that some shells treat
newgrp specially, replacing themselves with a new instance
of a shell that newgrp creates. This doesnt happen with sg,
so upon exit from a sg command you are returned to your
previous group ID.</p>
