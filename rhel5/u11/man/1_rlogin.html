<p>RLOGIN(1) RLOGIN(1)</p>

<p>NAME rlogin - remote login</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rlogin rhost [-ec] [-8] [-c] [ -a] [-f] [-F]
[-t termtype] [-n] [-7] [-PN | -PO] [-4] [-d] [-k realm]
[-x] [-L] [-l username]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rlogin connects your terminal on the current
local host system lhost to the remote host system rhost.</p>

<p>The version built to use Kerberos authentication is very
similar to the standard Berkeley rlogin(1), except that
instead of the rhosts mecha- nism, it uses Kerberos
authentication to determine the authorization to use a
remote account.</p>

<p>Each user may have a private authorization list in a
file .k5login in his login directory. Each line in this file
should contain a Kerberos principal name of the form
principal/instance@realm. If the originat- ing user is
authenticated to one of the principals named in .k5login,
access is granted to the account. If there is no /.k5login
file, the principal will be granted access to the account
according to the aname-&gt;lname mapping rules. (See
krb5_anadd(8) for more details.) Otherwise a login and
password will be prompted for on the remote machine as in
login(1). To avoid some security problems, the .k5login file
must be owned by the remote user.</p>

<p>If there is some problem in marshaling the Kerberos
authentication information, an error message is printed and
the standard UCB rlogin is executed in place of the Kerberos
rlogin.</p>

<p>A line of the form ~. disconnects from the remote host,
where ~ is the escape character. Similarly, the line ~^Z
(where ^Z, con- trol-Z, is the suspend character) will
suspend the rlogin session. Substitution of the
delayed-suspend character (normally ^Y) for the suspend
character suspends the send portion of the rlogin, but
allows output from the remote system.</p>

<p>The remote terminal type is the same as your local
terminal type (as given in your environment TERM variable),
unless the -t option is spec- ified (see below). The
terminal or window size is also copied to the remote system
if the server supports the option, and changes in size are
reflected as well.</p>

<p>All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that
(except for delays) the rlogin is transparent. Flow control
via ^S and ^Q and flushing of input and output on interrupts
are handled properly.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -8 allows an eight-bit input data path at all
times; otherwise par- ity bits are stripped except when the
remote sides stop and start characters are other than ^S/^Q.
Eight-bit mode is the default.</p>

<p>-L allows the rlogin session to be run in litout
mode.</p>

<p>-ec sets the escape character to c. There is no space
separating this option flag and the new escape
character.</p>

<p>-c require confirmation before disconnecting via ~.</p>

<p>-a force the remote machine to ask for a password by
sending a null local username. This option has no effect
unless the standard UCB rlogin is executed in place of the
Kerberos rlogin (see above).</p>

<p>-f forward a copy of the local credentials to the remote
system.</p>

<p>-F forward a forwardable copy of the local credentials
to the remote system.</p>

<p>-t termtype replace the terminal type passed to the
remote host with termtype.</p>

<p>-n prevent suspension of rlogin via ~^Z or ~^Y.</p>

<p>-7 force seven-bit transmissions.</p>

<p>-d turn on socket debugging (via setsockopt(2)) on the
TCP sockets used for communication with the remote host.</p>

<p>-k request rlogin to obtain tickets for the remote host
in realm realm instead of the remote hosts realm as
determined by krb_realmofhost(3).</p>

<p>-x turn on DES encryption for data passed via the rlogin
session. This applies only to input and output streams, so
the username is sent unencrypted. This significantly reduces
response time and significantly increases CPU
utilization.</p>

<p>-PN</p>

<p>-PO Explicitly request new or old version of the
Kerberos rcmd protocol. The new protocol avoids many
security problems found in the old one, but is not
interoperable with older servers. (An &quot;input/output
error&quot; and a closed connection is the most likely
result of attempting this combination.) If neither option is
specified, some simple heuristics are used to guess which to
try.</p>

<p>-4 Use Kerberos V4 authentication only; don t try
Kerberos V5.</p>

Kerberos principals that are allowed access.</p>

<p>BUGS More of the environment should be propagated.</p>
