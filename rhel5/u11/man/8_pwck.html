<p>NAME pwck - verify integrity of password files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pwck [-q] [-s] [passwd shadow]</p>

<p>pwck [-q] [-r] [passwd shadow]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pwck verifies the integrity of the system
authentication information. All entries in the /etc/passwd
and /etc/shadow are checked to see that the entry has the
proper format and valid data in each field. The user is
prompted to delete entries that are improperly formatted or
which have other uncorrectable errors.</p>

<p>Checks are made to verify that each entry has:</p>

<p>&middot; the correct number of fields</p>

<p>&middot; a unique user name</p>

<p>&middot; a valid user and group identifier</p>

<p>&middot; a valid primary group</p>

<p>&middot; a valid home directory</p>

<p>&middot; a valid login shell</p>

<p>The checks for correct number of fields and unique user
name are fatal. If the entry has the wrong number of fields,
the user will be prompted to delete the entire line. If the
user does not answer affirmatively, all further checks are
bypassed. An entry with a duplicated user name is prompted
for deletion, but the remaining checks will still be made.
All other errors are warning and the user is encouraged to
run the usermod command to correct the error.</p>

<p>The commands which operate on the /etc/passwd file are
not able to alter corrupted or duplicated entries. pwck
should be used in those circumstances to remove the
offending entry.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options which apply to the pwck command
are:</p>

<p>-q Report errors only. The warnings which do not require
any action from the user wont be displayed.</p>

<p>-r Execute the pwck command in read-only mode.</p>

<p>-s Sort entries in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow by
UID.</p>

<p>By default, pwck operates on the files /etc/passwd and
/etc/shadow. The user may select alternate files with the
passwd and shadow parameters.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/passwd User account information.</p>

<p>/etc/shadow Secure user account information.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO group(5), passwd(5), shadow(5), usermod(8).</p>

<p>EXIT VALUES The pwck command exits with the following
values:</p>

<p>0 success</p>

<p>1 invalid command syntax</p>

<p>2 one or more bad password entries</p>

<p>3 cant open password files</p>

<p>4 cant lock password files</p>
