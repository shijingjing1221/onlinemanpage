<p>TERM(5) TERM(5)</p>

<p>NAME term - format of compiled term file.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS term</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Compiled terminfo descriptions are placed
under the directory /usr/share/terminfo. In order to avoid a
linear search of a huge UNIX system directory, a two-level
scheme is used: /usr/share/ter- minfo/c/name where name is
the name of the terminal, and c is the first character of
name. Thus, act4 can be found in the file /usr/share/ter-
minfo/a/act4. Synonyms for the same terminal are implemented
by multi- ple links to the same compiled file.</p>

<p>The format has been chosen so that it will be the same
on all hardware. An 8 or more bit byte is assumed, but no
assumptions about byte order- ing or sign extension are
made.</p>

<p>The compiled file is created with the tic program, and
read by the rou- tine setupterm. The file is divided into
six parts: the header, termi- nal names, boolean flags,
numbers, strings, and string table.</p>

<p>The header section begins the file. This section
contains six short integers in the format described below.
These integers are (1) the magic number (octal 0432); (2)
the size, in bytes, of the names sec- tion; (3) the number
of bytes in the boolean section; (4) the number of short
integers in the numbers section; (5) the number of offsets
(short integers) in the strings section; (6) the size, in
bytes, of the string table.</p>

<p>Short integers are stored in two 8-bit bytes. The first
byte contains the least significant 8 bits of the value, and
the second byte contains the most significant 8 bits. (Thus,
the value represented is 256*sec- ond+first.) The value -1
is represented by the two bytes 0377, 0377; other negative
values are illegal. This value generally means that the
corresponding capability is missing from this terminal. Note
that this format corresponds to the hardware of the VAX and
PDP-11 (that is, lit- tle-endian machines). Machines where
this does not correspond to the hardware must read the
integers as two bytes and compute the little- endian
value.</p>

<p>The terminal names section comes next. It contains the
first line of the terminfo description, listing the various
names for the terminal, separated by the | character. The
section is terminated with an ASCII NUL character.</p>

<p>The boolean flags have one byte for each flag. This byte
is either 0 or 1 as the flag is present or absent. The
capabilities are in the same order as the file
&lt;term.h&gt;.</p>

<p>Between the boolean section and the number section, a
null byte will be inserted, if necessary, to ensure that the
number section begins on an even byte (this is a relic of
the PDP-11s word-addressed architecture, originally designed
in to avoid IOT traps induced by addressing a word on an odd
byte boundary). All short integers are aligned on a short
word boundary.</p>

<p>The numbers section is similar to the flags section.
Each capability takes up two bytes, and is stored as a
little-endian short integer. If the value represented is -1,
the capability is taken to be missing.</p>

<p>The strings section is also similar. Each capability is
stored as a short integer, in the format above. A value of
-1 means the capability is missing. Otherwise, the value is
taken as an offset from the begin- ning of the string table.
Special characters in ^X or stored in their interpreted
form, not the printing representation. Padding information
$&lt;nn&gt; and parameter information %x are stored intact
in uninterpreted form.</p>

<p>The final section is the string table. It contains all
the values of string capabilities referenced in the string
section. Each string is null terminated.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible for setupterm to expect a
different set of capabilities than are actually present in
the file. Either the database may have been updated since
setupterm has been recompiled (resulting in extra
unrecognized entries in the file) or the program may have
been recompiled more recently than the database was updated
(resulting in missing entries). The routine setupterm must
be prepared for both possibilities - this is why the numbers
and sizes are included. Also, new capabilities must always
be added at the end of the lists of boolean, number, and
string capabilities.</p>

<p>Despite the consistent use of little-endian for numbers
and the other- wise self-describing format, it is not wise
to count on portability of binary terminfo entries between
commercial UNIX versions. The problem is that there are at
least three versions of terminfo (under HP-UX, AIX, and
OSF/1) which diverged from System V terminfo after SVr1, and
have added extension capabilities to the string table that
(in the binary format) collide with System V and XSI Curses
extensions. See terminfo(5) for detailed discussion of
terminfo source compatibility issues.</p>

<p>As an example, here is a hex dump of the description for
the Lear- Siegler ADM-3, a popular though rather stupid
early terminal:</p>
