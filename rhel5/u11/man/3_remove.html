<p>REMOVE(3) GNU REMOVE(3)</p>

<p>NAME remove - delete a name and possibly the file it
refers to</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int remove(const char *pathname);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION remove() deletes a name from the filesystem.
It calls unlink() for files, and rmdir() for
directories.</p>

<p>If the removed name was the last link to a file and no
processes have the file open the file is deleted and the
space it was using is made available for reuse.</p>

<p>If the name was the last link to a file but any
processes still have the file open the file will remain in
existence until the last file descriptor referring to it is
closed.</p>

<p>If the name referred to a symbolic link the link is
removed.</p>

<p>If the name referred to a socket, fifo or device the
name for it is removed but processes which have the object
open may continue to use it.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS The errors that occur are those for unlink(2) and
rmdir(2).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C89, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>BUGS Infelicities in the protocol underlying NFS can
cause the unexpected disappearance of files which are still
being used.</p>

<p>NOTE Under libc4 and libc5, remove() was an alias for
unlink() (and hence would not remove directories).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO rm(1), link(2), mknod(2), open(2), rename(2),
rmdir(2), unlink(2), mkfifo(3), unlink(8)</p>
