<p>MINCORE(2) Linux Programmer s Manual MINCORE(2)</p>

<p>NAME mincore - get information on whether pages are in
core</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mincore(void *start, size_t length, unsigned char
*vec);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mincore() function requests a vector
describing which pages of a file are in core and can be read
without disk access. The kernel will supply data for length
bytes following the start address. On return, the kernel
will have filled vec with bytes, of which the least signifi-
cant bit indicates if a page is core resident. (The other
bits are undefined, reserved for possible later use.) Of
course this is only a snapshot: pages that are not locked in
core can come and go any moment, and the contents of vec may
be stale already when this call returns.</p>

<p>For mincore() to return successfully, start must lie on
a page bound- ary. It is the callers responsibility to round
up to the nearest page. The length parameter need not be a
multiple of the page size. The vec- tor vec must be large
enough to contain (length+PAGE_SIZE-1) / PAGE_SIZE bytes.
One may obtain the page size from getpagesize(2).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, mincore() returns zero. On
error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN kernel is temporarily out of resources</p>

<p>EFAULT vec points to an invalid address</p>

<p>EINVAL start is not a multiple of the page size.</p>

<p>ENOMEM len is greater than (TASK_SIZE - start). (This
could occur if a negative value is specified for len, since
that value will be interpreted as a large unsigned integer.)
In Linux 2.6.11 and earlier, the error EINVAL was returned
for this condition.</p>

<p>ENOMEM address to address + length contained unmapped
memory, or memory not part of a file.</p>

<p>BUGS Up to now (Linux 2.6.5), mincore() does not return
correct information for MAP_PRIVATE mappings.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO mincore() is not specified in
POSIX.1-2001, and it is not available on all Unix
implementations.</p>

<p>HISTORY The mincore() function first appeared in
4.4BSD.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY Since Linux 2.3.99pre1 and glibc 2.2.</p>
