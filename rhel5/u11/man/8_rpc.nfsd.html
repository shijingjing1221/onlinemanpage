<p>NAME rpc.nfsd - NFS server process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd [options] nproc</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rpc.nfsd program implements the user
level part of the NFS service. The main functionality is
handled by the nfsd.o kernel module; the user space program
merely starts the specified number of kernel threads.</p>

<p>The rpc.mountd server provides an ancillary service
needed to satisfy mount requests by NFS clients.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -H or --host hostname specify a particular
hostname (or address) that NFS requests will be accepted on.
By default, rpc.nfsd will accept NFS requests on all known
network addresses. Note that lockd (which performs file
locking services for NFS) may still accept request on all
known network addresses. This may change in future releases
of the Linux Kernel.</p>

<p>-p or --port port specify a diferent port to listen on
for NFS requests. By default, rpc.nfsd will listen on port
2049.</p>

<p>-N or --no-nfs-version vers This option can be used to
request that rpc.nfsd does not offer certain versions of
NFS. The current version of rpc.nfsd can support both NFS
version 2,3 and the newer version 4.</p>

<p>-T or --no-tcp Disable rpc.nfsd from accepting TCP
connections from clients.</p>

<p>-U or --no-udp Disable rpc.nfsd from accepting UDP
connections from clients.</p>

<p>nproc specify the number of NFS server threads. By
default, just one thread is started. However, for optimum
performance several threads should be used. The actual
figure depends on the number of and the work load created by
the NFS clients, but a useful starting point is 8 threads.
Effects of modifying that number can be checked using the
nfsstat(8) program.</p>

nfsstat(8).</p>
