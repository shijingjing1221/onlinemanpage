<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>NAME ctags - Generate tag files for source code</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ctags [options] [file(s)]</p>

<p>etags [options] [file(s)]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ctags and etags programs (hereinafter
collectively referred to as ctags, except where
distinguished) generate an index (or &quot;tag&quot;) file
for a variety of language objects found in file(s). This tag
file allows these items to be quickly and easily located by
a text editor or other utility. A &quot;tag&quot; signifies
a language object for which an index entry is available (or,
alternatively, the index entry created for that object).</p>

<p>Alternatively, ctags can generate a cross reference file
which lists, in human readable form, information about the
various source objects found in a set of language files.</p>

<p>Tag index files are supported by numerous editors, which
allow the user to locate the object associated with a name
appearing in a source file and jump to the file and line
which defines the name. Those known about at the time of
this release are:</p>

<p>Vi(1) and its derivatives (e.g. Elvis, Vim, Vile,
Lemmy), CRiSP, Emacs, FTE (Folding Text Editor), JED, jEdit,
Mined, NEdit (Nirvana Edit), TSE (The SemWare Editor),
UltraEdit, WorkSpace, X2, Zeus</p>

<p>Ctags is capable of generating different kinds of tags
for each of many different languages. For a complete list of
supported languages, the names by which they are recognized,
and the kinds of tags which are generated for each, see the
--list-languages and --list-kinds options.</p>

<p>SOURCE FILES Unless the --language-force option is
specified, the language of each source file is automatically
selected based upon a mapping of file names to languages.
The mappings in effect for each language may be display
using the --list-maps option and may be changed using the
--langmap option. On platforms which support it, if the name
of a file is not mapped to a language and the file is
executable, the first line of the file is checked to see if
the file is a &quot;#!&quot; script for a recog- nized
language.</p>

<p>By default, all other files names are ignored. This
permits running ctags on all files in either a single
directory (e.g. &quot;ctags *&quot;), or on all files in an
entire source directory tree (e.g. &quot;ctags -R&quot;),
since only those files whose names are mapped to languages
will be scanned.</p>

<p>[The reason that .h extensions are mapped to C++ files
rather than C files is because it is common to use .h
extensions in C++, and no harm results in treating them as
C++ files.]</p>

<p>OPTIONS Despite the wealth of available options,
defaults are set so that ctags is most commonly executed
without any options (e.g. &quot;ctags *&quot;, or
&quot;ctags -R&quot;), which will create a tag file in the
current directory for all recognized source files. The
options described below are provided merely to allow custom
tailoring to meet special needs.</p>

<p>Note that spaces separating the single-letter options
from their param- eters are optional.</p>

<p>Note also that the boolean parameters to the long form
options (those beginning with &quot;--&quot; and that take a
&quot;[=yes|no]&quot; parameter) may be omit- ted, in which
case &quot;=yes&quot; is implied. (e.g. --sort is equivalent
to --sort=yes). Note further that &quot;=1&quot; and
&quot;=on&quot; are considered synonyms for
&quot;=yes&quot;, and that &quot;=0&quot; and
&quot;=off&quot; are considered synonyms for
&quot;=no&quot;.</p>

<p>Some options are either ignored or useful only when used
while running in etags mode (see -e option). Such options
will be noted.</p>

<p>Most options may appear anywhere on the command line,
affecting only those files which follow the option. A few
options, however, must appear before the first file name and
will be noted as such.</p>

<p>Options taking language names will accept those names in
either upper or lower case. See the --list-languages option
for a complete list of the built-in language names.</p>

<p>-a Equivalent to --append.</p>

<p>-B Use backward searching patterns (e.g. ?pattern?).
[Ignored in etags mode]</p>

<p>-e Enable etags mode, which will create a tag file for
use with the Emacs editor. Alternatively, if ctags is
invoked by a name con- taining the string &quot;etags&quot;
(either by renaming, or creating a link to, the executable),
etags mode will be enabled. This option must appear before
the first file name.</p>

<p>-f tagfile Use the name specified by tagfile for the tag
file (default is &quot;tags&quot;, or &quot;TAGS&quot; when
running in etags mode). If tagfile is spec- ified as
&quot;-&quot;, then the tag file is written to standard
output instead. Ctags will stubbornly refuse to take orders
if tagfile exists and its first line contains something
other than a valid tags line. This will save your neck if
you mistakenly type &quot;ctags -f *.c&quot;, which would
otherwise overwrite your first C file with the tags
generated by the rest! It will also refuse to accept a multi
character file name which begins with a - (dash) charac-
ter, since this most likely means that you left out the tag
file name and this option tried to grab the next option as
the file name. If you really want to name your output tag
file &quot;-ugly&quot;, specify it as &quot;./-ugly&quot;.
This option must appear before the first file name. If this
option is specified more than once, only the last will
apply.</p>

<p>-F Use forward searching patterns (e.g. /pattern/)
(default). [Ignored in etags mode]</p>

<p>-h list Specifies a list of file extensions, separated
by periods, which are to be interpreted as include (or
header) files. To indicate files having no extension, use a
period not followed by a non- period character (e.g.
&quot;.&quot;, &quot;..x&quot;, &quot;.x.&quot;). This
option only affects how the scoping of a particular kinds of
tags is inter- preted (i.e. whether or not they are
considered as globally visi- ble or visible only within the
file in which they are defined); it does not map the
extension to any particular language. Any tag which is
located in a non-include file and cannot be seen (e.g.
linked to) from another file is considered to have
file-limited (e.g. static) scope. No kind of tag appearing
in an include file will be considered to have file-limited
scope. If the first char- acter in the list is a plus sign,
then the extensions in the list will be appended to the
current list; otherwise, the list will replace the current
list. See, also, the --file-scope option. The default list
is &quot;.h.H.hh.hpp.hxx.h++.inc.def&quot;. To restore the
default list, specify -h default. Note that if an extension
sup- plied to this option is not already mapped to a
particular lan- guage (see SOURCE FILES, above), you will
also need to use either the --langmap or --language-force
option.</p>

<p>-I identifier-list Specifies a list of identifiers which
are to be specially handled while parsing C and C++ source
files. This option is specifically provided to handle
special cases arising through the use of pre- processor
macros. When the identifiers listed are simple identi-
fiers, these identifiers will be ignored during parsing of
the source files. If an identifier is suffixed with a +
character, ctags will also ignore any parenthesis-enclosed
argument list which may immediately follow the identifier in
the source files. If two identifiers are separated with the
= character, the first identifiers is replaced by the second
identifiers for parsing pur- poses. The list of identifiers
may be supplied directly on the command line or read in from
a separate file. If the first charac- ter of identifier-list
is @ , . or a pathname separator (/ or ), or the first two
characters specify a drive letter (e.g. &quot;C:&quot;), the
parameter identifier-list will be interpreted as a filename
from which to read a list of identifiers, one per input
line. Otherwise, identifier-list is a list of identifiers
(or identifier pairs) to be specially handled, each
delimited by a either a comma or by white space (in which
case the list should be quoted to keep the entire list as
one command line argument). Mul- tiple -I options may be
supplied. To clear the list of ignore identifiers, supply a
single dash (&quot;-&quot;) for identifier-list.</p>

<p>This feature is useful when preprocessor macros are used
in such a way that they cause syntactic confusion due to
their presence. Indeed, this is the best way of working
around a number of prob- lems caused by the presence of
syntax-busting macros in source files (see CAVEATS, below).
Some examples will illustrate this point.</p>

<p>int foo ARGDECL4(void *, ptr, long int, nbytes)</p>

<p>In the above example, the macro &quot;ARGDECL4&quot;
would be mistakenly interpreted to be the name of the
function instead of the correct name of &quot;foo&quot;.
Specifying -I ARGDECL4 results in the correct behavior.</p>

<p>/* creates an RCS version string in module */
MODULE_VERSION(&quot;$Revision: 1.41 $&quot;)</p>

<p>In the above example the macro invocation looks too much
like a function definition because it is not followed by a
semicolon (indeed, it could even be followed by a global
variable definition that would look much like a K&amp;R
style function parameter declaration). In fact, this seeming
function definition could pos- sibly even cause the rest of
the file to be skipped over while trying to complete the
definition. Specifying -I MODULE_VERSION+ would avoid such a
problem.</p>

<p>CLASS Example { // your content here };</p>

<p>The example above uses &quot;CLASS&quot; as a
preprocessor macro which expands to something different for
each platform. For instance CLASS may be defined as
&quot;class __declspec(dllexport)&quot; on Win32 platforms
and simply &quot;class&quot; on UNIX. Normally, the absence
of the C++ keyword &quot;class&quot; would cause the source
file to be incor- rectly parsed. Correct behavior can be
restored by specifying -I CLASS=class.</p>

<p>-L file Read from file a list of file names for which
tags should be gen- erated. If file is specified as
&quot;-&quot;, then file names are read from standard input.
File names read using this option are pro- cessed following
file names appearing on the command line. Options all also
accepted in this input. If this option is specified more
than once, only the last will apply. Note: file is read in
line- oriented mode, where a new line is the only delimiter
and spaces are considered significant, in order that file
names containing spaces may be supplied; this can affect how
options are parsed if included in the input.</p>

<p>-n Equivalent to --excmd=number.</p>

<p>-N Equivalent to --excmd=pattern.</p>

<p>-o tagfile Equivalent to -f tagfile.</p>

<p>-R Equivalent to --recurse.</p>

<p>-u Equivalent to --sort=no (i.e.
&quot;unsorted&quot;).</p>

<p>-V Equivalent to --verbose.</p>

<p>-w This option is silently ignored for
backward-compatibility with the ctags of SVR4 Unix.</p>

<p>-x Print a tabular, human-readable cross reference
(xref) file to standard output instead of generating a tag
file. The information contained in the output includes: the
tag name; the kind of tag; the line number, file name, and
source line (with extra white space condensed) of the file
which defines the tag. No tag file is written and all
options affecting tag file output will be ignored. Example
applications for this feature are generating a listing of
all functions located in a source file (e.g. ctags -x
--c-kinds=f file), or generating a list of all externally
visible global vari- ables located in a source file (e.g.
ctags -x --c-kinds=v --file- scope=no file). This option
must appear before the first file name.</p>

<p>--append[=yes|no] Indicates whether tags generated from
the specified files should be appended to those already
present in the tag file or should replace them. This option
is off by default. This option must appear before the first
file name.</p>

<p>--etags-include=file Include a reference to file in the
tag file. This option may be specified as many times as
desired. This supports Emacs capabil- ity to use a tag file
which &quot;includes&quot; other tag files. [Available only
in etags mode]</p>

<p>--exclude=[pattern] Add pattern to a list of excluded
files and directories. This option may be specified as many
times as desired. For each file name considered by ctags,
each pattern specified using this option will be compared
against both the complete path (e.g. some/path/base.ext) and
the base name (e.g. base.ext) of the file, thus allowing
patterns which match a given file name irrespective of its
path, or match only a specific path. If appropriate support
is available from the runtime library of your C compiler,
then pattern may contain the usual shell wildcards (not
regular expres- sions) common on Unix (be sure to quote the
option parameter to protect the wildcards from being
expanded by the shell before being passed to ctags; also be
aware that wildcards can match the slash character, /). You
can determine if shell wildcards are available on your
platform by examining the output of the --ver- sion option,
which will include &quot;+wildcards&quot; in the compiled
fea- ture list; otherwise, pattern is matched against file
names using a simple textual comparison.</p>

<p>If pattern begins with the character @, then the rest of
the string is interpreted as a file name from which to read
exclusion patterns, one per line. If pattern is empty, the
list of excluded patterns is cleared. Note that at program
startup, the default exclude list contains
&quot;EIFGEN&quot;, &quot;SCCS&quot;, &quot;RCS&quot;, and
&quot;CVS&quot;, which are names of directories for which it
is generally not desirable to descend while processing the
--recurse option.</p>

<p>--excmd=type Determines the type of EX command used to
locate tags in the source file. [Ignored in etags mode]</p>

<p>The valid values for type (either the entire word or the
first letter is accepted) are:</p>

<p>number Use only line numbers in the tag file for
locating tags. This has four advantages: 1. Significantly
reduces the size of the resulting tag file. 2. Eliminates
failures to find tags because the line defining the tag has
changed, causing the pattern match to fail (note that some
editors, such as vim, are able to recover in many such
instances). 3. Eliminates finding identical matching, but
incorrect, source lines (see BUGS, below). 4. Retains
separate entries in the tag file for lines which are
identical in content. In pattern mode, duplicate entries are
dropped because the search pat- terns they generate are
identical, making the dupli- cate entries useless.</p>

<p>However, this option has one significant drawback:
changes to the source files can cause the line numbers
recorded in the tag file to no longer correspond to the
lines in the source file, causing jumps to some tags to miss
the target definition by one or more lines. Basi- cally,
this option is best used when the source code to which it is
applied is not subject to change. Selecting this option type
causes the following options to be ignored: -BF.</p>

<p>pattern Use only search patterns for all tags, rather
than the line numbers usually used for macro definitions.
This has the advantage of not referencing obsolete line
numbers when lines have been added or removed since the tag
file was generated.</p>

<p>mixed In this mode, patterns are generally used with a
few exceptions. For C, line numbers are used for macro defi-
nition tags. This was the default format generated by the
original ctags and is, therefore, retained as the default
for this option. For Fortran, line numbers are used for
common blocks because their corresponding source lines are
generally identical, making pattern searches useless for
finding all matches.</p>

<p>--extra=[+|-]flags Specifies whether to include extra
tag entries for certain kinds of information. The parameter
flags is a set of one-letter flags, each representing one
kind of extra tag entry to include in the tag file. If flags
is preceded by by either the + or - charac- ter, the effect
of each flag is added to, or removed from, those currently
enabled; otherwise the flags replace any current set- tings.
The meaning of each flag is as follows:</p>

<p>f Include an entry for the base file name of every
source file (e.g. &quot;example.c&quot;), which addresses
the first line of the file.</p>

<p>q Include an extra class-qualified tag entry for each
tag which is a member of a class (for languages for which
this information is extracted; currently C++, Eiffel, and
Java). The actual form of the qualified tag depends upon the
lan- guage from which the tag was derived (using a form that
is most natural for how qualified calls are specified in the
language). For C++, it is in the form
&quot;class::member&quot;; for Eiffel and Java, it is in the
form &quot;class.member&quot;. This may allow easier
location of a specific tags when multiple occurrences of a
tag name occur in the tag file. Note, how- ever, that this
could potentially more than double the size of the tag
file.</p>

<p>--fields=[+|-]flags Specifies the available extension
fields which are to be included in the entries of the tag
file (see TAG FILE FORMAT, below, for more information). The
parameter flags is a set of one-letter flags, each
representing one type of extension field to include, with
the following meanings (disabled by default unless indi-
cated):</p>

<p>a Access (or export) of class members f File-restricted
scoping [enabled] i Inheritance information k Kind of tag as
a single letter [enabled] K Kind of tag as full name l
Language of source file containing tag m Implementation
information n Line number of tag definition s Scope of tag
definition [enabled] S Signature of routine (e.g. prototype
or parameter list) z Include the &quot;kind:&quot; key in
kind field t Type and name of a variable or typedef as
&quot;typeref:&quot; field [enabled]</p>

<p>Each letter or group of letters may be preceded by
either + to add it to the default set, or - to exclude it.
In the absence of any preceding + or - sign, only those
kinds explicitly listed in flags will be included in the
output (i.e. overriding the default set). This option is
ignored if the option --format=1 has been specified. The
default value of this options is fks.</p>

<p>--file-scope[=yes|no] Indicates whether tags scoped only
for a single file (i.e. tags which cannot be seen outside of
the file in which they are defined, such as
&quot;static&quot; tags) should be included in the output.
See, also, the -h option. This option is enabled by
default.</p>

<p>--filter[=yes|no] Causes ctags to behave as a filter,
reading source file names from standard input and printing
their tags to standard output on a file-by-file basis. If
--sorted is enabled, tags are sorted only within the source
file in which they are defined. File names are read from
standard output in line-oriented input mode (see note for -L
option) and only after file names listed on the command line
or from any file supplied using the -L option. When this
option is enabled, the options -f, -o, and --totals are
ignored. This option is quite esoteric and is disabled by
default. This option must appear before the first file
name.</p>

<p>--filter-terminator=string Specifies a string to print
to standard output following the tags for each file name
parsed when the --filter option is enabled. This may permit
an application reading the output of ctags to determine when
the output for each file is finished. Note that if the file
name read is a directory and --recurse is enabled, this
string will be printed only one once at the end of all tags
found for by descending the directory. This string will
always be sepa- rated from the last tag line for the file by
its terminating new- line. This option is quite esoteric and
is empty by default. This option must appear before the
first file name.</p>

<p>--format=level Change the format of the output tag file.
Currently the only valid values for level are 1 or 2. Level
1 specifies the original tag file format and level 2
specifies a new extended format containing extension fields
(but in a manner which retains backward-compati- bility with
original vi(1) implementations). The default level is 2.
This option must appear before the first file name. [Ignored
in etags mode]</p>

<p>--help Prints to standard output a detailed usage
description, and then exits.</p>

<p>--if0[=yes|no] Indicates a preference as to whether code
within an &quot;#if 0&quot; branch of a preprocessor
conditional should be examined for non-macro tags (macro
tags are always included). Because the intent of this
construct is to disable code, the default value of this
options is no. Note that this indicates a preference only
and does not guar- antee skipping code within an &quot;#if
0&quot; branch, since the fall-back algorithm used to
generate tags when preprocessor conditionals are too complex
follows all branches of a conditional. This option is
disabled by default.</p>

<p>--&lt;LANG&gt;-kinds=[+|-]kinds Specifies a list of
language-specific kinds of tags (or kinds) to include in the
output file for a particular language, where &lt;LANG&gt; is
case-insensitive and is one of the built-in language names
(see the --list-languages option for a complete list). The
parameter kinds is a group of one-letter flags designating
kinds of tags (particular to the language) to either include
or exclude from the output. The specific sets of flags
recognized for each language, their meanings and defaults
may be list using the --list-kinds option. Each letter or
group of letters may be preceded by either + to add it to,
or - to remove it from, the default set. In the absence of
any preceding + or - sign, only those kinds explicitly
listed in kinds will be included in the output (i.e.
overriding the default for the specified language).</p>

<p>As an example for the C language, in order to add
prototypes and external variable declarations to the default
set of tag kinds, but exclude macros, use --c-kinds=+px-d;
to include only tags for functions, use --c-kinds=f.</p>

<p>--langdef=name Defines a new user-defined language,
name, to be parsed with regu- lar expressions. Once defined,
name may be used in other options taking language names. The
typical use of this option is to first define the language,
then map file names to it using --langmap, then specify
regular expressions using --regex-&lt;LANG&gt; to define how
its tags are found.</p>

<p>--langmap=map[,map[...]] Controls how file names are
mapped to languages (see the --list- maps option). Each
comma-separated map consists of the language name (either a
built-in or user-defined language), a colon, and a list of
file extensions and/or file name patterns. A file exten-
sion is specified by preceding the extension with a period
(e.g. &quot;.c&quot;). A file name pattern is specified by
enclosing the pattern in parentheses (e.g.
&quot;([Mm]akefile)&quot;). If appropriate support is
available from the runtime library of your C compiler, then
the file name pattern may contain the usual shell wildcards
common on Unix (be sure to quote the option parameter to
protect the wild- cards from being expanded by the shell
before being passed to ctags). You can determine if shell
wildcards are available on your platform by examining the
output of the --version option, which will include
&quot;+wildcards&quot; in the compiled feature list;
otherwise, the file name patterns are matched against file
names using a sim- ple textual comparison. When mapping a
file extension, it will first be unmapped from any other
languages.</p>

<p>If the first character in a map is a plus sign, then the
exten- sions and file name patterns in that map will be
appended to the current map for that language; otherwise,
the map will replace the current map. For example, to
specify that only files with exten- sions of .c and .x are
to be treated as C language files, use
&quot;--langmap=c:.c.x&quot;; to also add files with
extensions of .j as Java language files, specify
&quot;--langmap=c:.c.x,java:+.j&quot;. To map makefiles
(.e.g files named either &quot;Makefile&quot;,
&quot;makefile&quot;, or hav- ing the extension
&quot;.mak&quot;) to a language called &quot;make&quot;,
specify &quot;--langmap=make:([Mm]akefile).mak&quot;. To map
files having no exten- sion, specify a period not followed
by a non-period character (e.g. &quot;.&quot;,
&quot;..x&quot;, &quot;.x.&quot;). To clear the mapping for
a particular language (thus inhibiting automatic generation
of tags for that language), specify an empty extension list
(e.g. &quot;--langmap=for- tran:&quot;). To restore the
default language mappings for all a par- ticular language,
supply the keyword &quot;default&quot; for the mapping. To
specify restore the default language mappings for all lan-
guages, specify &quot;--langmap=default&quot;. Note that
file extensions are tested before file name patterns when
inferring the language of a file.</p>

<p>--language-force=language By default, ctags
automatically selects the language of a source file,
ignoring those files whose language cannot be determined
(see SOURCE FILES, above). This option forces the specified
lan- guage (case-insensitive; either built-in or
user-defined) to be used for every supplied file instead of
automatically selecting the language based upon its
extension. In addition, the special value auto indicates
that the language should be automatically selected (which
effectively disables this option).</p>

<p>--languages=[+|-]list Specifies the languages for which
tag generation is enabled, with list containing a
comma-separated list of language names (case- insensitive;
either built-in or user-defined). If the first lan- guage of
list is not preceded by either a + or -, the current list
will be cleared before adding or removing the languages in
list. Until a - is encountered, each language in the list
will be added to the current list. As either the + or
removed from the current list, respectively. Thus, it
becomes simple to replace the current list with a new one,
or to add or remove languages from the current list. The
actual list of files for which tags will be generated
depends upon the language extension mapping in effect (see
the --langmap option). Note that all languages, including
user-defined languages are enabled unless explicitly
disabled using this option. Language names included in list
may be any built-in language or one previously defined with
--langdef. The default is &quot;all&quot;, which is also
accepted as a valid argument. See the --list-languages
option for a complete list of the built- in language
names.</p>

<p>--license Prints a summary of the software license to
standard output, and then exits.</p>

<p>--line-directives[=yes|no] Specifies whether
&quot;#line&quot; directives should be recognized. These are
present in the output of preprocessors and contain the line
number, and possibly the file name, of the original source
file(s) from which the preprocessor output file was
generated. When enabled, this option will cause ctags to
generate tag entries marked with the file names and line
numbers of their locations original source file(s), instead
of their actual locations in the preprocessor output. The
actual file names placed into the tag file will have the
same leading path components as the preproces- sor output
file, since it is assumed that the original source files are
located relative to the preprocessor output file (unless, of
course, the #line directive specifies an absolute path).
This option is off by default. Note: This option is gener-
ally only useful when used together with the --excmd=number
(-n) option. Also, you may have to use either the --langmap
or --language-force option if the extension of the
preprocessor out- put file is not known to ctags.</p>

<p>--links[=yes|no] Indicates whether symbolic links (if
supported) should be fol- lowed. When disabled, symbolic
links are ignored. This option is on by default.</p>

<p>--list-kinds[=language|all] Lists the tag kinds
recognized for either the specified language or all
languages, and then exits. Each kind of tag recorded in the
tag file is represented by a one-letter flag, which is also
used to filter the tags placed into the output through use
of the --&lt;LANG&gt;-kinds option. Note that some languages
and/or tag kinds may be implemented using regular
expressions and may not be avail- able if regex support is
not compiled into ctags (see the --regex-&lt;LANG&gt;
option). Each kind listed is enabled unless fol- lowed by
&quot;[off]&quot;.</p>

<p>--list-maps[=language|all] Lists the file extensions and
file name patterns which associate a file name with a
language for either the specified language or all languages,
and then exits. See the --langmap option, and SOURCE FILES,
above.</p>

<p>--list-languages Lists the names of the languages
understood by ctags, and then exits. These language names
are case insensitive and may be used in the
--language-force, --languages, --&lt;LANG&gt;-kinds, and
--regex-&lt;LANG&gt; options.</p>

<p>--options=file Read additional options from file. As a
special case, if --options=NONE is specified as the first
option on the command line, it will disable the automatic
reading of any configuration options from either a file or
the environment (see FILES).</p>

<p>--recurse[=yes|no] Recurse into directories encountered
in the list of supplied files. If the list of supplied files
is empty and no file list is specified with the -L option,
then the current directory (i.e. &quot;.&quot;) is assumed.
Symbolic links are followed. If you dont like these
behaviors, either explicitly specify the files or pipe the
output of find(1) into ctags -L- instead. Note: This option
is not supported on all platforms at present. It is
available if the output of the --help option includes this
option. See, also, the --exclude to limit recursion.</p>


<p>--regex-&lt;LANG&gt;=/regexp/replacement/[kind-spec/][flags]
The /regexp/replacement/ pair define a regular expression
replace- ment pattern, similar in style to sed substitution
commands, with which to generate tags from source files
mapped to the named lan- guage, &lt;LANG&gt;,
(case-insensitive; either a built-in or user- defined
language). The regular expression, regexp, defines an
extended regular expression (roughly that used by egrep(1)),
which is used to locate a single source line containing a
tag and may specify tab characters using . When a matching
line is found, a tag will be generated for the name defined
by replacement, which generally will contain the special
back-references 1 through 9 to refer to matching
sub-expression groups within regexp. The / separator
characters shown in the parameter to the option can actually
be replaced by any character. Note that whichever separator
character is used will have to be escaped with a back- slash
() character wherever it is used in the parameter as
something other than a separator. The regular expression
defined by this option is added to the current list of
regular expressions for the specified language unless the
parameter is omitted, in which case the current list is
cleared.</p>

<p>Unless modified by flags, regexp is interpreted as a
Posix extended regular expression. The replacement should
expand for all matching lines to a non-empty string of
characters, or a warning message will be reported. An
optional kind specifier for tags matching regexp may follow
replacement, which will determine what kind of tag is
reported in the &quot;kind&quot; extension field (see TAG
FILE FORMAT, below). The full form of kind-spec is in the
form of a single letter, a comma, a name (without spaces), a
comma, a description, followed by a separator, which specify
the short and long forms of the kind value and its textual
description (dis- played using --list-kinds). Either the
kind name and/or the description may be omitted. If
kind-spec is omitted, it defaults to &quot;r,regex&quot;.
Finally, flags are one or more single-letter charac- ters
having the following effect upon the interpretation of reg-
exp:</p>

<p>b The pattern is interpreted as a Posix basic regular
expres- sion.</p>

<p>e The pattern is interpreted as a Posix extended regular
expression (default).</p>

<p>i The regular expression is to be applied in a
case-insensi- tive manner.</p>

<p>Note that this option is available only if ctags was
compiled with support for regular expressions, which depends
upon your platform. You can determine if support for regular
expressions is compiled in by examining the output of the
--version option, which will include &quot;+regex&quot; in
the compiled feature list.</p>

<p>For more information on the regular expressions used by
ctags, see either the regex(5,7) man page, or the GNU info
documentation for regex (e.g. &quot;info regex&quot;).</p>

<p>--sort[=yes|no|foldcase] Indicates whether the tag file
should be sorted on the tag name (default is yes). Note that
the original vi(1) required sorted tags. The foldcase value
specifies case insensitive (or case- folded) sorting. Fast
binary searches of tag files sorted with case-folding will
require special support from tools using tag files, such as
that found in the ctags readtags library, or Vim version 6.2
or higher (using &quot;set ignorecase&quot;). This option
must appear before the first file name. [Ignored in etags
mode]</p>

<p>--tag-relative[=yes|no] Indicates that the file paths
recorded in the tag file should be relative to the directory
containing the tag file, rather than relative to the current
directory, unless the files supplied on the command line are
specified with absolute paths. This option must appear
before the first file name. The default is yes when running
in etags mode (see the -e option), no otherwise.</p>

<p>--totals[=yes|no] Prints statistics about the source
files read and the tag file written during the current
invocation of ctags. This option is off by default. This
option must appear before the first file name.</p>

<p>--verbose[=yes|no] Enable verbose mode. This prints out
information on option pro- cessing and a brief message
describing what action is being taken for each file
considered by ctags. Normally, ctags does not read command
line arguments until after options are read from the con-
figuration files (see FILES, below) and the CTAGS
environment variable. However, if this option is the first
argument on the command line, it will take effect before any
options are read from these sources. The default is no.</p>

<p>--version Prints a version identifier for ctags to
standard output, and then exits. This is guaranteed to
always contain the string &quot;Exuberant Ctags&quot;.</p>

<p>OPERATIONAL DETAILS As ctags considers each file name in
turn, it tries to determine the language of the file by
applying the following three tests in order: if the file
extension has been mapped to a language, if the file name
matches a shell pattern mapped to a language, and finally if
the file is executable and its first line specifies an
interpreter using the Unix-style &quot;#!&quot;
specification (if supported on the platform). If a lan-
guage was identified, the file is opened and then the
appropriate lan- guage parser is called to operate on the
currently open file. The parser parses through the file and
adds an entry to the tag file for each language object it is
written to handle. See TAG FILE FORMAT, below, for details
on these entries.</p>

<p>This implementation of ctags imposes no formatting
requirements on C code as do legacy implementations. Older
implementations of ctags tended to rely upon certain
formatting assumptions in order to help it resolve coding
dilemmas caused by preprocessor conditionals.</p>

<p>In general, ctags tries to be smart about conditional
preprocessor directives. If a preprocessor conditional is
encountered within a statement which defines a tag, ctags
follows only the first branch of that conditional (except in
the special case of &quot;#if 0&quot;, in which case it
follows only the last branch). The reason for this is that
failing to pursue only one branch can result in ambiguous
syntax, as in the following example:</p>

<p>#ifdef TWO_ALTERNATIVES struct { #else union { #endif
short a; long b; }</p>

<p>Both branches cannot be followed, or braces become
unbalanced and ctags would be unable to make sense of the
syntax.</p>

<p>If the application of this heuristic fails to properly
parse a file, generally due to complicated and inconsistent
pairing within the condi- tionals, ctags will retry the file
using a different heuristic which does not selectively
follow conditional preprocessor branches, but instead falls
back to relying upon a closing brace (&quot;}&quot;) in
column 1 as indicating the end of a block once any brace
imbalance results from following a #if conditional
branch.</p>

<p>Ctags will also try to specially handle arguments lists
enclosed in double sets of parentheses in order to accept
the following conditional construct:</p>

<p>extern void foo __ARGS((int one, char two));</p>

<p>Any name immediately preceding the &quot;((&quot; will
be automatically ignored and the previous name will be
used.</p>

<p>C++ operator definitions are specially handled. In order
for consis- tency with all types of operators (overloaded
and conversion), the operator name in the tag file will
always be preceded by the string &quot;operator &quot; (i.e.
even if the actual operator definition was written as
&quot;operator&lt;&lt;&quot;).</p>

<p>After creating or appending to the tag file, it is
sorted by the tag name, removing identical tag lines.</p>

<p>TAG FILE FORMAT When not running in etags mode, each
entry in the tag file consists of a separate line, each
looking like this in the most general case:</p>


<p>tag_name&lt;TAB&gt;file_name&lt;TAB&gt;ex_cmd;&quot;&lt;TAB&gt;extension_fields</p>

<p>The fields and separators of these lines are specified
as follows:</p>

<p>1. tag name 2. single tab character 3. name of the file
in which the object associated with the tag is located 4.
single tab character 5. EX command used to locate the tag
within the file; generally a search pattern (either
/pattern/ or ?pattern?) or line number (see --excmd). Tag
file format 2 (see --format) extends this EX command under
certain circumstances to include a set of exten- sion fields
(described below) embedded in an EX comment immedi- ately
appended to the EX command, which leaves it backward-com-
patible with original vi(1) implementations.</p>

<p>A few special tags are written into the tag file for
internal purposes. These tags are composed in such a way
that they always sort to the top of the file. Therefore, the
first two characters of these tags are used a magic number
to detect a tag file for purposes of determining whether a
valid tag file is being overwritten rather than a source
file.</p>

<p>Note that the name of each source file will be recorded
in the tag file exactly as it appears on the command line.
Therefore, if the path you specified on the command line was
relative to the current directory, then it will be recorded
in that same manner in the tag file. See, how- ever, the
--tag-relative option for how this behavior can be
modified.</p>

<p>Extension fields are tab-separated key-value pairs
appended to the end of the EX command as a comment, as
described above. These key value pairs appear in the general
form &quot;key:value&quot;. Their presence in the lines of
the tag file are controlled by the --fields option. The
possi- ble keys and the meaning of their values are as
follows:</p>

<p>access Indicates the visibility of this class member,
where value is specific to the language.</p>

<p>file Indicates that the tag has file-limited visibility.
This key has no corresponding value.</p>

<p>kind Indicates the type, or kind, of tag. Its value is
either one of the corresponding one-letter flags described
under the various --&lt;LANG&gt;-kinds options above, or a
full name. It is permitted (and is, in fact, the default)
for the key portion of this field to be omitted. The
optional behaviors are controlled with the --fields
option.</p>

<p>implementation When present, this indicates a limited
implementation (abstract vs. concrete) of a routine or
class, where value is specific to the language
(&quot;virtual&quot; or &quot;pure virtual&quot; for C++;
&quot;abstract&quot; for Java).</p>

<p>inherits When present, value. is a comma-separated list
of classes from which this class is derived (i.e. inherits
from).</p>

<p>signature When present, value. is a language-dependent
representation of the signature of a routine. A routine
signature in its complete form specifies the return type of
a routine and its formal argument list. This extension field
is presently supported only for C-based languages and does
not include the return type.</p>

<p>In addition, information on the scope of the tag
definition may be available, with the key portion equal to
some language-dependent con- struct name and its value the
name declared for that construct in the program. This scope
entry indicates the scope in which the tag was found. For
example, a tag generated for a C structure member would have
a scope looking like &quot;struct:myStruct&quot;.</p>

<p>HOW TO USE WITH VI Vi will, by default, expect a tag
file by the name &quot;tags&quot; in the cur- rent
directory. Once the tag file is built, the following
commands exercise the tag indexing feature:</p>

<p>vi -t tag Start vi and position the cursor at the file
and line where &quot;tag&quot; is defined.</p>

<p>:ta tag Find a tag.</p>

<p>Ctrl-] Find the tag under the cursor.</p>

<p>Ctrl-T Return to previous location before jump to tag
(not widely implemented).</p>

<p>HOW TO USE WITH GNU EMACS Emacs will, by default, expect
a tag file by the name &quot;TAGS&quot; in the current
directory. Once the tag file is built, the following
commands exercise the tag indexing feature:</p>

<p>M-x visit-tags-table &lt;RET&gt; FILE &lt;RET&gt; Select
the tag file, &quot;FILE&quot;, to use.</p>

<p>M-. [TAG] &lt;RET&gt; Find the first definition of TAG.
The default tag is the identifier under the cursor.</p>

<p>M-* Pop back to where you previously invoked
&quot;M-.&quot;.</p>

<p>C-u M-. Find the next definition for the last tag.</p>

<p>For more commands, see the Tags topic in the Emacs info
document.</p>

<p>HOW TO USE WITH NEDIT NEdit version 5.1 and later can
handle the new extended tag file format (see --format). To
make NEdit use the tag file, select &quot;File-&gt;Load Tags
File&quot;. To jump to the definition for a tag, highlight
the word, the press Ctrl-D. NEdit 5.1 can can read multiple
tag files from different directories. Setting the X resource
nedit.tagFile to the name of a tag file instructs NEdit to
automatically load that tag file at startup time.</p>

<p>CAVEATS Because ctags is neither a preprocessor nor a
compiler, use of prepro- cessor macros can fool ctags into
either missing tags or improperly generating inappropriate
tags. Although ctags has been designed to han- dle certain
common cases, this is the single biggest cause of reported
problems. In particular, the use of preprocessor constructs
which alter the textual syntax of C can fool ctags. You can
work around many such problems by using the -I option.</p>

<p>White space is treated as a separator for file names and
options read from list files, specified using the -L option,
and in filter mode (specified using the --filter option).
Therefore, it is not currently possible to supply file names
or other options containing embedded white space (spaces,
etc.) through these options.</p>

<p>Note that when ctags generates uses patterns for
locating tags (see the --excmd option), it is entirely
possible that the wrong line may be found by your editor if
there exists another source line which is iden- tical to the
line containing the tag. The following example demon-
strates this condition:</p>

<p>int variable;</p>

<p>/* ... */ void foo(variable) int variable; { /* ... */
}</p>

<p>Depending upon which editor you use and where in the
code you happen to be, it is possible that the search
pattern may locate the local parame- ter declaration in
foo() before it finds the actual global variable definition,
since the lines (and therefore their search patterns are
identical). This can be avoided by use of the --excmd=n
option.</p>

<p>BUGS Ctags has more options than ls(1).</p>

<p>When parsing a C++ member function definition (e.g.
&quot;className::func- tion&quot;), ctags cannot determine
whether the scope specifier is a class name or a namespace
specifier and always lists it as a class name in the scope
portion of the extension fields. Also, if a C++ function is
defined outside of the class declaration (the usual case),
the access specification (i.e. public, protected, or
private) and implementation information (e.g. virtual, pure
virtual) contained in the function dec- laration are not
known when the tag is generated for the function defi-
nition. It will, however be available for prototypes (e.g
--c++-kinds=+p).</p>

<p>No qualified tags are generated for language objects
inherited into a class.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CTAGS If this environment variable
exists, it will be expected to contain a set of default
options which are read when ctags starts, after the
configuration files listed in FILES, below, are read, but
before any command line options are read. Options appearing
on the command line will override options specified in this
variable. Only options will be read from this variable. Note
that all white space in this variable in considered a sep-
arator, making it impossible to pass an option parameter
con- taining an embedded space. If this is a problem, use a
configu- ration file instead.</p>

<p>ETAGS Similar to the CTAGS variable above, this
variable, if found, will be read when etags starts. If this
variable is not found, etags will try to use CTAGS
instead.</p>

<p>TMPDIR On Unix-like hosts where mkstemp() is available,
the value of this variable specifies the directory in which
to place tempo- rary files. This can be useful if the size
of a temporary file becomes too large to fit on the
partition holding the default temporary directory defined at
compilation time. ctags creates temporary files only if
either (1) an emacs-style tag file is being generated, (2)
the tag file is being sent to standard output, or (3) the
program was compiled to use an internal sort algorithm to
sort the tag files instead of the the sort utility of the
operating system. If the sort utility of the operating
system is being used, it will generally observe this
variable also. Note that if ctags is setuid, the value of
TMPDIR will be ignored.</p>

<p>FILES /ctags.cnf (on MSDOS, MSWindows only)
/etc/ctags.conf /usr/local/etc/ctags.conf $HOME/.ctags
($HOME/ctags.cnf on MSDOS, MSWindows) .ctags (ctags.cnf on
MSDOS, MSWindows) If any of these configuration files exist,
each will be expected to contain a set of default options
which are read in the order listed when ctags starts, but
before the CTAGS environment vari- able is read or any
command line options are read. This makes it possible to set
up site-wide, personal or project-level defaults. It is
possible to compile ctags to read an additional
configuration file before any of those shown above, which
will be indicated if the output produced by the --version
option lists the &quot;custom-conf&quot; feature. Options
appearing in the CTAGS environment variable or on the
command line will override options specified in these files.
Only options will be read from these files. Note that the
option files are read in line-ori- ented mode in which
spaces are significant (since shell quoting is not
possible). Each line of the file is read as one command line
parameter (as if it were quoted with single quotes). There-
fore, use new lines to indicate separate command-line
arguments.</p>
