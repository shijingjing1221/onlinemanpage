<p>FDATASYNC(2) Linux Programmer s Manual FDATASYNC(2)</p>

<p>NAME fdatasync - synchronize a files in-core data with
that on disk</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fdatasync(int fd);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fdatasync() flushes all data buffers of a
file to disk (before the sys- tem call returns). It
resembles fsync() but is not required to update the metadata
such as access time.</p>

<p>Applications that access databases or log files often
write a tiny data fragment (e.g., one line in a log file)
and then call fsync() immedi- ately in order to ensure that
the written data is physically stored on the harddisk.
Unfortunately, fsync() will always initiate two write
operations: one for the newly written data and another one
in order to update the modification time stored in the
inode. If the modification time is not a part of the
transaction concept fdatasync() can be used to avoid
unnecessary inode disk write operations.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF fd is not a valid file descriptor open for
writing.</p>

<p>EIO An error occurred during synchronization.</p>

<p>EROFS, EINVAL fd is bound to a special file which does
not support synchro- nization.</p>

<p>BUGS Currently (Linux 2.2) fdatasync() is equivalent to
fsync().</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY On POSIX systems on which fdatasync() is
available, _POSIX_SYNCHRO- NIZED_IO is defined in
&lt;unistd.h&gt; to a value greater than 0. (See also
sysconf(3).)</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>
