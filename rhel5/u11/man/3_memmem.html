<p>MEMMEM(3) Linux Programmer s Manual MEMMEM(3)</p>

<p>NAME memmem - locate a substring</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *memmem(const void *haystack, size_t haystacklen,
const void *needle, size_t needlelen);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The memmem() function finds the start of the
first occurrence of the substring needle of length needlelen
in the memory area haystack of length haystacklen.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The memmem() function returns a pointer to
the beginning of the sub- string, or NULL if the substring
is not found.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function is a GNU extension.</p>

<p>BUGS This function was broken in Linux libraries up to
and including libc 5.0.9; there the needle and haystack
arguments were interchanged, and a pointer to the end of the
first occurrence of needle was returned. Since libc 5.0.9 is
still widely used, this is a dangerous function to use. Both
old and new libc s have the bug that if needle is empty
haystack-1 (instead of haystack) is returned. And glibc 2.0
makes it worse, and returns a pointer to the last byte of
haystack. This is fixed in glibc 2.1.</p>
