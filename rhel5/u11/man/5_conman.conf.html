<p>CONMAN.CONF(5) LLNL CONMAN.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME conman.conf - ConMan daemon configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The conman.conf configuration file is used
to specify the consoles being managed by conmand.</p>

<p>Comments are introduced by a hash sign (#), and continue
until the end of the line. Blank lines and white-space are
ignored. Directives are terminated by a newline, but may
span multiple lines by escaping it (ie, immediately
preceding the newline with a backslash). Strings may be
either single-quoted or double-quoted, but they may not
contain new- lines. Keywords are case-insensitive.</p>

<p>SERVER DIRECTIVES These directives begin with the SERVER
keyword followed by one of the following key/value
pairs:</p>

<p>keepalive = (on|off) Specifies whether the daemon will
use TCP keep-alives for detecting dead connections. The
default is on.</p>

<p>logdir = &quot;directory&quot; Specifies a directory
prefix for log files that are not defined via an absolute
pathname.</p>

<p>logfile = &quot;file[,priority]&quot; Specifies the file
to which log messages are appended. This string undergoes
conversion specifier expansion (cf, CONVERSION
SPECIFICATIONS). If an absolute pathname is not specified,
the files location is relative to logdir (assuming it has
been pre- viously defined). This file will be created if it
does not already exist. The filename may optionally be
followed by a comma and a minimum priority at which messages
will be logged. Refer to syslog.conf(5) for a list of
priorities. The default priority is info. If this keyword is
used in conjunction with the syslog keyword, messages will
be sent to both locations.</p>

<p>loopback = (on|off) Specifies whether the daemon will
bind its socket to the loop- back address, thereby only
accepting local client connections directed to that address
(127.0.0.1). The default is off.</p>

<p>pidfile = &quot;file&quot; Specifies the file to which
the daemons PID is written. The use of a pidfile is
recommended if you want to use the daemons -k, -q, or -r
options.</p>

<p>port = integer Specifies the port on which the daemon
will listen for client connections.</p>

<p>resetcmd = &quot;string&quot; Specifies a command string
to be invoked by a subshell upon receipt of the client s
&quot;reset&quot; escape. Multiple commands within a string
may be separated with semicolons. This string undergoes
conversion specifier expansion (cf, CONVERSION SPECI-
FICATIONS) and will be invoked multiple times if the client
is connected to multiple consoles.</p>

<p>syslog = &quot;facility&quot; Specifies that log
messages are to be sent to the system logger (syslogd) at
the given facility. Refer to syslog.conf(5) for a list of
facilities. If this keyword is used in conjunction with the
logfile keyword, messages will be sent to both
locations.</p>

<p>tcpwrappers = (on|off) Specifies whether the daemon will
use TCP-Wrappers when accept- ing client connections.
Support for this feature must be enabled at compile-time
(via configure s &quot;--with-tcp-wrappers&quot; option).
Refer to hosts_access(5) and hosts_options(5) for more
details. The default is off.</p>

<p>timestamp = integer (m|h|d) Specifies the interval
between timestamps written to the indi- vidual console log
files. The interval is an integer that may be followed by a
single-character modifier; m for minutes (the default), h
for hours, or d for days. The default is 0 (ie, no
timestamps).</p>

<p>GLOBAL DIRECTIVES These directives begin with the GLOBAL
keyword followed by one of the following key/value
pairs:</p>

<p>log = &quot;file&quot; Specifies the default log file to
use for each console direc- tive. This string undergoes
conversion specifier expansion (cf, CONVERSION
SPECIFICATIONS) and must contain either %N or %D. If an
absolute pathname is not given, the file s location is
relative to logdir (assuming it has been previously
defined).</p>

<p>logopts =
&quot;(sanitize|nosanitize),(timestamp|notimestamp)&quot;
Specifies global options for the console log files. These
options can be overridden on an per-console basis by
specifying the CONSOLE logopts keyword. Note that options
affecting the output of the console s logfile also affect
the output of the consoles log-replay escape. The valid
logoptions include the following:</p>

<p>sanitize or nosanitize - sanitized log files convert
non-print- able characters into 7-bit printable
characters.</p>

<p>timestamp or notimestamp - timestamped logs prepend each
line of console output with a timestamp in &quot;YYYY-MM-DD
HH:MM:SS&quot; format. This timestamp is generated when the
first character following the line break is output.</p>

<p>The default is &quot;nosanitize,notimestamp&quot;.</p>

<p>seropts = &quot;bps[,databits[parity[stopbits]]]&quot;
Specifies global options for local serial devices. These
options can be overridden on an per-console basis by
specifying the CONSOLE seropts keyword.</p>

<p>bps is an integer specifying the baud rate in
bits-per-second. If this exact value is not supported by the
system, it will be rounded down to the next supported
value.</p>

<p>databits is an integer from 5-8.</p>

<p>parity is a single case-insensitive character: n for
none, o for odd, and e for even.</p>

<p>stopbits is an integer from 1-2.</p>

<p>The default is &quot;9600,8n1&quot; for 9600 bps, 8 data
bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit.</p>

<p>CONSOLE DIRECTIVES This directive defines an individual
console being managed by the dae- mon. The CONSOLE keyword
is followed by one or more of the following key/value
pairs:</p>

<p>name = &quot;string&quot; Specifies the name used by
clients to refer to the console. This keyword is
required.</p>

<p>dev = &quot;string&quot; Specifies the location of the
device. A local serial-port con- nection is specified with
the pathname of the tty device. A remote terminal-server
connection is specified with the &quot;host:port&quot;
format (where host is either a hostname or IP address). This
keyword is required.</p>

<p>log = &quot;file&quot; Specifies the file where console
output is logged. This string undergoes conversion specifier
expansion (cf, CONVERSION SPECI- FICATIONS). If an absolute
pathname is not given, the files location is relative to
logdir (assuming it has been previously defined). An empty
log string (ie, log=&quot;&quot;) disables logging,
overriding the global log name.</p>

<p>logopts = &quot;string&quot; This keyword is optional
(cf, GLOBAL DIRECTIVES).</p>

<p>seropts = &quot;string&quot; This keyword is optional
(cf, GLOBAL DIRECTIVES).</p>

<p>CONVERSION SPECIFICATIONS A conversion specifier is a
two-character sequence beginning with a % character. The
second character in the sequence specifies the type of
conversion to be applied. The following specifiers are
supported:</p>

<p>%N The console name (from the name string).</p>

<p>%D The console device basename (from the dev string),
with leading directory components removed.</p>

<p>%P The daemons process identifier.</p>

<p>%Y The year as a 4-digit number with the century.</p>

<p>%y The year as a 2-digit number without the century.</p>

<p>%m The month as a 2-digit number (01-12).</p>

<p>%d The day of the month as a 2-digit number (01-31).</p>

<p>%H The hour as a 2-digit number using a 24-hour clock
(00-23).</p>

<p>%M The minute as a 2-digit number (00-59).</p>

<p>%S The seconds as a 2-digit number (00-61).</p>

<p>%s The number of seconds since the Epoch.</p>

<p>%% A literal % character.</p>

<p>The console name (%N) and device (%D) specifiers are
&quot;sanitized&quot; in that non-printable characters and
the forward-slash (/) character are replaced with
underscores.</p>
