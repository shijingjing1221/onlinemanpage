<p>OVERCHAN(8) OVERCHAN(8)</p>

<p>NAME overchan - update the news overview database</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS overchan [ file ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Overchan reads article data from files or
standard input if none are specified. (A single dash in the
file list means to read standard input.) It uses this
information to update the news overview database. Overchan
was originally designed to be used by InterNetNews or the C
News mkov packages to update the database as the articles
come in. For current INN, the database is stored in a
selected overview method. This can be done within innd(8)
itself, but overchan(8) can be used instead, if
&lt;useoverchan in inn.conf&gt; is true and appropriate
setup is done in newsfeeds, for example:</p>

<p>overview!:*:Tc,WnteO:&lt;pathbin in
inn.conf&gt;/overchan</p>

<p>Overchan input data consists of a line of text,
separated into four parts by a space. The first part is a
token for the article. The sec- ond part is time when the
article was received. The third part is time when the
article will be expired (which represents the Expires
header). The fourth part is the data to be stored.</p>

<p>The data in the overview files should be expired by
running expire- over(8). This is normally done by adding the
expireover flag to the news.daily(8) invocation.</p>
