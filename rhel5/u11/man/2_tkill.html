<p>TKILL(2) Linux Programmer s Manual TKILL(2)</p>

<p>NAME tkill - send a signal to a single process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int tkill(int tid, int sig);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tkill() system call is analogous to
kill(2), except when the speci- fied process is part of a
thread group (created by specifying the CLONE_THREAD flag in
the call to clone). Since all the processes in a thread
group have the same PID, they cannot be individually
signalled with kill(2). With tkill(), however, one can
address each process by its unique TID.</p>

<p>These are the raw system call interfaces, meant for
internal thread library use.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL An invalid TID or signal was
specified.</p>

<p>EPERM Permission denied. For the required permissions,
see kill(2).</p>

<p>ESRCH No process with the specified thread ID (and
thread group ID) exists.</p>

<p>VERSIONS tkill() is supported since Linux 2.4.19 /
2.5.4.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO tkill() is Linux specific and should not
be used in programs that are intended to be portable.</p>

<p>NOTES Glibc does not provide wrapper for these system
calls; call them using syscall(2).</p>
