<p>NAME innmail - Simple mail-sending program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS innmail [-h] [-s subject] address [address
...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION innmail is a Perl script intended to provide
the non-interactive mail- sending functionality of mail(1)
while avoiding nasty security prob- lems. It takes the body
of a mail message on standard input and sends it to the
specified addresses by invoking the value of mta in
inn.conf.</p>

<p>At least one address (formatted for the MTA specified in
inn.conf, if it matters) is required. innmail will sanitize
the addresses so that they contain only alphanumerics and
the symbols &quot;@&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;-&quot;,
&quot;+&quot;, &quot;_&quot;, and &quot;%&quot;.</p>

<p>innmail was written to be suitable for the mailcmd
setting in inn.conf.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Gives usage information.</p>

<p>-s subject Sets the Subject: header of the message. A
warning is issued if this option is omitted.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This sends a one-line message to the local user
&quot;joe&quot;:</p>

<p>echo &quot;A one-line message.&quot; innmail -s
&quot;Simple message&quot; joe</p>

<p>innmail by default is used by INN for sending nightly
reports and con- trol message reports.</p>

<p>BUGS innmail fails on addresses that begin with
&quot;-&quot;, although one might hope that the news server
will not need to contact any such addresses.</p>

<p>There are many &quot;correct&quot; addresses that will
be silently modified by the sanitization process. A news
administrator should be careful to use particularly sane
addresses if they may be passed to innmail.</p>
