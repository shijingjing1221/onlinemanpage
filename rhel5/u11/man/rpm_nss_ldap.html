<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) nss_ldap(5)
nss_ldap(5)</p>

<p>NAME nss_ldap - LDAP nameservice provider</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The nss_ldap module is a set of C library
extensions which allows X.500 and LDAP directory servers to
be used as a primary source of name ser- vice information.
(Name service information typically includes users, hosts,
groups, and other such data historically stored in flat
files or NIS.)</p>

<p>Features of the PADL nss_ldap module include support for
both the RFC 2307 and RFC 2307bis schema, a common
implementation across multiple platforms, Kerberos and SSL
security, configurable schema mapping, and configuration
file compatibility with the pam_ldap(5) module.</p>

<p>Because LDAP is a hierarchical directory service, one
can distribute the information in a manner which reflects
organizational structure. This contrasts with the flat,
single domain policy of NIS. LDAP has many of the advantages
of NIS+ (security and scalability) without the
complexity.</p>

<p>nss_ldap will work alongside existing NIS, NIS+, DNS and
flat file name services. More importantly, because it builds
as a shared library, it is not necessary to recompile any
applications to take advantage of LDAP.</p>

<p>The present version of nss_ldap supports AIX 4.3.3 and
above, FreeBSD 5.1, HP-UX 11i, Linux and Solaris 2.6 and
above. Many vendors provide their own LDAP nameservice
providers, often also called nss_ldap. This manual page
applies to the PADL nss_ldap module only. If you are using a
vendor provided module, consult the relevant documentation
instead.</p>

<p>The features supported by the version of nss_ldap depend
on which flags were enabled when the software was built.
Most features are enabled in the configuration file,
described below. (The location of the configu- ration file
is configurable at compile time; the default path is
/etc/ldap.conf.) Also, some features may be unavailable on
certain operating systems or with certain LDAP libraries.
For more information, consult your vendor.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION nss_ldap stores its configuration in the
ldap.conf file, the location of which is configurable at
compile time. (It should be noted that some LDAP client
libraries, such as OpenLDAP, also use a configuration file
of the same name. nss_ldap supports many of the same
configura- tion file options as OpenLDAP, but it adds
several that are specific to the functionality it provides.
Additionally, it is not guaranteed that nss_ldap will
continue to match the configuration file semantics of
OpenLDAP. You may wish to use different files.)</p>

<p>Configuration file options consist of a keyword followed
by a space and any arguments. The following options are
supported by both nss_ldap and the PADL pam_ldap module:</p>

<p>host &lt;name:port ...&gt; Specifies the name(s) or IP
address(es) of the LDAP server(s) to connect to. In the case
that nss_ldap is used for host name res- olution, each
server should be specified as an IP address or name that can
be resolved without using LDAP. Multiple servers may be
specified, each separated by a space. The failover time
depends on whether the LDAP client library supports
configurable network or connect timeouts (see bind_timelimit
below).</p>

<p>base &lt;base&gt; Specifies the default base
distinguished name (DN) to use for searches.</p>

<p>uri &lt;ldap[is]://[name[:port]] ...&gt; For LDAP client
libraries that support it, specifies the URI(s) of the LDAP
server(s) to connect to. The URI scheme may be ldap, ldapi,
or ldaps, specifying LDAP over TCP, IPC and SSL respec-
tively. If applicable, a port number can be specified; the
default port number for the selected protocol is used if
omit- ted. This option takes precedence over the host
option; it is not possible to combine the two.</p>

<p>ldap_version &lt;version&gt; Specifies the version of
the LDAP protocol to use. Presently version must be 2 or 3.
The default is to use the maximum ver- sion supported by the
client library.</p>

<p>binddn &lt;binddn&gt; Specifies the distinguished name
with which to bind to the directory server(s). This option
is optional; the default is to bind anonymously.</p>

<p>bindpw &lt;bindpw&gt; Specifies the cleartext
credentials with which to bind. This option is only
applicable when used with binddn above. The default is no
credential (anonymous bind). When binding to the directory
using SASL or other authentication mechanisms apart from
simple binds, this option is not used.</p>

<p>rootbinddn &lt;binddn&gt; This option has the same
syntax and effect as the binddn option above, except it
applies when the effective user ID is zero. If not
specified, then the identity specified in binddn is used
instead. Because the configuration file may be readable by
many users, the root bind DN credentials are stored in the
ldap.secret file instead. This file is usually in the same
directory as the configuration file.</p>

<p>port &lt;port&gt; Specifies the port to connect to; this
option is used with the host option, and is ignored with the
uri option.</p>

<p>scope &lt;sub|one|base&gt; Specifies the search scope
(subtree, one level or base object). The default scope is
subtree; base scope is almost never useful for nameservice
lookups.</p>

<p>deref &lt;never|searching|finding|always&gt; Specifies
the policy for dereferencing aliases. The default pol- icy
is to never dereference aliases.</p>

<p>timelimit &lt;timelimit&gt; Specifies the time limit (in
seconds) to use when performing searches. A value of zero
(0), which is the default, is to wait indefinitely for
searches to be completed.</p>

<p>bind_timelimit &lt;timelimit&gt; Specifies the time
limit (in seconds) to use when connecting to the directory
server. This is distinct from the time limit spec- ified in
timelimit and affects the initial server connection only.
(Server connections are otherwise cached.) Only some LDAP
client libraries have the underlying functionality necessary
to support this option. The default bind timelimit is 30
seconds.</p>

<p>referrals &lt;yes|no&gt; Specifies whether automatic
referral chasing should be enabled. The default behaviour is
specifed by the LDAP client library.</p>

<p>restart &lt;yes|no&gt; Specifies whether the LDAP client
library should restart the select(2) system call when
interrupted. This feature is not sup- ported by all client
libraries.</p>

<p>logdir &lt;directory&gt; Specifies the directory used
for logging by the LDAP client library. This feature is not
supported by all client libraries.</p>

<p>debug &lt;level&gt; Specifies the debug level used for
logging by the LDAP client library. This feature is not
supported by all client libraries, and does not apply to the
nss_ldap and pam_ldap modules them- selves (debugging, if
any, is configured separately and usually at compile
time).</p>

<p>ssl &lt;on|off|start_tls&gt; Specifies whether to use
SSL/TLS or not (the default is not to). If start_tls is
specified then StartTLS is used rather than raw LDAP over
SSL. Not all LDAP client libraries support both SSL and
StartTLS, and all related configuration options.</p>

<p>sslpath &lt;cert7_path&gt; For the Netscape and Mozilla
LDAP client libraries only, this specifies the path to the
X.509 certificate database.</p>

<p>tls_checkpeer &lt;yes|no&gt; Specifies whether to
require and verify the server certificate or not, when using
SSL/TLS with the OpenLDAP client library. The default is to
use the default behaviour of the client library; for
OpenLDAP 2.0 and earlier it is &quot;no&quot;, for OpenLDAP
2.1 and later it is &quot;yes&quot;. At least one of
tls_cacertdir and tls_cacertfile is required if peer
verification is enabled.</p>

<p>tls_cacertdir &lt;certificate_dir&gt; Specifies the
directory containing X.509 certificates for peer
authentication.</p>

<p>tls_cacertfile &lt;certificate_file&gt; Specifies the
path to the X.509 certificate for peer authentica- tion.</p>

<p>tls_randfile &lt;entropy_file&gt; Specifies the path to
an entropy source.</p>

<p>tls_ciphers &lt;ciphers&gt; Specifies the ciphers to use
for TLS. See your TLS implementa- tions documentation for
further information.</p>

<p>tls_cert &lt;certificate_file&gt; Specifies the path to
the file containing the local certificate for client TLS
authentication.</p>

<p>tls_key &lt;key_file&gt; Specifies the path to the file
containing the private key for client TLS
authentication.</p>

<p>The following configuration options apply to nss_ldap
only:</p>

<p>bind_policy &lt;hard_open|hard_init|soft&gt; Specifies
the policy to use for reconnecting to an unavailable LDAP
server. The default is hard_open, which reconnects if
opening the connection to the directory server failed. By
con- trast, hard_init reconnects if initializing the
connection failed. Initializing may not actually contact the
directory server, and it is possible that a malformed
configuration file will trigger reconnection. If soft is
specified, then nss_ldap will return immediately on server
failure. All &quot;hard&quot; reconnect policies block with
exponential backoff before retrying.</p>

<p>nss_connect_policy &lt;persist|oneshot&gt; Determines
whether nss_ldap persists connections. The default is for
the connection to the LDAP server to remain open after the
first request.</p>

<p>idle_timelimit &lt;timelimit&gt; Specifies the time (in
seconds) after which nss_ldap will close connections to the
directory server. The default is not to time out
connections.</p>

<p>sasl_authid &lt;authid&gt; Specifies the authorization
identity to be used when performing SASL authentication.</p>

<p>rootsasl_auth_id &lt;authid&gt; Specifies the
authorization identity to be used when performing SASL
authentication as root (when the effective user ID is
zero).</p>

<p>sasl_secprops &lt;properties&gt; Specifies Cyrus SASL
security properties. Allowed values are described in the
ldap.conf(5) manual page.</p>

<p>rootuse_sasl &lt;yes|no&gt; Specifies whether SASL
authentication should be used when the effective user ID is
zero.</p>

<p>krb5_ccname &lt;PREFIX:args&gt; If nss_ldap is built
with configurable GSS-API credentials cache name support,
specifies the Kerberos credentials cache to use.</p>

<p>nss_paged_results &lt;yes|no&gt; Enables support for
paged results.</p>

<p>pagesize &lt;pagesize&gt; When paged results are enabled
(see above), specifies the number of entries to return in a
single page. The default is 1000.</p>

<p>nss_base_&lt;map&gt; &lt;basedn?scope?filter&gt; Specify
the search base, scope and filter to be used for spe- cific
maps. (Note that map forms part of the configuration file
keyword and is one of passwd, shadow, group, hosts,
services, networks, protocols, rpc, ethers, netmasks,
bootparams, aliases and netgroup.) The syntax of basedn and
scope are the same as for the configuration file options of
the same name, with the addition of being able to omit the
trailing suffix of the base DN (in which case the global
base DN will be appended instead). The filter is a search
filter to be added to the default search filter for a
specific map, such that the effective filter is the logical
intersection of the two. The base DN, scope and filter are
separated with literal question marks (?) as given above;
this is for compatibility with the DUA configuration profile
schema and the ldapprofile tool. This option may be
specified multiple times.</p>

<p>nss_map_attribute &lt;from_attribute&gt;
&lt;to_attribute&gt; This option may be specified multiple
times, and directs nss_ldap to use the attribute
to_attribute instead of the RFC 2307 attribute
from_attribute in all lookups. If nss_ldap was built without
schema mapping support, then this option is ignored.</p>

<p>nss_map_objectclass &lt;from_objectclass&gt;
&lt;to_objectclass&gt; This option may be specified multiple
times, and directs nss_ldap to use the object class
to_objectclass instead of the RFC 2307 object class
from_objectclass in all lookups. If nss_ldap was built
without schema mapping support, then this option is
ignored.</p>

<p>nss_default_attribute_value &lt;attribute&gt;
&lt;value&gt; Specifies the default value to use for entries
that lack the specified attribute. This option may be
specified multiple times, for different attributes. If
nss_ldap was built without schema mapping support, then this
option is ignored.</p>

<p>nss_override_attribute_value &lt;attribute&gt;
&lt;value&gt; Specifies a value to use for the specified
attribute in prefer- ence to that contained in the actual
entry. This option may be specified multiple times, for
different attributes. If nss_ldap was built without schema
mapping support, then this option is ignored.</p>

<p>nss_schema &lt;rfc2307bis|rfc2307&gt; If the value of
this option is rfc2307bis then support for the RFC2307bis
schema (distinguished names in groups) will be enabled.</p>

<p>nss_initgroups &lt;backlink&gt; This option directs the
nss_ldap implementation of initgroups(3) to determine a
users group membership by reading the memberOf attribute of
their directory entry (and of any nested groups), rather
than querying on uniqueMember. This may provide increased
performance with certain directory servers that have
peculiar indexing configurations. If RFC2307bis support is
disabled, then this option is ignored.</p>

<p>nss_initgroups_ignoreusers &lt;user1,user2,...,userN&gt;
This option directs the nss_ldap implementation of
initgroups(3) to return NSS_STATUS_NOTFOUND if called with a
listed users as its argument.</p>

<p>nss_check_case &lt;yes|no&gt; This option directs the
nss_ldap module to check that results it retrieves from the
server exactly match the name for which it searched for
data.</p>

<p>nss_getgrent_skipmembers &lt;yes|no&gt; Specifies
whether or not to populate the members list in the group
structure for group lookups. If very large groups are
present, enabling this option will greatly increase
perforance, at the cost of some lost functionality. You
should verify no local applications rely on this information
before enabling this on a production system.</p>

<p>nss_srv_domain &lt;domain&gt; This option determines the
DNS domain used for performing SRV lookups.</p>
