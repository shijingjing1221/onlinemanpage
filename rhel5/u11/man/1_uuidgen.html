<p>UUIDGEN(1) UUIDGEN(1)</p>

<p>NAME uuidgen - command-line utility to create a new UUID
value</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS uuidgen [ -r | -t ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The uuidgen program creates a new
universally unique identifier (UUID) using the libuuid(3)
library. The new UUID can reasonably be consid- ered unique
among all UUIDs created on the local system, and among UUIDs
created on other systems in the past and in the future.</p>

<p>There are two types of UUIDs which uuidgen can generate:
time-based UUIDs and random-based UUIDs. By default uuidgen
will generate a random-based UUID if a high-quality random
number generator is present. Otherwise, it will chose a
time-based UUID. It is possible to force the generation of
one of these two UUID types by using the -r or -t
options.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -r Generate a random-based UUID. This method
creates a UUID con- sisting mostly of random bits. It
requires that the operating system have a high quality
random number generator, such as /dev/random.</p>

<p>-t Generate a time-based UUID. This method creates a
UUID based on the system clock plus the systems ethernet
hardware address, if present.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The UUID of the form
1b4e28ba-2fa1-11d2-883f-b9a761bde3fb (in printf(3) format
&quot;%08x-%04x-%04x-%04x-%012x&quot;) is output to the
standard output.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO OSF DCE 1.1</p>
