<p>NAME sasl.conf - SASL Configuration file for nnrpd.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file sasl.conf in pathetc specifies
Simple Authentication and Secu- rity Layer (SASL), defined
in RFC 2222, for nnrpd. Now nnrpd imple- ments only Security
Layer support, which is an extension of RFC 2595. This means
you can get SSL or TLS encrypted NNRP between your server
and newsreaders. It requires OpenSSL 0.9.3 or newer from
http://www.openssl.org/; it has been tested with versions
0.9.4 and 0.9.5.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION To use SSL, a certificate and private key
are needed that you can cre- ate using the openssl binary.
Make certain that each keys are owned by your news user,
news group, and are mode 0640 or 0660.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE</p>

<p>openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out
/usr/local/news/lib/cert.pem -days 366 -keyout
/usr/local/news/lib/cert.pem chown news:news
/usr/local/news/lib/cert.pem chmod 640
/usr/local/news/lib/cert.pem</p>

<p>You also can make the keys as the root user with
&quot;make cert&quot;.</p>
