<p>SCROLLKEEPER.CONF(5) SCROLLKEEPER.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME scrollkeeper.conf - ScrollKeeper configuration
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS System-wide configuration of ScrollKeeper</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The system-wide scrollkeeper.conf file is
typically installed at /etc/scrollkeeper.conf. It stores the
default OMF paths which are searched by scrollkeeper-update
(8) to update the ScrollKeeper documen- tation catalog. The
paths are held by the OMF_DIR variable which is assigned to
a colon (:) delimited list of paths.</p>

<p>Comment lines begin with the (#) character.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE A typical scrollkeeper.conf file will look
like:</p>

<p># Comment
OMF_DIR=/usr/share/omf:/usr/local/share/omf:/opt/gnome/share/omf:/opt/gnome-2.0/share/omf:/opt/kde/omf</p>

<p>NOTES Any user on the system is able to use the
scrollkeeper-update (8) com- mand to generate a ScrollKeeper
database at any path that the user has write permission to.
The user can over-ride the system default OMF_DIR path
variable by setting a shell variable of the same name,
OMF_DIR. In this way, a user can create a document catalog
which contains a superset of the system documentation, or a
completely independent set of documents which the user may
be interested in.</p>

<p>Note that most applications will register its
documentation at install time, and unregister it at
uninstall time. Thus, a user who keeps their own personal
ScrollKeeper database may need to periodically run
scrollkeeper-update (8) manually (or with cron) to keep
their database up-to-date.</p>
