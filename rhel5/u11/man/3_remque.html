<p>INSQUE(3) Linux Programmer s Manual INSQUE(3)</p>

<p>NAME insque, remque - insert/remove an item from a
queue</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;search.h&gt;</p>

<p>void insque(void *elem, void *prev); void remque(void
*elem);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION insque() and remque() are functions for
manipulating doubly-linked lists. Each element in the list
is a structure of which the first two structure elements are
a forward and a backward pointer.</p>

<p>insque() inserts the element pointed to by elem
immediately after the element pointed to by prev, which must
not be NULL.</p>

<p>remque() removes the element pointed to by elem from the
doubly-linked list.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001</p>

<p>HISTORICAL NOTES Traditionally (e.g. SunOS, Linux libc
4,5) the parameters of these functions were of type struct
qelem *, where the struct is defined as</p>

<p>struct qelem { struct qelem *q_forw; struct qelem
*q_back; char q_data[1]; };</p>

<p>This is still what you will get if _GNU_SOURCE is
defined before including &lt;search.h&gt;.</p>

<p>The location of the prototypes for these functions
differs among sev- eral versions of UNIX. The above is the
POSIX version. Some systems place them in &lt;string.h&gt;.
Linux libc4,5 placed them in &lt;stdlib.h&gt;.</p>
