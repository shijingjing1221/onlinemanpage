<p>HESIOD(3) HESIOD(3)</p>

<p>NAME hesiod_getpwnam, hesiod_getpwuid,
hesiod_free_passwd - Hesiod functions for retrieving passwd
information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;hesiod.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct passwd *hesiod_getpwnam(void *context, const char
*name) struct passwd *hesiod_getpwuid(void *context, uid_t
uid) void hesiod_free_passwd(void *context, struct passwd
*pw)</p>

<p>cc file.c -lhesiod</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This family of functions allows you to
retrieve passwd database infor- mation using Hesiod. To
perform lookups, you need an initialized Hes- iod context;
see hesiod(3) for details. You may look up passwd infor-
mation by name or by uid; information is returned in the
same format as by getpwnam or getpwuid. It is the caller s
responsibility to call hesiod_free_passwd with the returned
passwd entry to free the resources used by the passwd
entry.</p>

<p>Hesiod queries for passwd information are made using the
passwd or uid Hesiod type, using either the username or the
decimal represen- tation of the uid as the Hesiod name. The
corresponding records should be a colon-separated list of
fields giving the username, encrypted password, uid, gid,
GECOS information, home directory, and shell of the
user.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES On failure, hesiod_getpwnam and
hesiod_getpwuid return NULL and set the global variable
errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS These calls may fail for any of the reasons the
routine hesiod_resolve may fail.</p>
