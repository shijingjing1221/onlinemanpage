<p>NAME linuxdoc - LinuxDoc DTD SGML converter to other
output format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS linuxdoc --backend=format --papersize=size
--language=lang --charset=char --style=file --debug --define
attribute=value --include entity [backend-options...]
file(.sgml)</p>

<p>or (Old, obsoleted usage) sgmlxxxx [generic-options...]
[backend-options...] file(.sgml)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The linuxdoc suite is a collection of text
formatters which understands a LinuxDoc DTD SGML source
file. Each formatter (or &quot;back-end&quot;) renders the
source file into a variety of output formats, including
HTML, TeX, DVI, PostScript, plain text, and groff(1) source
in manual-page format. The linuxdoc suite is provided for
backward compatibility, because there are still many useful
documents written in LinuxDoc DTD sgml source.</p>

<p>The markup language(s) accepted by these formatters is
described in the Linuxdoc-Tools User s Guide. They are
variants of an SGML document type definition originally
designed by Matt Welsh for Linux documenta- tion.</p>

<p>GENERIC-OPTIONS Most command-line options are accepted
by all back-ends. Some back- ends have additional specific
options to control rendering to their particular output
format. Here are the common options:</p>

<p>--backend=format, -B Set the backend for specified
format. Default is none of the actual format, but just
output the usage of this suites. Avail- able formats are:
html, info, latex, lyx, rtf, txt, check.</p>

<p>--papersize=size, -p Set the paper size. Default is
letter . You may also spec- ify a4 size (European 297x210mm
paper).</p>

<p>--language=lang, -l Specify the language of the document
(this may change which style files are used for formatting
by a back end). The default language is English. Run an
LinuxDoc-tools command without argu- ments to see the list
of valid language codes.</p>

<p>--charset=chars, -c Specify the output character
encoding. Defaults to ascii selecting the ASCII set; you may
specify &quot;latin&quot; to specify the ISO 8859-1
(Latin-1) character set. Also, nippon and euc- kr is
required to handle the euc-jp and euc-kr encoded sgml
file.</p>

<p>--style=file, -S Include an auxiliary DTD (Document Type
Definition) from /usr/share/linuxdoc-tools/dtd.</p>

<p>--tabsize=n, -t Set the tab spacing assumed for
generating the output document. The default tab spacing is
8.</p>

<p>--debug, -d Dont delete intermediate files (such as .TeX
files generated on the way to a .dvi, or .man files deleted
on the way to plain text).</p>

<p>--define, -D Pass attribute/value pairs to be matched
against &quot;if&quot; and &quot;unless&quot; conditionals.
See the Users Guide for extended dis- cussion of this
feature. This conditionalization are handled by sgmlpre
command. See sgmlpre(1) as well as the Users Guide.</p>

<p>--include, -i Pass a -i option to nsgmls(1). This may be
used for conditional inclusion. See the nsgmls(1) manual
page for details.</p>

<p>--pass, -P Pass an option string to the back end. The
exact semantics of this option are dependent on the back end
and should be explained in the individual manual pages for
each.</p>

<p>file The SGML source file, named either file or
file.sgml.</p>

<p>Running a back-end with no arguments will cause it to
list all its options (Error message about &quot;no filenames
given&quot; can be ignored safely in this case). The
available back ends include (names in brackets are old &amp;
obsoleted form):</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B html (sgml2html) translate to HTML</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B info (sgml2info) translate to GNU info</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B lyx (sgml2lyx) translate to Lyx macros</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B latex (sgml2latex) translate to LaTeX 2e</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B rtf (sgml2rtf) translate to Microsoft Rich
Text Format</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B txt (sgml2txt) translate to plain text or
Unix manual-page markup</p>

<p>There is also a tool linuxdoc-Bcheck (sgmlcheck)
available for checking the Linuxdoc DTD SGML syntax of
document sources without actually generating a translated
version.</p>

<p>BACKEND-DRIVERS Here are the description for each
backend drivers:</p>


<p>****************************************************</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B html (sgml2html) converts a LinuxDoc DTD
SGML source file to HTML output. Output will appear in the
top level file file.html and file-n.html for each section
(default action, but can be changed by option), where file
is the name of the SGML source file and n is the section
name.</p>

<p>The attribute/value pair &quot;output=html&quot; is set
for conditionals.</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B html accepts the following options: [--split
0|1|2 ] [--dosnames] [--imagebuttons] [--toc 0|1|2 ]</p>

<p>The meanings of them are:</p>

<p>--split, -s What level to split source documents. 0 =
don t split, 1 = split by major sections, 2 = split by
subsections.</p>

<p>--toc, -T What level to generate toc. 0 = dont generate
toc at all, 1 = includes major sections(/chapters/parts), 2
= includes subsections.</p>

<p>--dosnames, -h Use &quot;.htm&quot; rather than
&quot;.html&quot; as the extension of</p>

<p>--imagebuttons, -I Use the &quot;next&quot;,
&quot;previous&quot;, and &quot;contents&quot; arrow image
icons included in /usr/share/linuxdoc-tools as navigation
buttons.</p>

<p>--footer, -F Use the specified file as the footer in
each resulted html file. Default footer is just plain</p>

<p>&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;</p>

<p>--header, -H Use the specified file as the top part of
the header in each re- sulted html file. Note this is not
the full part of the header. (i.e. the title and the links
(next,previous,contents) in the default header are retained.
Default is</p>

<p>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2
Final//EN&quot;&gt; &lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;</p>


<p>****************************************************</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B info (sgml2info) converts a LinuxDoc DTD
SGML source file to GNU info format. Output will appear in
file.info where file is the name of the SGML source
file.</p>

<p>The attribute/value pair &quot;output=info&quot; is set
for conditionals.</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B info has not backend specific options.</p>


<p>****************************************************</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B latex (sgml2latex) converts a LinuxDoc DTD
SGML source file to LaTeX output, using the nsgmls(1) or
onsgmls(1) parser, and the sgmlsasp(1) translator. Using the
LaTeX output, and the latex(1) text formatter, you can then
create DVI output, and PostScript output using the dvips(1)
converter. Output will appear in file.tex for LaTeX out-
put, file.dvi for DVI output, or file.ps for PostScript
output, where file is the name of the SGML source file.</p>

<p>Using the LaTeX output, and the pdflatex(1) text
formatter, you can then create a nice PDF output, suitable
for viewing with PDF viewers as xpdf(1), acroread(1) or
ghostview(1).</p>

<p>The attribute/value pair &quot;output=latex2e&quot; is
set for conditionals.</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B latex accepts following backend specific
options: [--out- put=tex|dvi|ps|pdf] [--bibtex]
[--makeindex] [--pagenumber=n] --quick
[--latex=latex|hlatexp|platex|jlatex]
[--dvips=dvips|dvi2ps]</p>

<p>The meanings of them are:</p>

<p>--output=fmt, -o Specify the desired output format. The
specifier fmt may be tex, dvi, ps, or pdf.</p>

<p>Note: This version does not overwrite/remove the
intermediate files: tex file for dvi output, or tex/dvi
files for ps output. This is dif- ferent behavior from the
original SGML-Tools 1.0.9, so you are warned here.</p>

<p>--bibtex, -b Process the generated TeX with
bibtex(1).</p>

<p>--makeindex, -m Generate a TeX index file suitable for
processing with makein- dex(1) from and &lt;idx&gt; and
&lt;cdx&gt; tags present in the SGML source.</p>

<p>--pagenumber, -n Set the starting page number in the
output DVI or PS file.</p>

<p>--quick, -q Do only one pass of LaTeX formatting. This
is often not suffi- cient to produce final output (because
of references, etc.) but is useful for spotting TeX errors
and justification problems.</p>

<p>--pass, -P The argument of the pass option is inserted
just after the LaTeX preamble generated by the document-type
tag. Specify the de- sired output format. The specifier fmt
may be tex, dvi, ps, or pdf.</p>

<p>--latex=alternate_latex_command, -x This option is
currently for Korean and Japanese. The alter-
nate_latex_command can be latex (default), hlatexp (for
Korean), platex or jlatex (for Japanese). This option can be
used to render Korean document using HLaTeXp, or to ren- der
Japanese document using pLaTeX/jLaTeX. If not, HLaTeX should
be installed to render Korean document. On the other hand,
Japanese document can be rendered with jLaTeX (which is the
default when -c nippon is specified), so if you already have
jLaTeX, you may not need to install the pLaTeX.</p>

<p>--dvips=alternate_dvips_command, -s This option is
currently for Japanese. The alternate_dvips_com- mand can be
dvips or dvi2ps. If you don t know this, then you may not
need this.</p>


<p>****************************************************</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B lyx (sgml2lyx) converts a LinuxDoc DTD SGML
source file to LyX output. Output will appear in file.lyx
where file is the name of the SGML source file.</p>

<p>The attribute/value pair &quot;output=lyx&quot; is set
for conditionals.</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B lyx has not backend specific options.</p>


<p>****************************************************</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B rtf (sgml2rtf) converts a LinuxDoc DTD SGML
source file to RTF, the Rich Text Tormat used by the
Microsoft Windows help system. Output will appear in the top
level file file.rtf and file-n.rtf for each section, where
file is the name of the SGML source file. The RTF output is
tailored for compilation by the Windows Help Compiler
(hc31.exe).</p>

<p>The attribute/value pair &quot;output=rtf&quot; is set
for conditionals.</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B rtf accepts [--twosplit] as a backend
specific option. Following is the meaning of this
option:</p>

<p>--twosplit, -2 Splits files both at n. sections and n.m.
subsections</p>


<p>****************************************************</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B txt (sgml2txt) converts a LinuxDoc DTD SGML
source file to ASCII, ISO-8859-1, or EUC-JP output. Output
will appear in file.txt where file is the name of the SGML
source file.</p>

<p>The attribute/value pair &quot;output=txt&quot; is set
for conditionals.</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B txt accepts following backend-options:
[--manpage] [--fil- ter] [--blanks=n]</p>

<p>The meaning of these options are:</p>

<p>--manpage, -m Outputs a groff source file, suitable for
formatting with groff -man for man pages</p>

<p>--filter, -f Remove backspace-overstrikes from the
intermediate form generat- ed by groff(1).</p>

<p>--pass, -P The argument of the pass option is added to
the command-line op- tions handed to groff(1).</p>

<p>--blanks=n, -b Set the limit of continuous blank lines
for generating the out- put document. The default limit is
3. if 0 (zero) is specified, the result have many continuous
blank lines.</p>


<p>****************************************************</p>

<p>linuxdoc -B check (sgmlcheck) runs an SGML parse on the
specified doc- ument source. Any errors are reported to
standard output. No format- ted version of the source is
produced.</p>

<p>Note that linuxdoc -B check preprocesses the LinuxDoc
DTD SGML source, doing the conditionalization described by
any &lt;#if&gt;&lt;/#if&gt; and &lt;#un-
less&gt;&lt;/#unless&gt; tags. Document sources containing
these tags will con- fuse a standalone SGML parser. linuxdoc
-B check has no backend-spe- cific options.
****************************************************</p>

<p>FILES Many files and executables in
/usr/share/linuxdoc-tools and /usr/bin are used.</p>

<p>BUGS Maybe some are left. Feel free to send your report
to the current maintainer.</p>
