<p>NAME mktemp - make temporary filename (unique)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mktemp [-V] | [-dqtu] [-p directory]
[template]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mktemp utility takes the given filename
template and overwrites a portion of it to create a unique
filename. The template may be any filename with some number
of Xs appended to it, for example /tmp/tfile.XXXXXXXXXX. If
no template is specified a default of tmp.XXXXXXXXXX is used
and the -t flag is implied (see below).</p>

<p>The trailing Xs are replaced with a combination of the
current pro- cess number and random letters. The name chosen
depends both on the number of Xs in the template and the
number of collisions with pre-existing files. The number of
unique filenames mktemp can return depends on the number of
Xs provided; ten Xs will result in mktemp testing roughly 26
** 10 combinations.</p>

<p>If mktemp can successfully generate a unique filename,
the file (or directory) is created with file permissions
such that it is only read- able and writable by its owner
(unless the -u flag is given) and the filename is printed to
standard output.</p>

<p>mktemp is provided to allow shell scripts to safely use
temporary files. Traditionally, many shell scripts take the
name of the program with the PID as a suffix and use that as
a temporary filename. This kind of naming scheme is
predictable and the race condition it creates is easy for an
attacker to win. A safer, though still inferior approach is
to make a temporary directory using the same naming scheme.
While this does allow one to guarantee that a temporary file
will not be subverted, it still allows a simple denial of
service attack. For these reasons it is suggested that
mktemp be used instead.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-V Print the version and exit.</p>

<p>-d Make a directory instead of a file.</p>

<p>-p directory Use the specified directory as a prefix
when generating the tem- porary filename. The directory will
be overridden by the users TMPDIR environment variable if it
is set. This option implies the -t flag (see below).</p>

<p>-q Fail silently if an error occurs. This is useful if a
script does not want error output to go to standard
error.</p>

<p>-t Generate a path rooted in a temporary directory. This
directory is chosen as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; If the users TMPDIR environment variable is
set, the directory contained therein is used.</p>

<p>&middot; Otherwise, if the -p flag was given the
specified direc- tory is used.</p>

<p>&middot; If none of the above apply, /tmp is used.</p>

<p>In this mode, the template (if specified) should be a
directory component (as opposed to a full path) and thus
should not contain any forward slashes.</p>

<p>-u Operate in unsafe mode. The temp file will be
unlinked before mktemp exits. This is slightly better than
mktemp(3) but still introduces a race condition. Use of this
option is not encouraged.</p>

<p>The mktemp utility exits with a value of 0 on success or
1 on failure.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following sh(1) fragment illustrates a
simple use of mktemp where the script should quit if it
cannot get a safe temporary file.</p>

<p>TMPFILE=mktemp /tmp/example.XXXXXXXXXX || exit 1 echo
&quot;program output&quot; &gt;&gt; $TMPFILE</p>

<p>The same fragment with support for a user s TMPDIR
environment variable can be written as follows.</p>

<p>TMPFILE=mktemp -t example.XXXXXXXXXX || exit 1 echo
&quot;program output&quot; &gt;&gt; $TMPFILE</p>

<p>This can be further simplified if we dont care about the
actual name of the temporary file. In this case the -t flag
is implied.</p>

<p>TMPFILE=mktemp || exit 1 echo &quot;program output&quot;
&gt;&gt; $TMPFILE</p>

<p>In some cases, it may be desirable to use a default
temporary directory other than /tmp. In this example the
temporary file will be created in /extra/tmp unless the
users TMPDIR environment variable specifies oth- erwise.</p>

<p>TMPFILE=mktemp -p /extra/tmp example.XXXXXXXXXX || exit
1 echo &quot;program output&quot; &gt;&gt; $TMPFILE</p>

<p>In some cases, we want the script to catch the error.
For instance, if we attempt to create two temporary files
and the second one fails we need to remove the first before
exiting.</p>

<p>TMP1=mktemp -t example.1.XXXXXXXXXX || exit 1
TMP2=mktemp -t example.2.XXXXXXXXXX if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then rm
-f $TMP1 exit 1 fi</p>

<p>Or perhaps you dont want to exit if mktemp is unable to
create the file. In this case you can protect that part of
the script thusly.</p>

<p>TMPFILE=mktemp -t example.XXXXXXXXXX &amp;&amp; { # Safe
to use $TMPFILE in this block echo data &gt; $TMPFILE ... rm
-f $TMPFILE }</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT TMPDIR directory in which to place the
temporary file when in -t mode</p>
