<p>DESCRIPTION lvconvert is used to change the segment type
(i.e. linear, mirror, etc) or characteristics of a logical
volume. For example, it can add or remove the redundant
images of a logical volume, change the log type of a mirror,
or designate a logical volume as a snapshot repository. If
the conversion requires allocation of physical extents (for
example, when converting from linear to mirror) and you
specify one or more PhysicalVolumes (optionally with ranges
of physical extents), alloca- tion of physical extents will
be restricted to these physical extents. If the conversion
frees physical extents (for example, when converting from a
mirror to a linear, or reducing mirror legs) and you specify
one or more PhysicalVolumes, the freed extents come first
from the speci- fied PhysicalVolumes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm for common options. Exactly one of
--splitmirrors, --mirrors, --repair, --snapshot or --merge
arguments is required.</p>

<p>-m, --mirrors Mirrors Specifies the degree of the mirror
you wish to create. For example, &quot;-m 1&quot; would
convert the original logical volume to a mirror volume with
2-sides; that is, a linear volume plus one copy.</p>

<p>--mirrorlog {disk|core|mirrored} Specifies the type of
log to use. The default is disk, which is persistent and
requires a small amount of storage space, usually on a
separate device from the data being mirrored. Core may be
useful for short-lived mirrors: It means the mirror is
regener- ated by copying the data from the first device
again every time the device is activated - perhaps, for
example, after every reboot. Using &quot;mirrored&quot; will
create a persistent log that is itself mirrored.</p>

<p>--corelog The optional argument &quot;--corelog&quot; is
the same as specifying &quot;--mirrorlog core&quot;.</p>

<p>-R, --regionsize MirrorLogRegionSize A mirror is divided
into regions of this size (in MB), and the mirror log uses
this granularity to track which regions are in sync.</p>

<p>-b, --background Run the daemon in the background.</p>

<p>-i, --interval Seconds Report progress as a percentage
at regular intervals.</p>

<p>--noudevsync Disable udev synchronisation. The process
will not wait for notification from udev. It will continue
irrespective of any possible udev processing in the
background. You should only use this if udev is not running
or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.</p>

<p>--splitmirrors Images The number of redundant Images of
a mirror to be split off and used to form a new logical
volume. A name must be supplied for the newly-split-off
logical volume using the --name argument, unless the
--trackchanges argument is given.</p>

<p>-n Name The name to apply to a logical volume which has
been split off from a mirror logical volume.</p>

<p>--trackchanges Used with --splitmirrors on a raid1
device, this tracks changes so that the read-only detached
image can be merged efficiently back into the mirror later.
Only the regions of the detatched device where the data
changed get resynchronized.</p>

<p>Please note that this feature is only supported with the
new md- based mirror implementation and not with the
original device- mapper mirror implementation.</p>

<p>-s, --snapshot Create a snapshot from existing logical
volume using another existing logical volume as its
origin.</p>

<p>-c, --chunksize ChunkSize Power of 2 chunk size for the
snapshot logical volume between 4k and 512k.</p>

<p>-Z, --zero y|n Controls zeroing of the first KB of data
in the snapshot. If the volume is read-only the snapshot
will not be zeroed.</p>

<p>--merge Merges a snapshot into its origin volume or
merges a raid1 image that has been split from its mirror
with --trackchanges back into its mirror.</p>

<p>To check if your kernel supports the snapshot merge
feature, look for snapshot-merge in the output of dmsetup
targets. If both the origin and snapshot volume are not open
the merge will start immediately. Otherwise, the merge will
start the first time either the origin or snapshot are
activated and both are closed. Merging a snapshot into an
origin that cannot be closed, for example a root filesystem,
is deferred until the next time the origin volume is
activated. When merging starts, the resulting logical volume
will have the origins name, minor number and UUID. While the
merge is in progress, reads or writes to the origin appear
as they were directed to the snap- shot being merged. When
the merge finishes, the merged snapshot is removed. Multiple
snapshots may be specified on the command- line or a @tag
may be used to specify multiple snapshots be merged to their
respective origin.</p>

<p>--repair Repair a mirror after suffering a disk failure.
The mirror will be brought back into a consistent state. By
default, the origi- nal number of mirrors will be restored
if possible. Specify -y on the command line to skip the
prompts. Use -f if you do not want any replacement.
Additionally, you may use --use-policies to use the device
replacement policy specified in lvm.conf, viz.
activation/mirror_log_fault_policy or activation/mir-
ror_device_fault_policy.</p>

<p>--stripes Stripes Gives the number of stripes. This is
equal to the number of physical volumes to scatter the
logical volume. This does not apply to existing allocated
space, only newly allocated space can be striped.</p>

<p>-I, --stripesize StripeSize Gives the number of
kilobytes for the granularity of the stripes. StripeSize
must be 2^n (n = 2 to 9) for metadata in LVM1 format. For
metadata in LVM2 format, the stripe size may be a larger
power of 2 but must not exceed the physical extent size.</p>

<p>Examples &quot;lvconvert -m1 vg00/lvol1&quot; converts
the linear logical volume &quot;vg00/lvol1&quot; to a
two-way mirror logical volume.</p>

<p>&quot;lvconvert --mirrorlog core vg00/lvol1&quot;
converts a mirror with a disk log to a mirror with an
in-memory log.</p>

<p>&quot;lvconvert --mirrorlog disk vg00/lvol1&quot;
converts a mirror with an in-memory log to a mirror with a
disk log.</p>

<p>&quot;lvconvert -m0 vg00/lvol1&quot; converts a mirror
logical volume to a linear logical volume.</p>

<p>&quot;lvconvert -s vg00/lvol1 vg00/lvol2&quot; converts
logical volume &quot;vg00/lvol2&quot; to snapshot of
original volume &quot;vg00/lvol1&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;lvconvert -m1 vg00/lvol1 /dev/sda:0-15
/dev/sdb:0-15&quot; converts linear logical volume
&quot;vg00/lvol1&quot; to a two-way mirror, using physical
extents /dev/sda:0-15 and /dev/sdb:0-15 for allocation of
new extents.</p>

<p>&quot;lvconvert -m0 vg00/lvmirror1 /dev/sda&quot;
converts mirror logical volume &quot;vg00/lvmirror1&quot; to
linear, freeing physical extents from /dev/sda.</p>

<p>&quot;lvconvert --merge vg00/lvol1_snap&quot; merges
&quot;vg00/lvol1_snap&quot; into its origin.</p>

<p>&quot;lvconvert --merge @some_tag&quot; If vg00/lvol1,
vg00/lvol2, and vg00/lvol3 are all tagged with
&quot;some_tag&quot; each snapshot logical volume will be
merged serially, e.g.: vg00/lvol1, then vg00/lvol2, then
vg00/lvol3. If --background were used it would start all
snapshot logical volume merges in parallel.</p>

<p>&quot;lvconvert --splitmirrors 1 --name lv_split
vg00/lvmirror1&quot; Extract one image from the mirror,
making it a new logical volume named &quot;lv_split&quot;.
The mirror the image is extracted from is reduced accord-
ingly. If it was a 2-way mirror (created with -m 1), then
the resulting original volume will be linear.</p>

<p>&quot;lvconvert --splitmirrors 1 --trackchanges
vg00/lv_raid1&quot; A mirrored logical volume created with
--type raid1 can use the --trackchanges argument when
splitting off an image.</p>

<p>Detach one image from the mirrored logical volume
lv_raid1 as a sepa- rate read-only device and track the
changes made to the mirror while it is detached. The
split-off device has a name of the form lv_raid1_rim- age_N,
where N is a number, and it cannot be renamed.</p>

<p>&quot;lvconvert --merge vg00/lv_raid1_rimage_1&quot;
Merge an image that was detached temporarily from its mirror
with the --trackchanges argument back into its original
mirror and bring its contents back up-to-date.</p>
