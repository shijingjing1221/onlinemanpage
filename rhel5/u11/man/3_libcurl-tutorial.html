<p>NAME libcurl-tutorial - libcurl programming tutorial</p>

<p>Objective This document attempts to describe the general
principles and some basic approaches to consider when
programming with libcurl. The text will focus mainly on the
C interface but might apply fairly well on other interfaces
as well as they usually follow the C one pretty closely.</p>

<p>This document will refer to the user as the person
writing the source code that uses libcurl. That would
probably be you or someone in your position. What will be
generally referred to as the program will be the collected
source code that you write that is using libcurl for
transfers. The program is outside libcurl and libcurl is
outside of the program.</p>

<p>To get the more details on all options and functions
described herein, please refer to their respective man
pages.</p>

<p>Building There are many different ways to build C
programs. This chapter will assume a unix-style build
process. If you use a different build system, you can still
read this to get general information that may apply to your
environment as well.</p>

<p>Compiling the Program Your compiler needs to know where
the libcurl headers are located. Therefore you must set your
compiler s include path to point to the directory where you
installed them. The curl-con- fig[3] tool can be used to get
this information:</p>

<p>$ curl-config --cflags</p>

<p>Linking the Program with libcurl When having compiled
the program, you need to link your object files to create a
single executable. For that to succeed, you need to link
with libcurl and possibly also with other libraries that
libcurl itself depends on. Like the OpenSSL libraries, but
even some standard OS libraries may be needed on the command
line. To figure out which flags to use, once again the curl-
config tool comes to the rescue:</p>

<p>$ curl-config --libs</p>

<p>SSL or Not libcurl can be built and customized in many
ways. One of the things that varies from different libraries
and builds is the support for SSL-based transfers, like
HTTPS and FTPS. If OpenSSL was detected properly at
build-time, libcurl will be built with SSL support. To
figure out if an installed libcurl has been built with SSL
support enabled, use curl-config like this:</p>

<p>$ curl-config --feature</p>

<p>And if SSL is supported, the keyword SSL will be written
to stdout, possibly together with a few other features that
can be on and off on different libcurls.</p>

<p>See also the &quot;Features libcurl Provides&quot;
further down.</p>

<p>autoconf macro When you write your configure script to
detect libcurl and setup variables accordingly, we offer a
prewritten macro that probably does everything you need in
this area. See docs/libcurl/libcurl.m4 file - it includes
docs on how to use it.</p>

<p>Portable Code in a Portable World The people behind
libcurl have put a considerable effort to make libcurl work
on a large amount of different operating systems and envi-
ronments.</p>

<p>You program libcurl the same way on all platforms that
libcurl runs on. There are only very few minor
considerations that differs. If you just make sure to write
your code portable enough, you may very well create yourself
a very portable program. libcurl shouldn t stop you from
that.</p>

<p>Global Preparation The program must initialize some of
the libcurl functionality globally. That means it should be
done exactly once, no matter how many times you intend to
use the library. Once for your programs entire life time.
This is done using</p>

<p>curl_global_init()</p>

<p>and it takes one parameter which is a bit pattern that
tells libcurl what to initialize. Using CURL_GLOBAL_ALL will
make it initialize all known internal sub modules, and might
be a good default option. The current two bits that are
specified are:</p>

<p>CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32 which only does anything on Windows
machines. When used on a Windows machine, it ll make libcurl
initialize the win32 socket stuff. Without having that
initialized prop- erly, your program cannot use sockets
properly. You should only do this once for each application,
so if your program already does this or of another library
in use does it, you should not tell libcurl to do this as
well.</p>

<p>CURL_GLOBAL_SSL which only does anything on libcurls
compiled and built SSL-enabled. On these systems, this will
make libcurl initialize OpenSSL properly for this
application. This is only needed to do once for each
application so if your program or another library already
does this, this bit should not be needed.</p>

<p>libcurl has a default protection mechanism that detects
if curl_global_init(3) hasn t been called by the time
curl_easy_perform(3) is called and if that is the case,
libcurl runs the function itself with a guessed bit pattern.
Please note that depending solely on this is not considered
nice nor very good.</p>

<p>When the program no longer uses libcurl, it should call
curl_global_cleanup(3), which is the opposite of the init
call. It will then do the reversed operations to cleanup the
resources the curl_global_init(3) call initialized.</p>

<p>Repeated calls to curl_global_init(3) and
curl_global_cleanup(3) should be avoided. They should only
be called once each.</p>

<p>Features libcurl Provides It is considered best-practice
to determine libcurl features at run- time rather than at
build-time (if possible of course). By calling
curl_version_info(3) and checking out the details of the
returned struct, your program can figure out exactly what
the currently running libcurl supports.</p>

<p>Handle the Easy libcurl libcurl first introduced the so
called easy interface. All operations in the easy interface
are prefixed with curl_easy.</p>

<p>Recent libcurl versions also offer the multi interface.
More about that interface, what it is targeted for and how
to use it is detailed in a separate chapter further down.
You still need to understand the easy interface first, so
please continue reading for better understanding.</p>

<p>To use the easy interface, you must first create
yourself an easy han- dle. You need one handle for each easy
session you want to perform. Basically, you should use one
handle for every thread you plan to use for transferring.
You must never share the same handle in multiple
threads.</p>

<p>Get an easy handle with</p>

<p>easyhandle = curl_easy_init();</p>

<p>It returns an easy handle. Using that you proceed to the
next step: setting up your preferred actions. A handle is
just a logic entity for the upcoming transfer or series of
transfers.</p>

<p>You set properties and options for this handle using
curl_easy_setopt(3). They control how the subsequent
transfer or trans- fers will be made. Options remain set in
the handle until set again to something different. Alas,
multiple requests using the same handle will use the same
options.</p>

<p>Many of the options you set in libcurl are
&quot;strings&quot;, pointers to data terminated with a zero
byte. Keep in mind that when you set strings with
curl_easy_setopt(3), libcurl will not copy the data. It will
merely point to the data. You MUST make sure that the data
remains available for libcurl to use until finished or until
you use the same option again to point to something
else.</p>

<p>One of the most basic properties to set in the handle is
the URL. You set your preferred URL to transfer with
CURLOPT_URL in a manner similar to:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_URL,
&quot;http://domain.com/&quot;);</p>

<p>Lets assume for a while that you want to receive data as
the URL iden- tifies a remote resource you want to get here.
Since you write a sort of application that needs this
transfer, I assume that you would like to get the data
passed to you directly instead of simply getting it passed
to stdout. So, you write your own function that matches this
prototype:</p>

<p>size_t write_data(void *buffer, size_t size, size_t
nmemb, void *userp);</p>

<p>You tell libcurl to pass all data to this function by
issuing a func- tion similar to this:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION,
write_data);</p>

<p>You can control what data your function get in the forth
argument by setting another property:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA,
&amp;internal_struct);</p>

<p>Using that property, you can easily pass local data
between your appli- cation and the function that gets
invoked by libcurl. libcurl itself wont touch the data you
pass with CURLOPT_WRITEDATA.</p>

<p>libcurl offers its own default internal callback that ll
take care of the data if you don t set the callback with
CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION. It will then simply output the
received data to stdout. You can have the default callback
write the data to a different file handle by passing a FILE
* to a file opened for writing with the CURLOPT_WRITEDATA
option.</p>

<p>Now, we need to take a step back and have a deep breath.
Heres one of those rare platform-dependent nitpicks. Did you
spot it? On some plat- forms[2], libcurl wont be able to
operate on files opened by the pro- gram. Thus, if you use
the default callback and pass in an open file with
CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, it will crash. You should therefore avoid
this to make your program run fine virtually everywhere.</p>

<p>(CURLOPT_WRITEDATA was formerly known as CURLOPT_FILE.
Both names still work and do the same thing).</p>

<p>If you re using libcurl as a win32 DLL, you MUST use the
CURLOPT_WRITE- FUNCTION if you set CURLOPT_WRITEDATA - or
you will experience crashes.</p>

<p>There are of course many more options you can set, and
we ll get back to a few of them later. Let s instead
continue to the actual transfer:</p>

<p>success = curl_easy_perform(easyhandle);</p>

<p>curl_easy_perform(3) will connect to the remote site, do
the necessary commands and receive the transfer. Whenever it
receives data, it calls the callback function we previously
set. The function may get one byte at a time, or it may get
many kilobytes at once. libcurl delivers as much as possible
as often as possible. Your callback function should return
the number of bytes it &quot;took care of&quot;. If that is
not the exact same amount of bytes that was passed to it,
libcurl will abort the operation and return with an error
code.</p>

<p>When the transfer is complete, the function returns a
return code that informs you if it succeeded in its mission
or not. If a return code isn t enough for you, you can use
the CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER to point libcurl to a buffer of
yours where itll store a human readable error message as
well.</p>

<p>If you then want to transfer another file, the handle is
ready to be used again. Mind you, it is even preferred that
you re-use an existing handle if you intend to make another
transfer. libcurl will then attempt to re-use the previous
connection.</p>

<p>Multi-threading Issues The first basic rule is that you
must never share a libcurl handle (be it easy or multi or
whatever) between multiple threads. Only use one handle in
one thread at a time.</p>

<p>libcurl is completely thread safe, except for two
issues: signals and SSL/TLS handlers. Signals are used
timeouting name resolves (during DNS lookup) - when built
without c-ares support and not on Windows..</p>

<p>If you are accessing HTTPS or FTPS URLs in a
multi-threaded manner, you are then of course using
OpenSSL/GnuTLS multi-threaded and those libs have their own
requirements on this issue. Basically, you need to provide
one or two functions to allow it to function properly. For
all details, see this:</p>

<p>OpenSSL</p>


<p>http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/threads.html#DESCRIPTION</p>

<p>GnuTLS</p>

<p>http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/man-
ual/html_node/Multi_002dthreaded-applications.html</p>

<p>When using multiple threads you should set the
CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL option to TRUE for all handles. Everything
will or might work fine except that timeouts are not honored
during the DNS lookup - which you can work around by
building libcurl with c-ares support. c-ares is a library
that provides asynchronous name resolves. Unfortunately,
c-ares does not yet fully support IPv6. On some platforms,
libcurl simply will not function properly multi-threaded
unless this option is set.</p>

<p>Also, note that CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE is not
thread-safe.</p>

<p>When It Doest Work There will always be times when the
transfer fails for some reason. You might have set the wrong
libcurl option or misunderstood what the libcurl option
actually does, or the remote server might return non-
standard replies that confuse the library which then
confuses your pro- gram.</p>

<p>There s one golden rule when these things occur: set the
CURLOPT_VER- BOSE option to TRUE. Itll cause the library to
spew out the entire protocol details it sends, some internal
info and some received proto- col data as well (especially
when using FTP). If youre using HTTP, adding the headers in
the received output to study is also a clever way to get a
better understanding why the server behaves the way it does.
Include headers in the normal body output with
CURLOPT_HEADER set TRUE.</p>

<p>Of course there are bugs left. We need to get to know
about them to be able to fix them, so were quite dependent
on your bug reports! When you do report suspected bugs in
libcurl, please include as much details you possibly can: a
protocol dump that CURLOPT_VERBOSE produces, library
version, as much as possible of your code that uses libcurl,
operating system name and version, compiler name and version
etc.</p>

<p>If CURLOPT_VERBOSE is not enough, you increase the level
of debug data your application receive by using the
CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION.</p>

<p>Getting some in-depth knowledge about the protocols
involved is never wrong, and if youre trying to do funny
things, you might very well understand libcurl and how to
use it better if you study the appropri- ate RFC documents
at least briefly.</p>

<p>Upload Data to a Remote Site libcurl tries to keep a
protocol independent approach to most trans- fers, thus
uploading to a remote FTP site is very similar to uploading
data to a HTTP server with a PUT request.</p>

<p>Of course, first you either create an easy handle or you
re-use one existing one. Then you set the URL to operate on
just like before. This is the remote URL, that we now will
upload.</p>

<p>Since we write an application, we most likely want
libcurl to get the upload data by asking us for it. To make
it do that, we set the read callback and the custom pointer
libcurl will pass to our read callback. The read callback
should have a prototype similar to:</p>

<p>size_t function(char *bufptr, size_t size, size_t
nitems, void *userp);</p>

<p>Where bufptr is the pointer to a buffer we fill in with
data to upload and size*nitems is the size of the buffer and
therefore also the maxi- mum amount of data we can return to
libcurl in this call. The userp pointer is the custom
pointer we set to point to a struct of ours to pass private
data between the application and the callback.</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_READFUNCTION,
read_function);</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_INFILE,
&amp;filedata);</p>

<p>Tell libcurl that we want to upload:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_UPLOAD, TRUE);</p>

<p>A few protocols wont behave properly when uploads are
done without any prior knowledge of the expected file size.
So, set the upload file size using the
CURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE for all known file sizes like
this[1]:</p>

<p>/* in this example, file_size must be an off_t variable
*/ curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE,
file_size);</p>

<p>When you call curl_easy_perform(3) this time, it ll
perform all the necessary operations and when it has invoked
the upload it ll call your supplied callback to get the data
to upload. The program should return as much data as
possible in every invoke, as that is likely to make the
upload perform as fast as possible. The callback should
return the num- ber of bytes it wrote in the buffer.
Returning 0 will signal the end of the upload.</p>

<p>Passwords Many protocols use or even require that user
name and password are pro- vided to be able to download or
upload the data of your choice. libcurl offers several ways
to specify them.</p>

<p>Most protocols support that you specify the name and
password in the URL itself. libcurl will detect this and use
them accordingly. This is written like this:</p>

<p>protocol://user:password@example.com/path/</p>

<p>If you need any odd letters in your user name or
password, you should enter them URL encoded, as %XX where XX
is a two-digit hexadecimal num- ber.</p>

<p>libcurl also provides options to set various passwords.
The user name and password as shown embedded in the URL can
instead get set with the CURLOPT_USERPWD option. The
argument passed to libcurl should be a char * to a string in
the format &quot;user:password:&quot;. In a manner like
this:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_USERPWD,
&quot;myname:thesecret&quot;);</p>

<p>Another case where name and password might be needed at
times, is for those users who need to authenticate
themselves to a proxy they use. libcurl offers another
option for this, the CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD. It is used quite
similar to the CURLOPT_USERPWD option like this:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD,
&quot;myname:these- cret&quot;);</p>

<p>Theres a long time unix &quot;standard&quot; way of
storing ftp user names and passwords, namely in the
$HOME/.netrc file. The file should be made private so that
only the user may read it (see also the &quot;Security Con-
siderations&quot; chapter), as it might contain the password
in plain text. libcurl has the ability to use this file to
figure out what set of user name and password to use for a
particular host. As an extension to the normal
functionality, libcurl also supports this file for non-FTP
pro- tocols such as HTTP. To make curl use this file, use
the CURLOPT_NETRC option:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_NETRC, TRUE);</p>

<p>And a very basic example of how such a .netrc file may
look like:</p>

<p>machine myhost.mydomain.com login userlogin password
secretword</p>

<p>All these examples have been cases where the password
has been optional, or at least you could leave it out and
have libcurl attempt to do its job without it. There are
times when the password isnt optional, like when youre using
an SSL private key for secure trans- fers.</p>

<p>To pass the known private key password to libcurl:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_SSLKEYPASSWD,
&quot;keypassword&quot;);</p>

<p>HTTP Authentication The previous chapter showed how to
set user name and password for get- ting URLs that require
authentication. When using the HTTP protocol, there are many
different ways a client can provide those credentials to the
server and you can control what way libcurl will (attempt
to) use. The default HTTP authentication method is called
Basic, which is sending the name and password in clear-text
in the HTTP request, base64-encoded. This is insecure.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing libcurl can be built to use:
Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate, GSS-Negotiate and SPNEGO.
You can tell libcurl which one to use with CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH
as in:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH,
CURLAUTH_DIGEST);</p>

<p>And when you send authentication to a proxy, you can
also set authenti- cation type the same way but instead with
CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH,
CURLAUTH_NTLM);</p>

<p>Both these options allow you to set multiple types (by
ORing them together), to make libcurl pick the most secure
one out of the types the server/proxy claims to support.
This method does however add a round-trip since libcurl must
first ask the server what it supports:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH,
CURLAUTH_DIGEST|CURLAUTH_BASIC);</p>

<p>For convenience, you can use the CURLAUTH_ANY define
(instead of a list with specific types) which allows libcurl
to use whatever method it wants.</p>

<p>When asking for multiple types, libcurl will pick the
available one it considers &quot;best&quot; in its own
internal order of preference.</p>

<p>HTTP POSTing We get many questions regarding how to
issue HTTP POSTs with libcurl the proper way. This chapter
will thus include examples using both different versions of
HTTP POST that libcurl supports.</p>

<p>The first version is the simple POST, the most common
version, that most HTML pages using the &lt;form&gt; tag
uses. We provide a pointer to the data and tell libcurl to
post it all to the remote site:</p>

<p>char *data=&quot;name=daniel&amp;project=curl&quot;;
curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, data);
curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_URL,
&quot;http://posthere.com/&quot;);</p>

<p>curl_easy_perform(easyhandle); /* post away! */</p>

<p>Simple enough, huh? Since you set the POST options with
the CUR- LOPT_POSTFIELDS, this automatically switches the
handle to use POST in the upcoming request.</p>

<p>Ok, so what if you want to post binary data that also
requires you to set the Content-Type: header of the post?
Well, binary posts prevents libcurl from being able to do
strlen() on the data to figure out the size, so therefore we
must tell libcurl the size of the post data. Set- ting
headers in libcurl requests are done in a generic way, by
building a list of our own headers and then passing that
list to libcurl.</p>

<p>struct curl_slist *headers=NULL; headers =
curl_slist_append(headers, &quot;Content-Type:
text/xml&quot;);</p>

<p>/* post binary data */ curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle,
CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, binaryptr);</p>

<p>/* set the size of the postfields data */
curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE, 23);</p>

<p>/* pass our list of custom made headers */
curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER,
headers);</p>

<p>curl_easy_perform(easyhandle); /* post away! */</p>

<p>curl_slist_free_all(headers); /* free the header list
*/</p>

<p>While the simple examples above cover the majority of
all cases where HTTP POST operations are required, they don
t do multi-part formposts. Multi-part formposts were
introduced as a better way to post (possibly large) binary
data and was first documented in the RFC1867. Theyre called
multi-part because they re built by a chain of parts, each
being a single unit. Each part has its own name and
contents. You can in fact create and post a multi-part
formpost with the regular libcurl POST support described
above, but that would require that you build a form- post
yourself and provide to libcurl. To make that easier,
libcurl pro- vides curl_formadd(3). Using this function, you
add parts to the form. When youre done adding parts, you
post the whole form.</p>

<p>The following example sets two simple text parts with
plain textual contents, and then a file with binary contents
and upload the whole thing.</p>

<p>struct curl_httppost *post=NULL; struct curl_httppost
*last=NULL; curl_formadd(&amp;post, &amp;last,
CURLFORM_COPYNAME, &quot;name&quot;, CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS,
&quot;daniel&quot;, CURLFORM_END); curl_formadd(&amp;post,
&amp;last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, &quot;project&quot;,
CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS, &quot;curl&quot;, CURLFORM_END);
curl_formadd(&amp;post, &amp;last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME,
&quot;logotype-image&quot;, CURLFORM_FILECONTENT,
&quot;curl.png&quot;, CURLFORM_END);</p>

<p>/* Set the form info */ curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle,
CURLOPT_HTTPPOST, post);</p>

<p>curl_easy_perform(easyhandle); /* post away! */</p>

<p>/* free the post data again */ curl_formfree(post);</p>

<p>Multipart formposts are chains of parts using MIME-style
separators and headers. It means that each one of these
separate parts get a few head- ers set that describe the
individual content-type, size etc. To enable your
application to handicraft this formpost even more, libcurl
allows you to supply your own set of custom headers to such
an individual form part. You can of course supply headers to
as many parts you like, but this little example will show
how you set headers to one specific part when you add that
to the post handle:</p>

<p>struct curl_slist *headers=NULL; headers =
curl_slist_append(headers, &quot;Content-Type:
text/xml&quot;);</p>

<p>curl_formadd(&amp;post, &amp;last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME,
&quot;logotype-image&quot;, CURLFORM_FILECONTENT,
&quot;curl.xml&quot;, CURLFORM_CONTENTHEADER, headers,
CURLFORM_END);</p>

<p>curl_easy_perform(easyhandle); /* post away! */</p>

<p>curl_formfree(post); /* free post */
curl_slist_free_all(post); /* free custom header list */</p>

<p>Since all options on an easyhandle are
&quot;sticky&quot;, they remain the same until changed even
if you do call curl_easy_perform(3), you may need to tell
curl to go back to a plain GET request if you intend to do
such a one as your next request. You force an easyhandle to
back to GET by using the CURLOPT_HTTPGET option:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_HTTPGET, TRUE);</p>

<p>Just setting CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS to &quot;&quot; or NULL
will *not* stop libcurl from doing a POST. It will just make
it POST without any data to send!</p>

<p>Showing Progress For historical and traditional reasons,
libcurl has a built-in progress meter that can be switched
on and then makes it presents a progress meter in your
terminal.</p>

<p>Switch on the progress meter by, oddly enough, set
CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS to FALSE. This option is set to TRUE by
default.</p>

<p>For most applications however, the built-in progress
meter is useless and what instead is interesting is the
ability to specify a progress callback. The function pointer
you pass to libcurl will then be called on irregular
intervals with information about the current transfer.</p>

<p>Set the progress callback by using
CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION. And pass a pointer to a function
that matches this prototype:</p>

<p>int progress_callback(void *clientp, double dltotal,
double dlnow, double ultotal, double ulnow);</p>

<p>If any of the input arguments is unknown, a 0 will be
passed. The first argument, the clientp is the pointer you
pass to libcurl with CUR- LOPT_PROGRESSDATA. libcurl wont
touch it.</p>

<p>libcurl with C++ Theres basically only one thing to keep
in mind when using C++ instead of C when interfacing
libcurl:</p>

<p>The callbacks CANNOT be non-static class member
functions</p>

<p>Example C++ code:</p>

<p>class AClass { static size_t write_data(void *ptr,
size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *ourpointer) { /* do what
you want with the data */ } }</p>

<p>Proxies What &quot;proxy&quot; means according to
Merriam-Webster: &quot;a person authorized to act for
another&quot; but also &quot;the agency, function, or office
of a deputy who acts as a substitute for another&quot;.</p>

<p>Proxies are exceedingly common these days. Companies
often only offer Internet access to employees through their
HTTP proxies. Network clients or user-agents ask the proxy
for documents, the proxy does the actual request and then it
returns them.</p>

<p>libcurl has full support for HTTP proxies, so when a
given URL is wanted, libcurl will ask the proxy for it
instead of trying to connect to the actual host identified
in the URL.</p>

<p>The fact that the proxy is a HTTP proxy puts certain
restrictions on what can actually happen. A requested URL
that might not be a HTTP URL will be still be passed to the
HTTP proxy to deliver back to libcurl. This happens
transparently, and an application may not need to know. I
say &quot;may&quot;, because at times it is very important
to understand that all operations over a HTTP proxy is using
the HTTP protocol. For example, you can t invoke your own
custom FTP commands or even proper FTP direc- tory
listings.</p>

<p>Proxy Options</p>

<p>To tell libcurl to use a proxy at a given port
number:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_PROXY, &quot;proxy-
host.com:8080&quot;);</p>

<p>Some proxies require user authentication before allowing
a request, and you pass that information similar to
this:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD,
&quot;user:pass- word&quot;);</p>

<p>If you want to, you can specify the host name only in
the CUR- LOPT_PROXY option, and set the port number
separately with CUR- LOPT_PROXYPORT.</p>

<p>Environment Variables</p>

<p>libcurl automatically checks and uses a set of
environment vari- ables to know what proxies to use for
certain protocols. The names of the variables are following
an ancient de facto stan- dard and are built up as
&quot;[protocol]_proxy&quot; (note the lower cas- ing).
Which makes the variable HTTP. Following the same rule, the
variable named ftp_proxy is checked for FTP URLs. Again, the
proxies are always HTTP proxies, the different names of the
variables simply allows different HTTP proxies to be
used.</p>

<p>The proxy environment variable contents should be in the
format
&quot;[protocol://][user:password@]machine[:port]&quot;.
Where the proto- col:// part is simply ignored if present
(so http://proxy and bluerk://proxy will do the same) and
the optional port number specifies on which port the proxy
operates on the host. If not specified, the internal default
port number will be used and that is most likely *not* the
one you would like it to be.</p>

<p>There are two special environment variables. all_proxy
is what sets proxy for any URL in case the protocol specific
variable wasnt set, and no_proxy defines a list of hosts
that should not use a proxy even though a variable may say
so. If no_proxy is a plain asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) it
matches all hosts.</p>

<p>SSL and Proxies</p>

<p>SSL is for secure point-to-point connections. This
involves strong encryption and similar things, which
effectively makes it impossible for a proxy to operate as a
&quot;man in between&quot; which the proxy s task is, as
previously discussed. Instead, the only way to have SSL work
over a HTTP proxy is to ask the proxy to tunnel trough
everything without being able to check or fiddle with the
traffic.</p>

<p>Opening an SSL connection over a HTTP proxy is therefor
a matter of asking the proxy for a straight connection to
the target host on a specified port. This is made with the
HTTP request CONNECT. (&quot;please mr proxy, connect me to
that remote host&quot;).</p>

<p>Because of the nature of this operation, where the proxy
has no idea what kind of data that is passed in and out
through this tunnel, this breaks some of the very few
advantages that come from using a proxy, such as caching.
Many organizations prevent this kind of tunneling to other
destination port numbers than 443 (which is the default
HTTPS port number).</p>

<p>Tunneling Through Proxy As explained above, tunneling is
required for SSL to work and often even restricted to the
operation intended for SSL; HTTPS.</p>

<p>This is however not the only time proxy-tunneling might
offer benefits to you or your application.</p>

<p>As tunneling opens a direct connection from your
application to the remote machine, it suddenly also
re-introduces the ability to do non-HTTP operations over a
HTTP proxy. You can in fact use things such as FTP upload or
FTP custom commands this way.</p>

<p>Again, this is often prevented by the administrators of
proxies and is rarely allowed.</p>

<p>Tell libcurl to use proxy tunneling like this:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL,
TRUE);</p>

<p>In fact, there might even be times when you want to do
plain HTTP operations using a tunnel like this, as it then
enables you to operate on the remote server instead of
asking the proxy to do so. libcurl will not stand in the way
for such innovative actions either!</p>

<p>Proxy Auto-Config</p>

<p>Netscape first came up with this. It is basically a web
page (usually using a .pac extension) with a javascript that
when executed by the browser with the requested URL as
input, returns information to the browser on how to connect
to the URL. The returned information might be
&quot;DIRECT&quot; (which means no proxy should be used),
&quot;PROXY host:port&quot; (to tell the browser where the
proxy for this particular URL is) or &quot;SOCKS
host:port&quot; (to direct the browser to a SOCKS
proxy).</p>

<p>libcurl has no means to interpret or evaluate javascript
and thus it doesnt support this. If you get yourself in a
position where you face this nasty invention, the following
advice have been mentioned and used in the past:</p>

<p>- Depending on the javascript complexity, write up a
script that translates it to another language and execute
that.</p>

<p>- Read the javascript code and rewrite the same logic in
another language.</p>

<p>- Implement a javascript interpreted, people have
successfully used the Mozilla javascript engine in the
past.</p>

<p>- Ask your admins to stop this, for a static proxy setup
or sim- ilar.</p>

<p>Persistence Is The Way to Happiness Re-cycling the same
easy handle several times when doing multiple requests is
the way to go.</p>

<p>After each single curl_easy_perform(3) operation,
libcurl will keep the connection alive and open. A
subsequent request using the same easy handle to the same
host might just be able to use the already open con-
nection! This reduces network impact a lot.</p>

<p>Even if the connection is dropped, all connections
involving SSL to the same host again, will benefit from
libcurl s session ID cache that drastically reduces
re-connection time.</p>

<p>FTP connections that are kept alive saves a lot of time,
as the com- mand- response round-trips are skipped, and also
you don t risk getting blocked without permission to login
again like on many FTP servers only allowing N persons to be
logged in at the same time.</p>

<p>libcurl caches DNS name resolving results, to make
lookups of a previ- ously looked up name a lot faster.</p>

<p>Other interesting details that improve performance for
subsequent requests may also be added in the future.</p>

<p>Each easy handle will attempt to keep the last few
connections alive for a while in case they are to be used
again. You can set the size of this &quot;cache&quot; with
the CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS option. Default is 5. It is very
seldom any point in changing this value, and if you think of
changing this it is often just a matter of thinking
again.</p>

<p>When the connection cache gets filled, libcurl must
close an existing connection in order to get room for the
new one. To know which connec- tion to close, libcurl uses a
&quot;close policy&quot; that you can affect with the
CURLOPT_CLOSEPOLICY option. Theres only two polices
implemented as of this writing (libcurl 7.9.4) and they
are:</p>

<p>CURLCLOSEPOLICY_LEAST_RECENTLY_USED simply close the one
that hasnt been used for the longest time. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>CURLCLOSEPOLICY_OLDEST closes the oldest connection, the
one that was created the longest time ago.</p>

<p>There are, or at least were, plans to support a close
policy that would call a user-specified callback to let the
user be able to decide which connection to dump when this is
necessary and therefor is the CUR- LOPT_CLOSEFUNCTION an
existing option still today. Nothing ever uses this though
and this will not be used within the foreseeable future
either.</p>

<p>To force your upcoming request to not use an already
existing connec- tion (it will even close one first if there
happens to be one alive to the same host youre about to
operate on), you can do that by setting
CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT to TRUE. In a similar spirit, you can
also forbid the upcoming request to be &quot;lying&quot;
around and possibly get re-used after the request by setting
CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE to TRUE.</p>

<p>HTTP Headers Used by libcurl When you use libcurl to do
HTTP requests, itll pass along a series of headers
automatically. It might be good for you to know and
understand these ones.</p>

<p>Host This header is required by HTTP 1.1 and even many
1.0 servers and should be the name of the server we want to
talk to. This includes the port number if anything but
default.</p>

<p>Pragma &quot;no-cache&quot;. Tells a possible proxy to
not grab a copy from the cache but to fetch a fresh one.</p>

<p>Accept &quot;*/*&quot;.</p>

<p>Expect: When doing multi-part formposts, libcurl will
set this header to &quot;100-continue&quot; to ask the
server for an &quot;OK&quot; message before it proceeds with
sending the data part of the post.</p>

<p>Customizing Operations There is an ongoing development
today where more and more protocols are built upon HTTP for
transport. This has obvious benefits as HTTP is a tested and
reliable protocol that is widely deployed and have excellent
proxy-support.</p>

<p>When you use one of these protocols, and even when doing
other kinds of programming you may need to change the
traditional HTTP (or FTP or...) manners. You may need to
change words, headers or various data.</p>

<p>libcurl is your friend here too.</p>

<p>CUSTOMREQUEST If just changing the actual HTTP request
keyword is what you want, like when GET, HEAD or POST is not
good enough for you, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST is there for you.
It is very simple to use:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST,
&quot;MYOWN- RUQUEST&quot;);</p>

<p>When using the custom request, you change the request
keyword of the actual request you are performing. Thus, by
default you make GET request but you can also make a POST
operation (as described before) and then replace the POST
keyword if you want to. Youre the boss.</p>

<p>Modify Headers HTTP-like protocols pass a series of
headers to the server when doing the request, and you re
free to pass any amount of extra headers that you think fit.
Adding headers are this easy:</p>

<p>struct curl_slist *headers=NULL; /* init to NULL is
important */</p>

<p>headers = curl_slist_append(headers,
&quot;Hey-server-hey: how are you?&quot;); headers =
curl_slist_append(headers, &quot;X-silly-content:
yes&quot;);</p>

<p>/* pass our list of custom made headers */
curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER,
headers);</p>

<p>curl_easy_perform(easyhandle); /* transfer http */</p>

<p>curl_slist_free_all(headers); /* free the header list
*/</p>

<p>... and if you think some of the internally generated
headers, such as Accept: or Host: dont contain the data you
want them to contain, you can replace them by simply setting
them too:</p>

<p>headers = curl_slist_append(headers, &quot;Accept:
Agent-007&quot;); headers = curl_slist_append(headers,
&quot;Host: munged.host.line&quot;);</p>

<p>Delete Headers If you replace an existing header with
one with no contents, you will prevent the header from being
sent. Like if you want to completely prevent the
&quot;Accept:&quot; header to be sent, you can dis- able it
with code similar to this:</p>

<p>headers = curl_slist_append(headers,
&quot;Accept:&quot;);</p>

<p>Both replacing and canceling internal headers should be
done with careful consideration and you should be aware that
you may violate the HTTP protocol when doing so.</p>

<p>Enforcing chunked transfer-encoding</p>

<p>By making sure a request uses the custom header
&quot;Transfer-Encod- ing: chunked&quot; when doing a
non-GET HTTP operation, libcurl will switch over to
&quot;chunked&quot; upload, even though the size of the data
to upload might be known. By default, libcurl usually
switches over to chunked upload automatically if the upload
data size is unknown.</p>

<p>HTTP Version</p>

<p>Theres only one aspect left in the HTTP requests that we
haven t yet mentioned how to modify: the version field. All
HTTP requests includes the version number to tell the server
which version we support. libcurl speak HTTP 1.1 by default.
Some very old servers dont like getting 1.1-requests and
when dealing with stubborn old things like that, you can
tell libcurl to use 1.0 instead by doing something like
this:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION,
CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_0);</p>

<p>FTP Custom Commands</p>

<p>Not all protocols are HTTP-like, and thus the above may
not help you when you want to make for example your FTP
transfers to behave differently.</p>

<p>Sending custom commands to a FTP server means that you
need to send the commands exactly as the FTP server expects
them (RFC959 is a good guide here), and you can only use
commands that work on the control-connection alone. All
kinds of commands that requires data interchange and thus
needs a data-connection must be left to libcurls own
judgment. Also be aware that libcurl will do its very best
to change directory to the target directory before doing any
transfer, so if you change directory (with CWD or similar)
you might confuse libcurl and then it might not attempt to
transfer the file in the correct remote directory.</p>

<p>A little example that deletes a given file before an
operation:</p>

<p>headers = curl_slist_append(headers, &quot;DELE
file-to-remove&quot;);</p>

<p>/* pass the list of custom commands to the handle */
curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_QUOTE, headers);</p>

<p>curl_easy_perform(easyhandle); /* transfer ftp data!
*/</p>

<p>curl_slist_free_all(headers); /* free the header list
*/</p>

<p>If you would instead want this operation (or chain of
opera- tions) to happen _after_ the data transfer took place
the option to curl_easy_setopt(3) would instead be called
CURLOPT_POSTQUOTE and used the exact same way.</p>

<p>The custom FTP command will be issued to the server in
the same order they are added to the list, and if a command
gets an error code returned back from the server, no more
commands will be issued and libcurl will bail out with an
error code (CURLE_FTP_QUOTE_ERROR). Note that if you use
CURLOPT_QUOTE to send commands before a transfer, no
transfer will actually take place when a quote command has
failed.</p>

<p>If you set the CURLOPT_HEADER to true, you will tell
libcurl to get information about the target file and output
&quot;headers&quot; about it. The headers will be in
&quot;HTTP-style&quot;, looking like they do in HTTP.</p>

<p>The option to enable headers or to run custom FTP
commands may be useful to combine with CURLOPT_NOBODY. If
this option is set, no actual file content transfer will be
performed.</p>

<p>FTP Custom CUSTOMREQUEST If you do what list the
contents of a FTP directory using your own defined FTP
command, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST will do just that.
&quot;NLST&quot; is the default one for listing directories
but you re free to pass in your idea of a good
alternative.</p>

<p>Cookies Without Chocolate Chips In the HTTP sense, a
cookie is a name with an associated value. A server sends
the name and value to the client, and expects it to get sent
back on every subsequent request to the server that matches
the particular conditions set. The conditions include that
the domain name and path match and that the cookie hasnt
become too old.</p>

<p>In real-world cases, servers send new cookies to replace
existing one to update them. Server use cookies to
&quot;track&quot; users and to keep &quot;ses-
sions&quot;.</p>

<p>Cookies are sent from server to clients with the header
Set-Cookie: and they re sent from clients to servers with
the Cookie: header.</p>

<p>To just send whatever cookie you want to a server, you
can use CUR- LOPT_COOKIE to set a cookie string like
this:</p>

<p>curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_COOKIE,
&quot;name1=var1; name2=var2;&quot;);</p>

<p>In many cases, that is not enough. You might want to
dynamically save whatever cookies the remote server passes
to you, and make sure those cookies are then use accordingly
on later requests.</p>

<p>One way to do this, is to save all headers you receive
in a plain file and when you make a request, you tell
libcurl to read the previous headers to figure out which
cookies to use. Set header file to read cookies from with
CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE.</p>

<p>The CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE option also automatically enables
the cookie parser in libcurl. Until the cookie parser is
enabled, libcurl will not parse or understand incoming
cookies and they will just be ignored. However, when the
parser is enabled the cookies will be understood and the
cookies will be kept in memory and used properly in
subsequent requests when the same handle is used. Many times
this is enough, and you may not have to save the cookies to
disk at all. Note that the file you specify to
CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE doesnt have to exist to enable the
parser, so a common way to just enable the parser and not
read able might be to use a file name you know doesnt
exist.</p>

<p>If you rather use existing cookies that you ve
previously received with your Netscape or Mozilla browsers,
you can make libcurl use that cookie file as input. The
CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE is used for that too, as libcurl will
automatically find out what kind of file it is and act
accord- ingly.</p>

<p>The perhaps most advanced cookie operation libcurl
offers, is saving the entire internal cookie state back into
a Netscape/Mozilla formatted cookie file. We call that the
cookie-jar. When you set a file name with CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR,
that file name will be created and all received cookies will
be stored in it when curl_easy_cleanup(3) is called. This
enabled cookies to get passed on properly between multiple
handles without any information getting lost.</p>

<p>FTP Peculiarities We Need FTP transfers use a second
TCP/IP connection for the data transfer. This is usually a
fact you can forget and ignore but at times this fact will
come back to haunt you. libcurl offers several different
ways to custom how the second connection is being made.</p>

<p>libcurl can either connect to the server a second time
or tell the server to connect back to it. The first option
is the default and it is also what works best for all the
people behind firewalls, NATs or IP- masquerading setups.
libcurl then tells the server to open up a new port and wait
for a second connection. This is by default attempted with
EPSV first, and if that doesnt work it tries PASV instead.
(EPSV is an extension to the original FTP spec and does not
exist nor work on all FTP servers.)</p>

<p>You can prevent libcurl from first trying the EPSV
command by setting CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPSV to FALSE.</p>

<p>In some cases, you will prefer to have the server
connect back to you for the second connection. This might be
when the server is perhaps behind a firewall or something
and only allows connections on a single port. libcurl then
informs the remote server which IP address and port number
to connect to. This is made with the CURLOPT_FTPPORT option.
If you set it to &quot;-&quot;, libcurl will use your
systems &quot;default IP address&quot;. If you want to use a
particular IP, you can set the full IP address, a host name
to resolve to an IP address or even a local network
interface name that libcurl will get the IP address
from.</p>

<p>When doing the &quot;PORT&quot; approach, libcurl will
attempt to use the EPRT and the LPRT before trying PORT, as
they work with more protocols. You can disable this behavior
by setting CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPRT to FALSE.</p>

<p>Headers Equal Fun Some protocols provide
&quot;headers&quot;, meta-data separated from the normal
data. These headers are by default not included in the
normal data stream, but you can make them appear in the data
stream by setting CUR- LOPT_HEADER to TRUE.</p>

<p>What might be even more useful, is libcurls ability to
separate the headers from the data and thus make the
callbacks differ. You can for example set a different
pointer to pass to the ordinary write callback by setting
CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER.</p>

<p>Or, you can set an entirely separate function to receive
the headers, by using CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION.</p>

<p>The headers are passed to the callback function one by
one, and you can depend on that fact. It makes it easier for
you to add custom header parsers etc.</p>

<p>&quot;Headers&quot; for FTP transfers equal all the FTP
server responses. They arent actually true headers, but in
this case we pretend they are! ;-)</p>

<p>Post Transfer Information [ curl_easy_getinfo ]</p>

<p>Security Considerations libcurl is in itself not
insecure. If used the right way, you can use libcurl to
transfer data pretty safely.</p>

<p>There are of course many things to consider that may
loosen up this situation:</p>

<p>Command Lines If you use a command line tool (such as
curl) that uses libcurl, and you give option to the tool on
the command line those options can very likely get read by
other users of your system when they use ps or other tools
to list currently running pro- cesses.</p>

<p>To avoid this problem, never feed sensitive things to
programs using command line options.</p>

<p>.netrc .netrc is a pretty handy file/feature that allows
you to login quickly and automatically to frequently visited
sites. The file contains passwords in clear text and is a
real security risk. In some cases, your .netrc is also
stored in a home directory that is NFS mounted or used on
another network based file system, so the clear text
password will fly through your network every time anyone
reads that file!</p>

<p>To avoid this problem, dont use .netrc files and never
store passwords in plain text anywhere.</p>

<p>Clear Text Passwords Many of the protocols libcurl
supports send name and password unencrypted as clear text
(HTTP Basic authentication, FTP, TEL- NET etc). It is very
easy for anyone on your network or a net- work nearby yours,
to just fire up a network analyzer tool and eavesdrop on
your passwords. Dont let the fact that HTTP uses base64
encoded passwords fool you. They may not look readable at a
first glance, but they very easily &quot;deciphered&quot; by
anyone within seconds.</p>

<p>To avoid this problem, use protocols that dont let
snoopers see your password: HTTPS, FTPS and FTP-kerberos are
a few examples. HTTP Digest authentication allows this too,
but isnt supported by libcurl as of this writing.</p>

<p>Showing What You Do On a related issue, be aware that
even in situations like when you have problems with libcurl
and ask someone for help, every- thing you reveal in order
to get best possible help might also impose certain security
related risks. Host names, user names, paths, operating
system specifics etc (not to mention passwords of course)
may in fact be used by intruders to gain additional
information of a potential target.</p>

<p>To avoid this problem, you must of course use your
common sense. Often, you can just edit out the sensitive
data or just search/replace your true information with faked
data.</p>

<p>Multiple Transfers Using the multi Interface The easy
interface as described in detail in this document is a syn-
chronous interface that transfers one file at a time and
doesnt return until its done.</p>

<p>The multi interface on the other hand, allows your
program to transfer multiple files in both directions at the
same time, without forcing you to use multiple threads.</p>

<p>To use this interface, you are better off if you first
understand the basics of how to use the easy interface. The
multi interface is simply a way to make multiple transfers
at the same time, by adding up multi- ple easy handles in to
a &quot;multi stack&quot;.</p>

<p>You create the easy handles you want and you set all the
options just like you have been told above, and then you
create a multi handle with curl_multi_init(3) and add all
those easy handles to that multi handle with
curl_multi_add_handle(3).</p>

<p>When youve added the handles you have for the moment
(you can still add new ones at any time), you start the
transfers by call curl_multi_perform(3).</p>

<p>curl_multi_perform(3) is asynchronous. It will only
execute as little as possible and then return back control
to your program. It is designed to never block. If it
returns CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM you better call it again
soon, as that is a signal that it still has local data to
send or remote data to receive.</p>

<p>The best usage of this interface is when you do a
select() on all pos- sible file descriptors or sockets to
know when to call libcurl again. This also makes it easy for
you to wait and respond to actions on your own applications
sockets/handles. You figure out what to select() for by
using curl_multi_fdset(3), that fills in a set of fd_set
variables for you with the particular file descriptors
libcurl uses for the moment.</p>

<p>When you then call select(), itll return when one of the
file handles signal action and you then call
curl_multi_perform(3) to allow libcurl to do what it wants
to do. Take note that libcurl does also feature some
time-out code so we advice you to never use very long
timeouts on select() before you call curl_multi_perform(3),
which thus should be called unconditionally every now and
then even if none of its file descriptors have signaled
ready. Another precaution you should use: always call
curl_multi_fdset(3) immediately before the select() call
since the current set of file descriptors may change when
calling a curl function.</p>

<p>If you want to stop the transfer of one of the easy
handles in the stack, you can use
curl_multi_remove_handle(3) to remove individual easy
handles. Remember that easy handles should be
curl_easy_cleanup(3)ed.</p>

<p>When a transfer within the multi stack has finished, the
counter of running transfers (as filled in by
curl_multi_perform(3)) will decrease. When the number
reaches zero, all transfers are done.</p>

<p>curl_multi_info_read(3) can be used to get information
about completed transfers. It then returns the CURLcode for
each easy transfer, to allow you to figure out success on
each individual transfer.</p>
