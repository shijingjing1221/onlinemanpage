<p>sane-fujitsu(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-fujitsu(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-fujitsu - SANE backend for Fujitsu flatbed and
ADF scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-fujitsu library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend which provides access to
most Fujitsu flatbed and ADF scanners.</p>

<p>This document describes the rewritten backend versions
1.0.21 and greater.</p>

<p>The backend supports lineart, halftone, grayscale, and
color scanning for most USB and SCSI scanners, depending on
hardware capabilities. Most simple scanning related features
are exposed. This version fea- tures at least basic support
for many more models. See KNOWN ISSUES.</p>

<p>HARDWARE SUPPORT The following scanners are thought to
have at least basic scanning capability, either because they
have been tested with a prior version, or because
documentation indicates they are compatible with a tested
model.</p>

<p>WORKGROUP SIZED SCANNERS:
-------------------------------------- SCSI: SCSI/USB: USB:
------------ ------------ ------------ M3091DC fi-4120C
fi-5110C M3092DC fi-4220C fi-5110EOX SP-93GX fi-4120C2
fi-4220C2 fi-5120C fi-5220C</p>

<p>DEPARTMENTAL SIZED SCANNERS:
-------------------------------------- SCSI: SCSI/USB:
------------ ------------ M3093GX/DG fi-4340C M3096G/GX
fi-4530C M3097G+/DG fi-5530C fi-4640S fi-4750C</p>

<p>PRODUCTION SIZED SCANNERS:
-------------------------------------- SCSI: SCSI/USB:
------------ ------------ M3099G/GH/GX fi-5650C M4097D
fi-5750C fi-4750L fi-5900C fi-4860C M4099D</p>

<p>The following scanners are known NOT to work with this
backend, either because they have a non-fujitsu chipset, or
an unsupported interface type. Some of these scanners may be
supported by another backend.</p>

<p>UNSUPPORTED SCANNERS:
-------------------------------------- SCSI: SERIAL: USB:
------------ ------------ ------------ ScanStation
M3093E/DE/EX fi-4110EOX2 ScanPartner M3096EX fi-4010CU SP-Jr
M3097E+/DE SP-10/10C M3099A/EH/EX SP-15C/300C
SP-600C/620C</p>

<p>This backend may support scanners not listed here. The
best way to determine level of support is to test the
scanner directly. Fujitsu equipment has historically been
good enough to not be damaged by incor- rect commands if the
scanner is incompatible. Please contact the author with test
results, positive or negative.</p>

<p>OPTIONS A modest effort has been made to expose the
standard options to the API. This allows a frontend to set
scanning region, resolution, bit- depth, color mode, and
enable the automatic document feeder. The fujitsu backend
supports the following basic options for most scanners:</p>

<p>source s Selects the source for the scan. Options may
include &quot;Flatbed&quot;, &quot;ADF Front&quot;,
&quot;ADF Back&quot;, &quot;ADF Duplex&quot;.</p>

<p>mode m Selects the mode for the scan. Options may
include &quot;Lineart&quot;, &quot;Halftone&quot;,
&quot;Gray&quot;, and &quot;Color&quot;.</p>

<p>resolution, y-resolution Controls scan resolution.
Setting --resolution also sets --y- resolution but not vice
versa. This behavior is overridden by some frontends.</p>

<p>tlx, tly, brx, bry Sets scan area upper left and lower
right coordinates. Often converted to t, l, x, y by frontend
code.</p>

<p>pagewidth, pageheight Sets paper size. Used by scanner
to determine centering of scan coordinates when using
ADF.</p>

<p>Other options will be available based on the
capabilities of the scan- ner. Use scanimage --help to get a
list. Be aware that some options may appear only when
another option has been set.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
&quot;fujitsu.conf&quot; is used to tell the backend how to
look for scanners, and provide options controlling the
operation of the backend. This file is read each time the
frontend asks the backend for a list of scanners, generally
only when the frontend starts. If the configuration file is
missing, the backend will use a set of compiled defaults,
which are identical to the default configuration file
shipped with SANE.</p>

<p>Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in 4
ways:</p>

<p>&quot;scsi FUJITSU&quot; Requests backend to search all
scsi busses in the system for a device which reports itself
to be a scanner made by FUJITSU.</p>

<p>&quot;scsi /dev/sg0&quot; (or other scsi device file)
Requests backend to open the named scsi device. Only useful
if you have multiple compatible scanners connected to your
system, and need to specify one. Probably should not be used
with the other &quot;scsi&quot; line above.</p>

<p>&quot;usb 0x04c5 0x1042&quot; (or other vendor/product
ids) Requests backend to search all usb busses in the system
for a device which uses that vendor and product id. The
device will then be queried to determine if it is a Fujitsu
scanner.</p>

<p>&quot;usb /dev/usb/scanner0&quot; (or other device file)
Some systems use a kernel driver to access usb scanners.
This method is untested.</p>

<p>The only configuration option supported is
&quot;buffer-size=xxx&quot;, allowing you to set the number
of bytes in the data buffer to something other than the
compiled-in default, 65536 (64K). Some users report that
their scanner will &quot;hang&quot; mid-page, or fail to
transmit the image if the buffer is not large enough.</p>

<p>Note: This option may appear multiple times in the
configuration file. It only applies to scanners discovered
by scsi/usb lines that follow this option.</p>

<p>Note: The backend does not place an upper bound on this
value, as some users required it to be quite large. Values
above the default are not recommended, and may crash your OS
or lockup your scsi card driver. You have been warned.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The backend uses a single environment
variable, SANE_DEBUG_FUJITSU, which enables debugging output
to stderr. Valid values are:</p>

<p>5 Errors 10 Function trace 15 Function detail 20 Option
commands 25 SCSI/USB trace 30 SCSI/USB detail</p>

<p>OLDER VERSIONS Backend versions prior to this were
numbered with a two part version, or with no version number
at all. At the time this version was written, all older
versions were retroactively renumbered, 1.0.2 - 1.0.20.</p>

<p>The current backend may have lost support for some
feature you were using. The last of the &quot;old&quot;
backends, 1.0.20, is still available as source from:</p>

<p>http://www2.pfeiffer.edu/~anoah/fujitsu/</p>

<p>If you find that you need to use the older version,
please contact the author, to try and get those features
restored to a later version.</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES All IPC, imprinter, and compression options
are disabled. Most scanner specific quirks are not accounted
for, making it possible to set some options in ways that the
scanner does not support. Some flatbed options are affected
by adf settings. Any model that does not support VPD during
inquiry will not function.</p>
