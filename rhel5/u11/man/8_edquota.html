<p>NAME edquota - edit user quotas</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS edquota [ -p protoname ] [ -u | -g ] [ -r ] [
-x ] [ -F format-name ] [ -f filesystem ] username...</p>

<p>edquota [ -u | -g ] [ -x ] [ -F format-name ] [ -f
filesystem ] -t</p>

<p>edquota [ -u | -g ] [ -x ] [ -F format-name ] [ -f
filesystem ] -T username | groupname...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION edquota is a quota editor. One or more users
or groups may be speci- fied on the command line. If a
number is given in the place of user/group name it is
threated as an UID/GID. For each user or group a temporary
file is created with an ASCII representation of the current
disk quotas for that user or group and an editor is then
invoked on the file. The quotas may then be modified, new
quotas added, etc. Setting a quota to zero indicates that no
quota should be imposed.</p>

<p>Users are permitted to exceed their soft limits for a
grace period that may be specified per filesystem. Once the
grace period has expired, the soft limit is enforced as a
hard limit.</p>

<p>The current usage information in the file is for
informational pur- poses; only the hard and soft limits can
be changed.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the editor, edquota reads the temporary
file and modifies the binary quota files to reflect the
changes made.</p>

<p>The editor invoked is vi(1) unless either the EDITOR or
the VISUAL environment variable specifies otherwise.</p>

<p>Only the super-user may edit quotas.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -r Edit also non-local quota use rpc.rquotad on
remote server to set quota. This option is available only if
quota tools were compiled with enabled support for setting
quotas over RPC. The -n option is equivalent, and is
maintained for backward compati- bility.</p>

<p>-u Edit the user quota. This is the default.</p>

<p>-g Edit the group quota.</p>

<p>-x Always try to translate name to id, even if it is
composed of only digits.</p>

<p>-p protoname Duplicate the quotas of the prototypical
user specified for each user specified. This is the normal
mechanism used to initialize quotas for groups of users.</p>

<p>-F format-name Edit quota for specified format (ie. don
t perform format autodetection). Possible format names are:
vfsold (version 1 quota), vfsv0 (version 2 quota), rpc
(quota over NFS), xfs (quota on XFS filesystem)</p>

<p>-f filesystem Perform specified operations only for
given filesystem (default is to perform operations for all
filesystems with quota).</p>

<p>-t Edit the soft time limits for each filesystem. In old
quota format if the time limits are zero, the default time
limits in &lt;linux/quota.h&gt; are used. In new quota
format time limits must be specified (there is no default
value set in kernel). Time units of seconds, minutes, hours,
and days are under- stood. Time limits are printed in the
greatest possible time unit such that the value is greater
than or equal to one.</p>

<p>-T Edit time for the user/group when softlimit is
enforced. Possi- ble values are unset or number and unit.
Units are the same as in -t option.</p>

<p>FILES aquota.user or aquota.group quota file at the
filesystem root (version 2 quota, non-XFS filesystems)
quota.user or quota.group quota file at the filesystem root
(version 1 quota, non-XFS filesystems) /etc/mtab mounted
filesystems table</p>
