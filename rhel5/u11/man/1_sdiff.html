<p>NAME sdiff - find differences between two files and
merge interactively</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sdiff -o outfile [options] from-file
to-file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sdiff command merges two files and
interactively outputs the results to outfile.</p>

<p>If from-file is a directory and to-file is not, sdiff
compares the file in from-file whose file name is that of
to-file, and vice versa. from- file and to-file may not both
be directories.</p>

<p>sdiff options begin with -, so normally from-file and
to-file may not begin with -. However, -- as an argument by
itself treats the remain- ing arguments as file names even
if they begin with -. You may not use - as an input
file.</p>

<p>sdiff without -o (or --output) produces a side-by-side
difference. This usage is obsolete; use diff --side-by-side
instead.</p>

<p>Options Below is a summary of all of the options that
GNU sdiff accepts. Each option has two equivalent names, one
of which is a single letter pre- ceded by -, and the other
of which is a long name preceded by --. Mul- tiple single
letter options (unless they take an argument) can be com-
bined into a single command line argument. Long named
options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their
name.</p>

<p>-a Treat all files as text and compare them
line-by-line, even if they do not appear to be text.</p>

<p>-b Ignore changes in amount of white space.</p>

<p>-B Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank
lines.</p>

<p>-d Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set of
changes. This makes sdiff slower (sometimes much
slower).</p>

<p>-H Use heuristics to speed handling of large files that
have numer- ous scattered small changes.</p>

<p>--expand-tabs Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to
preserve the alignment of tabs in the input files.</p>

<p>-i Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and
lower-case to be the same.</p>

<p>-I regexp Ignore changes that just insert or delete
lines that match reg- exp.</p>

<p>--ignore-all-space Ignore white space when comparing
lines.</p>

<p>--ignore-blank-lines Ignore changes that just insert or
delete blank lines.</p>

<p>--ignore-case Ignore changes in case; consider upper-
and lower-case to be the same.</p>

<p>--ignore-matching-lines=regexp Ignore changes that just
insert or delete lines that match reg- exp.</p>

<p>--ignore-space-change Ignore changes in amount of white
space.</p>

<p>-l --left-column Print only the left column of two
common lines.</p>

<p>--minimal Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller
set of changes. This makes sdiff slower (sometimes much
slower).</p>

<p>-o file --output=file Put merged output into file. This
option is required for merg- ing.</p>

<p>-s --suppress-common-lines Do not print common
lines.</p>

<p>--speed-large-files Use heuristics to speed handling of
large files that have numer- ous scattered small
changes.</p>

<p>-t Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the
alignment of tabs in the input files.</p>

<p>--text Treat all files as text and compare them
line-by-line, even if they do not appear to be text.</p>

<p>-v --version Output the version number of sdiff.</p>

<p>-w columns --width=columns Use an output width of
columns. Note that for historical rea- sons, this option is
-W in diff, -w in sdiff.</p>

<p>-W Ignore horizontal white space when comparing lines.
Note that for historical reasons, this option is -w in diff,
-W in sdiff.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO cmp(1), comm(1), diff(1), diff3(1).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS An exit status of 0 means no differences
were found, 1 means some dif- ferences were found, and 2
means trouble.</p>
