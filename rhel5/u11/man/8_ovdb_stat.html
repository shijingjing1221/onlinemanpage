<p>OVDB_STAT(8) InterNetNews Documentation OVDB_STAT(8)</p>

<p>NAME ovdb_stat - Display information from the ovdb
database</p>

<p>SYNOPSYS ovdb_stat -Hgci [-r artnumrange] newsgroup
[newsgroup ...]</p>

<p>ovdb_stat -Hklmtv [-d database]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ovdb_stat displays information from the ovdb
database: BerkeleyDB statistics, newsgroup data, and
overview records; and optionally out- puts in HTML
format.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -g Newsgroup himark, lowmark, article count, and
flag for the given newsgroups (as stored in the ovdb
&quot;groupinfo&quot; database) are dis- played.</p>

<p>-c Similar to -g, except the himark, lowmark, and count
are calculated by actually scanning the overview records and
counting them. This can be a lengthy operation on groups
with lots of articles.</p>

<p>-i Internal data regarding the given newsgroups are
displayed.</p>

<p>-r artnumrange Overview records are retrieved. The
artnumrange parameter may be a single article number, or a
range of articles in the format &quot;low-hi&quot;.</p>

<p>-H Output is presented in HTML format.</p>

<p>-k Displays lock region statistics, as returned by the
BerkeleyDB lock_stat() call.</p>

<p>-l Displays log region statistics, as returned by the
BerkeleyDB log_stat() call.</p>

<p>-m Displays global memory pool statistics, as returned
by the Berke- leyDB memp_stat() call.</p>

<p>-M Same as -m, and also displays memory pool statistics
for each database file.</p>

<p>-t Displays log region statistics, as returned by the
BerkeleyDB txn_stat() call.</p>

<p>-v Displays ovdb version, and BerkeleyDB version.</p>

<p>-d database Displays information about the given
database, as returned by the BerkeleyDB db-&gt;stat() call.
This operation may take a long time on busy systems (several
minutes or more).</p>

<p>WARNINGS ovdb_stat may be safely killed with the INT,
TERM, or HUP signals. It catches those signals and exits
cleanly. Do not kill ovdb_stat with other signals, unless
absolutely necessary, because it may leave stale locks in
the DB environment.</p>
