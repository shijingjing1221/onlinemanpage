<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) LIBMNG(3)
LIBMNG(3)</p>

<p>NAME libmng - Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG)
Reference Library 1.0.9</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS</p>

<p>#include &lt;libmng.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The libmng library supports decoding,
displaying, encoding, and various other manipulations of the
Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG) format image files. It
uses the zlib(3) compression library, and optionally the
JPEG library by the Independant JPEG Group (IJG) and/or lcms
(lit- tle cms), a color-management library by Marti Maria
Saguer.</p>

<p>I. Introduction This file describes how to use and
modify the MNG reference library (known as libmng) for your
own use. There are seven sections to this file:
introduction, callbacks, housekeeping, reading, displaying,
writ- ing, and modification and configuration notes for
various special plat- forms. We assume that libmng is
already installed; see the INSTALL.README file for
instructions on how to install libmng.</p>

<p>Libmng was written to support and promote the MNG
specification.</p>

<p>The MNG-1.0 specification is available at
&lt;http://www.libpng.org/pub/mng/spec/&gt;.</p>

<p>Other information about MNG can be found at the MNG home
page, &lt;http://www.libpng.org/pub/mng/&gt;. The latest
version of libmng can be found at its own homepage at
&lt;http://www.libmng.com/&gt;.</p>

<p>In most cases the library will not need to be changed.
For standard- ization purposes the library contains both a
Windows DLL and a makefile for building a shared library
(SO). The library is written in C, but an interface for
Borland Delphi is also available.</p>

<p>Libmng has been designed to handle multiple sessions at
one time, to be easily modifiable, to be portable to the
vast majority of machines (ANSI, K&amp;R, 32-, and 64-bit)
available, and to be easy to use.</p>

<p>Libmng uses zlib for its compression and decompression
of MNG files. Further information about zlib, and the latest
version of zlib, can be found at the zlib home page,
&lt;http://www.zlib.org/&gt;. The zlib compres- sion utility
is a general purpose utility that is useful for more than
MNG/PNG files, and can be used without libmng. See the
documentation delivered with zlib for more details.</p>

<p>Libmng optionally uses the JPEG library by the
Independant JPEG Group (IJG). This library is used for the
JNG sub-format, which is part of the MNG specification, and
allows for inclusion of JPEG decoded and thus highly
compressed (photographic) images. Further information about
the IJG JPEG library and the latest sources can be found at
&lt;http://www.ijg.org/&gt;.</p>

<p>Libmng can also optionally use the lcms (little CMS)
library by Marti Maria Saguer. This library provides an
excellent color-management sys- tem (CMS), which gives
libmng the ability to provide full color- correction for
images with the proper color-information encoded. Fur- ther
information and the latest sources can be found at
&lt;http://www.littlecms.com/&gt;.</p>

<p>Libmng is thread safe, provided the threads are using
different handles as returned by the initialization call.
Each thread should have its own handle and thus its own
image. Libmng does not protect itself against two threads
using the same instance of a handle.</p>

<p>The libmng.h header file is the single reference needed
for programming with libmng:</p>

<p>#include &lt;libmng.h&gt;</p>

<p>II. Callbacks Libmng makes extensive use of callback
functions. This is meant to keep the library as
platform-independant and flexible as possible. Actu- ally,
the first call you will make to the library, already
contains three parameters you can use to provide callback
entry-points.</p>

<p>Most functions must return a mng_bool (boolean).
Returning MNG_FALSE indicates the library the callback
failed in some way and the library will immediately return
from whatever it was doing back to the applica- tion.
Returning MNG_TRUE indicates there were no problems and
process- ing can continue.</p>

<p>Let s step through each of the possible callbacks. The
sections on reading, displaying and writing will also
explain which callbacks are needed when and where.</p>

<p>- mng_ptr mng_memalloc (mng_size_t iLen)</p>

<p>A very basic function which the library uses to allocate
a memory-block with the given size. A typical implementation
would be:</p>

<p>mng_ptr my_alloc (mng_size_t iLen) { return calloc (1,
iLen); }</p>

<p>Note that the library requires you to zero-out the
memory-block!!!</p>

<p>- void mng_memfree (mng_ptr pPtr, mng_size_t iLen)</p>

<p>Counterpart of the previous function. Typically:</p>

<p>void my_free (mng_ptr pPtr, mng_size_t iLen) { free
(pPtr); }</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_openstream (mng_handle hHandle)</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_closestream (mng_handle hHandle)</p>

<p>These are called by the library just before it starts to
process (either read or write) a file and just after the
processing stops. This is the recommended place to do I/O
initialization &amp; finalization. Whether you do or not, is
up to you. The library does not put any mean- ing into the
calls. They are simply provided for your convenience.</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_readdata (mng_handle hHandle, mng_ptr
pBuf, mng_uint32 iBuflen, mng_uint32p pRead)</p>

<p>This function is called when the library needs some more
input while reading an image. The reading process supports
two modes: Suspension- mode (SMOD) and non-suspension-mode
(NSMOD). See mng_set_suspension- mode() for a more detailed
description.</p>

<p>In NSMOD, the library requires you to return exactly the
amount of bytes requested (= iBuflen). Any lesser amount
indicates the input file is exhausted and the library will
return a MNG_UNEXPECTEDEOF errorcode.</p>

<p>In SMOD, you may return a smaller amount of bytes than
requested. This tells the library it should temporarily wait
for more input to arrive. The lib will return with
MNG_NEEDMOREDATA, and will expect a call to
mng_read_resume() or mng_display_resume() next, as soon as
more input- data has arrived.</p>

<p>For NSMOD this function could be as simple as:</p>

<p>mng_bool my_read (mng_handle hHandle, mng_ptr pBuf,
mng_uint32 iBuflen, mng_uint32p pRead) { *pRead = fread
(pBuf, 1, iBuflen, myfile); return MNG_TRUE; }</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_writedata (mng_handle hHandle, mng_ptr
pBuf, mng_uint32 iBuflen, mng_uint32p pWritten)</p>

<p>This function is called during the mng_write() function
to actually output data to the file. There is no
suspension-mode during write, so the application must return
the exact number of bytes the library requests to be
written.</p>

<p>A typical implementation could be:</p>

<p>mng_bool my_write (mng_handle hHandle, mng_ptr pBuf,
mng_uint32 iBuflen, mng_uint32p pWritten) { *pWritten =
fwrite (pBuf, 1, iBuflen, myfile); return MNG_TRUE; }</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_errorproc (mng_handle hHandle, mng_int32
iErrorcode, mng_int8 iSeverity, mng_chunkid iChunkname,
mng_uint32 iChunkseq, mng_int32 iExtra1, mng_int32 iExtra2,
mng_pchar zErrortext)</p>

<p>This function is called whenever an error is detected
inside the library. This may be caused by invalid input,
callbacks indicating failure, or wrongfully calling
functions out of place.</p>

<p>If you do not provide this callback the library will
still return an errorcode from the called function, and the
mng_getlasterror() function can be used to retrieve the
other parameters.</p>

<p>This function is currently only provided for
convenience, but may at some point be used to indicate
certain errors may be acceptable, and processing should
continue.</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_traceproc (mng_handle hHandle, mng_int32
iFuncnr, mng_int32 iFuncseq, mng_pchar zFuncname)</p>

<p>This function is provided to allow a functional analysis
of the library. This may be useful if you encounter certain
errors and cannot determine what the problem is.</p>

<p>Almost all functions inside the library will activate
this callback with an appropriate function-name at the start
and end of the function. Please note that large images may
generate an enormous amount of calls.</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_processheader (mng_handle hHandle,
mng_uint32 iWidth, mng_uint32 iHeight)</p>

<p>This function is called once the header information of
an input- image has been processed. At this point the image
dimensions are available and also some other properties
depending on the type of the image. Eg. for a MNG the
frame-/layercount, playtime &amp; simplicity fields are
known.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of this callback is to inform the
application of the size of the image, and for the
application to initialize the draw- ing canvas to be used by
the library. This is also a good point to set the
canvas-style. Eg. mng_set_canvasstyle().</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_processtext (mng_handle hHandle,
mng_uint8 iType, mng_pchar zKeyword, mng_pchar zText,
mng_pchar zLanguage, mng_pchar zTranslation)</p>

<p>This callback is activated for each textual chunk in the
input- image. These are tEXt, zTXt &amp; iTXt. It may be
used to retain specific comments for presentation to the
user.</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_processsave (mng_handle hHandle)</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_processseek (mng_handle hHandle,
mng_pchar zName)</p>

<p>The purpose of these callbacks is to signal the
processing of the SAVE &amp; SEEK chunks in a MNG
input-file. This may be used in the future to specify some
special processing. At the moment these functions are only
provided as a signal.</p>

<p>- mng_ptr mng_getcanvasline (mng_handle hHandle,
mng_uint32 iLinenr)</p>

<p>- mng_ptr mng_getbkgdline (mng_handle hHandle,
mng_uint32 iLinenr)</p>

<p>- mng_ptr mng_getalphaline (mng_handle hHandle,
mng_uint32 iLinenr)</p>

<p>These callbacks are used to access the drawing canvas,
background can- vas and an optional separate alpha-channel
canvas. The latter is used only with the MNG_CANVAS_RGB8_A8
canvas-style.</p>

<p>If the getbkgdline() callback is not supplied the
library will compos- ite fully or partially transparent
pixels in the image against a speci- fied background color.
See mng_set_bgcolor() for more details. If a chosen
canvas-style includes an alpha-channel, this callback is
very likely not needed.</p>

<p>The application is responsible for returning a pointer
to a line of pixels, which should be in the exact format as
defined by the call to mng_set_canvasstyle() and
mng_set_bkgdstyle(), without gaps between the representation
of each pixel, unless specified by the canvas-style.</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_refresh (mng_handle hHandle, mng_uint32
iX, mng_uint32 iY, mng_uint32 iWidth, mng_uint32
iHeight)</p>

<p>This callback is called when the library has drawn a
complete frame onto the drawing canvas, and it is ready to
be displayed. The applica- tion is responsible for
transferring the drawing canvas from memory onto the actual
output device.</p>

<p>- mng_uint32 mng_gettickcount (mng_handle hHandle)</p>

<p>This function should return the number of milliseconds
on some internal clock. The entire animation timing depends
heavily on this function, and the number returned should be
as accurate as possible.</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_settimer (mng_handle hHandle, mng_uint32
iMsecs)</p>

<p>This callback is activated every time the library
requires a &quot;pause&quot;. Note that the function itself
should NOT execute the wait. It should simply store the
time-field and allow the library to return. Libmng will
return with the MNG_NEEDTIMERWAIT code, indicating the
callback was called and it is now time to execute the
pause.</p>

<p>After the indicated number of milliseconds have elapsed,
the applica- tion should call mng_display_resume(), to
resume the animation as planned.</p>

<p>This method allows for both a real timer or a simple
wait command in the application. Whichever method you
select, both the gettickcount() and settimer() callbacks are
crucial for proper animation timing.</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_processgamma (mng_handle hHandle,
mng_uint32 iGamma)</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_processchroma (mng_handle hHandle,
mng_uint32 iWhitepointx, mng_uint32 iWhitepointy, mng_uint32
iRedx, mng_uint32 iRedy, mng_uint32 iGreenx, mng_uint32
iGreeny, mng_uint32 iBluex, mng_uint32 iBluey)</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_processsrgb (mng_handle hHandle,
mng_uint8 iRenderingintent)</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_processiccp (mng_handle hHandle,
mng_uint32 iProfilesize, mng_ptr pProfile)</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_processarow (mng_handle hHandle,
mng_uint32 iRowsamples, mng_bool bIsRGBA16, mng_ptr
pRow)</p>

<p>These callbacks are only required when you selected the
MNG_APP_CMS directive during compilation of the library. See
the configuration sec- tion for more details.</p>

<p>- mng_bool mng_iteratechunk (mng_handle hHandle,
mng_handle hChunk, mng_chunkid iChunkid, mng_uint32
iChunkseq)</p>

<p>This callback is only used for the mng_iterate_chunks()
function. It is called exactly once for each chunk
stored.</p>

<p>III. Housekeeping Memory management The library can use
internal memory allocation/deallocation or use pro- vided
callbacks for its memory management. The choice is made at
compi- lation time. See the section on customization for
details.</p>

<p>If internal management has been selected, the memory
callback functions need not be supplied. Even if you do
supply them they will not be used. The actual code used is
similar to the code discussed in the callback section:</p>

<p>pPtr = calloc (1, iLen);</p>

<p>free (pPtr);</p>

<p>If your compiler does not support these functions, or
you wish to moni- tor the librarys use of memory for certain
reasons, you can choose to compile the library with external
memory management. In this case the memory callback
functions MUST be supplied, and should function as if the
above code was used.</p>

<p>Initialization The basic initialization of the library
is short and swift:</p>

<p>myhandle = mng_initialize (myuserdata, my_alloc,
my_free, MNG_NULL); if (myhandle == MNG_NULL) /* process
error */;</p>

<p>The first field is an application-only parameter. It is
saved in libmng s internal structures and available at all
times through the mng_get_userdata() function. This is
especially handy in callback func- tions if your program may
be handling multiple files at the same time.</p>

<p>The second and third field supply the library with the
memory callback function entry-points. These are described
in more detail in the call- back section and the previous
paragraph.</p>

<p>The fourth and last field may be used to supply the
library with the entry-point of a trace callback function.
For regular use you will not need this!</p>

<p>The function returns a handle which will be your ticket
to MNG-heaven. All other functions rely on this handle. It
is the single fixed unique reference-point between your
application and the library.</p>

<p>You should call the initialization function for each
image you wish to process simultaneously. If you are
processing images consecutively, you can reset the internal
status of the library with the mng_reset() function. This
function will clear all internal state variables, free any
stored chunks and/or objects, etc, etc. Your callbacks and
other external parameters will be retained.</p>

<p>After you successfully received the handle it is time to
set the required callbacks. The sections on reading,
displaying &amp; writing indi- cate which callbacks are
required and which are optional. To set the callbacks simply
do:</p>

<p>myretcode = mng_setcb_xxxxxx (myhandle, my_xxxxxx); if
(myretcode != MNG_NOERROR) /* process error */;</p>

<p>Naturally you d replace the x s with the name of the
callback.</p>

<p>Cleanup Once youve gotten hold of that precious
mng_handle, you should always, and I mean always, call the
cleanup function when youre done. Just do:</p>

<p>mng_cleanup (myhandle);</p>

<p>And youre done. There shouldnt be an ounce of memory
spilled after that call.</p>

<p>Note that if you would like to process multiple files
consecutively you do not need to do mng_cleanup() /
mng_initialize() between each file but simply</p>

<p>myretcode = mng_reset (myhandle); if (myretcode !=
MNG_NOERROR) /* process error */;</p>

<p>will suffice. Saves some time and effort, that.</p>

<p>Error handling From the examples in the previous
paragraphs you may have noticed a meticulous scheme for
error handling. And yes, that s exactly what it is.
Practically each call simply returns an errorcode,
indicating suc- cess, eg. MNG_NOERROR or failure, anything
else but MNG_NEEDMOREDATA and MNG_NEEDTIMERWAIT. These
latter two will be discussed in more detail in their
respective fields of interest: the reading section and
displaying section respectively.</p>

<p>It is the application s responsibility to check the
returncode after each call. You can call mng_getlasterror()
to receive the details of the last detected error. This even
includes a discriptive error-message if you enabled that
option during compilation of the library.</p>

<p>Note that after receiving an error it is still possible
to call the library, but its also very likely that any
following call will fail. The only functions deemed to work
will be mng_reset() and mng_cleanup(). Yes, if you abort
your program after an error, you should still call
mng_cleanup().</p>

<p>IV. Reading Reading a MNG, JNG or PNG is fairly easy. It
depends slightly on your ultimate goal how certain specifics
are to be handled, but the basics are similar in all
cases.</p>

<p>For the read functioins to work you must have compiled
the library with the MNG_READ_SUPPRT directive. The standard
DLL and Shared Library have this on by default!</p>

<p>Setup Naturally you must have initialized the library
and be the owner of a mng_handle. The following callbacks
are essential:</p>

<p>mng_openstream, mng_readdata, mng_closestream</p>

<p>You may optionally define:</p>

<p>mng_errorproc, mng_traceproc mng_processheader,
mng_processtext mng_processsave, mng_processseek</p>

<p>The reading bit will also fail if you are already
creating or display- ing a file. Seems a bit obvious, but I
thought Id mention it, just in case.</p>

<p>To suspend or not to suspend There is one choice you
need to make before calling the read function. Are you in
need of suspension-mode or not?</p>

<p>If youre reading from a disk you most certainly do not
need suspen- sion-mode. Even the oldest and slowest of disks
will be fast enough for straight reading.</p>

<p>However, if your input comes from a really slow device,
such as a dialup-line or the likes, you may opt for
suspension-mode. This is done by calling</p>

<p>myretcode = mng_set_suspensionmode (myhandle, MNG_TRUE);
if (myretcode != MNG_NOERROR) /* process error */;</p>

<p>Suspension-mode will force the library to use special
buffering on the input. This allows your application to
receive data of arbitrarily length and return this in the
mng_readdata() callback, without disturb- ing the chunk
processing routines of the library.</p>

<p>Suspension-mode does require a little extra care in the
main logic of the application. The read function may return
with MNG_NEEDMOREDATA when the mng_readdata() callback
returns less data then it needs to process the next chunk.
This indicates the application to wait for more data to
arrive and then resume processing by calling
mng_read_resume().</p>

<p>The read HLAPI The actual reading is just plain simple.
Since all I/O is done outside the library through the
callbacks, the library can focus on its real task.
Understanding, checking and labelling the input data!</p>

<p>All you really need to do is this:</p>

<p>myretcode = mng_read (myhandle); if (myretcode !=
MNG_NOERROR) /* process error */;</p>

<p>Of course, if youre on suspension-mode the code is a
little more complicated:</p>

<p>myretcode = mng_read (myhandle);</p>

<p>while (myretcode == MNG_NEEDMOREDATA) { /* wait for
input-data to arrive */ myretcode = mng_read_resume
(myhandle); }</p>

<p>if (myretcode != MNG_NOERROR) /* process error */;</p>

<p>This is rather crude and more sophisticated programming
methods may dictate another approach. Whatever method you
decide on, it should act as if the above code was in its
place.</p>

<p>There is also the mng_readdisplay() function, but this
is discussed in the displaying section. It functions pretty
much as the mng_read() function, but also immediately starts
displaying the image. mng_read_resume() should be replaced
by mng_display_resume() in that case!</p>

<p>What happens inside What actually happens inside the
library depends on the configuration options set during the
compilation of the library.</p>

<p>Basically the library will first read the 8-byte file
header, to deter- mine its validity and the type of image it
is about to process. Then it will repeatedly read a 4-byte
chunk-length and then the remainder of the chunk until it
either reaches EOF (indicated by the mng_readdata()
callback) or implicitly decides EOF as it processed the
logically last chunk of the image.</p>

<p>Applications that require strict conformity and do not
allow superflu- ous data after the ending chunk, will need
to perform this check in their mng_closestream()
callback.</p>

<p>Each chunk is then checked on CRC, after which it is
handed over to the appropriate chunk processing routine.
These routines will disect the chunk, check the validity of
its contents, check its position with respect to other
chunks, etc, etc.</p>

<p>If everything checks out, the chunk is further processed
as follows:</p>

<p>If display support has been selected during compilation,
certain pre- display initialization will take place.</p>

<p>If chunk-storage support has been selected during
compilation, the chunks data may be stored in a special
internal structure and held for future reference.</p>

<p>Storing and accessing chunks One of the compilation
options activates support for chunk storage. This option may
be useful if you want to examine an image. The direc- tive
is MNG_STORE_CHUNKS. You must also turn on the
MNG_ACCESS_CHUNKS directive.</p>

<p>The actual storage facility can be turned on or off with
the mng_set_storechunks() function. If set to MNG_TRUE,
chunks will be stored as they are read.</p>

<p>At any point you can then call the mng_iterate_chunks()
function to iterate through the current list of chunks. This
function requires a callback which is called for each chunk
and receives a specific chunk- handle. This chunk-handle can
be used to call the appropriate mng_getchunk_xxxx()
function, to access the chunks properties.</p>

<p>A typical implementation may look like this:</p>

<p>mng_bool my_iteratechunk (mng_handle hHandle, mng_handle
hChunk, mng_chunkid iChunkid, mng_uint32 iChunkseq) { switch
(iChunkid) { case MNG_UINT_MHDR : { /* process MHDR */;
break; } case MNG_UINT_FRAM : { /* process FRAM */; break;
}</p>

<p>...etc...</p>

<p>case MNG_UINT_HUH : { /* unknown chunk */; break; }
default : { /* duh; forgot one */; } }</p>

<p>return MNG_TRUE; /* keepm coming */ }</p>

<p>To get to the actual chunk fields of lets say a SHOW
chunk you would do:</p>

<p>mng_bool isempty; mng_uint16 firstid, lastid; mng_uint8
showmode;</p>

<p>myretcode mng_getchunk_show (hHandle, hChunk, isempty,
firstid, lastid, showmode); if (myretcode != MNG_NOERROR) /*
process error */;</p>

<p>V. Displaying Setup Assuming you have initialized the
library and are the owner of a mng_handle. The following
callbacks are essential:</p>

<p>mng_getcanvasline, mng_refresh mng_gettickcount,
mng_settimer</p>

<p>If you wish to use an application supplied background
you must supply:</p>

<p>mng_getbkgdline</p>

<p>If you wish to use the MNG_CANVAS_RGB8_A8 canvas style
you must supply:</p>

<p>mng_getalphaline</p>

<p>You may optionally define:</p>

<p>mng_errorproc, mng_traceproc mng_processheader,
mng_processtext mng_processsave, mng_processseek</p>

<p>Note that the mng_processheader() callback is optional
but will be quite significant for proper operation!</p>

<p>Displaying an image will fail if you are creating a file
or already displaying one. Yes, you cant display it
twice!</p>

<p>A word on canvas styles The canvas style describes how
your drawing canvas is made up. You must set this before the
library actually starts drawing, so the mng_processheader()
callback is a pretty good place for it.</p>

<p>Currently only 8-bit RGB canvas styles are supported,
either with or without an alpha channel.</p>

<p>If you like to do alpha composition yourself you can
select one of the canvas styles that include an alpha
channel. You can even have a sepa- rate alpha canvas by
selecting the MNG_CANVAS_RGB8_A8 style.</p>

<p>All styles require a compact model. Eg. MNG_CANVAS_BGR8
requires your canvas lines in bgrbgrbgr... storage, where
each letter represents an 8-bit value of the corresponding
color, and each threesome makes up the values of one(1)
pixel.</p>

<p>The library processes a line at a time, so the canvas
lines do not actually need to be consecutive in memory.</p>

<p>Alpha composition and application backgrounds All
Network Graphics can be partially transparent. This requires
spe- cial processing if you need to display an image against
some back- ground. Note that the MNG header (MHDR chunk)
contains a simplicity field indicating whether transparency
information in the file is criti- cal or not. This only
applies to embedded images, which means the full image-frame
of the MNG may still contain fully transparent pixels!</p>

<p>Depending on your needs you can supply a single
background color, a background canvas or tell the library to
return the alpha-channel and do alpha composition
yourself.</p>

<p>This is different from the BACK chunk in a MNG, or the
bKGD chunk in an (embedded) PNG or JNG. The BACK chunk
indicates an optional or manda- tory background color and/or
image. The bKGD chunk only indicates an optional background
color. These chunks indicate the Authors prefer- ences. They
may be absent in which case you need to supply some sort of
background yourself.</p>

<p>Composing against a background color This is the easiest
method. Call the mng_set_bgcolor() function to set the
values of the red, green and blue component of your
preferred back- ground color.</p>

<p>Use one of the canvas styles that do not have an
alpha-channel, and which matches your output
requirements.</p>

<p>Composing against a background canvas This is somewhat
more complicated. You will need to set the mng_get-
bkgdline() callback. This will be called whenever the
library needs to compose a partially transparent line.</p>

<p>This canvas must hold the background against which the
image should be composed. Its size must match exactly with
the image dimensions and thus the drawing canvas!</p>

<p>Use one of the canvas styles that do not have an
alpha-channel, and which matches your output requirements.
The canvas style of the back- ground canvas may even differ
from the drawing canvas. The librarys composing will still
function properly.</p>

<p>Composing within the application If you have the option
in your application to draw a (partially) trans- parent
canvas to the output device, this option is preferred.</p>

<p>Select one of the canvas styles that do have an
alpha-channel. The library will now supply the appropriate
alpha information, allowing the application to compose the
image as it sees fit.</p>

<p>Color information and CMS Network Graphics may, and
usually will, contain color-correction infor- mation. This
information is intended to compensate for the difference in
recording and display devices used.</p>

<p>This document does not address the specifics of
color-management. See the PNG specification for a more
detailed description.</p>

<p>Using little cms by Marti Maria Saguer This is the
easiest method, providing you can compile the lcms package.
Select the MNG_FULL_CMS directive during compilation, and
sit back and relax. The library will take care of all
color-correction for you.</p>

<p>Using an OS- or application-supplied CMS If you are so
lucky to have access to CMS functionality from within your
application, you may instruct the library to leave
color-correc- tion to you.</p>

<p>Select the MNG_APP_CMS directive during compilation of
the library. You MUST also set the following callbacks:</p>

<p>mng_processgamma, mng_processchroma, mng_processsrgb,
mng_processiccp and mng_processarow</p>

<p>The last callback is called when the library needs you
to correct an arbitrary line of pixels. The other callbacks
are called when the cor- responding color-information is
encountered in the file. You must store this information
somewhere for use in the mng_processarow() call- back.</p>

<p>Using gamma-only correction This isn t a preferred
method, but its better than no correction at all. Gamma-only
correction will at least compensate for gamma-differ- ences
between the original recorder and your output device.</p>

<p>Select the MNG_GAMMA_ONLY directive during compilation
of the library. Your compiler MUST support fp
operations.</p>

<p>No color correction Ouch. This is really bad. This is
the least preferred method, but may be necessary if your
system cannot use lcms, doesn t have its own CMS, and does
not allow fp operations, ruling out the gamma-only
option.</p>

<p>Select the MNG_NO_CMS directive during compilation.

<p>Animations and timing Animations require some form of
timing support. The library relies on two callbacks for this
purpose. The mng_gettickcount() and mng_set- timer()
callbacks. mng_gettickcount() is used to determine the
passing of time in milliseconds since the beginning of the
animation. This is also used to compensate during
suspension-mode if you are using the mng_readdisplay()
function to read &amp; display the file simultaneously.</p>

<p>The callback may return an arbitrary number of
milliseconds, but this number must increase proportionaly
between calls. Most modern systems will have some
tickcount() function which derives its input from an
internal clock. The value returned from this function is
more than ade- quate for libmng.</p>

<p>The mng_settimer() callback is called when the library
determines a little &quot;pause&quot; is required before
rendering another frame of the anima- tion. The pause
interval is also expressed in milliseconds. Your application
should store this value and return immediately. The library
will then make appropriate arrangements to store its
internal state and returns to your application with the
MNG_NEEDTIMERWAIT code.</p>

<p>At that point you should suspend processing and wait the
given inter- val. Please use your OS features for this. Do
not engage some sort of loop. That is real bad programming
practice. Most modern systems will have some timing
functions. A simple wait() function may suffice, but this
may prevent your applications main-task from running, and
possibly prevent the actual update of your output
device.</p>

<p>The mng_refresh() callback The mng_refresh() callback is
called whenever the library has &quot;fin- ished&quot;
drawing a new frame onto your canvas, and just before it
will call the mng_settimer() callback.</p>

<p>This allows you to perform some actions necessary to
&quot;refresh&quot; the can- vas onto your output device.
Please do NOT suspend processing inside this callback. This
must be handled after the mng_settimer() callback!</p>

<p>Displaying while reading This method is preferred if you
are reading from a slow input device (such as a dialup-line)
and you wish to start displaying something as quickly as
possible. This functionality is provided mainly for browser-
type applications but may be appropriate for other
applications as well.</p>

<p>The method is usually used in unison with the
suspension-mode of the read module. A typical implementation
would look like this:</p>

<p>/* initiale library and set required callbacks */</p>

<p>/* activate suspension-mode */ myretcode =
mng_set_suspensionmode (myhandle, MNG_TRUE); if (myretcode
!= MNG_NOERROR) /* process error */;</p>

<p>myretcode = mng_readdisplay (myhandle);</p>

<p>while ((myretcode == MNG_NEEDMOREDATA) || (myretcode ==
MNG_NEEDTIMERWAIT)) { if (myretcode == MNG_NEEDMOREDATA) /*
wait for more input-data */; else /* wait for timer interval
*/;</p>

<p>myretcode = mng_display_resume (myhandle); }</p>

<p>if (myretcode != MNG_NOERROR) /* process error */;</p>

<p>More advanced programming methods may require a
different approach, but the final result should function as
in the code above.</p>

<p>Displaying after reading This method is used to display
a file that was previously read. It is primarily meant for
viewers with direct file access, such as 1a local
harddisk.</p>

<p>Once you have successfully read the file, all you need
to do is:</p>

<p>myretcode = mng_display (myhandle);</p>

<p>while (myretcode == MNG_NEEDTIMERWAIT) { /* wait for
timer interval */; myretcode = mng_display_resume
(myhandle); }</p>

<p>if (myretcode != MNG_NOERROR) /* process error */;</p>

<p>Again, more advanced programming methods may require a
different approach, but the final result should function as
in the code above.</p>

<p>Display manipulation Several HLAPI functions are
provided to allow a user to manipulate the normal flow of an
animation.</p>

<p>- mng_display_freeze (mng_handle hHandle)</p>

<p>This will &quot;freeze&quot; the animation in place.</p>

<p>- mng_display_resume (mng_handle hHandle)</p>

<p>This function can be used to resume a frozen animation,
or to force the library to advance the animation to the next
frame.</p>

<p>- mng_display_reset (mng_handle hHandle)</p>

<p>This function will &quot;reset&quot; the animation into
its pristine state. Calling mng_display() afterwards will
re-display the animation from the first frame.</p>

<p>- mng_display_golayer (mng_handle hHandle, mng_uint32
iLayer)</p>

<p>- mng_display_goframe (mng_handle hHandle, mng_uint32
iFrame)</p>

<p>- mng_display_gotime (mng_handle hHandle, mng_uint32
iPlaytime)</p>

<p>These three functions can be used to &quot;jump&quot; to
a specific layer, frame or timeslot in the animation. You
must &quot;freeze&quot; the animation before using any of
these functions.</p>

<p>All above functions may only be called during a timer
interval! It is the applications responsibility to cleanup
any resources with respect to the timer wait.</p>

<p>VI. Writing The main focus of the library lies in its
displaying capabilites. But it does offer writing support as
well. You can create and write a file, or you can write a
file you have previously read, providing the storage of
chunks was enabled and active.</p>

<p>For this to work you must have compiled the library with
the MNG_WRITE_SUPPO1RT and MNG_ACCESS_CHUNKS directives. The
standard DLL and Shared Library have this on by default!</p>

<p>Setup As always you must have initialized the library
and be the owner of a mng_handle. The following callbacks
are essential:</p>

<p>mng_openstream, mng_writedata, mng_closestream</p>

<p>You can optionally define:</p>

<p>mng_errorproc, mng_traceproc</p>

<p>The creation and writing functions will fail if you are
in the middle of reading, creating or writing a file.</p>

<p>Creating a new file To start a new file the library must
be in its initial state. First you need to tell the library
your intentions:</p>

<p>myretcode = mng_create (myhandle); if (myretcode !=
MNG_NOERROR) /* process error */;</p>

<p>After that you start adding the appropriate chunks:</p>

<p>myretcode = mng_put1chunk_mhdr (myhandle, ...); if
(myretcode != MNG_NOERROR) /* process error */;</p>

<p>And so on, and so forth. Note that the library will
automatically sig- nal the logical end of the file by the
ending chunk. Also the first chunk will indicate the library
the filetype (eg. PNG, JNG or MNG) and force the proper
signature when writing the file.</p>

<p>The code above can be simplified, as you can always get
the last error- code by using the mng_getlasterror()
function:</p>

<p>if ( (mng_putchunk_xxxx (myhandle, ...)) or
(mng_putchunk_xxxx (myhandle, ...)) or ...etc... ) /*
process error */;</p>

<p>Please note that you must have a pretty good
understanding of the chunk specification. Unlike the read
functions, there are virtually no checks, so it is quite
possible to write completely wrong files. It is a good
practice to read back your file into the library to verify
its integrity.</p>

<p>Once youve got all the chunks added, all you do is:</p>

<p>myretcode mng_write (myhandle); if (myretcode !=
MNG_NOERROR) /* process error */;</p>

<p>And presto. Youre done. The real work is of course
carried out in your callbacks. Note that this is a single
operation as opposed to the read &amp; display functions
that may return with MNG_NEEDMOREDATA and/or
MNG_NEEDTIMERWAIT. The write function just does the job, and
only returns after it s finished or if it encounters some
unrecoverable error.</p>

<p>Writing a previously read file If you have already
successfully read a file, you can use the library to write
it out as a copy or something. You MUST have compiled the
library with the MNG_STORE_CHUNKS directive, and you must
have done mng_set_storechunks (myhandle, MNG_TRUE).</p>

<p>This doesn t require the MNG_ACCESS_CHUNKS directive,
unless you want to fiddle with the chunks as well.</p>

<p>Again all you need to do is:</p>

<p>myretcode mng_write (myhandle); if (myretcode !=
MNG_NOERROR) /* process error */;</p>

<p>Remarks Parts of this software have been adapted from
the libpng library. Although this library supports all
features from the PNG specification (as MNG descends from
it) it does not require the libpng library. It does require
the zlib library and optionally the IJG JPEG library, and/or
the &quot;little-cms&quot; library by Marti Maria Saguer
(depending on the inclusion of support for JNG and
Full-Color-Management respectively.</p>

<p>This librarys function is primarily to read and display
MNG anima- tions. It is not meant as a full-featured
image-editing component! It does however offer creation and
editing functionality at the chunk level. (future
modifications may include some more support for creation and
or editing)</p>
