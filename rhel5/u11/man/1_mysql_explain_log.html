MYSQL_EXPLAIN_LOG(1)</p>

<p>NAME mysql_explain_log - use EXPLAIN on statements in
query log</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysql_explain_log [options] &lt; log_file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mysql_explain_log reads its standard input
for query log contents. It uses EXPLAIN to analyze SELECT
statements found in the input. UPDATE statements are
rewritten to SELECT statements and also analyzed with
EXPLAIN. mysql_explain_log then displays a summary of its
results.</p>

<p>The results may assist you in determining which queries
result in table scans and where it would be beneficial to
add indexes to your tables.</p>

<p>Invoke mysql_explain_log like this, where log_file
contains all or part of a MySQL query log:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql_explain_log [options] &lt; log_file</p>
