<p>NAME iswpunct - test for punctuation or symbolic wide
character</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;</p>

<p>int iswpunct(wint_t wc);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The iswpunct() function is the
wide-character equivalent of the ispunct() function. It
tests whether wc is a wide character belonging to the wide
character class &quot;punct&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide character class &quot;punct&quot; is a subclass
of the wide character class &quot;graph&quot;, and therefore
also a subclass of the wide character class
&quot;print&quot;.</p>

<p>The wide character class &quot;punct&quot; is disjoint
from the wide character class &quot;alnum&quot; and
therefore also disjoint from its subclasses
&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;upper&quot;, &quot;lower&quot;,
&quot;digit&quot;, &quot;xdigit&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a subclass of the wide character class
&quot;print&quot;, the wide charac- ter class
&quot;punct&quot; is disjoint from the wide character class
&quot;cntrl&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a subclass of the wide character class
&quot;graph&quot;, the wide charac- ter class
&quot;punct&quot; is disjoint from the wide character class
&quot;space&quot; and its subclass &quot;blank&quot;.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The iswpunct() function returns non-zero if
wc is a wide character belonging to the wide character class
&quot;punct&quot;. Otherwise it returns zero.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ispunct(3), iswctype(3)</p>

<p>NOTES The behaviour of iswpunct() depends on the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.</p>

<p>This functions name is a misnomer when dealing with
Unicode charac- ters, because the wide character class
&quot;punct&quot; contains both punctua- tion characters and
symbol (math, currency, etc.) characters.</p>
