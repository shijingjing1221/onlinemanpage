<p>NAME grephistory - Query the INN history database</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS grephistory [-eilnqsv] [-f db] [message-id]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION grephistory queries the INN history database
for information about the specified message ID. If no flags
are given, the program prints the storage API token of the
corresponding article, or &quot;/dev/null&quot; if the
article is listed in the history database but not stored on
the server. If the message ID cannot be found in the
database, grephistory will print &quot;grephistory: not
found&quot; and exit with a non-zero status.</p>

<p>Be sure to escape any special characters in the message
ID from the shell. Single quotes are recommended for this
purpose since many mes- sage IDs contain dollar signs.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -e Only print the storage token if the article
is stored on the sys- tem. (In other words, suppress the
&quot;/dev/null&quot; or &quot;not found&quot; out- put for
missing or remembered articles.)</p>

<p>-f db Query the history database db rather than the
default history database.</p>

<p>-i Rather than expecting a message ID on the command
line, grephistory will read a list of message IDs on
standard input, one per line. Leading and trailing
whitespace is ignored, as are any malformed lines. It will
print out standard output those message IDs which are not
found in the history database. This is used when process-
ing &quot;ihave&quot; control messages.</p>

<p>-l Display the entire line from the history database,
rather than just the storage API token.</p>

<p>-n If the message ID is present in the history database
but has no storage API token, print &quot;/dev/null&quot;
and exit successfully. This can happen if an article has
been cancelled or expired, but history information has still
been retained. This is the default behavior.</p>

<p>-q Don t print any message, but still exit with the
appropriate sta- tus.</p>

<p>-s Rather than expecting a message ID on the command
line, grephistory will read a list of message IDs on
standard input, one per line. Leading and trailing
whitespace is ignored, as are any malformed lines. It will
print on standard output the storage API tokens for any
articles that are still available, one per line. This flag
is used when processing &quot;sendme&quot; control
messages.</p>

<p>-v Print out the hash of the message ID for diagnostic
purposes, as well as any other requested information. This
flag is not useful with -s.</p>
