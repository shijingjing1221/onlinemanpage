<p>NAME irnet - IrNET protocol device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION File /dev/irnet is used to access and
configure the IrNET protocol part of the Linux-IrDA
stack.</p>

<p>IrNET is a protocol allowing to create TCP/IP
connections between two IrDA peers in an efficient fashion,
and generally to enable standard networking over IrDA. It is
a thin layer, passing PPP packets to IrTTP and vice versa.
It uses PPP in synchronous mode, because IrTTP offer a
reliable sequenced packet service (as opposed to a byte
stream). In fact, you could see IrNET as carrying TCP/IP in
a IrDA socket, using PPP to provide the glue.</p>

<p>The main difference with traditional PPP over IrCOMM is
that it avoids the framing and serial emulation which are a
performance bottleneck. It also allows multipoint
communications in a sensible fashion. And finally, it can
automatically handle incomming connections through
irnetd.</p>

<p>The main difference with IrLAN is that we use PPP for
the link manage- ment, which is more standard, interoperable
and flexible than the IrLAN protocol. For example, PPP adds
authentication, encryption, compres- sion, header
compression and automated routing setup. And, as IrNET let
PPP do the hard work, the implementation is much simpler
than IrLAN.</p>

<p>IrNET connections are initiated and managed with
pppd(8). File /dev/irnet also offer a control channel. Reads
from /dev/irnet will return various IrNET events. Write to
/dev/irnet allow to configure the IrNET connection.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION If your system does not have /dev/irnet
created already, it can be cre- ated with the following
commands:</p>

<p>mknod -m 644 /dev/irnet c 10 187 chown root:root
/dev/irnet</p>

<p>You will also need to have IrNET support in your kernel
or as module and the Linux-IrDA stack installed and
configured (see irattach(8)).</p>

<p>File /dev/irnet is supposed to only be used with the PPP
line disci- pline or for accessing the control channel,
other use are unsupported. IrNET support multiple concurent
connections (limited by the IrDA stack), all those
connections are multiplexed on a single /dev/irnet device
(as opposed to IrCOMM which as one device per
connection).</p>

<p>PARAMETERS Writing commands to /dev/irnet allow to
configure the IrNET connection being made. This need to be
done through pppd(8) (see below for exam- ples). Commands
are separated by comas.</p>

<p>name &lt;peer&gt; Connect to the IrDA device which IrDA
nickname is &lt;peer&gt;. The IrDA nickname is a string up
to 31 characters.</p>

<p>daddr &lt;peer&gt; Connect to the IrDA device which IrDA
address is &lt;peer&gt;. The IrDA address is a 32 bits
hexadecimal number.</p>

<p>raddr &lt;port&gt; Restrict connections to the local
IrDA interface which IrDA address is &lt;port&gt;. The IrDA
address is a 32 bits hexadecimal number.</p>

<p>DISPLAY Reading from /dev/irnet will show various IrNET
events. This is usu- ally done with the command cat
/dev/irnet.</p>

<p>Found Dump of the current IrNET discovery log.</p>

<p>Discovered New IrNET device discovered.</p>

<p>Expired Previously discovered IrNET device no longer
present.</p>

<p>Connected to This computer successfully established an
IrNET connection to a peer.</p>

<p>Connection from A peer successfully established an IrNET
connection to this com- puter.</p>

<p>Request from A peer attempted to connect to this
computer, but no IrNET con- nection was waiting for it.</p>

<p>No-answer from This computer attempted to connect to a
peer, but no IrNET con- nection was waiting for it.</p>

<p>Blocked link with The IrDA link of the IrNET connection
is currently blocked.</p>

<p>Disconnection from A peer successfully terminated an
IrNET connection with this computer.</p>

<p>Disconnected to This computer successfully terminated an
IrNET connection with a peer.</p>

<p>File /proc/net/irda/irnet will also show the current
state of the vari- ous IrNET connections.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Start a IrNET server accepting any incomming
connection: pppd /dev/irnet 9600 local noauth nolock
passive</p>

<p>Start a IrNET client connecting to any IrDA peer: pppd
/dev/irnet 9600 local noauth nolock</p>

<p>Start a IrNET client connecting to the IrDA peer called
MyIrDANode: pppd /dev/irnet 9600 local noauth nolock connect
&quot;echo name MyIr- DANode&quot;</p>

<p>Start a IrNET server accepting incomming connection from
peer with IrDA address 0x12345678 only on IrDA port
0x87654321: pppd /dev/irnet 9600 local noauth nolock passive
connect &quot;echo daddr 0x12345678 , saddr
0x87654321&quot;</p>
