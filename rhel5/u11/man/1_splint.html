<p>NAME splint - A tool for statically checking C
programs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS splint [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Splint is a tool for statically checking C
programs for security vul- nerabilities and common
programming mistakes. With minimal effort, Splint can be
used as a better lint(1).If additional effort is invested
adding annotations to programs, Splint can perform stronger
checks than can be done by any standard lint. For full
documentation, please see http://www.splint.org. This man
page only covers a few of the avail- able options.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -help Shows help</p>

<p>Initialization</p>

<p>These flags control directories and files used by
Splint. They may be used from the command line or in an
options file, but may not be used as control comments in the
source code. Except where noted. they have the same meaning
preceded by - or +.</p>

<p>-tmpdir directory Set directory for writing temp files.
Default is /tmp/.</p>

<p>-I directory Add directory to path searched for C
include files. Note there is no space after the I, to be
consistent with C preprocessor flags.</p>

<p>-S directory Add directory to path search for .lcl
specification files.</p>

<p>-f file Load options file &lt;file&gt;. If this flag is
used from the command line, the default ~/.splintrc file is
not loaded. This flag may be used in an options file to load
in another options file.</p>

<p>-nof Prevents the default options files (./.splintrc and
~/.splintrc) from being loaded. (Setting -nof overrides
+nof, causing the options files to be loaded normally.)</p>

<p>-systemdirs directories Set directories for system files
(default is &quot;/usr/include&quot;). Separate directories
with colons (e.g., &quot;/usr/include:/usr/local/lib&quot;).
Flag settings propagate to files in a system directory. If
-systemdirerrors is set, no errors are reported for files in
system directories.</p>

<p>Pre-processor</p>

<p>These flags are used to define or undefine pre-processor
constants. The -I&lt;directory&gt; flag is also passed to
the C pre-processor.</p>

<p>-D initializer Passed to the C pre-processor.</p>

<p>-U initializer Passed to the C pre-processor</p>

<p>Libraries These flags control the creation and use of
libraries.</p>

<p>-dump file Save state in &lt;file&gt; for loading. The
default extension .lcd is added if &lt;file&gt; has no
extension.</p>

<p>-load file Load state from &lt;file&gt; (created by
-dump). The default extension .lcd is added if &lt;file&gt;
has no extension. Only one library file may be loaded.</p>

<p>By default, the standard library is loaded if the -load
flag is not used to load a user library. If no user library
is loaded, one of the following flags may be used to select
a different standard library. Precede the flag by + to load
the described library (or prevent a library from being
loaded using nolib). See Apppendix F for information on the
provided libraries.</p>

<p>-nolib Do not load any library. This prevents the
standard library from being loaded.</p>

<p>-ansi-lib Use the ANSI standard library (selected by
default).</p>

<p>-strict-lib Use strict version of the ANSI standard
library.</p>

<p>-posix-lib Use the POSIX standard library.</p>

<p>-posix-strict-lib Use the strict version of the POSIX
standard library.</p>

<p>-1-lib Use UNIX version of standard library.</p>

<p>-1-strict-lib Use the strict version of the UNIX
standard library.</p>

<p>Output</p>

<p>These flags control what additional information is
printed by Splint. Setting +&lt;flag&gt; causes the
described information to be printed; setting -&lt;flag&gt;
prevents it. By default, all these flags are off.</p>

<p>-usestderr Send error messages to standard error
(instead of standard out).</p>

<p>-showsummary Show a summary of all errors reported and
suppressed. Counts of suppressed errors are not necessarily
correct since turning a flag off may prevent some checking
from being done to save compu- tation, and errors that are
not reported may propagate differ- ently from when they are
reported.</p>

<p>-showscan Show file names are they are processed.</p>

<p>-showalluses Show list of uses of all external
identifiers sorted by number of uses.</p>

<p>-stats Display number of lines processed and checking
time.</p>

<p>-timedist Display distribution of where checking time is
spent.</p>

<p>-quiet Suppress herald and error count. (If quiet is not
set, Splint prints out a herald with version information
before checking begins, and a line summarizing the total
number of errors reported.)</p>

<p>-whichlib Print out the standard library filename and
creation information.</p>

<p>-limit number At most &lt;number&gt; similar errors are
reported consecutively. Fur- ther errors are suppressed, and
a message showing the number of suppressed messages is
printed.</p>

<p>Expected Errors</p>

<p>Normally, Splint will expect to report no errors. The
exit status will be success (0) if no errors are reported,
and failure if any errors are reported. Flags can be used to
set the expected number of reported errors. Because of the
provided error suppression mechanisms, these options should
probably not be used for final checking real programs but
may be useful in developing programs using make.</p>

<p>-expect &lt;number&gt; Exactly &lt;number&gt; code
errors are expected. Splint will exit with failure exit
status unless &lt;number&gt; code errors are detected.</p>

<p>-Message Format These flags control how messages are
printed. They may be set at the command line, in options
files, or locally in syntactic com- ments. The linelen and
limit flags may be preceded by + or - with the same meaning;
for the other flags, + turns on the describe printing and -
turns it off. The box to the left of each flag gives its
default value.</p>

<p>-showcolumn Show column number where error is found.
Default: +</p>

<p>-showfunc Show name of function (or macro) definition
containing error. The function name is printed once before
the first message detected in that function. Default: +</p>

<p>-showallconjs Show all possible alternate types (see
Section 8.2.2). Default: -</p>

<p>-paren-file-format Use file(line) format in
messages.</p>

<p>-hints Provide hints describing an error and how a
message may be sup- pressed for the first error reported in
each error class. Default: +</p>

<p>-forcehints Provide hints for all errors reported, even
if the hint has already been displayed for the same error
class. Default: -</p>

<p>-linelen number Set length of maximum message line to
&lt;number&gt; characters. Splint will split messages longer
than &lt;number&gt; characters long into multiple lines.
Default: 80</p>

<p>Mode Selector Flags</p>

<p>Mode selects flags set the mode checking flags to
predefined values. They provide a quick coarse-grain way of
controlling what classes of errors are reported. Specific
checking flags may be set after a mode flag to override the
mode settings. Mode flags may be used locally, however the
mode settings will override specific command line flag set-
tings. A warning is produced if a mode flag is used after a
mode check- ing flag has been set.</p>

<p>These are brief descriptions to give a general idea of
what each mode does. To see the complete flag settings in
each mode, use splint -help modes. A mode flag has the same
effect when used with either + or -.</p>

<p>-weak Weak checking, intended for typical unannotated C
code. No modi- fies checking, macro checking, rep exposure,
or clean interface checking is done. Return values of type
int may be ignored. The types bool, int, char and
user-defined enum types are all equiva- lent. Old style
declarations are unreported.</p>

<p>-standard The default mode. All checking done by weak,
plus modifies check- ing, global alias checking, use all
parameters, using released storage, ignored return values or
any type, macro checking, unreachable code, infinite loops,
and fall-through cases. The types bool, int and char are
distinct. Old style declarations are reported.</p>

<p>-checks Moderately strict checking. All checking done by
standard, plus must modification checking, rep exposure,
return alias, memory management and complete interfaces.</p>

<p>-strict Absurdly strict checking. All checking done by
checks, plus modi- fications and global variables used in
unspecified functions, strict standard library, and strict
typing of C operators. A spe- cial reward will be presented
to the first person to produce a real program that produces
no errors with strict checking.</p>
