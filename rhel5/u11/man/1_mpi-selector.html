<p>NAME mpi-selector - A simple site-wide/per-user MPI
selection tool for clus- ters with more than one MPI
implementation installed.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Commands for end users</p>

<p>mpi-selector [options] --list</p>

<p>mpi-selector [options] --set &lt;name&gt;</p>

<p>mpi-selector [options] --unset</p>

<p>mpi-selector [options] --query</p>

<p>mpi-selector [options] --version</p>

<p>Commands for MPI implementations</p>

<p>mpi-selector [options] --register &lt;name&gt;
--source-dir &lt;dir&gt;</p>

<p>mpi-selector [options] --unregister &lt;name&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mpi-selector command is a simplistic
tool to select one of multiple MPI implementations.
mpi-selector allows system administrators to set a site-wide
default MPI implementation while also allowing users to set
their own default MPI implementation (thereby overriding the
system- wide default).</p>

<p>Note that both the site-wide and per-user defaults are
independent from each other; a system administrator may
choose not to have a site-wide default while a user may
choose to have a personal default -- and vice versa.</p>

<p>The system is effected by having system-wide shell
startup files that looks first at the users MPI preferences.
If found, the MPI implemen- tation indicated by the users
preferences is setup in the current environment. If not
found, look for a site-wide default. If found, the MPI
implementation indicated in by the site-wide default is
setup in the current environment. If not found, exit
silently.</p>

<p>End Users / System Administrators</p>

<p>The mpi-selector command provides four main actions:</p>

<p>* List which MPI implementations are available * Set a
default (either on a per-user or site-wide basis) * Unset a
default (either on a per-user or site-wide basis) * Query
what the current default is</p>

<p>A common scenario is that a system administrator sets a
site-wide default for a supported MPI implementation that
most users will use. Power users then change their per-user
defaults to use a different MPI implementation.</p>

<p>Another common scenario is for power users to frequently
use mpi-selec- tor to swap back and forth between multiple
different MPI implementa- tions.</p>

<p>NOTE: The mpi-selector command only changes the defaults
for new shells. Specifically, after you invoke the
mpi-selector command to change the default MPI
implementation, this change does not take effect until you
start a new shell. This is intentional. See the &quot;KNOWN
LIM- ITATIONS&quot; section, below.</p>

<p>MPI Implementations</p>

<p>MPI implementations register themselves with
mpi-selector when they are installed and unregister
themselves when they are uninstalled. Each MPI installation
provides two files that setup the environment for
itself:</p>

<p>* mpivars.sh: File sourceable by Bourne-like shells (sh,
bash, etc.) * mpivars.csh: File sourceable by C-like shells
(csh, tcsh, etc.)</p>

<p>These files are expected to be in a single directory and
&quot;registered&quot; with mpi-selector using the
--register and --source-dir options. mpi- selector will copy
these files to its own internal store; it is safe to remove
the originals after the mpi-selector registration completes
suc- cessfully.</p>

<p>The &lt;name&gt; argument to --register must be
simplistic -- it cannot con- tain any shell special
characters (not even if they are escaped), nor can it
contain spaces. The intent is to provide simple names that
users can type without escaping or quoting. Names not
conforming to these rules will be rejected and the
registration will fail.</p>

<p>When an MPI implementation is uninstalled, it should
unregister with mpi-selector via the --unregister
option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --list: List which MPI implementations are
available</p>

<p>--no: Assume &quot;no&quot; to any interactive questions
asked.</p>

<p>--query: See what the current default is. If specified
with no options, whichevery default has precedence -- if any
-- will be shown. If specified with --user, only show the
per-user default (if there is one). If specified with
--system, only show the site-wide default (if there is
one).</p>

<p>--register: Register a new MPI implementation. Must be
combined with the --source-dir option.</p>

<p>--set &lt;name&gt;: Set the default MPI implementation.
May be combined with --system or --user (--user is the
default and does not need to be spec- ified).</p>

<p>--source-dir: Specify the location where mpivars.* files
should be copied from. Only meaningful when used with the
--register option.</p>

<p>--system: When used with --set or --unset, specifies to
work with the site-wide default (vs. the per-user default).
When used with --query, it specifies to specifically query
the site-wide default.</p>

<p>--unregister: Unregister an MPI implementation.</p>

<p>--user: When used with --set or --unset, specifies to
work with the per-user default (vs. the site-wide default).
When used with --query, it specifies to specifically query
the per-user default.</p>

<p>--unset: Unset the default MPI implementation. May be
combined with --system or --user (--user is the default and
does not need to be explicitly specified).</p>

<p>--verbose: Be verbose.</p>

<p>--version: Return the version of mpi-selector.</p>

<p>--yes: Assume &quot;yes&quot; to any interactive
questions asked.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Examples for End Users / System
Administrators</p>

<p>The four main actions that system administrators and end
users invoke are: listing which MPI implementations are
available, setting a default, unsetting a default, and
querying what the current default is.</p>

<p>Listing which MPI implementations are available</p>

<p>The --list option to the mpi-selector command shows a
simple list of which MPI implementations are available:</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --list mympi-1.2.3 mympi-4.5.6
othermpi-7.8.9 shell$</p>

<p>Setting a default</p>

<p>By default, MPI selections are performed on a per-user
basis with the --set option, using a name from the list of
available MPI implementa- tions (which can be obtained via
the --list command):</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --set mympi-4.5.6 shell$</p>

<p>Note that the default takes effect in the next shell
that is started; it does NOT take effect in the current
shell!</p>

<p>If a default MPI is already set, setting a new default
will cause an interactive confirmation prompt. This
interactive prompt can be avoided by using the --yes option,
which assumes a &quot;yes&quot; answer to all questions:</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --set mympi-4.5.6 shell$
mpi-selector --set mympi-4.5.6 --yes shell$</p>

<p>If the --system option is used, the site-wide default is
modified instead of the per-user default. Since this option
typically reqires writing files into protected areas, root
access may be required.</p>

<p>shell# mpi-selector --set mympi-4.5.6 --system
shell#</p>

<p>Unsetting a default</p>

<p>Unset the current default with the --unset option:</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --unset shell$</p>

<p>Similar to --set, the --system option can be used to
unset the site- wide default</p>

<p>shell# mpi-selector --unset --system shell#</p>

<p>Querying what the current default is</p>

<p>The --query option can be used to see what the current
MPI implementation is (more specifically, what the MPI
implementation will be for the next shell that is started).
It indicates both which MPI is the default and at what level
the default was set (per-user vs. site-wide):</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --set mympi-1.2.3 shell$
mpi-selector --query default:mympi-1.2.3 level:user
shell$</p>

<p>Note that if there is no per-user default, the system
default will be shown:</p>

<p>shell# mpi-selector --set othermpi-7.8.9 --system</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --unset shell$ mpi-selector --query
default:othermpi-7.8.9 level:system shell$ mpi-selector
--set mympi-1.2.3 shell$ mpi-selector --query
default:mympi-1.2.3 level:user shell$</p>

<p>If there is no per-user default and no site-wide
default, --query will return silently:</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --query shell$</p>

<p>Examples for MPI Implementations</p>

<p>Registering and unregistering typically writes files
into protected areas, and therefore usually requires root
access.</p>

<p>If there are no MPI implementations registered, --list
will return silently:</p>

<p>shell# mpi-selector --list shell#</p>

<p>An MPI with mpivars.sh and mpivars.csh in /opt/mympi/bin
can be regis- tered as follows:</p>

<p>shell# mpi-selector --register mympi-1.2.3 --source-dir
/opt/mympi/bin shell# mpi-selector --list mympi-1.2.3
shell#</p>

<p>Note that re-registering the same &lt;name&gt; will
cause an interactive con- firmation prompt; the --yes option
can be supplied to assume &quot;yes&quot; to all questions
asked:</p>

<p>shell# mpi-selector --list mympi-1.2.3 shell#
mpi-selector --register mympi-1.2.3 --source-dir
/opt/mympi/bin --yes mympi-1.2.3 is already registered.
Overwriting previously registered files. shell# mpi-selector
--list mympi-1.2.3 shell#</p>

<p>Unregistering is also simple:</p>

<p>shell# mpi-selector --list mympi-1.2.3 shell#
mpi-selector --unregister mympi-1.2.3 shell# mpi-selector
--list shell#</p>

<p>Registering and Unregistering in RPMs</p>

<p>Registering and unregistering via RPM is unfortunately
more complicated than it needs to be because of the
following issues:</p>

<p>1. Although RPM obeys dependency ordering of &quot;rpm
-i a b c&quot;. That is, c will be installed before a if a
requires c. Regardless, RPM s must know a) that the
mpi-selector command is installed, and b) be able to find it
in its path.</p>

<p>2. RPM does not obey dependency ordering of &quot;rpm -e
a b c&quot;. That is, c may be uninstalled before a, even if
a requires c. Hence, the mpi-select command may disappear
before an RPM using the mpi-select command in a scriptlet is
uninstalled.</p>

<p>3. &quot;Updating&quot; RPMs will first uninstall the
old RPM and then re-install the new one.</p>

<p>Additionally, the staged installations (such as the OFED
installer) require telling the mpi-selector command
additional information so that various internal data files
can be found.</p>

<p>In general, MPI installations via RPMs should register
during the %post scriptlet and unregister during the %preun
scriptlet (not during the %postun scriptlet!).</p>

<p>If RPMs &quot;require&quot; the mpi-selector RPM, they
can be assured that the mpi-selector command will exist and
be installed properly, but they still need to be able to
find mpi-selector in their PATH. Hence, if mpi-selector is
not installed into a default PATH location, the %post
scriptlet won t be able to find it, and the registration
call will fail. The simplest workaround (at least for the
moment) is to set the PATH to where mpi-selector is
installed before installing any RPMs that use it.</p>

<p>With that in mind, here is a possible %post scriptlet
for OFED- installed RPMS:</p>

<p>mpi-selector --register &lt;name&gt; --source-dir
&lt;source_dir&gt; --yes --silent</p>

<p>Note the following:</p>

<p>1. The --yes option forces an overwrite if, for some
reason, a previous MPI of the name name is already
registered.</p>

<p>2. The --silent option makes mpi-selector run silently,
since RPMs are supposed to install with no output.</p>

<p>Here is a possible %preun scriptlet for OFED-installed
RPMs:</p>

<p>mpi-selector --unregister &lt;name&gt; --yes /bin/true
&gt; /dev/null 2&gt; /dev/null</p>

<p>Note the following:</p>

<p>1. We use %preun instead of %postun because of RPM s
upgrade behavior.</p>

<p>2. Since RPM does not honor dependencies when
uninstalling, it is possible that mpi-selector is no longer
installed, and therefore the command may fail. However,
since mpi-selector is no longer installed, we dont care that
it failed (i.e., there s nothing to unregister from), so
just redirect all output to /dev/null and ensure that the
return code from the overall command is &quot;true&quot;
(RPM will abort if any individual scriptlet command
fails).</p>

<p>KNOWN LIMITATIONS The main known limitation of
mpi-selector is that it only affects future shells --
running it does not affect the current shell. After you run
mpi-selector to set a new default MPI (regardless of whether
it is a system-level or user-specific default), that default
will not take effect until you start a new shell -- even
though --query will report the new default.</p>

<p>This behavior is because mpi-selector defaults are only
read during shell startup. It was an intentional design
decision -- mpi-selector is intended to be a simplistic
tool, and an all-encompassing solution.</p>

<p>Other solutions for modifying the current environment
exist, such as the Environment Modules package
(&lt;http://modules.sourceforge.net/&gt;) and SoftEnv from
Argonne National Laboratory (and probably others). Using
these tools, you can immediately change the environment of
the current shell (to include switching to use a different
MPI implementation). As such, these already-existing, mature
tools are better suited for such usage patterns;
mpi-selector is not intended to replace them.</p>

<p>For rsh/ssh-based parallel environments, switching
defaults frequently should be done with care. Specifically,
rsh/ssh-based launchers may depends on a common environment
across all nodes (e.g., to find helper executables and/or
libraries for a specific MPI). Consider the follow- ing
example:</p>

<p>shell$ mpi-selector --set mympi-1.2.3 shell$ mpicc
my_mpi_app.c -o my_mpi_app shell$ mpirun -np 32 --hostfile
myhosts my_mpi_app</p>

<p>While my_mpi_app is starting, it may be dangerous to
switch the mpi- selector default (perhaps in a different
window) because the rsh and/or ssh commands currently
executing may be relying on finding the same MPI
implementation on all nodes. Changing the default while the
applica- tion is launching may cause a different MPI
implementation to be found on some nodes, thereby causing
undefined behavior.</p>
