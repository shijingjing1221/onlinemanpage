<p>SSH_CONFIG(5) BSD File Formats Manual SSH_CONFIG(5)</p>

<p>NAME ssh_config - OpenSSH SSH client configuration
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ~/.ssh/config /etc/ssh/ssh_config</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ssh obtains configuration data from the
following sources in the follow- ing order: 1. command-line
options 2. users configuration file (~/.ssh/config) 3.
system-wide configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config)</p>

<p>For each parameter, the first obtained value will be
used. The configu- ration files contain sections separated
by Host specifications, and that section is only applied for
hosts that match one of the patterns given in the
specification. The matched host name is the one given on the
command line.</p>

<p>Since the first obtained value for each parameter is
used, more host-spe- cific declarations should be given near
the beginning of the file, and general defaults at the
end.</p>

<p>The configuration file has the following format:</p>

<p>Empty lines and lines starting with # are comments.</p>

<p>Otherwise a line is of the format keyword arguments .
Configuration options may be separated by whitespace or
optional whitespace and exactly one =; the latter format is
useful to avoid the need to quote whites- pace when
specifying configuration options using the ssh, scp and sftp
-o option.</p>

<p>The possible keywords and their meanings are as follows
(note that key- words are case-insensitive and arguments are
case-sensitive):</p>

<p>Host Restricts the following declarations (up to the
next Host key- word) to be only for those hosts that match
one of the patterns given after the keyword. * and ? can be
used as wildcards in the patterns. A single * as a pattern
can be used to provide global defaults for all hosts. The
host is the hostname argument given on the command line
(i.e., the name is not converted to a canonicalized host
name before matching).</p>

<p>AddressFamily Specifies which address family to use when
connecting. Valid arguments are any , inet (use IPv4 only)
or inet6 (use IPv6 only).</p>

<p>BatchMode If set to yes, passphrase/password querying
will be disabled. This option is useful in scripts and other
batch jobs where no user is present to supply the password.
The argument must be yes or no. The default is no.</p>

<p>BindAddress Use the specified address on the local
machine as the source address of the connection. Only useful
on systems with more than one address. Note that this option
does not work if UsePrivilegedPort is set to yes.</p>

<p>ChallengeResponseAuthentication Specifies whether to use
challenge response authentication. The argument to this
keyword must be yes or no. The default is yes.</p>

<p>CheckHostIP If this flag is set to yes, ssh will
additionally check the host IP address in the known_hosts
file. This allows ssh to detect if a host key changed due to
DNS spoofing. If the option is set to no, the check will not
be executed. The default is yes.</p>

<p>Cipher Specifies the cipher to use for encrypting the
session in proto- col version 1. Currently, blowfish, 3des,
and des are sup- ported. des is only supported in the ssh
client for interoper- ability with legacy protocol 1
implementations that do not sup- port the 3des cipher. Its
use is strongly discouraged due to cryptographic weaknesses.
The default is 3des.</p>

<p>Ciphers Specifies the ciphers allowed for protocol
version 2 in order of preference. Multiple ciphers must be
comma-separated. The sup- ported ciphers are 3des-cbc,
aes128-cbc, aes192-cbc, aes256-cbc, aes128-ctr, aes192-ctr,
aes256-ctr, arcfour128, arcfour256, arcfour, blowfish-cbc,
and cast128-cbc. The default is</p>

<p>aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,arcfour256,arcfour128,
aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc,cast128-cbc,aes192-cbc,
aes256-cbc,arcfour</p>

<p>ClearAllForwardings Specifies that all local, remote and
dynamic port forwardings specified in the configuration
files or on the command line be cleared. This option is
primarily useful when used from the ssh command line to
clear port forwardings set in configuration files, and is
automatically set by scp(1) and sftp(1). The argu- ment must
be yes or no. The default is no.</p>

<p>Compression Specifies whether to use compression. The
argument must be yes or no. The default is no.</p>

<p>CompressionLevel Specifies the compression level to use
if compression is enabled. The argument must be an integer
from 1 (fast) to 9 (slow, best). The default level is 6,
which is good for most applications. The meaning of the
values is the same as in gzip(1). Note that this option
applies to protocol version 1 only.</p>

<p>ConnectionAttempts Specifies the number of tries (one
per second) to make before exiting. The argument must be an
integer. This may be useful in scripts if the connection
sometimes fails. The default is 1.</p>

<p>ConnectTimeout Specifies the timeout (in seconds) used
when connecting to the ssh server, instead of using the
default system TCP timeout. This value is used only when the
target is down or really unreachable, not when it refuses
the connection.</p>

<p>ControlMaster Enables the sharing of multiple sessions
over a single network connection. When set to yes ssh will
listen for connections on a control socket specified using
the ControlPath argument. Addi- tional sessions can connect
to this socket using the same ControlPath with ControlMaster
set to no (the default). These sessions will try to reuse
the master instances network connec- tion rather than
initiating new ones, but will fall back to con- necting
normally if the control socket does not exist, or is not
listening.</p>

<p>Setting this to ask will cause ssh to listen for control
con- nections, but require confirmation using the
SSH_ASKPASS program before they are accepted (see ssh-add(1)
for details). If the ControlPath can not be opened, ssh will
continue without connect- ing to a master instance.</p>

<p>X11 and ssh-agent(1) forwarding is supported over these
multi- plexed connections, however the display and agent
forwarded will be the one belonging to the master connection
i.e. it is not pos- sible to forward multiple displays or
agents.</p>

<p>Two additional options allow for opportunistic
multiplexing: try to use a master connection but fall back
to creating a new one if one does not already exist. These
options are: auto and autoask. The latter requires
confirmation like the ask option.</p>

<p>ControlPath Specify the path to the control socket used
for connection shar- ing as described in the ControlMaster
section above or the string none to disable connection
sharing. In the path, %h will be substituted by the target
host name, %p the port and %r by the remote login username.
It is recommended that any ControlPath used for
opportunistic connection sharing include all three of these
escape sequences. This ensures that shared con- nections are
uniquely identified.</p>

<p>DynamicForward Specifies that a TCP port on the local
machine be forwarded over the secure channel, and the
application protocol is then used to determine where to
connect to from the remote machine.</p>

<p>The argument must be [bind_address:]port. IPv6 addresses
can be specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets
or by using an alternative syntax: [bind_address/]port. By
default, the local port is bound in accordance with the
GatewayPorts setting. However, an explicit bind_address may
be used to bind the connec- tion to a specific address. The
bind_address of localhost indicates that the listening port
be bound for local use only, while an empty address or *
indicates that the port should be available from all
interfaces.</p>

<p>Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported,
and ssh will act as a SOCKS server. Multiple forwardings may
be speci- fied, and additional forwardings can be given on
the command line. Only the superuser can forward privileged
ports.</p>

<p>EnableSSHKeysign Setting this option to yes in the
global client configuration file /etc/ssh/ssh_config enables
the use of the helper program ssh-keysign(8) during
HostbasedAuthentication. The argument must be yes or no. The
default is no . This option should be placed in the
non-hostspecific section. See ssh-keysign(8) for more
information.</p>

<p>EscapeChar Sets the escape character (default: ~). The
escape character can also be set on the command line. The
argument should be a single character, ^ followed by a
letter, or none to disable the escape character entirely
(making the connection transparent for binary data).</p>

<p>ForwardAgent Specifies whether the connection to the
authentication agent (if any) will be forwarded to the
remote machine. The argument must be yes or no. The default
is no.</p>

<p>Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users
with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote
host (for the agents Unix-domain socket) can access the
local agent through the forwarded connection. An attacker
cannot obtain key material from the agent, however they can
perform operations on the keys that enable them to
authenticate using the identities loaded into the agent.</p>

<p>ForwardX11 Specifies whether X11 connections will be
automatically redi- rected over the secure channel and
DISPLAY set. The argument must be yes or no. The default is
no.</p>

<p>X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users
with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote
host (for the users X11 authorization database) can access
the local X11 dis- play through the forwarded connection. An
attacker may then be able to perform activities such as
keystroke monitoring if the ForwardX11Trusted option is also
enabled.</p>

<p>ForwardX11Trusted If this option is set to yes then
remote X11 clients will have full access to the original X11
display.</p>

<p>If this option is set to no then remote X11 clients will
be considered untrusted and prevented from stealing or
tampering with data belonging to trusted X11 clients.
Furthermore, the xauth(1) token used for the session will be
set to expire after 20 minutes. Remote clients will be
refused access after this time.</p>

<p>The default is no.</p>

<p>See the X11 SECURITY extension specification for full
details on the restrictions imposed on untrusted
clients.</p>

<p>GatewayPorts Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed
to connect to local forwarded ports. By default, ssh binds
local port forwardings to the loopback address. This
prevents other remote hosts from con- necting to forwarded
ports. GatewayPorts can be used to specify that ssh should
bind local port forwardings to the wildcard address, thus
allowing remote hosts to connect to forwarded ports. The
argument must be yes or no. The default is no.</p>

<p>GlobalKnownHostsFile Specifies a file to use for the
global host key database instead of
/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.</p>

<p>GSSAPIAuthentication Specifies whether user
authentication based on GSSAPI is allowed. The default is
no. Note that this option applies to protocol version 2
only.</p>

<p>GSSAPIDelegateCredentials Forward (delegate) credentials
to the server. The default is no . Note that this option
applies to protocol version 2 only.</p>

<p>HashKnownHosts Indicates that ssh should hash host names
and addresses when they are added to ~/.ssh/known_hosts.
These hashed names may be used normally by ssh and sshd, but
they do not reveal identifying information should the files
contents be disclosed. The default is no. Note that hashing
of names and addresses will not be retrospectively applied
to existing known hosts files, but these may be manually
hashed using ssh-keygen(1).</p>

<p>HostbasedAuthentication Specifies whether to try rhosts
based authentication with public key authentication. The
argument must be yes or no. The default is no. This option
applies to protocol version 2 only and is similar to
RhostsRSAAuthentication.</p>

<p>HostKeyAlgorithms Specifies the protocol version 2 host
key algorithms that the client wants to use in order of
preference. The default for this option is:
ssh-rsa,ssh-dss.</p>

<p>HostKeyAlias Specifies an alias that should be used
instead of the real host name when looking up or saving the
host key in the host key database files. This option is
useful for tunneling ssh connec- tions or for multiple
servers running on a single host.</p>

<p>HostName Specifies the real host name to log into. This
can be used to specify nicknames or abbreviations for hosts.
Default is the name given on the command line. Numeric IP
addresses are also permitted (both on the command line and
in HostName specifica- tions).</p>

<p>IdentitiesOnly Specifies that ssh should only use the
authentication identity files configured in the ssh_config
files, even if the ssh-agent offers more identities. The
argument to this keyword must be yes or no. This option is
intended for situations where ssh-agent offers many
different identities. The default is no.</p>

<p>IdentityFile Specifies a file from which the user s RSA
or DSA authentication identity is read. The default is
~/.ssh/identity for protocol version 1, and ~/.ssh/id_rsa
and ~/.ssh/id_dsa for protocol ver- sion 2. Additionally,
any identities represented by the authen- tication agent
will be used for authentication. The file name may use the
tilde syntax to refer to a users home directory. It is
possible to have multiple identity files specified in
configu- ration files; all these identities will be tried in
sequence.</p>

<p>KbdInteractiveDevices Specifies the list of methods to
use in keyboard-interactive authentication. Multiple method
names must be comma-separated. The default is to use the
server specified list.</p>

<p>LocalCommand Specifies a command to execute on the local
machine after suc- cessfully connecting to the server. The
command string extends to the end of the line, and is
executed with /bin/sh. This directive is ignored unless
PermitLocalCommand has been enabled.</p>

<p>LocalForward Specifies that a TCP port on the local
machine be forwarded over the secure channel to the
specified host and port from the remote machine. The first
argument must be [bind_address:]port and the second argument
must be host:hostport. IPv6 addresses can be specified by
enclosing addresses in square brackets or by using an
alternative syntax: [bind_address/]port and host/hostport.
Multiple forwardings may be specified, and additional
forwardings can be given on the command line. Only the
superuser can forward privileged ports. By default, the
local port is bound in accor- dance with the GatewayPorts
setting. However, an explicit bind_address may be used to
bind the connection to a specific address. The bind_address
of localhost indicates that the lis- tening port be bound
for local use only, while an empty address or * indicates
that the port should be available from all interfaces.</p>

<p>LogLevel Gives the verbosity level that is used when
logging messages from ssh. The possible values are: QUIET,
FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VER- BOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2 and
DEBUG3. The default is INFO. DEBUG and DEBUG1 are
equivalent. DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of
verbose output.</p>

<p>MACs Specifies the MAC (message authentication code)
algorithms in order of preference. The MAC algorithm is used
in protocol ver- sion 2 for data integrity protection.
Multiple algorithms must be comma-separated. The default is
hmac-md5,hmac-sha1,hmac-ripemd160,hmac-sha1-96,hmac-md5-96
.</p>

<p>NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost This option can be used
if the home directory is shared across machines. In this
case localhost will refer to a different machine on each of
the machines and the user will get many warn- ings about
changed host keys. However, this option disables host
authentication for localhost. The argument to this keyword
must be yes or no. The default is to check the host key for
localhost.</p>

<p>NumberOfPasswordPrompts Specifies the number of password
prompts before giving up. The argument to this keyword must
be an integer. Default is 3.</p>

<p>PasswordAuthentication Specifies whether to use password
authentication. The argument to this keyword must be yes or
no. The default is yes.</p>

<p>PermitLocalCommand Allow local command execution via the
LocalCommand option or using the !command escape sequence in
ssh(1). The argument must be yes or no. The default is
no.</p>

<p>Port Specifies the port number to connect on the remote
host. Default is 22.</p>

<p>PreferredAuthentications Specifies the order in which
the client should try protocol 2 authentication methods.
This allows a client to prefer one method (e.g.
keyboard-interactive) over another method (e.g. password)
The default for this option is:
hostbased,publickey,keyboard-interactive,password.</p>

<p>Protocol Specifies the protocol versions ssh should
support in order of preference. The possible values are 1
and 2. Multiple ver- sions must be comma-separated. The
default is 2,1 . This means that ssh tries version 2 and
falls back to version 1 if version 2 is not available.</p>

<p>ProxyCommand Specifies the command to use to connect to
the server. The com- mand string extends to the end of the
line, and is executed with /bin/sh. In the command string,
%h will be substituted by the host name to connect and %p by
the port. The command can be basically anything, and should
read from its standard input and write to its standard
output. It should eventually connect an sshd(8) server
running on some machine, or execute sshd -i some- where.
Host key management will be done using the HostName of the
host being connected (defaulting to the name typed by the
user). Setting the command to none disables this option
entirely. Note that CheckHostIP is not available for
connects with a proxy command.</p>

<p>This directive is useful in conjunction with nc(1) and
its proxy support. For example, the following directive
would connect via an HTTP proxy at 192.0.2.0:</p>

<p>ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -X connect -x 192.0.2.0:8080 %h
%p</p>

<p>PubkeyAuthentication Specifies whether to try public key
authentication. The argument to this keyword must be yes or
no. The default is yes. This option applies to protocol
version 2 only.</p>

<p>RekeyLimit Specifies the maximum amount of data that may
be transmitted before the session key is renegotiated. The
argument is the num- ber of bytes, with an optional suffix
of K, M, or G to indicate Kilobytes, Megabytes, or
Gigabytes, respectively. The default is between 1G and 4G ,
depending on the cipher. This option applies to protocol
version 2 only.</p>

<p>RemoteForward Specifies that a TCP port on the remote
machine be forwarded over the secure channel to the
specified host and port from the local machine. The first
argument must be [bind_address:]port and the second argument
must be host:hostport. IPv6 addresses can be specified by
enclosing addresses in square brackets or by using an
alternative syntax: [bind_address/]port and host/hostport.
Multiple forwardings may be specified, and additional
forwardings can be given on the command line. Only the
superuser can forward privileged ports.</p>

<p>If the bind_address is not specified, the default is to
only bind to loopback addresses. If the bind_address is * or
an empty string, then the forwarding is requested to listen
on all inter- faces. Specifying a remote bind_address will
only succeed if the server s GatewayPorts option is enabled
(see sshd_config(5)).</p>

<p>RhostsRSAAuthentication Specifies whether to try rhosts
based authentication with RSA host authentication. The
argument must be yes or no . The default is no. This option
applies to protocol version 1 only and requires ssh to be
setuid root.</p>

<p>RSAAuthentication Specifies whether to try RSA
authentication. The argument to this keyword must be yes or
no. RSA authentication will only be attempted if the
identity file exists, or an authentication agent is running.
The default is yes . Note that this option applies to
protocol version 1 only.</p>

<p>SendEnv Specifies what variables from the local
environ(7) should be sent to the server. Note that
environment passing is only supported for protocol 2, the
server must also support it, and the server must be
configured to accept these environment variables. Refer to
AcceptEnv in sshd_config(5) for how to configure the server.
Variables are specified by name, which may contain the
wildcard characters * and ?. Multiple environment variables
may be separated by whitespace or spread across multiple
SendEnv direc- tives. The default is not to send any
environment variables.</p>

<p>ServerAliveCountMax Sets the number of server alive
messages (see below) which may be sent without ssh receiving
any messages back from the server. If this threshold is
reached while server alive messages are being sent, ssh will
disconnect from the server, terminating the ses- sion. It is
important to note that the use of server alive mes- sages is
very different from TCPKeepAlive (below). The server alive
messages are sent through the encrypted channel and there-
fore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option enabled
by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The server alive mechanism is
valu- able when the client or server depend on knowing when
a connec- tion has become inactive.</p>

<p>The default value is 3. If, for example,
ServerAliveInterval (see below) is set to 15, and
ServerAliveCountMax is left at the default, if the server
becomes unresponsive ssh will disconnect after approximately
45 seconds.</p>

<p>ServerAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds
after which if no data has been received from the server,
ssh will send a message through the encrypted channel to
request a response from the server. The default is 0,
indicating that these messages will not be sent to the
server. This option applies to protocol version 2 only.</p>

<p>SmartcardDevice Specifies which smartcard device to use.
The argument to this keyword is the device ssh should use to
communicate with a smart- card used for storing the users
private RSA key. By default, no device is specified and
smartcard support is not activated.</p>

<p>StrictHostKeyChecking If this flag is set to yes , ssh
will never automatically add host keys to the
~/.ssh/known_hosts file, and refuses to connect to hosts
whose host key has changed. This provides maximum pro-
tection against trojan horse attacks, however, can be
annoying when the /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts file is poorly
maintained, or connections to new hosts are frequently made.
This option forces the user to manually add all new hosts.
If this flag is set to no , ssh will automatically add new
host keys to the user known hosts files. If this flag is set
to ask, new host keys will be added to the user known host
files only after the user has con- firmed that is what they
really want to do, and ssh will refuse to connect to hosts
whose host key has changed. The host keys of known hosts
will be verified automatically in all cases. The argument
must be yes, no or ask. The default is ask .</p>

<p>TCPKeepAlive Specifies whether the system should send
TCP keepalive messages to the other side. If they are sent,
death of the connection or crash of one of the machines will
be properly noticed. However, this means that connections
will die if the route is down tem- porarily, and some people
find it annoying.</p>

<p>The default is yes (to send TCP keepalive messages), and
the client will notice if the network goes down or the
remote host dies. This is important in scripts, and many
users want it too.</p>

<p>To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be
set to no.</p>

<p>Tunnel Request starting tun(4) device forwarding between
the client and the server. This option also allows
requesting layer 2 (ether- net) instead of layer 3
(point-to-point) tunneling from the server. The argument
must be yes, point-to-point, ethernet or no. The default is
no.</p>

<p>TunnelDevice Force a specified tun(4) device on the
client. Without this option, the next available device will
be used.</p>

<p>UsePrivilegedPort Specifies whether to use a privileged
port for outgoing connec- tions. The argument must be yes or
no. The default is no. If set to yes ssh must be setuid
root. Note that this option must be set to yes for
RhostsRSAAuthentication with older servers.</p>

<p>User Specifies the user to log in as. This can be useful
when a dif- ferent user name is used on different machines.
This saves the trouble of having to remember to give the
user name on the com- mand line.</p>

<p>UserKnownHostsFile Specifies a file to use for the user
host key database instead of ~/.ssh/known_hosts.</p>

<p>VerifyHostKeyDNS Specifies whether to verify the remote
key using DNS and SSHFP resource records. If this option is
set to yes, the client will implicitly trust keys that match
a secure fingerprint from DNS. Insecure fingerprints will be
handled as if this option was set to ask . If this option is
set to ask, information on fingerprint match will be
displayed, but the user will still need to confirm new host
keys according to the StrictHostKeyChecking option. The
argument must be yes, no or ask . The default is no . Note
that this option applies to protocol version 2 only.</p>

<p>XAuthLocation Specifies the full pathname of the
xauth(1) program. The default is /usr/bin/xauth.</p>

<p>FILES ~/.ssh/config This is the per-user configuration
file. The format of this file is described above. This file
is used by the ssh client. Because of the potential for
abuse, this file must have strict permissions: read/write
for the user, and not accessible by oth- ers.</p>

<p>/etc/ssh/ssh_config Systemwide configuration file. This
file provides defaults for those values that are not
specified in the user s configuration file, and for those
users who do not have a configuration file. This file must
be world-readable.</p>
