<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>NAME emacs - GNU project Emacs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS emacs [ command-line switches ] [ files ...
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION GNU Emacs is a version of Emacs, written by
the author of the original (PDP-10) Emacs, Richard Stallman.
The primary documentation of GNU Emacs is in the GNU Emacs
Manual, which you can read on line using Info, a subsystem
of Emacs. Please look there for complete and up-to-date
documentation. This man page is updated only when someone
volunteers to do so; the Emacs maintainers priority goal is
to minimize the amount of time this man page takes away from
other more useful projects. The user functionality of GNU
Emacs encompasses everything other Emacs editors do, and it
is easily extensible since its editing commands are written
in Lisp.</p>

<p>Emacs has an extensive interactive help facility, but
the facility assumes that you know how to manipulate Emacs
windows and buffers. CTRL-h (backspace or CTRL-h) enters the
Help facility. Help Tutorial (CTRL-h t) requests an
interactive tutorial which can teach beginners the
fundamentals of Emacs in a few minutes. Help Apropos (CTRL-h
a) helps you find a command given its functionality, Help
Character (CTRL- h c) describes a given character s effect,
and Help Function (CTRL-h f) describes a given Lisp function
specified by name.</p>

<p>Emacss Undo can undo several steps of modification to
your buffers, so it is easy to recover from editing
mistakes.</p>

<p>GNU Emacss many special packages handle mail reading
(RMail) and send- ing (Mail), outline editing (Outline),
compiling (Compile), running subshells within Emacs windows
(Shell), running a Lisp read-eval-print loop
(Lisp-Interaction-Mode), and automated psychotherapy
(Doctor).</p>

<p>There is an extensive reference manual, but users of
other Emacses should have little trouble adapting even
without a copy. Users new to Emacs will be able to use basic
features fairly rapidly by studying the tutorial and using
the self-documentation features.</p>

<p>Emacs Options</p>

<p>The following options are of general interest:</p>

<p>file Edit file.</p>

<p>+number Go to the line specified by number (do not
insert a space between the &quot;+&quot; sign and the
number).</p>

<p>-q Do not load an init file.</p>

<p>-u user Load users init file.</p>

<p>-t file Use specified file as the terminal instead of
using stdin/std- out. This must be the first argument
specified in the command line.</p>

<p>The following options are lisp-oriented (these options
are processed in the order encountered):</p>

<p>-f function Execute the lisp function function.</p>

<p>-l file Load the lisp code in the file file.</p>

<p>The following options are useful when running Emacs as a
batch editor:</p>

<p>-batch Edit in batch mode. The editor will send messages
to stderr. This option must be the first in the argument
list. You must use -l and -f options to specify files to
execute and functions to call.</p>

<p>-kill Exit Emacs while in batch mode.</p>

<p>Using Emacs with X</p>

<p>Emacs has been tailored to work well with the X window
system. If you run Emacs from under X windows, it will
create its own X window to dis- play in. You will probably
want to start the editor as a background process so that you
can continue using your original window.</p>

<p>Emacs can be started with the following X switches:</p>

<p>-name name Specifies the name which should be assigned
to the initial Emacs window. This controls looking up X
resources as well as the window title.</p>

<p>-title name Specifies the title for the initial X
window.</p>

<p>-r Display the Emacs window in reverse video.</p>

<p>-i Use the &quot;kitchen sink&quot; bitmap icon when
iconifying the Emacs window.</p>

<p>-font font, -fn font Set the Emacs windows font to that
specified by font. You will find the various X fonts in the
/usr/lib/X11/fonts direc- tory. Note that Emacs will only
accept fixed width fonts. Under the X11 Release 4
font-naming conventions, any font with the value
&quot;m&quot; or &quot;c&quot; in the eleventh field of the
font name is a fixed width font. Furthermore, fonts whose
name are of the form widthxheight are generally fixed width,
as is the font fixed. See xlsfonts(1) for more
information.</p>

<p>When you specify a font, be sure to put a space between
the switch and the font name.</p>

<p>-bw pixels Set the Emacs windows border width to the
number of pixels specified by pixels. Defaults to one pixel
on each side of the window.</p>

<p>-ib pixels Set the window s internal border width to the
number of pixels specified by pixels. Defaults to one pixel
of padding on each side of the window.</p>

<p>-geometry geometry Set the Emacs windows width, height,
and position as speci- fied. The geometry specification is
in the standard X format; see X(1) for more information. The
width and height are speci- fied in characters; the default
is 80 by 24.</p>

<p>-fg color On color displays, sets the color of the
text.</p>

<p>See the file /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt for a list of valid
color names.</p>

<p>-bg color On color displays, sets the color of the
window s background.</p>

<p>-bd color On color displays, sets the color of the
windows border.</p>

<p>-cr color On color displays, sets the color of the
window s text cursor.</p>

<p>-ms color On color displays, sets the color of the
windows mouse cursor.</p>

<p>-d displayname, -display displayname Create the Emacs
window on the display specified by display- name. Must be
the first option specified in the command line.</p>

<p>-nw Tells Emacs not to use its special interface to X.
If you use this switch when invoking Emacs from an xterm(1)
window, dis- play is done in that window. This must be the
first option specified in the command line.</p>

<p>You can set X default values for your Emacs windows in
your .Xresources file (see xrdb(1)). Use the following
format:</p>

<p>emacs.keyword:value</p>

<p>where value specifies the default value of keyword.
Emacs lets you set default values for the following
keywords:</p>

<p>font (class Font) Sets the windows text font.</p>

<p>reverseVideo (class ReverseVideo) If reverseVideos value
is set to on, the window will be dis- played in reverse
video.</p>

<p>bitmapIcon (class BitmapIcon) If bitmapIcons value is
set to on, the window will iconify into the &quot;kitchen
sink.&quot;</p>

<p>borderWidth (class BorderWidth) Sets the windows border
width in pixels.</p>

<p>internalBorder (class BorderWidth) Sets the windows
internal border width in pixels.</p>

<p>foreground (class Foreground) For color displays, sets
the windows text color.</p>

<p>background (class Background) For color displays, sets
the window s background color.</p>

<p>borderColor (class BorderColor) For color displays, sets
the color of the windows border.</p>

<p>cursorColor (class Foreground) For color displays, sets
the color of the window s text cursor.</p>

<p>pointerColor (class Foreground) For color displays, sets
the color of the windows mouse cur- sor.</p>

<p>geometry (class Geometry) Sets the geometry of the Emacs
window (as described above).</p>

<p>title (class Title) Sets the title of the Emacs
window.</p>

<p>iconName (class Title) Sets the icon name for the Emacs
window icon.</p>

<p>If you try to set color values while using a black and
white display, the windows characteristics will default as
follows: the foreground color will be set to black, the
background color will be set to white, the border color will
be set to grey, and the text and mouse cursors will be set
to black.</p>

<p>Using the Mouse</p>

<p>The following lists the mouse button bindings for the
Emacs window under X11.</p>

<p>MOUSE BUTTON FUNCTION left Set point. middle Paste text.
right Cut text into X cut buffer. SHIFT-middle Cut text into
X cut buffer. SHIFT-right Paste text. CTRL-middle Cut text
into X cut buffer and kill it. CTRL-right Select this
window, then split it into two win- dows. Same as typing
CTRL-x 2. CTRL-SHIFT-left X buffer menu--hold the buttons
and keys down, wait for menu to appear, select buffer, and
release. Move mouse out of menu and release to cancel.
CTRL-SHIFT-middle X help menu--pop up index card menu for
Emacs help. CTRL-SHIFT-right Select window with mouse, and
delete all other windows. Same as typing CTRL-x 1.</p>

<p>MANUALS You can order printed copies of the GNU Emacs
Manual from the Free Software Foundation, which develops GNU
software. See the file ORDERS for ordering information. Your
local Emacs maintainer might also have copies available. As
with all software and publications from FSF, everyone is
permitted to make and distribute copies of the Emacs manual.
The TeX source to the man- ual is also included in the Emacs
source distribution.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/local/info - files for the Info documentation
browser (a subsystem of Emacs) to refer to. Currently not
much of Unix is documented here, but the complete text of
the Emacs reference manual is included in a convenient tree
structured form.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/src - C source files and
object files</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/lisp - Lisp source files
and compiled files that define most editing commands. Some
are preloaded; others are autoloaded from this directory
when used.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc - various programs
that are used with GNU Emacs, and some files of
information.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/DOC.* - contains the
documentation strings for the Lisp primitives and preloaded
Lisp functions of GNU Emacs. They are stored here to reduce
the size of Emacs proper.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/OTHER.EMACSES
discusses GNU Emacs vs. other versions of Emacs.
/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/SERVICE lists people
offering vari- ous services to assist users of GNU Emacs,
including education, trou- bleshooting, porting and
customization. These files also have information useful to
anyone wishing to write programs in the Emacs Lisp extension
language, which has not yet been fully documented.</p>

<p>/usr/local/com/emacs/lock - holds lock files that are
made for all files being modified in Emacs, to prevent
simultaneous modification of one file by two users.</p>

<p>/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt - list of valid X color names.</p>

<p>BUGS There is a mailing list,
bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu on the internet
(ucbvax!prep.ai.mit.edu!bug-gnu-emacs on UUCPnet), for
reporting Emacs bugs and fixes. But before reporting
something as a bug, please try to be sure that it really is
a bug, not a misunderstanding or a deliberate feature. We
ask you to read the section Reporting Emacs Bugs near the
end of the reference manual (or Info system) for hints on
how and when to report bugs. Also, include the version
number of the Emacs you are running in every bug report that
you send in.</p>

<p>Do not expect a personal answer to a bug report. The
purpose of reporting bugs is to get them fixed for everyone
in the next release, if possible. For personal assistance,
look in the SERVICE file (see above) for a list of people
who offer it.</p>

<p>Please do not send anything but bug reports to this
mailing list. Send requests to be added to mailing lists to
the special list info-gnu- emacs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu (or
the corresponding UUCP address). For more information about
Emacs mailing lists, see the file
/usr/local/emacs/etc/MAILINGLISTS. Bugs tend actually to be
fixed if they can be isolated, so it is in your interest to
report them in such a way that they can be easily
reproduced.</p>

<p>Bugs that I know about are: shell will not work with
programs running in Raw mode on some Unix versions.</p>

<p>UNRESTRICTIONS Emacs is free; anyone may redistribute
copies of Emacs to anyone under the terms stated in the
Emacs General Public License, a copy of which accompanies
each copy of Emacs and which also appears in the reference
manual.</p>

<p>Copies of Emacs may sometimes be received packaged with
distributions of Unix systems, but it is never included in
the scope of any license covering those systems. Such
inclusion violates the terms on which distribution is
permitted. In fact, the primary purpose of the General
Public License is to prohibit anyone from attaching any
other restric- tions to redistribution of Emacs.</p>

<p>Richard Stallman encourages you to improve and extend
Emacs, and urges that you contribute your extensions to the
GNU library. Eventually GNU (Gnus Not Unix) will be a
complete replacement for Berkeley Unix. Everyone will be
free to use, copy, study and change the GNU system.</p>
