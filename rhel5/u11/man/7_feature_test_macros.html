<p>FEATURE_TEST_MACROS(7) Linux Programmer s Manual
FEATURE_TEST_MACROS(7)</p>

<p>NAME feature_test_macros - feature test macros</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;features.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Feature test macros allow the programmer to
control the definitions that are exposed by system header
files when a program is compiled. This can be useful for
creating portable applications, by preventing non-standard
definitions from being exposed. Other macros can be used to
expose non-standard definitions that are not exposed by
default. The precise effects of each of the feature test
macros described below can be ascertained by inspecting the
&lt;features.h&gt; header file.</p>

<p>In order to be effective, a feature test macro must be
defined before including any header files. This can either
be done in the compilation command (cc -DMACRO=value) or by
defining the macro within the source code before including
any headers.</p>

<p>Linux/glibc understands the following feature test
macros:</p>

<p>_POSIX_C_SOURCE Defining this macro with the value 1
causes header files to expose definitions conforming to
POSIX.1-1990 and ISO C (1990). Defining with the value
199309 or greater additionally exposes definitions for
POSIX.1b (real-time extensions). Defining with the value
199506 or greater additionally exposes definitions for
POSIX.1c (threads). Defining with the value 200112 exposes
def- initions corresponding to the POSIX.1-2001 base
specification (excluding the XSI extension).</p>

<p>_POSIX_SOURCE Defining this obsolete macro with any
value is equivalent to defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE with the
value 1.</p>

<p>_XOPEN_SOURCE Defining this macro with any value causes
header files to expose definitions conforming to POSIX.1,
POSIX.2, and XPG4. Defining with the value 500 or greater
additionally exposes definitions for SUSv2 (UNIX 98).
Defining with the value 600 or greater additionally exposes
definitions for SUSv3 (UNIX 03; i.e., the POSIX.1-2001 base
specification plus the XSI extension) and C 99
definitions.</p>

<p>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED If this macro is defined with the
value 1, and the _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined, then expose
definitions corresponding to the XPG4v2 UNIX extensions.</p>

<p>_ISOC99_SOURCE Exposes C 99 extensions to ISO C
(1990).</p>

<p>_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE Expose definitions for the
alternative API specified by the LFS (Large File Summit) as
a &quot;transitional extension&quot; the Single UNIX
Specification. (See http://ftp.sas.com/stan-
dards/large.file/.)</p>

<p>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS Defining this macro with the value 64
automatically converts references to 32-bit functions and
data types related to file I/O and file system operations
into references to their 64-bit counterparts. This is useful
for performing I/O on large files (&gt; 2 Gigabytes) on
32-bit systems.</p>

<p>_BSD_SOURCE Defining this macro with any value cause
header files to expose BSD-derived definitions. Defining
this macro also causes BSD definitions to be preferred in
some situations where standards conflict.</p>

<p>_SVID_SOURCE Defining this macro with any value cause
header files to expose System V-derived definitions. (SVID
== System V Interface Defi- nition; see standards(7).)</p>

<p>_GNU_SOURCE Defining this macro (with any value) is
equivalent to defining _BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE,
_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE, _ISOC99_SOURCE _POSIX_C_SOURCE with the
value 1999506, and _XOPEN_SOURCE with the value 600. In
addition, various GNU-specific extensions are also
exposed.</p>

<p>When gcc(1) is invoked, the following macros are defined
by default: _BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE, _POSIX_SOURCE, and
POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506. If individual macros are defined,
then other macros are disabled unless they are also
explicitly defined. (Exception: if POSIX_C_SOURCE is not
otherwise defined, then it is always defined with the value
199506, unless the compiler is invoked in one of its
standard modes, e.g., the -std=c99 flag.) Multiple macros
can be defined; the results are addi- tive.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1 specifies _POSIX_C_SOURCE,
_POSIX_SOURCE, and _XOPEN_SOURCE. _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED was
specified by XPG4v2 (aka SUSv1). _FILE_OFF- SET_BITS is not
specified by any standard, but is employed on some other
implementations. _BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE, and _GNU_SOURCE
are Linux (glibc) specific.</p>

<p>NOTES &lt;features.h&gt; is a Linux/glibc specific
header file. Other systems have an analogous file, but
typically with a different name. This header file is
automatically included by other header files as required: it
is not necessary to explicitly include it in order to employ
feature test macros.</p>
