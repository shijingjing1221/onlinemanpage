<p>PERLFAQ6(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLFAQ6(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlfaq6 - Regular Expressions ($Revision: 1.38 $,
$Date: 2005/12/31 00:54:37 $)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This section is surprisingly small because
the rest of the FAQ is lit- tered with answers involving
regular expressions. For example, decod- ing a URL and
checking whether something is a number are handled with
regular expressions, but those answers are found elsewhere
in this doc- ument (in perlfaq9: &quot;How do I decode or
create those %-encodings on the web&quot; and perlfaq4:
&quot;How do I determine whether a scalar is a num-
ber/whole/integer/float&quot;, to be precise).</p>

<p>How can I hope to use regular expressions without
creating illegible and unmaintainable code?</p>

<p>Three techniques can make regular expressions
maintainable and under- standable.</p>

<p>Comments Outside the Regex Describe what you re doing
and how youre doing it, using normal Perl comments.</p>

<p># turn the line into the first word, a colon, and the #
number of characters on the rest of the line s/^(912</p>

<p>Comments Inside the Regex The &quot;/x&quot; modifier
causes whitespace to be ignored in a regex pat- tern (except
in a character class), and also allows you to use nor- mal
comments there, too. As you can imagine, whitespace and com-
ments help a lot.</p>

<p>&quot;/x&quot; lets you turn this:</p>


<p>s{&lt;(?:[^&gt;&quot;]*&quot;.*?&quot;.*?)+&gt;}{}gs;</p>

<p>into this:</p>

<p>s{ &lt; # opening angle bracket (?: # Non-backreffing
grouping paren [^&gt;&quot;] * # 0 or more things that are
neither &gt; nor nor &quot; # or else &quot;.*?&quot; # a
section between double quotes (stingy match) # or else .*? #
a section between single quotes (stingy match) ) + # all
occurring one or more times &gt; # closing angle bracket
}{}gsx; # replace with nothing, i.e. delete</p>

<p>Its still not quite so clear as prose, but it is very
useful for describing the meaning of each part of the
pattern.</p>

<p>Different Delimiters While we normally think of patterns
as being delimited with &quot;/&quot; characters, they can
be delimited by almost any character. perlre describes this.
For example, the &quot;s///&quot; above uses braces as
delimiters. Selecting another delimiter can avoid quoting
the delimiter within the pattern:</p>

<p>s/usrlocal/usrshare/g; # bad delimiter choice
s#/usr/local#/usr/share#g; # better</p>

<p>m having trouble matching over more than one line. What
s wrong?</p>

<p>Either you dont have more than one line in the string
you re looking at (probably), or else you aren t using the
correct modifier(s) on your pattern (possibly).</p>

<p>There are many ways to get multiline data into a string.
If you want it to happen automatically while reading input,
youll want to set $/ (probably to for paragraphs or
&quot;undef&quot; for the whole file) to allow you to read
more than one line at a time.</p>

<p>Read perlre to help you decide which of &quot;/s&quot;
and &quot;/m&quot; (or both) you might want to use:
&quot;/s&quot; allows dot to include newline, and
&quot;/m&quot; allows caret and dollar to match next to a
newline, not just at the end of the string. You do need to
make sure that youve actually got a multiline string in
there.</p>

<p>For example, this program detects duplicate words, even
when they span line breaks (but not paragraph ones). For
this example, we dont need &quot;/s&quot; because we arent
using dot in a regular expression that we want to cross line
boundaries. Neither do we need &quot;/m&quot; because we
arent wanting caret or dollar to match at any point inside
the record next to newlines. But its imperative that $/ be
set to something other than the default, or else we won t
actually ever have a multiline record read in.</p>

<p>$/ = ; # read in more whole paragraph, not just one line
while ( &lt;&gt; ) { [ 1 while ( /9 2print &quot;Duplicate
$1 at paragraph $.0; } }</p>

<p>Heres code that finds sentences that begin with
&quot;From &quot; (which would be mangled by many
mailers):</p>

<p>$/ = ; # read in more whole paragraph, not just one line
while ( &lt;&gt; ) { while ( /^From /gm ) { # /m makes ^
match next to print &quot;leading from in paragraph $.0; }
}</p>

<p>Heres code that finds everything between START and END
in a paragraph:</p>

<p>undef $/; # read in whole file, not just one line or
paragraph while ( &lt;&gt; ) { while ( /START(.*?)END/sgm )
{ # /s makes . cross line boundaries print &quot;$10; }
}</p>

<p>How can I pull out lines between two patterns that are
themselves on different lines?</p>

<p>You can use Perl s somewhat exotic &quot;..&quot;
operator (documented in per- lop):</p>

<p>perl -ne print if /START/ .. /END/ file1 file2 ...</p>

<p>If you wanted text and not lines, you would use</p>

<p>perl -0777 -ne print &quot;$10 while /START(.*?)END/gs
file1 file2 ...</p>

<p>But if you want nested occurrences of &quot;START&quot;
through &quot;END&quot;, youll run up against the problem
described in the question in this section on matching
balanced text.</p>

<p>Heres another example of using &quot;..&quot;:</p>

<p>while (&lt;&gt;) { $in_header = 1 .. /^$/; $in_body =
/^$/ .. eof(); # now choose between them } continue { reset
if eof(); # fix $. }</p>

<p>I put a regular expression into $/ but it didt work.
Whats wrong?</p>

<p>Up to Perl 5.8.0, $/ has to be a string. This may change
in 5.10, but dont get your hopes up. Until then, you can use
these examples if you really need to do this.</p>

<p>If you have File::Stream, this is easy.</p>

<p>use File::Stream; my $stream = File::Stream-&gt;new(
$filehandle, separator =&gt; qr/,/, );</p>

<p>print &quot;$_0 while &lt;$stream&gt;;</p>

<p>If you don t have File::Stream, you have to do a little
more work.</p>

<p>You can use the four argument form of sysread to
continually add to a buffer. After you add to the buffer,
you check if you have a complete line (using your regular
expression).</p>

<p>local $_ = &quot;&quot;; while( sysread FH, $_, 8192,
length ) { while( s/^((?s).*?)your_pattern/ ) { my $record =
$1; # do stuff here. } }</p>

<p>You can do the same thing with foreach and a match using
the c flag and the G anchor, if you do not mind your entire
file being in memory at the end.</p>

<p>local $_ = &quot;&quot;; while( sysread FH, $_, 8192,
length ) { foreach my $record ( m/G((?s).*?)your_pattern/gc
) { # do stuff here. } substr( $_, 0, pos ) = &quot;&quot;
if pos; }</p>

<p>How do I substitute case insensitively on the LHS while
preserving case on the RHS?</p>

<p>Heres a lovely Perlish solution by Larry Rosler. It
exploits proper- ties of bitwise xor on ASCII strings.</p>

<p>$_= &quot;this is a TEsT case&quot;;</p>

<p>$old = test; $new = success;</p>

<p>s{(Q$old} { uc $new (uc $1 ^ $1) . (uc(substr $1, -1) ^
substr $1, -1) x (length($new) - length $1) }egi;</p>

<p>print;</p>

<p>And here it is as a subroutine, modeled after the
above:</p>

<p>sub preserve_case($$) { my ($old, $new) = @_; my $mask =
uc $old ^ $old;</p>

<p>uc $new $mask . substr($mask, -1) x (length($new) -
length($old)) }</p>

<p>$a = &quot;this is a TEsT case&quot;; $a =~
s/(test)/preserve_case($1, &quot;success&quot;)/egi; print
&quot;$a0;</p>

<p>This prints:</p>

<p>this is a SUcCESS case</p>

<p>As an alternative, to keep the case of the replacement
word if it is longer than the original, you can use this
code, by Jeff Pinyan:</p>

<p>sub preserve_case { my ($from, $to) = @_; my ($lf, $lt)
= map length, @_;</p>

<p>if ($lt &lt; $lf) { $from = substr $from, 0, $lt } else
{ $from .= substr $to, $lf }</p>

<p>return uc $to ($from ^ uc $from); }</p>

<p>This changes the sentence to &quot;this is a SUcCess
case.&quot;</p>

<p>Just to show that C programmers can write C in any
programming lan- guage, if you prefer a more C-like
solution, the following script makes the substitution have
the same case, letter by letter, as the original. (It also
happens to run about 240% slower than the Perlish solution
runs.) If the substitution has more characters than the
string being substituted, the case of the last character is
used for the rest of the substitution.</p>

<p># Original by Nathan Torkington, massaged by Jeffrey
Friedl # sub preserve_case($$) { my ($old, $new) = @_; my
($state) = 0; # 0 = no change; 1 = lc; 2 = uc my ($i,
$oldlen, $newlen, $c) = (0, length($old), length($new)); my
($len) = $oldlen &lt; $newlen ? $oldlen : $newlen;</p>

<p>for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $len; $i++) { if ($c = substr($old,
$i, 1), $c =~ /[W_]/) { $state = 0; } elsif (lc $c eq $c) {
substr($new, $i, 1) = lc(substr($new, $i, 1)); $state = 1; }
else { substr($new, $i, 1) = uc(substr($new, $i, 1)); $state
= 2; } } # finish up with any remaining new (for when new is
longer than old) if ($newlen &gt; $oldlen) { if ($state ==
1) { substr($new, $oldlen) = lc(substr($new, $oldlen)); }
elsif ($state == 2) { substr($new, $oldlen) =
uc(substr($new, $oldlen)); } } return $new; }</p>

<p>How can I make 48&quot; match national character
sets?</p>

<p>Put &quot;use locale;&quot; in your script. The 216class
is taken from the current locale.</p>

<p>See perllocale for details.</p>

<p>How can I match a locale-smart version of
&quot;/[a-zA-Z]/&quot;?</p>

<p>You can use the POSIX character class syntax
&quot;/[[:alpha:]]/&quot; documented in perlre.</p>

<p>No matter which locale you are in, the alphabetic
characters are the characters in 168the digits and the
underscore. As a regex, that looks like &quot;/[^W_]/&quot;.
Its complement, the non-alphabetics, is then everything in W
along with the digits and the underscore, or
&quot;/[W_]/&quot;.</p>

<p>How can I quote a variable to use in a regex?</p>

<p>The Perl parser will expand $variable and @variable
references in regu- lar expressions unless the delimiter is
a single quote. Remember, too, that the right-hand side of a
&quot;s///&quot; substitution is considered a dou-
ble-quoted string (see perlop for more details). Remember
also that any regex special characters will be acted on
unless you precede the substitution with Q. Heres an
example:</p>

<p>$string = &quot;Placido P. Octopus&quot;; $regex =
&quot;P.&quot;;</p>

<p>$string =~ s/$regex/Polyp/; # $string is now
&quot;Polypacido P. Octopus&quot;</p>

<p>Because &quot;.&quot; is special in regular expressions,
and can match any single character, the regex &quot;P.&quot;
here has matched the &lt;Pl&gt; in the original string.</p>

<p>To escape the special meaning of &quot;.&quot;, we use
&quot;Q&quot;:</p>

<p>$string = &quot;Placido P. Octopus&quot;; $regex =
&quot;P.&quot;;</p>

<p>$string =~ s/Q$regex/Polyp/; # $string is now
&quot;Placido Polyp Octopus&quot;</p>

<p>The use of &quot;Q&quot; causes the &lt;.&gt; in the
regex to be treated as a regular character, so that
&quot;P.&quot; matches a &quot;P&quot; followed by a
dot.</p>

<p>What is &quot;/o&quot; really for?</p>

<p>Using a variable in a regular expression match forces a
re-evaluation (and perhaps recompilation) each time the
regular expression is encountered. The &quot;/o&quot;
modifier locks in the regex the first time its used. This
always happens in a constant regular expression, and in
fact, the pattern was compiled into the internal format at
the same time your entire program was.</p>

<p>Use of &quot;/o&quot; is irrelevant unless variable
interpolation is used in the pattern, and if so, the regex
engine will neither know nor care whether the variables
change after the pattern is evaluated the very first
time.</p>

<p>&quot;/o&quot; is often used to gain an extra measure of
efficiency by not per- forming subsequent evaluations when
you know it wont matter (because you know the variables wont
change), or more rarely, when you dont want the regex to
notice if they do.</p>

<p>For example, heres a &quot;paragrep&quot; program:</p>

<p>$/ = ; # paragraph mode $pat = shift; while (&lt;&gt;) {
print if /$pat/o; }</p>

<p>How do I use a regular expression to strip C style
comments from a file?</p>

<p>While this actually can be done, its much harder than
youd think. For example, this one-liner</p>

<p>perl -0777 -pe s{/*?}{}gs foo.c</p>

<p>will work in many but not all cases. You see, its too
simple-minded for certain kinds of C programs, in
particular, those with what appear to be comments in quoted
strings. For that, youd need something like this, created by
Jeffrey Friedl and later modified by Fred Curtis.</p>

<p>$/ = undef; $_ = &lt;&gt;; s#/*([^/*][^*]*)*/ (&quot;(\.
[^&quot;\])*&quot; (\. [^ \])* .[^/&quot; \]*)#defined $2 ?
$2 : &quot;&quot;#gse; print;</p>

<p>This could, of course, be more legibly written with the
&quot;/x&quot; modifier, adding whitespace and comments.
Here it is expanded, courtesy of Fred Curtis.</p>

<p>s{ / ## Start of /* ... */ comment [^*]* ## Non-*
followed by 1-or-more *s ( [^/*][^*]* )* ## 0-or-more things
which don t start with / ## but do end with * / ## End of /*
... */ comment</p>

<p>## OR various things which aren t comments:</p>

<p>( &quot; ## Start of &quot; ... &quot; string ( \. ##
Escaped char ## OR [^&quot;\] ## Non &quot; )* &quot; ## End
of &quot; ... &quot; string</p>

<p>## OR</p>

<p>## Start of ... string ( \. ## Escaped char ## OR [^\]
## Non )* ## End of ... string</p>

<p>## OR</p>

<p>. ## Anything other char [^/&quot;\]* ## Chars which
doesnt start a comment, string or escape ) }{defined $2 ? $2
: &quot;&quot;}gxse;</p>

<p>A slight modification also removes C++ comments:</p>

<p>s#/*([^/*][^*]*)*/ //[^0* (&quot;(\.
[^&quot;\])*&quot;(\.[^\])*.[^/&quot; \]*)#defined $2 ? $2 :
&quot;&quot;#gse;</p>

<p>Can I use Perl regular expressions to match balanced
text?</p>

<p>Historically, Perl regular expressions were not capable
of matching balanced text. As of more recent versions of
perl including 5.6.1 experimental features have been added
that make it possible to do this. Look at the documentation
for the (??{ }) construct in recent perlre manual pages to
see an example of matching balanced parentheses. Be sure to
take special notice of the warnings present in the manual
before making use of this feature.</p>

<p>CPAN contains many modules that can be useful for
matching text depend- ing on the context. Damian Conway
provides some useful patterns in Regexp::Common. The module
Text::Balanced provides a general solution to this
problem.</p>

<p>One of the common applications of balanced text matching
is working with XML and HTML. There are many modules
available that support these needs. Two examples are
HTML::Parser and XML::Parser. There are many others.</p>

<p>An elaborate subroutine (for 7-bit ASCII only) to pull
out balanced and possibly nested single chars, like
&quot;&lsquo;&quot; and &quot;&rsquo;&quot;, &quot;{&quot;
and &quot;}&quot;, or &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot; can be
found in
http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/TOMC/scripts/pull_quotes.gz
.</p>

<p>The C::Scan module from CPAN also contains such subs for
internal use, but they are undocumented.</p>

<p>What does it mean that regexes are greedy? How can I get
around it?</p>

<p>Most people mean that greedy regexes match as much as
they can. Tech- nically speaking, its actually the
quantifiers (&quot;?&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;+&quot;,
&quot;{}&quot;) that are greedy rather than the whole
pattern; Perl prefers local greed and immediate
gratification to overall greed. To get non-greedy ver- sions
of the same quantifiers, use (&quot;??&quot;,
&quot;*?&quot;, &quot;+?&quot;, &quot;{}?&quot;).</p>

<p>An example:</p>

<p>$s1 = $s2 = &quot;I am very very cold&quot;; $s1 =~
s/ve.*y //; # I am cold $s2 =~ s/ve.*?y //; # I am very
cold</p>

<p>Notice how the second substitution stopped matching as
soon as it encountered &quot;y &quot;. The &quot;*?&quot;
quantifier effectively tells the regular expression engine
to find a match as quickly as possible and pass con- trol on
to whatever is next in line, like you would if you were
playing hot potato.</p>

<p>How do I process each word on each line?</p>

<p>Use the split function:</p>

<p>while (&lt;&gt;) { foreach $word ( split ) { # do
something with $word here } }</p>

<p>Note that this isnt really a word in the English sense;
it s just chunks of consecutive non-whitespace
characters.</p>

<p>To work with only alphanumeric sequences (including
underscores), you might consider</p>

<p>while (&lt;&gt;) { foreach $word (m/(144 # do something
with $word here } }</p>

<p>How can I print out a word-frequency or line-frequency
summary?</p>

<p>To do this, you have to parse out each word in the input
stream. Well pretend that by word you mean chunk of
alphabetics, hyphens, or apos- trophes, rather than the
non-whitespace chunk idea of a word given in the previous
question:</p>

<p>while (&lt;&gt;) { ^ W while ( /(_576&quot;
]$seen{$1}++; } } while ( ($word, $count) = each %seen ) {
print &quot;$count $word0; }</p>

<p>If you wanted to do the same thing for lines, you
wouldnt need a regu- lar expression:</p>

<p>while (&lt;&gt;) { $seen{$_}++; } while ( ($line,
$count) = each %seen ) { print &quot;$count $line&quot;;
}</p>

<p>If you want these output in a sorted order, see
perlfaq4: &quot;How do I sort a hash (optionally by value
instead of key)?&quot;.</p>

<p>How can I do approximate matching?</p>

<p>See the module String::Approx available from CPAN.</p>

<p>How do I efficiently match many regular expressions at
once?</p>

<p>( contributed by brian d foy )</p>

<p>Avoid asking Perl to compile a regular expression every
time you want to match it. In this example, perl must
recompile the regular expres- sion for every iteration of
the foreach() loop since it has no way to know what $pattern
will be.</p>

<p>@patterns = qw( foo bar baz );</p>

<p>LINE: while( &lt;&gt; ) { foreach $pattern ( @patterns )
{ p a t print if /t e r n next LINE; } }</p>

<p>The qr// operator showed up in perl 5.005. It compiles a
regular expression, but doesn t apply it. When you use the
pre-compiled ver- sion of the regex, perl does less work. In
this example, I inserted a map() to turn each pattern into
its pre-compiled form. The rest of the script is the same,
but faster.</p>

<p>@patterns = map { qr/_</p>

<p>LINE: while( &lt;&gt; ) { foreach $pattern ( @patterns )
{ p a t print if /t e r n next LINE; } }</p>

<p>In some cases, you may be able to make several patterns
into a single regular expression. Beware of situations that
require backtracking though.</p>

<p>$regex = join , qw( foo bar baz );</p>

<p>LINE: while( &lt;&gt; ) { ? : $ r print if /e g e x )
}</p>

<p>For more details on regular expression efficiency, see
Mastering Regu- lar Expressions by Jeffrey Freidl. He
explains how regular expressions engine work and why some
patterns are surprisingly inefficient. Once you understand
how perl applies regular expressions, you can tune them for
individual situations.</p>

<p>b Why dot word-boundary searches with &quot;&quot; work
for me?</p>

<p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p>r e a Ensure that you know what ldoes: its the boundary
between l y a word character, 1128 thing that isnt a word
character might be W, but it can also be the start or end of
the string.</p>

<p>It s not (not!) the boundary between whitespace and
non-whitespace, and it s not the stuff between words we use
to create sentences.</p>

<p>i s a &quot; z e r o w i d t h a In regex speak, a word
boundary (s s e r t i o n &quot; , m e a n - ing that it
doesnt represent a character in the string, but a condi-
tion at a certain position.</p>

<p>e For the regular expression, /r lbefore the
&quot;P&quot; and after the &quot;l&quot;. As long as
something other than a word character precedes the
&quot;P&quot; and succeeds the &quot;l&quot;, the pattern
will e match. These strings match /r l</p>

<p>&quot;Perl&quot; # no word char before P or after l
&quot;Perl &quot; # same as previous (space is not a word
char) &quot;Perl&quot; # the char is not a word char
&quot;Perl s&quot; # no word char before P, non-word char
after &quot;l&quot;</p>

<p>e These strings do not match /r l</p>

<p>&quot;Perl_&quot; # _ is a word char! &quot;Perler&quot;
# no word char before P, but one after l</p>

<p>t You don t have to use omatch words though. You can
look for non- word characters surrounded by word characters.
These strings match the pattern /</p>

<p>&quot;dont&quot; # the char is surrounded by
&quot;n&quot; and &quot;t&quot; &quot;qepa&quot; # the char
is surrounded by &quot;p&quot; and &quot;a&quot;</p>

<p>These strings do not match /</p>

<p>&quot;foo&quot; # there is no word char after
non-word</p>

<p>0 n o t b e a w o r You can also use the complement of d
b o u n d a r y .</p>

<p>In the pattern /0 word character before the
&quot;a&quot; and after the &quot;m&quot;. These patterns
match /0 &quot;llama&quot; # &quot;am&quot; surrounded by
word chars &quot;Samuel&quot; # same</p>

<p>These strings do not match /0 &quot;Sam&quot; # no word
boundary before &quot;a&quot;, but one after &quot;m&quot;
&quot;I am Sam&quot; # &quot;am&quot; surrounded by non-word
chars</p>

<p>Why does using $&amp;, , or $slow my program down?</p>

<p>(contributed by Anno Siegel)</p>

<p>Once Perl sees that you need one of these variables
anywhere in the program, it provides them on each and every
pattern match. That means that on every pattern match the
entire string will be copied, part of it to $ , part to
$&amp;, and part to $. Thus the penalty is most severe with
long strings and patterns that match often. Avoid $&amp;, $,
and $ if you can, but if you cant, once youve used them at
all, use them at will because youve already paid the price.
Remember that some algo- rithms really appreciate them. As
of the 5.005 release, the $&amp; variable is no longer
&quot;expensive&quot; the way the other two are.</p>

<p>Since Perl 5.6.1 the special variables @- and @+ can
functionally replace $, $&amp; and $. These arrays contain
pointers to the beginning and end of each match (see perlvar
for the full story), so they give you essentially the same
information, but without the risk of excessive string
copying.</p>

<p>What good is G&quot; in a regular expression?</p>

<p>You use the &quot;G&quot; anchor to start the next match
on the same string where the last match left off. The
regular expression engine cannot skip over any characters to
find the next match with this anchor, so &quot;G&quot; is
similar to the beginning of string anchor, &quot;^&quot;.
The &quot;G&quot; anchor is typically used with the
&quot;g&quot; flag. It uses the value of pos() as the
position to start the next match. As the match operator
makes successive matches, it updates pos() with the position
of the next character past the last match (or the first
character of the next match, depending on how you like to
look at it). Each string has its own pos() value.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to match all of consective pairs of
digits in a string like &quot;1122a44&quot; and stop
matching when you encounter non-digits. You want to match 11
and 22 but the letter &lt;a&gt; shows up between 22 and 44
and you want to stop at &quot;a&quot;. Simply matching pairs
of digits skips over the &quot;a&quot; and still matches
44.</p>

<p>$_ = &quot;1122a44&quot;; my @pairs = m/()/g; # qw( 11
22 44 )</p>

<p>If you use the G anchor, you force the match after 22 to
start with the &quot;a&quot;. The regular expression cannot
match there since it does not find a digit, so the next
match fails and the match operator returns the pairs it
already found.</p>

<p>$_ = &quot;1122a44&quot;; my @pairs = m/G()/g; # qw( 11
22 )</p>

<p>You can also use the &quot;G&quot; anchor in scalar
context. You still need the &quot;g&quot; flag.</p>

<p>$_ = &quot;1122a44&quot;; while( m/G()/g ) { print
&quot;Found $10; }</p>

<p>After the match fails at the letter &quot;a&quot;, perl
resets pos() and the next match on the same string starts at
the beginning.</p>

<p>$_ = &quot;1122a44&quot;; while( m/G()/g ) { print
&quot;Found $10; }</p>

<p>print &quot;Found $1 after while&quot; if m/()/g; #
finds &quot;11&quot;</p>

<p>You can disable pos() resets on fail with the
&quot;c&quot; flag. Subsequent matches start where the last
successful match ended (the value of pos()) even if a match
on the same string as failed in the meantime. In this case,
the match after the while() loop starts at the &quot;a&quot;
(where the last match stopped), and since it does not use
any anchor it can skip over the &quot;a&quot; to find
&quot;44&quot;.</p>

<p>$_ = &quot;1122a44&quot;; while( m/G()/gc ) { print
&quot;Found $10; }</p>

<p>print &quot;Found $1 after while&quot; if m/()/g; #
finds &quot;44&quot;</p>

<p>Typically you use the &quot;G&quot; anchor with the
&quot;c&quot; flag when you want to try a different match if
one fails, such as in a tokenizer. Jeffrey Friedl offers
this example which works in 5.004 or later.</p>

<p>while (&lt;&gt;) { chomp; PARSER: { m/ G( + )/gcx
&amp;&amp; do { print &quot;number: $10; redo; }; m/ G( 1224
m/ G( )/gcx &amp;&amp; do { print &quot;space: $10; redo; };
m/ G( [^1152 } }</p>

<p>For each line, the PARSER loop first tries to match a
series of digits followed by a word boundary. This match has
to start at the place the last match left off (or the
beginning of the string on the first ) / g match). Since
&quot;m/ G( +cuses the &quot;c&quot; flag, if the string x
&quot; does not match that regular expression, perl does not
reset pos() and the next match starts at the same position
to try a different pattern.</p>

<p>Are Perl regexes DFAs or NFAs? Are they POSIX
compliant?</p>

<p>While its true that Perls regular expressions resemble
the DFAs (deterministic finite automata) of the egrep(1)
program, they are in fact implemented as NFAs
(non-deterministic finite automata) to allow backtracking
and backreferencing. And they aren t POSIX-style either,
because those guarantee worst-case behavior for all cases.
(It seems that some people prefer guarantees of consistency,
even when whats guaranteed is slowness.) See the book
&quot;Mastering Regular Expressions&quot; (from O Reilly) by
Jeffrey Friedl for all the details you could ever hope to
know on these matters (a full citation appears in
perlfaq2).</p>

<p>Whas wrong with using grep in a void context?</p>

<p>The problem is that grep builds a return list,
regardless of the con- text. This means youre making Perl go
to the trouble of building a list that you then just throw
away. If the list is large, you waste both time and space.
If your intent is to iterate over the list, then use a for
loop for this purpose.</p>

<p>In perls older than 5.8.1, map suffers from this problem
as well. But since 5.8.1, this has been fixed, and map is
context aware - in void context, no lists are
constructed.</p>

<p>How can I match strings with multibyte characters?</p>

<p>Starting from Perl 5.6 Perl has had some level of
multibyte character support. Perl 5.8 or later is
recommended. Supported multibyte char- acter repertoires
include Unicode, and legacy encodings through the Encode
module. See perluniintro, perlunicode, and Encode.</p>

<p>If you are stuck with older Perls, you can do Unicode
with the &quot;Uni- code::String&quot; module, and character
conversions using the &quot;Uni- code::Map8&quot; and
&quot;Unicode::Map&quot; modules. If you are using Japanese
encodings, you might try using the jperl 5.005_03.</p>

<p>Finally, the following set of approaches was offered by
Jeffrey Friedl, whose article in issue #5 of The Perl
Journal talks about this very matter.</p>

<p>Lets suppose you have some weird Martian encoding where
pairs of ASCII uppercase letters encode single Martian
letters (i.e. the two bytes &quot;CV&quot; make a single
Martian letter, as do the two bytes &quot;SG&quot;,
&quot;VS&quot;, &quot;XX&quot;, etc.). Other bytes represent
single characters, just like ASCII.</p>

<p>So, the string of Martian &quot;I am CVSGXX!&quot; uses
12 bytes to encode the nine characters I, , a, m, , CV, SG,
XX, !.</p>

<p>Now, say you want to search for the single character
&quot;/GX/&quot;. Perl doesnt know about Martian, so itll
find the two bytes &quot;GX&quot; in the &quot;I am
CVSGXX!&quot; string, even though that character isnt there:
it just looks like it is because &quot;SG&quot; is next to
&quot;XX&quot;, but there s no real &quot;GX&quot;. This is
a big problem.</p>

<p>Here are a few ways, all painful, to deal with it:</p>

<p>$martian =~ s/([A-Z][A-Z])/ $1 /g; # Make sure adjacent
&quot;martian&quot; # bytes are no longer adjacent. print
&quot;found GX!0 if $martian =~ /GX/;</p>

<p>Or like this:</p>

<p>@chars = $martian =~ m/([A-Z][A-Z][^A-Z])/g; # above is
conceptually similar to: @chars = $text =~ m/(.)/g; #
foreach $char (@chars) { print &quot;found GX!0, last if
$char eq GX; }</p>

<p>Or like this:</p>

<p>while ($martian =~ m/G([A-Z][A-Z].)/gs) { # G probably
unneeded print &quot;found GX!0, last if $1 eq GX; }</p>

<p>Here s another, slightly less painful, way to do it from
Benjamin Gold- berg, who uses a zero-width negative
look-behind assertion.</p>

<p>print &quot;found GX!0 if $martian =~ m/ (?&lt;![A-Z])
(?:[A-Z][A-Z])*? GX /x;</p>

<p>This succeeds if the &quot;martian&quot; character GX is
in the string, and fails otherwise. If you dont like using
(?&lt;!), a zero-width negative look- behind assertion, you
can replace (?&lt;![A-Z]) with (?:^ [^A-Z]).</p>

<p>It does have the drawback of putting the wrong thing in
$-[0] and $+[0], but this usually can be worked around.</p>

<p>How do I match a pattern that is supplied by the
user?</p>

<p>Well, if its really a pattern, then just use</p>

<p>chomp($pattern = &lt;STDIN&gt;); if ($line =~
/$pattern/) { }</p>

<p>Alternatively, since you have no guarantee that your
user entered a valid regular expression, trap the exception
this way:</p>

<p>if (eval { $line =~ /$pattern/ }) { }</p>

<p>If all you really want is to search for a string, not a
pattern, then you should either use the index() function,
which is made for string searching, or, if you cant be
disabused of using a pattern match on a non-pattern, then be
sure to use &quot;Q&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>$pattern = &lt;STDIN&gt;;</p>

<p>open (FILE, $input) or die &quot;Couldnt open input
$input: $!; aborting&quot;; while (&lt;FILE&gt;) { print if
/Q$pattern; } close FILE;</p>
