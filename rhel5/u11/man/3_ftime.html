<p>FTIME(3) Linux Programmer s Manual FTIME(3)</p>

<p>NAME ftime - return date and time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/timeb.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ftime(struct timeb *tp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Return current date and time in tp, which is
declared as follows:</p>

<p>struct timeb { time_t time; unsigned short millitm;
short timezone; short dstflag; };</p>

<p>Here time is the number of seconds since the epoch,
millitm is the num- ber of milliseconds since time seconds
since the epoch, timezone is the local time zone measured in
minutes of time west of Greenwich, and dst- flag is a flag
that, if non-zero, indicates that Daylight Saving time
applies locally during the appropriate part of the year.</p>

<p>These days the contents of the timezone and dstflag
fields are unde- fined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE This function always returns 0.</p>

<p>BUGS This function is obsolete. Dont use it. If the time
in seconds suf- fices, time(2) can be used; gettimeofday(2)
gives microseconds; clock_gettime(3) gives nanoseconds but
is not yet widely available.</p>

<p>Under libc4 and libc5 the millitm field is meaningful.
But early glibc2 is buggy and returns 0 there; glibc 2.1.1
is correct again.</p>

<p>HISTORY The ftime() function appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.2BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO gettimeofday(2), time(2)</p>
