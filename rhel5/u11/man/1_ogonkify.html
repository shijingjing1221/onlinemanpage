<p>NAME ogonkify - international support for PostScript</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ogonkify [-p procset] [-e encoding] [-r
Old=New] [-a] [-c] [-h] [-t] [-A] [-C] [-H] [-T] [-AT] [-CT]
[-ATH] [-CTH] [-E] [-N] [-M] [-mp] [-SO] [-AX] [-F] [-RS]
[--] file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ogonkify does various munging of PostScript
files related to printing in different languages. Its main
use is to filter the output of Netscape, Mosaic and other
programs in order to print in languages that don t use the
standard Western-European encoding (ISO 8859-1).</p>

<p>SUMMARY USAGE Installation instructions are provided in
the file INSTALL. Assuming the installation has been
correctly completed, save the PostScript out- put of
Netscape or Mosaic to a file, say output.ps. Then print it
using</p>

<p>% ogonkify -AT -N output.ps | lpr</p>

<p>in the case of Netscape, or</p>

<p>% ogonkify -AT -M output.ps | lpr</p>

<p>in the case of Mosaic.</p>

<p>You may want to change the -AT option to -CT in order to
use a high quality Courier font from IBM (at the price of
slower printing).</p>

<p>An alternative way to print from Netscape is to set the
printing com- mand in the printing dialog box to:</p>

<p>ogonkify -AT -N | lpr</p>

<p>For more details, see the USAGE section below.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p Includes the specified procset in the output
file.</p>

<p>-e Set the encoding of the output. Defaults to L2 (ISO
8859-2, a.k.a. ISO Latin-2). Other possible values are L1
(ISO 8859-1, a.k.a. ISO Latin-1), L3 (ISO 8859-3, a.k.a. ISO
Latin-3), L4 (ISO 8859-4, a.k.a. ISO Latin-4), L5 (ISO
8859-9, a.k.a. ISO Latin-5), L6 (ISO 8859-10, a.k.a. ISO
Latin-6), L7 (ISO 8859-13, a.k.a. ISO Latin-7), L9 (ISO
8859-15, a.k.a. ISO Latin-9), CP1250 (Microsoft Code Page
1250, a.k.a. CeP), ibmpc (Original IBM-PC encoding), mac
(Apple Macintosh encoding) and hp (HP Roman Encoding).</p>

<p>-r Use the font New in place of Old. Will lead to ugly
or unread- able output when the metrics mismatch.</p>

<p>-a Do the right font remappings for using Courier-Ogonki
in place of Courier (the a stands for Adobe Courier). This
avoids downloading any fonts to the printer.</p>

<p>-c Do the right font remappings for using IBM Courier in
place of Adobe Courier.</p>

<p>-t Do the right font remappings for using
Times-Roman-Ogonki in place of Times-Roman.</p>

<p>-h Do the right font remappings for using
Helvetica-Ogonki in place of Helvetica.</p>

<p>-A Like -a but also downloads the Courier-Ogonki
fonts.</p>

<p>-C Like -c, but also downloads the IBM Courier
fonts.</p>

<p>-H Like -h, but also downloads the Helvetica-xxx-Ogonki
fonts.</p>

<p>-T Like -t, but also downloads the Times-xxx-Ogonki
fonts.</p>

<p>-CT Equivalent to -C -T.</p>

<p>-CTH Equivalent to -C -T -H.</p>

<p>-E Add the Euro currency sign to all standard fonts (use
with -e L9).</p>

<p>-N Do Netscape processing.</p>

<p>-M Do Mosaic processing.</p>

<p>-mp Do mp processing. Will not work with the -A option
(use -C instead).</p>

<p>-SO Do StarOffice processing.</p>

<p>-AX Do ApplixWare processing.</p>

<p>-F Do XFig processing.</p>

<p>-RS Recode standard fonts. This is likely to work with
applications that leave fonts in AdobeStandardEncoding,
typically applica- tions that do not even support printing
even of characters.</p>

<p>-- End options.</p>

<p>USAGE Let us assume that you want to print a WWW page
encoded in ISO Latin-2. Netscape stubbornly insists on
printing it as ISO Latin-1. By using the File-&gt;Print
command, have Netscape send the output to a file, say ala-
makota.ps.</p>

<p>As ogonkify is configured for ISO Latin-2 by default,
passing it the PostScript generated by Netscape will correct
the encoding of the fonts. It is enough to do:</p>

<p>% ogonkify -N &lt;alamakota.ps | lpr</p>

<p>However, most printers do not have fonts with the needed
characters installed; synthetized fonts will be downloaded
and used instead of Courier and Times-Roman with -AT, and a
very good Courier font from IBM will be used with: -CT. The
command will therefore typically be:</p>

<p>% ogonkify -N -AT &lt;alamakota.ps | lpr</p>

<p>or eventually</p>

<p>% ogonkify -N -CT &lt;alamakota.ps | lpr</p>

<p>Typical usage with other programs is:</p>

<p>% ogonkify -M -AT &lt;alamakota.ps | lpr % ogonkify -mp
-AT &lt;alamakota.ps | lpr % ogonkify -SO -AT
&lt;alamakota.ps | lpr % ogonkify -AX -ATH &lt;alamakota.ps
| lpr % ogonkify -XF -ATH &lt;alamakota.ps | lpr</p>

<p>BUGS Characters with an ogonek should be constructed
differently (for instance, the ogonek used with an a should
be differently shaped than the one used with an e.)</p>

<p>It would be better to patch the programs we have the
sources to than to post-process the produced PostScript.</p>

<p>The program is written in Perl.</p>

<p>NOTES In order to view the output PostScript with
Ghostscript, you might need to run gs with the flag
-dNOPLATFONTS, and ghostview with the flag -arguments
-dNOPLATFONTS.</p>

<p>Netscape, IBM, Adobe, PostScript, StarOffice, ApplixWare
and possibly others are registered trademarks.</p>

<p>THANKS Much of the composite character data have been
provided by Primoz Peterlin, H. Turgut Uyar, Ricardas Cepas,
Kristof Petrovay and Jan Prikryl.</p>

<p>Jacek Pliszka provided the support for StarOffice.
Andrzej Baginski provided the support for ApplixWare.</p>

<p>Markku Rossi wrote genscript and provided many useful
encoding vectors with the distribution.</p>

<p>Throughout writing the Postscript code, I used the
ghostscript inter- preter, by Peter Deutsch.</p>

<p>Larry Wall wrote perl, the syntax and semantics of which
are a never ending source of puzzlement.</p>

help from loads of people.</p>
