<p>SEND-UUCP(8) SEND-UUCP(8)</p>

<p>NAME send-nntp, send-ihave - send Usenet articles to
remote site</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS send-nntp [ -d ] sitename:hostname | sitename [
sitename:hostname | sitename .. ]</p>

<p>send-ihave [ -d ] sitename:hostname | sitename [
sitename:hostname | sitename .. ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The send-* utilities are scripts that
process the batch files written by innd(8) to send Usenet
articles to a remote NNTP site.</p>

<p>The sites to be fed may be specified by giving sitename
hostname pairs on the command line.</p>

<p>The sitename is the label the site has in the newsfeeds
file, the host- name is the real hostname of the remote
site, a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name). Normally, the
sitename and the hostname are the same, and as such dont
have to be specified as sitename:hostname pairs but just as
a sitename.</p>

<p>send-nntp starts an innxmit to send the articles to the
remote site.</p>

<p>send-ihave encapsulates the articles in an ihave control
message and uses inews to send the articles to a to.sitename
pseudo-group. Using send-ihave is discouraged, nobody uses
it anymore and even the author of this manpage is unsure as
to how it actually works or used to work.</p>

<p>send-* expect that the batchfile for a site is named
&lt;pathoutgo- ing in inn.conf&gt;/sitename. To prevent
batchfile corruption, shlock(1) is used to lock these
files.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d The -d flag causes nntpsend to send output to
stdout rather than the log file &lt;pathlog in
inn.conf&gt;/&lt;program-name&gt;.log.</p>

<p>NOTES You should probably not use send-nntp, but
innfeed, or if that is not possible, nntpsend.</p>

<p>The usual flags for a batch file for send-nntp are
Tf,Wfm.</p>
