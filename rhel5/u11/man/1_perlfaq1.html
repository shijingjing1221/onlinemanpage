PERLFAQ1(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlfaq1 - General Questions About Perl ($Revision:
1.19 $, $Date: 2005/12/31 00:54:37 $)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This section of the FAQ answers very
general, high-level questions about Perl.</p>

<p>What is Perl?</p>

<p>Perl is a high-level programming language with an
eclectic heritage written by Larry Wall and a cast of
thousands. It derives from the ubiquitous C programming
language and to a lesser extent from sed, awk, the Unix
shell, and at least a dozen other tools and languages. Perls
process, file, and text manipulation facilities make it
particularly well-suited for tasks involving quick
prototyping, system utilities, software tools, system
management tasks, database access, graphical programming,
networking, and world wide web programming. These strengths
make it especially popular with system administrators and
CGI script authors, but mathematicians, geneticists,
journalists, and even managers also use Perl. Maybe you
should, too.</p>

<p>Who supports Perl? Who develops it? Why is it free?</p>

<p>The original culture of the pre-populist Internet and
the deeply-held beliefs of Perls author, Larry Wall, gave
rise to the free and open distribution policy of perl. Perl
is supported by its users. The core, the standard Perl
library, the optional modules, and the documen- tation youre
reading now were all written by volunteers. See the per-
sonal note at the end of the README file in the perl source
distribu- tion for more details. See perlhist (new as of
5.005) for Perls mile- stone releases.</p>

<p>In particular, the core development team (known as the
Perl Porters) are a rag-tag band of highly altruistic
individuals committed to pro- ducing better software for
free than you could hope to purchase for money. You may
snoop on pending developments via the archives at
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/ and
http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/ or the
news gate- way nntp://nntp.perl.org/perl.perl5.porters or
its web interface at
http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters , or read the
faq at http://simon-cozens.org/writings/p5p-faq , or you can
subscribe to the mailing list by sending
perl5-porters-request@perl.org a subscription request (an
empty message with no subject is fine).</p>

<p>While the GNU project includes Perl in its
distributions, theres no such thing as &quot;GNU Perl&quot;.
Perl is not produced nor maintained by the Free Software
Foundation. Perls licensing terms are also more open than
GNU softwares tend to be.</p>

<p>You can get commercial support of Perl if you wish,
although for most users the informal support will more than
suffice. See the answer to &quot;Where can I buy a
commercial version of perl?&quot; for more information.</p>

<p>Which version of Perl should I use?</p>

<p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p>There is often a matter of opinion and taste, and there
isnt any one answer that fits anyone. In general, you want
to use either the cur- rent stable release, or the stable
release immediately prior to that one. Currently, those are
perl5.8.x and perl5.6.x, respectively.</p>

<p>Beyond that, you have to consider several things and
decide which is best for you.</p>

<p>&middot; If things arent broken, upgrading perl may
break them (or at least issue new warnings).</p>

<p>&middot; The latest versions of perl have more bug
fixes.</p>

<p>&middot; The Perl community is geared toward supporting
the most recent releases, so youll have an easier time
finding help for those.</p>

<p>&middot; Versions prior to perl5.004 had serious
security problems with buffer overflows, and in some cases
have CERT advisories (for instance,
http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1997-17.html ).</p>

<p>&middot; The latest versions are probably the least
deployed and widely tested, so you may want to wait a few
months after their release and see what problems others have
if you are risk averse.</p>

<p>&middot; The immediate, previous releases (i.e.
perl5.6.x ) are usually maintained for a while, although not
at the same level as the cur- rent releases.</p>

<p>&middot; No one is actively supporting perl4.x. Five
years ago it was a dead camel carcass (according to this
document). Now its barely a skeleton as its whitewashed
bones have fractured or eroded.</p>

<p>&middot; There is no perl6.x for the next couple of
years. Stay tuned, but dont worry that youll have to change
major versions of Perl soon (i.e. before 2006).</p>

<p>&middot; There are really two tracks of perl
development: a maintenance ver- sion and an experimental
version. The maintenance versions are stable, and have an
even number as the minor release (i.e. perl5.8.x, where 8 is
the minor release). The experimental ver- sions may include
features that dont make it into the stable ver- sions, and
have an odd number as the minor release (i.e. perl5.9.x,
where 9 is the minor release).</p>

<p>What are perl4, perl5, or perl6?</p>

<p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p>In short, perl4 is the past, perl5 is the present, and
perl6 is the future.</p>

<p>The number after perl (i.e. the 5 after perl5) is the
major release of the perl interpreter as well as the version
of the language. Each major version has significant
differences that earlier versions cannot support.</p>

<p>The current major release of Perl is perl5, and was
released in 1994. It can run scripts from the previous major
release, perl4 (March 1991), but has significant
differences. It introduced the concept of refer- ences,
complex data structures, and modules. The perl5 interpreter
was a complete re-write of the previous perl sources.</p>

<p>Perl6 is the next major version of Perl, but its still
in development in both its syntax and design. The work
started in 2002 and is still ongoing. Many of the most
interesting features have shown up in the latest versions of
perl5, and some perl5 modules allow you to use some perl6
syntax in your programs. You can learn more about perl6 at
http://dev.perl.org/perl6/ .</p>

<p>See perlhist for a history of Perl revisions.</p>

<p>What is Ponie?</p>

<p>At The O Reilly Open Source Software Convention in 2003,
Artur Bergman, Fotango, and The Perl Foundation announced a
project to run perl5 on the Parrot virtual machine named
Ponie. Ponie stands for Perl On New Internal Engine. The
Perl 5.10 language implementation will be used for Ponie,
and there will be no language level differences between
perl5 and ponie. Ponie is not a complete rewrite of
perl5.</p>

<p>For more details, see http://www.poniecode.org/</p>

<p>What is perl6?</p>

<p>At The Second O Reilly Open Source Software Convention,
Larry Wall announced Perl6 development would begin in
earnest. Perl6 was an oft used term for Chip Salzenbergs
project to rewrite Perl in C++ named Topaz. However, Topaz
provided valuable insights to the next version of Perl and
its implementation, but was ultimately abandoned.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about Perl6, or have a desire
to help in the crusade to make Perl a better place then
peruse the Perl6 developers page at
http://dev.perl.org/perl6/ and get involved.</p>

<p>Perl6 is not scheduled for release yet, and Perl5 will
still be sup- ported for quite awhile after its release. Do
not wait for Perl6 to do whatever you need to do.</p>

<p>&quot;Were really serious about reinventing everything
that needs reinvent- ing.&quot; --Larry Wall</p>

<p>How stable is Perl?</p>

<p>Production releases, which incorporate bug fixes and new
functionality, are widely tested before release. Since the
5.000 release, we have averaged only about one production
release per year.</p>

<p>Larry and the Perl development team occasionally make
changes to the internal core of the language, but all
possible efforts are made toward backward compatibility.
While not quite all perl4 scripts run flaw- lessly under
perl5, an update to perl should nearly never invalidate a
program written for an earlier version of perl (barring
accidental bug fixes and the rare new keyword).</p>

<p>Is Perl difficult to learn?</p>

<p>No, Perl is easy to start learning--and easy to keep
learning. It looks like most programming languages youre
likely to have experience with, so if youve ever written a C
program, an awk script, a shell script, or even a BASIC
program, youre already partway there.</p>

<p>Most tasks only require a small subset of the Perl
language. One of the guiding mottos for Perl development is
&quot;theres more than one way to do it&quot; (TMTOWTDI,
sometimes pronounced &quot;tim toady&quot;). Perls learn-
ing curve is therefore shallow (easy to learn) and long
(theres a whole lot you can do if you really want).</p>

<p>Finally, because Perl is frequently (but not always, and
certainly not by definition) an interpreted language, you
can write your programs and test them without an
intermediate compilation step, allowing you to experiment
and test/debug quickly and easily. This ease of experimen-
tation flattens the learning curve even more.</p>

<p>Things that make Perl easier to learn: Unix experience,
almost any kind of programming experience, an understanding
of regular expressions, and the ability to understand other
peoples code. If there s something you need to do, then its
probably already been done, and a working example is usually
available for free. Don t forget the new perl mod- ules,
either. They re discussed in Part 3 of this FAQ, along with
CPAN, which is discussed in Part 2.</p>

<p>How does Perl compare with other languages like Java,
Python, REXX, Scheme, or Tcl?</p>

<p>Favorably in some areas, unfavorably in others.
Precisely which areas are good and bad is often a personal
choice, so asking this question on Usenet runs a strong risk
of starting an unproductive Holy War.</p>

<p>Probably the best thing to do is try to write equivalent
code to do a set of tasks. These languages have their own
newsgroups in which you can learn about (but hopefully not
argue about) them.</p>

<p>Some comparison documents can be found at
http://www.perl.com/doc/FMTEYEWTK/versus/ if you really cant
stop yourself.</p>

<p>Can I do [task] in Perl?</p>

<p>Perl is flexible and extensible enough for you to use on
virtually any task, from one-line file-processing tasks to
large, elaborate systems. For many people, Perl serves as a
great replacement for shell script- ing. For others, it
serves as a convenient, high-level replacement for most of
what theyd program in low-level languages like C or C++. Its
ultimately up to you (and possibly your management) which
tasks youll use Perl for and which you wont.</p>

<p>If you have a library that provides an API, you can make
any component of it available as just another Perl function
or variable using a Perl extension written in C or C++ and
dynamically linked into your main perl interpreter. You can
also go the other direction, and write your main program in
C or C++, and then link in some Perl code on the fly, to
create a powerful application. See perlembed.</p>

<p>That said, there will always be small, focused,
special-purpose lan- guages dedicated to a specific problem
domain that are simply more con- venient for certain kinds
of problems. Perl tries to be all things to all people, but
nothing special to anyone. Examples of specialized languages
that come to mind include prolog and matlab.</p>

<p>When shouldt I program in Perl?</p>

<p>When your manager forbids it--but do consider replacing
them :-).</p>

<p>Actually, one good reason is when you already have an
existing applica- tion written in another language thats all
done (and done well), or you have an application language
specifically designed for a certain task (e.g. prolog,
make).</p>

<p>For various reasons, Perl is probably not well-suited
for real-time embedded systems, low-level operating systems
development work like device drivers or context-switching
code, complex multi-threaded shared-memory applications, or
extremely large applications. Youll notice that perl is not
itself written in Perl.</p>

<p>The new, native-code compiler for Perl may eventually
reduce the limi- tations given in the previous statement to
some degree, but understand that Perl remains fundamentally
a dynamically typed language, not a statically typed one.
You certainly wont be chastised if you dont trust
nuclear-plant or brain-surgery monitoring code to it. And
Larry will sleep easier, too--Wall Street programs not
withstanding. :-)</p>

<p>Whas the difference between &quot;perl&quot; and
&quot;Perl&quot;?</p>

<p>One bit. Oh, you werent talking ASCII? :-) Larry now
uses &quot;Perl&quot; to signify the language proper and
&quot;perl&quot; the implementation of it, i.e. the current
interpreter. Hence Toms quip that &quot;Nothing but perl can
parse Perl.&quot; You may or may not choose to follow this
usage. For example, parallelism means &quot;awk and
perl&quot; and &quot;Python and Perl&quot; look OK, while
&quot;awk and Perl&quot; and &quot;Python and perl&quot; do
not. But never write &quot;PERL&quot;, because perl is not
an acronym, apocryphal folklore and post- facto expansions
notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Is it a Perl program or a Perl script?</p>

<p>Larry doesnt really care. He says (half in jest) that
&quot;a script is what you give the actors. A program is
what you give the audience.&quot;</p>

<p>Originally, a script was a canned sequence of normally
interactive com- mands--that is, a chat script. Something
like a UUCP or PPP chat script or an expect script fits the
bill nicely, as do configuration scripts run by a program at
its start up, such .cshrc or .ircrc, for example. Chat
scripts were just drivers for existing programs, not
stand-alone programs in their own right.</p>

<p>A computer scientist will correctly explain that all
programs are interpreted and that the only question is at
what level. But if you ask this question of someone who isn
t a computer scientist, they might tell you that a program
has been compiled to physical machine code once and can then
be run multiple times, whereas a script must be translated
by a program each time its used.</p>

<p>Perl programs are (usually) neither strictly compiled
nor strictly interpreted. They can be compiled to a
byte-code form (something of a Perl virtual machine) or to
completely different languages, like C or assembly language.
You cant tell just by looking at it whether the source is
destined for a pure interpreter, a parse-tree interpreter, a
byte-code interpreter, or a native-code compiler, so it s
hard to give a definitive answer here.</p>

<p>Now that &quot;script&quot; and &quot;scripting&quot;
are terms that have been seized by unscrupulous or unknowing
marketeers for their own nefarious purposes, they have begun
to take on strange and often pejorative meanings, like
&quot;non serious&quot; or &quot;not real programming&quot;.
Consequently, some Perl pro- grammers prefer to avoid them
altogether.</p>

<p>What is a JAPH?</p>

<p>These are the &quot;just another perl hacker&quot;
signatures that some people sign their postings with. Randal
Schwartz made these famous. About 100 of the earlier ones
are available from http://www.cpan.org/misc/japh .</p>

<p>Where can I get a list of Larry Wall witticisms?</p>

<p>Over a hundred quips by Larry, from postings of his or
source code, can be found at
http://www.cpan.org/misc/lwall-quotes.txt.gz .</p>

<p>How can I convince my sysadmin/supervisor/employees to
use version 5/5.6.1/Perl instead of some other language?</p>

<p>If your manager or employees are wary of unsupported
software, or soft- ware which doesn t officially ship with
your operating system, you might try to appeal to their
self-interest. If programmers can be more productive using
and utilizing Perl constructs, functionality, simplic- ity,
and power, then the typical manager/supervisor/employee may
be persuaded. Regarding using Perl in general, its also
sometimes help- ful to point out that delivery times may be
reduced using Perl compared to other languages.</p>

<p>If you have a project which has a bottleneck, especially
in terms of translation or testing, Perl almost certainly
will provide a viable, quick solution. In conjunction with
any persuasion effort, you should not fail to point out that
Perl is used, quite extensively, and with extremely reliable
and valuable results, at many large computer soft- ware and
hardware companies throughout the world. In fact, many Unix
vendors now ship Perl by default. Support is usually just a
news-post- ing away, if you cant find the answer in the
comprehensive documenta- tion, including this FAQ.</p>

<p>See http://www.perl.org/advocacy/ for more
information.</p>

<p>If you face reluctance to upgrading from an older
version of perl, then point out that version 4 is utterly
unmaintained and unsupported by the Perl Development Team.
Another big sell for Perl5 is the large number of modules
and extensions which greatly reduce development time for any
given task. Also mention that the difference between version
4 and version 5 of Perl is like the difference between awk
and C++. (Well, OK, maybe it s not quite that distinct, but
you get the idea.) If you want support and a reasonable
guarantee that what you re developing will continue to work
in the future, then you have to run the supported version.
As of December 2003 that means running either 5.8.2
(released in November 2003), or one of the older releases
like 5.6.2 (also released in November 2003; a maintenance
release to let perl 5.6 com- pile on newer systems as 5.6.1
was released in April 2001) or 5.005_03 (released in March
1999), although 5.004_05 isnt that bad if you abso- lutely
need such an old version (released in April 1999) for
stability reasons. Anything older than 5.004_05 shouldnt be
used.</p>

<p>Of particular note is the massive bug hunt for buffer
overflow problems that went into the 5.004 release. All
releases prior to that, includ- ing perl4, are considered
insecure and should be upgraded as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In August 2000 in all Linux distributions a new security
problem was found in the optional suidperl (not built or
installed by default) in all the Perl branches 5.6, 5.005,
and 5.004, see http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/sperl-2000-08-05/
Perl maintenance releases 5.6.1 and 5.8.0 have this security
hole closed. Most, if not all, Linux distribution have
patches for this vulnerability available, see
http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/ , but the most
recommendable way is to upgrade to at least Perl 5.6.1.</p>
