<p>SYSLOG(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SYSLOG(2)</p>

<p>NAME syslog, klogctl - read and/or clear kernel message
ring buffer; set console_loglevel</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int syslog(int type, char *bufp, int len); /*
No wrapper provided in glibc */</p>

<p>/* The glibc interface */ #include
&lt;sys/klog.h&gt;</p>

<p>int klogctl(int type, char *bufp, int len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If you need the libc function syslog()
(which talks to syslogd(8)), then look at syslog(3). The
system call of this name is about control- ling the kernel
printk() buffer, and the glibc version is called
klogctl().</p>

<p>The type argument determines the action taken by this
function.</p>

<p>Quoting from kernel/printk.c: /* * Commands to
sys_syslog: * * 0 -- Close the log. Currently a NOP. * 1 --
Open the log. Currently a NOP. * 2 -- Read from the log. * 3
-- Read up to the last 4k of messages in the ring buffer. *
4 -- Read and clear last 4k of messages in the ring buffer *
5 -- Clear ring buffer. * 6 -- Disable printks to console *
7 -- Enable printks to console * 8 -- Set level of messages
printed to console * 9 -- Return number of unread characters
in the log buffer */</p>

<p>Only function 3 is allowed to non-root processes.
(Function 9 was added in 2.4.10.)</p>

<p>The kernel log buffer The kernel has a cyclic buffer of
length LOG_BUF_LEN (4096, since 1.3.54: 8192, since 2.1.113:
16384; in recent kernels the size can be set at compile
time) in which messages given as argument to the kernel
function printk() are stored (regardless of their
loglevel).</p>

<p>The call syslog() (2,buf,len) waits until this kernel
log buffer is nonempty, and then reads at most len bytes
into the buffer buf. It returns the number of bytes read.
Bytes read from the log disappear from the log buffer: the
information can only be read once. This is the function
executed by the kernel when a user program reads
/proc/kmsg.</p>

<p>The call syslog() (3,buf,len) will read the last len
bytes from the log buffer (nondestructively), but will not
read more than was written into the buffer since the last
clear ring buffer command (which does not clear the buffer
at all). It returns the number of bytes read.</p>

<p>The call syslog() (4,buf,len) does precisely the same,
but also exe- cutes the clear ring buffer command.</p>

<p>The call syslog() (5,dummy,idummy) only executes the
clear ring buffer command.</p>

<p>The loglevel The kernel routine printk() will only print
a message on the console, if it has a loglevel less than the
value of the variable con- sole_loglevel. This variable
initially has the value DEFAULT_CON- SOLE_LOGLEVEL (7), but
is set to 10 if the kernel command line contains the word
debug, and to 15 in case of a kernel fault (the 10 and 15
are just silly, and equivalent to 8). This variable is set
(to a value in the range 1-8) by the call syslog()
(8,dummy,value). The calls sys- log() (type,dummy,idummy)
with type equal to 6 or 7, set it to 1 (ker- nel panics
only) or 7 (all except debugging messages),
respectively.</p>

<p>Every text line in a message has its own loglevel. This
level is DEFAULT_MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL - 1 (6) unless the line
starts with &lt;d&gt; where d is a digit in the range 1-7,
in which case the level is d. The con- ventional meaning of
the loglevel is defined in &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt; as
follows:</p>

<p>#define KERN_EMERG &quot;&lt;0&gt;&quot; /* system is
unusable */ #define KERN_ALERT &quot;&lt;1&gt;&quot; /*
action must be taken immediately */ #define KERN_CRIT
&quot;&lt;2&gt;&quot; /* critical conditions */ #define
KERN_ERR &quot;&lt;3&gt;&quot; /* error conditions */
#define KERN_WARNING &quot;&lt;4&gt;&quot; /* warning
conditions */ #define KERN_NOTICE &quot;&lt;5&gt;&quot; /*
normal but significant condition */ #define KERN_INFO
&quot;&lt;6&gt;&quot; /* informational */ #define KERN_DEBUG
&quot;&lt;7&gt;&quot; /* debug-level messages */</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE In case of error, -1 is returned, and errno
is set. Otherwise, for type equal to 2, 3 or 4, syslog()
returns the number of bytes read, and otherwise 0.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL Bad parameters.</p>

<p>EPERM An attempt was made to change console_loglevel or
clear the ker- nel message ring buffer by a process without
root permissions.</p>

<p>ERESTARTSYS System call was interrupted by a signal;
nothing was read. (This can be seen only during a
trace.)</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is Linux specific and
should not be used in programs intended to be portable.</p>

<p>NOTES From the very start people noted that it is
unfortunate that kernel call and library routine of the same
name are entirely different ani- mals. In libc4 and libc5
the number of this call was defined by SYS_klog. In glibc
2.0 the syscall is baptised klogctl().</p>
