<p>WPRINTF(3) Linux Programmer s Manual WPRINTF(3)</p>

<p>NAME wprintf, fwprintf, swprintf, vwprintf, vfwprintf,
vswprintf - formatted wide character output conversion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>int wprintf(const wchar_t *format, ...); int
fwprintf(FILE *stream, const wchar_t *format, ...); int
swprintf(wchar_t *wcs, size_t maxlen, const wchar_t *format,
...);</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;</p>

<p>int vwprintf(const wchar_t *format, va_list args); int
vfwprintf(FILE *stream, const wchar_t *format, va_list
args); int vswprintf(wchar_t *wcs, size_t maxlen, const
wchar_t *format, va_list args);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wprintf() family of functions is the
wide-character equivalent of the printf() family of
functions. It performs formatted output of wide
characters.</p>

<p>The wprintf() and vwprintf() functions perform wide
character output to stdout. stdout must not be byte
oriented; see function fwide() for more information.</p>

<p>The fwprintf() and vfwprintf() functions perform wide
character output to stream. stream must not be byte
oriented; see function fwide() for more information.</p>

<p>The swprintf() and vswprintf() functions perform wide
character output to an array of wide characters. The
programmer must ensure that there is room for at least
maxlen wide characters at wcs.</p>

<p>These functions are like the printf(), vprintf(),
fprintf(), vfprintf(), sprintf(), vsprintf() functions
except for the following differences:</p>

<p>&middot; The format string is a wide character
string.</p>

<p>&middot; The output consists of wide characters, not
bytes.</p>

<p>&middot; swprintf() and vswprintf() take a maxlen
argument, sprintf() and vsprintf() do not. (snprintf() and
vsnprintf() take a maxlen argument, but these functions do
not return -1 upon buffer over- flow on Linux.)</p>

<p>The treatment of the conversion characters c and s is
different:</p>

<p>c If no l modifier is present, the int argument is
converted to a wide character by a call to the btowc()
function, and the resulting wide character is written. If an
l modifier is present, the wint_t (wide character) argument
is written.</p>

<p>s If no l modifier is present: The const char * argument
is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type
(pointer to a string) containing a multibyte character
sequence beginning in the initial shift state. Characters
from the array are con- verted to wide characters (each by a
call to the mbrtowc() function with a conversion state
starting in the initial state before the first byte). The
resulting wide characters are writ- ten up to (but not
including) the terminating null wide charac- ter. If a
precision is specified, no more wide characters than the
number specified are written. Note that the precision
determines the number of wide characters written, not the
number of bytes or screen positions. The array must contain
a termi- nating null byte, unless a precision is given and
it is so small that the number of converted wide characters
reaches it before the end of the array is reached. If an l
modifier is present: The const wchar_t * argument is
expected to be a pointer to an array of wide characters.
Wide characters from the array are written up to (but not
including) a terminating null wide char- acter. If a
precision is specified, no more than the number specified
are written. The array must contain a terminating null wide
character, unless a precision is given and it is smaller
than or equal to the number of wide characters in the
array.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The functions return the number of wide
characters written, excluding the terminating null wide
character in case of the functions swprintf() and
vswprintf(). They return -1 when an error occurs.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO fprintf(3), fputwc(3), fwide(3), printf(3),
snprintf(3), wscanf(3)</p>

<p>NOTES The behaviour of wprintf() et al. depends on the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.</p>

<p>If the format string contains non-ASCII wide characters,
the program will only work correctly if the LC_CTYPE
category of the current locale at run time is the same as
the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale at compile time.
This is because the wchar_t representation is platform and
locale dependent. (The GNU libc represents wide characters
using their Unicode (ISO-10646) code point, but other
platforms dont do this. Also, the use of C99 universal
character names of the form nnnn does not solve this
problem.) Therefore, in internationalized programs, the
format string should consist of ASCII wide characters only,
or should be constructed at run time in an internationalized
way (e.g. using gettext() or iconv(), followed by
mbstowcs()).</p>
