<p>NAME passwd.nntp - passwords for connecting to remote
NNTP servers</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file passwd.nntp in pathetc contains
host / name / password triplets for use when authenticating
client programs to NNTP servers. This file is normally
interpreted by NNTPsendpassword() in libinn(3). Blank lines
and lines beginning with a number sign (&quot;#&quot;) are
ignored. All other lines should consist of three or four
fields separated by colons:</p>

<p>host:name:password host:name:password:style</p>

<p>The first field is the name of a host, and is matched in
a case-insen- sitive manner. (No detailed matching, such as
comparing IP addresses, is done.)</p>

<p>The second field is a user name, and the third is a
password. If either the username or password is empty, then
that portion of the authentication will not occur. (For
example, when connecting to a remote INN for peering, only
the password is needed.)</p>

<p>The optional fourth field specifies the type of
authentication to use. At present, the only recognized
&quot;authentication style&quot; is &quot;authinfo&quot;;
this is also the default. It means that NNTP
&quot;authinfo&quot; commands are used to authenticate to
the remote host. (The &quot;authinfo&quot; command is a
common extension to RFC 977.)</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>## UUNET needs a password, MIT doesnt.
mit.edu:bbn::authinfo uunet.uu.net:bbn:yoyoma:authinfo</p>

<p>This file should not be world-readable.</p>
