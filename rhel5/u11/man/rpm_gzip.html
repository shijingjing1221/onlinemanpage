<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) GZIP(1) GZIP(1)</p>

<p>NAME gzip, gunzip, zcat - compress or expand files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gzip [ -acdfhlLnNrtvV19 ] [-S suffix] [ name
... ] gunzip [ -acfhlLnNrtvV ] [-S suffix] [ name ... ] zcat
[ -fhLV ] [ name ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Gzip reduces the size of the named files
using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77). Whenever possible, each file
is replaced by one with the extension .gz, while keeping the
same ownership modes, access and modi- fication times. (The
default extension is -gz for VMS, z for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT,
Windows NT FAT and Atari.) If no files are specified, or if
a file name is &quot;-&quot;, the standard input is
compressed to the standard output. Gzip will only attempt to
compress regular files. In particu- lar, it will ignore
symbolic links.</p>

<p>If the compressed file name is too long for its file
system, gzip trun- cates it. Gzip attempts to truncate only
the parts of the file name longer than 3 characters. (A part
is delimited by dots.) If the name consists of small parts
only, the longest parts are truncated. For example, if file
names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe is
compressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz. Names are not truncated on
systems which do not have a limit on file name length.</p>

<p>By default, gzip keeps the original file name and
timestamp in the com- pressed file. These are used when
decompressing the file with the -N option. This is useful
when the compressed file name was truncated or when the time
stamp was not preserved after a file transfer.</p>

<p>Compressed files can be restored to their original form
using gzip -d or gunzip or zcat. If the original name saved
in the compressed file is not suitable for its file system,
a new name is constructed from the original one to make it
legal.</p>

<p>gunzip takes a list of files on its command line and
replaces each file whose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, _z
or .Z and which begins with the correct magic number with an
uncompressed file without the original extension. gunzip
also recognizes the special extensions .tgz and .taz as
shorthands for .tar.gz and .tar.Z respectively. When
compressing, gzip uses the .tgz extension if necessary
instead of truncating a file with a .tar extension.</p>

<p>gunzip can currently decompress files created by gzip,
zip, compress, compress -H or pack. The detection of the
input format is automatic. When using the first two formats,
gunzip checks a 32 bit CRC. For pack, gunzip checks the
uncompressed length. The standard compress format was not
designed to allow consistency checks. However gunzip is
sometimes able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error
when uncompressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file
is correct simply because the standard uncompress does not
complain. This generally means that the standard uncompress
does not check its input, and happily generates garbage
output. The SCO compress -H format (lzh compression method)
does not include a CRC but also allows some consistency
checks.</p>

<p>Files created by zip can be uncompressed by gzip only if
they have a single member compressed with the deflation
method. This feature is only intended to help conversion of
tar.zip files to the tar.gz format. To extract a zip file
with a single member, use a command like gunzip &lt;foo.zip
or gunzip -S .zip foo.zip. To extract zip files with several
members, use unzip instead of gunzip.</p>

<p>zcat is identical to gunzip -c. (On some systems, zcat
may be installed as gzcat to preserve the original link to
compress.) zcat uncompresses either a list of files on the
command line or its standard input and writes the
uncompressed data on standard output. zcat will uncompress
files that have the correct magic number whether they have a
.gz suffix or not.</p>

<p>Gzip uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in zip and
PKZIP. The amount of compression obtained depends on the
size of the input and the dis- tribution of common
substrings. Typically, text such as source code or English
is reduced by 60-70%. Compression is generally much better
than that achieved by LZW (as used in compress), Huffman
coding (as used in pack), or adaptive Huffman coding
(compact).</p>

<p>Compression is always performed, even if the compressed
file is slightly larger than the original. The worst case
expansion is a few bytes for the gzip file header, plus 5
bytes every 32K block, or an expansion ratio of 0.015% for
large files. Note that the actual number of used disk blocks
almost never increases. gzip preserves the mode, ownership
and timestamps of files when compressing or
decompressing.</p>

<p>The gzip file format is specified in P. Deutsch, GZIP
file format spec- ification version 4.3,
&lt;ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1952.txt&gt;, Inter- net
RFC 1952 (May 1996). The zip deflation format is specified
in P. Deutsch, DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification
version 1.3, &lt;ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1951.txt&gt;,
Internet RFC 1951 (May 1996).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a --ascii Ascii text mode: convert end-of-lines
using local conventions. This option is supported only on
some non-Unix systems. For MSDOS, CR LF is converted to LF
when compressing, and LF is con- verted to CR LF when
decompressing.</p>

<p>-c --stdout --to-stdout Write output on standard output;
keep original files unchanged. If there are several input
files, the output consists of a sequence of independently
compressed members. To obtain better compression,
concatenate all input files before compressing them.</p>

<p>-d --decompress --uncompress Decompress.</p>

<p>-f --force Force compression or decompression even if
the file has multiple links or the corresponding file
already exists, or if the com- pressed data is read from or
written to a terminal. If the input data is not in a format
recognized by gzip, and if the option --stdout is also
given, copy the input data without change to the standard
output: let zcat behave as cat. If -f is not given, and when
not running in the background, gzip prompts to verify
whether an existing file should be overwritten.</p>

<p>-h --help Display a help screen and quit.</p>

<p>-l --list For each compressed file, list the following
fields:</p>

<p>compressed size: size of the compressed file
uncompressed size: size of the uncompressed file ratio:
compression ratio (0.0% if unknown) uncompressed_name: name
of the uncompressed file</p>

<p>The uncompressed size is given as -1 for files not in
gzip for- mat, such as compressed .Z files. To get the
uncompressed size for such a file, you can use:</p>

<p>zcat file.Z | wc -c</p>

<p>In combination with the --verbose option, the following
fields are also displayed:</p>

<p>method: compression method crc: the 32-bit CRC of the
uncompressed data date &amp; time: time stamp for the
uncompressed file</p>

<p>The compression methods currently supported are deflate,
com- press, lzh (SCO compress -H) and pack. The crc is given
as ffffffff for a file not in gzip format.</p>

<p>With --name, the uncompressed name, date and time are
those stored within the compress file if present.</p>

<p>With --verbose, the size totals and compression ratio
for all files is also displayed, unless some sizes are
unknown. With --quiet, the title and totals lines are not
displayed.</p>

<p>-L --license Display the gzip license and quit.</p>

<p>-n --no-name When compressing, do not save the original
file name and time stamp by default. (The original name is
always saved if the name had to be truncated.) When
decompressing, do not restore the original file name if
present (remove only the gzip suffix from the compressed
file name) and do not restore the original time stamp if
present (copy it from the compressed file). This option is
the default when decompressing.</p>

<p>-N --name When compressing, always save the original
file name and time stamp; this is the default. When
decompressing, restore the original file name and time stamp
if present. This option is useful on systems which have a
limit on file name length or when the time stamp has been
lost after a file transfer.</p>

<p>-q --quiet Suppress all warnings.</p>

<p>-r --recursive Travel the directory structure
recursively. If any of the file names specified on the
command line are directories, gzip will descend into the
directory and compress all the files it finds there (or
decompress them in the case of gunzip ).</p>

<p>-S .suf --suffix .suf Use suffix .suf instead of .gz.
Any suffix can be given, but suffixes other than .z and .gz
should be avoided to avoid confu- sion when files are
transferred to other systems. A null suffix forces gunzip to
try decompression on all given files regard- less of suffix,
as in:</p>

<p>gunzip -S &quot;&quot; * (*.* for MSDOS)</p>

<p>Previous versions of gzip used the .z suffix. This was
changed to avoid a conflict with pack(1).</p>

<p>-t --test Test. Check the compressed file integrity.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Verbose. Display the name and percentage
reduction for each file compressed or decompressed.</p>

<p>-V --version Version. Display the version number and
compilation options then quit.</p>

<p>-# --fast --best Regulate the speed of compression using
the specified digit #, where -1 or --fast indicates the
fastest compression method (less compression) and -9 or
--best indicates the slowest com- pression method (best
compression). The default compression level is -6 (that is,
biased towards high compression at expense of speed).</p>

<p>ADVANCED USAGE Multiple compressed files can be
concatenated. In this case, gunzip will extract all members
at once. For example:</p>

<p>gzip -c file1 &gt; foo.gz gzip -c file2 &gt;&gt;
foo.gz</p>

<p>Then</p>

<p>gunzip -c foo</p>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<p>cat file1 file2</p>

<p>In case of damage to one member of a .gz file, other
members can still be recovered (if the damaged member is
removed). However, you can get better compression by
compressing all members at once:</p>

<p>cat file1 file2 | gzip &gt; foo.gz</p>

<p>compresses better than</p>

<p>gzip -c file1 file2 &gt; foo.gz</p>

<p>If you want to recompress concatenated files to get
better compression, do:</p>

<p>gzip -cd old.gz | gzip &gt; new.gz</p>

<p>If a compressed file consists of several members, the
uncompressed size and CRC reported by the --list option
applies to the last member only. If you need the
uncompressed size for all members, you can use:</p>

<p>gzip -cd file.gz | wc -c</p>

<p>If you wish to create a single archive file with
multiple members so that members can later be extracted
independently, use an archiver such as tar or zip. GNU tar
supports the -z option to invoke gzip transpar- ently. gzip
is designed as a complement to tar, not as a
replacement.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variable GZIP can hold a set
of default options for gzip. These options are interpreted
first and can be overwritten by explicit command line
parameters. For example: for sh: GZIP=&quot;-8v
--name&quot;; export GZIP for csh: setenv GZIP &quot;-8v
--name&quot; for MSDOS: set GZIP=-8v --name</p>

<p>On Vax/VMS, the name of the environment variable is
GZIP_OPT, to avoid a conflict with the symbol set for
invocation of the program.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Exit status is normally 0; if an error
occurs, exit status is 1. If a warning occurs, exit status
is 2.</p>

<p>Usage: gzip [-cdfhlLnNrtvV19] [-S suffix] [file ...]
Invalid options were specified on the command line.</p>

<p>file: not in gzip format The file specified to gunzip
has not been compressed.</p>

<p>file: Corrupt input. Use zcat to recover some data. The
compressed file has been damaged. The data up to the point
of failure can be recovered using</p>

<p>zcat file &gt; recover</p>

<p>file: compressed with xx bits, can only handle yy bits
File was compressed (using LZW) by a program that could deal
with more bits than the decompress code on this machine.
Recom- press the file with gzip, which compresses better and
uses less memory.</p>

<p>file: already has .gz suffix -- no change The file is
assumed to be already compressed. Rename the file and try
again.</p>

<p>file already exists; do you wish to overwrite (y or n)?
Respond &quot;y&quot; if you want the output file to be
replaced; &quot;n&quot; if not.</p>

<p>gunzip: corrupt input A SIGSEGV violation was detected
which usually means that the input file has been
corrupted.</p>

<p>xx.x% Percentage of the input saved by compression.
(Relevant only for -v and -l.)</p>

<p>-- not a regular file or directory: ignored When the
input file is not a regular file or directory, (e.g. a
symbolic link, socket, FIFO, device file), it is left
unaltered.</p>

<p>-- has xx other links: unchanged The input file has
links; it is left unchanged. See ln(1) for more information.
Use the -f flag to force compression of multi- ply-linked
files.</p>

<p>CAVEATS When writing compressed data to a tape, it is
generally necessary to pad the output with zeroes up to a
block boundary. When the data is read and the whole block is
passed to gunzip for decompression, gunzip detects that
there is extra trailing garbage after the compressed data
and emits a warning by default. You have to use the --quiet
option to suppress the warning. This option can be set in
the GZIP environment variable as in: for sh:
GZIP=&quot;-q&quot; tar -xfz --block-compress /dev/rst0 for
csh: (setenv GZIP -q; tar -xfz --block-compr /dev/rst0</p>

<p>In the above example, gzip is invoked implicitly by the
-z option of GNU tar. Make sure that the same block size (-b
option of tar) is used for reading and writing compressed
data on tapes. (This example assumes you are using the GNU
version of tar.)</p>

<p>BUGS The gzip format represents the the input size
modulo 2^32, so the --list option reports incorrect
uncompressed sizes and compression ratios for uncompressed
files 4 GB and larger. To work around this problem, you can
use the following command to discover a large uncom- pressed
files true size:</p>

<p>zcat file.gz | wc -c</p>

<p>The --list option reports sizes as -1 and crc as
ffffffff if the com- pressed file is on a non seekable
media.</p>

<p>In some rare cases, the --best option gives worse
compression than the default compression level (-6). On some
highly redundant files, com- press compresses better than
gzip.</p>
