<p>NAME dvitype - translate a dvi file for humans</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dvitype dvi_name[.dvi]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>The dvitype program translates a DVI (DeVice
Independent) file output by (for example) tex(1) or
gftodvi(1), to a file that humans can read. It also serves
as a DVI file-validating program (i.e., if dvitype can read
it, its correct) and as an example of a DVI-reading program
for future device drivers.</p>

<p>The output file can include all commands, just the
important ones, or none at all (in which case only errors
are reported). A subinterval of pages may be selected for
transliteration; the magnification and reso- lution of the
output device may be changed; and so on. All options are
specified with an on-line dialog.</p>

<p>The .dvi extension is supplied if omitted from dvi_name.
The output goes to stdout.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variable TEXFONTS is used to
search for the TFM files used in the DVI file. See tex(1)
for the details of the searching. If TEXFONTS is not set, it
uses the system default.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO gftype(1), pktype(1). Donald E. Knuth,
TeXfornroffware.</p>

<p>BUGS The interactive dialog should be replaced by
command-line options, as with gftype.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Donald E. Knuth wrote the program. It was
published as part of the TeX for nroffware technical report,
available from the TeX Users Group. Howard Trickey and Pavel
Curtis originally ported it to Unix.</p>
