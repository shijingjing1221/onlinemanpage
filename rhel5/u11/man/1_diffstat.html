<p>DIFFSTAT(1) DIFFSTAT(1)</p>

<p>NAME diffstat - make histogram from diff-output</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS diffstat [options] [file-specifications]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program reads the output of diff and
displays a histogram of the insertions, deletions, and
modifications per-file. Diffstat is a pro- gram that is
useful for reviewing large, complex patch files. It reads
from one or more input files which contain output from diff,
producing a histogram of the total lines changed for each
file referenced. If the input filename ends with .bz2, .Z or
.gz, diffstat will read the uncompressed data via a pipe
from the corresponding program.</p>

<p>Diffstat recognizes the most popular types of output
from diff:</p>

<p>unified preferred by the patch utility.</p>

<p>context best for readability, but not very compact.</p>

<p>default not good for much, but simple to generate.</p>

<p>Diffstat detects the lines that are output by diff to
tell which files are compared, and then counts the markers
in the first column that denote the type of change
(insertion, deletion or modification). These are shown in
the histogram as &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot; and
&quot;!&quot; characters.</p>

<p>If no filename is given on the command line, diffstat
reads the differ- ences from the standard input.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c prefix each line of output with
&quot;#&quot;, making it a comment-line for shell
scripts.</p>

<p>-e file redirect standard error to file.</p>

<p>-f format specify the format of the histogram.</p>

<p>0 for concise, which shows only the value and a single
his- togram code for each of insert (+), delete (-) or
modify (!)</p>

<p>1 for normal output,</p>

<p>2 to fill in the histogram with dots,</p>

<p>4 to print each value with the histogram.</p>

<p>Any nonzero value gives a histogram. The dots and
individual values can be combined, e.g., -f6 gives both.</p>

<p>-h prints the usage message and exits.</p>

<p>-k suppress the merging of filenames in the report.</p>

<p>-l lists only the filenames. No histogram is
generated.</p>

<p>-n number specify the minimum width used for filenames.
If you dont specify this, diffstat uses the length of the
longest filename, after stripping common prefixes.</p>

<p>-o file redirect standard output to file.</p>

<p>-p number override the logic that strips common
pathnames, simulating the patch &quot;-p&quot; option.</p>

<p>-r code provides optional rounding of the data shown in
histogram, rather than truncating with error
adjustments.</p>

<p>0 is the default. No rounding is performed, but
accumulated errors are added to following columns.</p>

<p>1 rounds the data</p>

<p>2 rounds the data and adjusts the histogram to ensure
that it displays something if there are any differences even
if those would normally be rounded to zero.</p>

<p>-t overrides the histogram, generates output of comma
separated values.</p>

<p>-u suppress the sorting of filenames in the report.</p>

<p>-v show progress, e.g., if the output is redirected to a
file, write progress messages to the standard error.</p>

<p>-V prints the current version number and exits.</p>

<p>-w number specify the maximum width of the histogram.
The histogram will never be shorter than 10 columns, just in
case the filenames get too large.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Diffstat runs in a portable UNIX&reg;
environment.</p>

<p>FILES Diffstat is a single binary module, which uses no
auxiliary files.</p>

<p>BUGS Diffstat makes a lot of assumptions about the
format of a diff file.</p>

<p>There is no way to obtain a filename from the standard
diff between two files with no options. Context diffs work,
as well as unified diffs.</p>

<p>Theres no easy way to determine the degree of overlap
between the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot;
displays of modified lines.</p>
