<p>NAME regex - POSIX.2 regular expressions</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Regular expressions (REs), as defined in
POSIX.2, come in two forms: modern REs (roughly those of
egrep; 1003.2 calls these extended REs) and obsolete REs
(roughly those of ed(1); 1003.2 basic REs). Obsolete REs
mostly exist for backward compatibility in some old
programs; they will be discussed at the end. 1003.2 leaves
some aspects of RE syntax and semantics open; (!) marks
decisions on these aspects that may not be fully portable to
other 1003.2 implemen- tations.</p>

<p>A (modern) RE is one(!) or more non-empty(!) branches,
separated by |. It matches anything that matches one of the
branches.</p>

<p>A branch is one(!) or more pieces, concatenated. It
matches a match for the first, followed by a match for the
second, etc.</p>

<p>A piece is an atom possibly followed by a single(!) *, +
, ?, or bound. An atom followed by * matches a sequence of 0
or more matches of the atom. An atom followed by + matches a
sequence of 1 or more matches of the atom. An atom followed
by ? matches a sequence of 0 or 1 matches of the atom.</p>

<p>A bound is { followed by an unsigned decimal integer,
possibly fol- lowed by , possibly followed by another
unsigned decimal integer, always followed by }. The integers
must lie between 0 and RE_DUP_MAX (255(!)) inclusive, and if
there are two of them, the first may not exceed the second.
An atom followed by a bound containing one integer i and no
comma matches a sequence of exactly i matches of the atom.
An atom followed by a bound containing one integer i and a
comma matches a sequence of i or more matches of the atom.
An atom followed by a bound containing two integers i and j
matches a sequence of i through j (inclusive) matches of the
atom.</p>

<p>An atom is a regular expression enclosed in () (matching
a match for the regular expression), an empty set of ()
(matching the null string)(!), a bracket expression (see
below), . (matching any single character), ^ (matching the
null string at the beginning of a line), $ (matching the
null string at the end of a line), a followed by one of the
characters ^.[$()|*+?{ (matching that character taken as an
ordinary character), a followed by any other character(!)
(matching that character taken as an ordinary character, as
if the had not been present(!)), or a single character with
no other signifi- cance (matching that character). A {
followed by a character other than a digit is an ordinary
character, not the beginning of a bound(!). It is illegal to
end an RE with .</p>

<p>A bracket expression is a list of characters enclosed in
[]. It nor- mally matches any single character from the list
(but see below). If the list begins with ^, it matches any
single character (but see below) not from the rest of the
list. If two characters in the list are separated by -, this
is shorthand for the full range of charac- ters between
those two (inclusive) in the collating sequence, e.g. [0-9]
in ASCII matches any decimal digit. It is illegal(!) for two
ranges to share an endpoint, e.g. a-c-e. Ranges are very
collating- sequence-dependent, and portable programs should
avoid relying on them.</p>

<p>To include a literal ] in the list, make it the first
character (fol- lowing a possible ^). To include a literal
-, make it the first or last character, or the second
endpoint of a range. To use a literal - as the first
endpoint of a range, enclose it in [. and .] to make it a
collating element (see below). With the exception of these
and some combinations using [ (see next paragraphs), all
other spe- cial characters, including , lose their special
significance within a bracket expression.</p>

<p>Within a bracket expression, a collating element (a
character, a multi- character sequence that collates as if
it were a single character, or a collating-sequence name for
either) enclosed in [. and .] stands for the sequence of
characters of that collating element. The sequence is a
single element of the bracket expressions list. A bracket
expression containing a multi-character collating element
can thus match more than one character, e.g. if the
collating sequence includes a ch collating element, then the
RE [[.ch.]]*c matches the first five characters of
chchcc.</p>

<p>Within a bracket expression, a collating element
enclosed in [= and =] is an equivalence class, standing for
the sequences of characters of all collating elements
equivalent to that one, including itself. (If there are no
other equivalent collating elements, the treatment is as if
the enclosing delimiters were [. and .] .) For example, if o
and ^ are the members of an equivalence class, then [[=o=]],
[[=^=]], and [o^] are all synonymous. An equivalence class
may not(!) be an endpoint of a range.</p>

<p>Within a bracket expression, the name of a character
class enclosed in [: and :] stands for the list of all
characters belonging to that class. Standard character class
names are:</p>

<p>alnum digit punct alpha graph space blank lower upper
cntrl print xdigit</p>

<p>These stand for the character classes defined in
wctype(3). A locale may provide others. A character class
may not be used as an endpoint of a range.</p>

<p>In the event that an RE could match more than one
substring of a given string, the RE matches the one starting
earliest in the string. If the RE could match more than one
substring starting at that point, it matches the longest.
Subexpressions also match the longest possible substrings,
subject to the constraint that the whole match be as long as
possible, with subexpressions starting earlier in the RE
taking pri- ority over ones starting later. Note that
higher-level subexpressions thus take priority over their
lower-level component subexpressions.</p>

<p>Match lengths are measured in characters, not collating
elements. A null string is considered longer than no match
at all. For example, bb* matches the three middle characters
of abbbc, (wee|week)(knights|nights) matches all ten
characters of weeknights , when (.*).* is matched against
abc the parenthesized subexpression matches all three
characters, and when (a*)* is matched against bc both the
whole RE and the parenthesized subexpression match the null
string.</p>

<p>If case-independent matching is specified, the effect is
much as if all case distinctions had vanished from the
alphabet. When an alphabetic that exists in multiple cases
appears as an ordinary character outside a bracket
expression, it is effectively transformed into a bracket
expression containing both cases, e.g. x becomes [xX]. When
it appears inside a bracket expression, all case
counterparts of it are added to the bracket expression, so
that (e.g.) [x] becomes [xX] and [^x] becomes [^xX].</p>

<p>No particular limit is imposed on the length of REs(!).
Programs intended to be portable should not employ REs
longer than 256 bytes, as an implementation can refuse to
accept such REs and remain POSIX-com- pliant.</p>

<p>Obsolete (basic) regular expressions differ in several
respects. | , + , and ? are ordinary characters and there is
no equivalent for their functionality. The delimiters for
bounds are and , with { and } by themselves ordinary
characters. The parentheses for nested subexpressions are
and , with ( and ) by them- selves ordinary characters. ^ is
an ordinary character except at the beginning of the RE
or(!) the beginning of a parenthesized subexpres- sion, $ is
an ordinary character except at the end of the RE or(!) the
end of a parenthesized subexpression, and * is an ordinary
char- acter if it appears at the beginning of the RE or the
beginning of a parenthesized subexpression (after a possible
leading ^ ). Finally, there is one new type of atom, a back
reference: followed by a non- zero decimal digit d matches
the same sequence of characters matched by the dth
parenthesized subexpression (numbering subexpressions by the
positions of their opening parentheses, left to right), so
that (e.g.) c]1 matches bb or cc but not bc.</p>

<p>POSIX.2, section 2.8 (Regular Expression Notation).</p>

<p>BUGS Having two kinds of REs is a botch.</p>

<p>The current 1003.2 spec says that ) is an ordinary
character in the absence of an unmatched (; this was an
unintentional result of a wording error, and change is
likely. Avoid relying on it.</p>

<p>Back references are a dreadful botch, posing major
problems for effi- cient implementations. They are also
somewhat vaguely defined (does ab*2*d match abbbd?). Avoid
using them.</p>

<p>1003.2s specification of case-independent matching is
vague. The one case implies all cases definition given above
is current con- sensus among implementors as to the right
interpretation.</p>

<p>The syntax for word boundaries is incredibly ugly.</p>
