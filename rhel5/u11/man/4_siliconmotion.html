<p>NAME siliconmotion - Silicon Motion video driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;siliconmotion&quot; ... [
Option &quot;optionname&quot; [&quot;optionvalue&quot;]]
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION siliconmotion is an Xorg driver for Silicon
Motion based video cards. The driver is fully accelerated,
and provides support for the following framebuffer depths:
8, 16, and 24. All visual types are supported for depth 8,
and TrueColor visuals are supported for the other
depths.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE The siliconmotion driver supports PCI
and AGP video cards based on the following Silicon Motion
chips:</p>

<p>Lynx SM910</p>

<p>LynxE SM810</p>

<p>Lynx3D SM820</p>

<p>LynxEM SM710</p>

<p>LynxEM+ SM712</p>

<p>Lynx3DM SM720</p>

<p>Cougar3DR SM730</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5x) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver. All options
names are case and white space insensitive when parsed by
the server, for example, &quot;lynxe&quot; and
&quot;LynxE&quot; are equivalent.</p>

<p>The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the
following ChipSet names may optionally be specified in the
config file &quot;Device&quot; section, and will override
the auto-detection:</p>

<p>&quot;lynx&quot;, &quot;lynxe&quot;, &quot;lynx3d&quot;,
&quot;lynxem&quot;, &quot;lynxem+&quot;,
&quot;lynx3dm&quot;, &quot;cougar3dr&quot;.</p>

<p>The following Cursor Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;HWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable the HW cursor. Default: on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Inverse
of &quot;HWCursor&quot;. Default: off.</p>

<p>The following display Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Use
shadow framebuffer. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CW&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CCW&quot; Rotate the
screen CW - clockwise or CCW - counter clockwise. Uses
ShadowFB. Default: no rotation.</p>

<p>Option &quot;VideoKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot; Set the
video color key. Default: a little off full blue.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ByteSwap&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Turn on
byte swapping for capturing using SMI demo board. Default:
off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Interlaced&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Turn
on interlaced video capturing. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;UseBIOS&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Use the
BIOS to set the modes. This is used for custom panel
timings. Default: on.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ZoomOnLCD&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Allow
changing resolution on LCD (Ctrl-Alt-Plus and Ctrl-Alt-
Minus). Default: off.</p>

<p>The following video memory Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;set_mclk&quot; &quot;integer&quot; sets the
memory clock, where integer is in kHz, and integer &lt;=
100000. Default: probe the memory clock value, and use it at
server start.</p>

<p>The following acceleration and graphics engine Options
are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; Disable acceleration. Very
useful for determining if the driver has problems with
drawing and acceleration routines. This is the first option
to try if your server runs but you see graphic corruption on
the screen. Using it decreases performance, as it uses
software emulation for drawing operations the video driver
can accelerate with hardware. Default: acceleration is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;fifo_aggressive&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;fifo_moderate&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;fifo_conservative&quot; alter the settings
for the threshold at which the pixel FIFO takes over the
internal memory bus to refill itself. The smaller this
threshold, the better the acceleration performance of the
card. You may try the fastest setting (fifo_aggressive) and
move down if you encounter pixel corruption. The optimal
setting will probably depend on dot-clock and on color
depth. Note that specifying any of these options will also
alter other memory settings which may increase performance,
so trying fifo_conser- vative will in most cases be a slight
benefit (this uses the chip defaults). If pixel corruption
or transient streaking is observed during drawing operations
then removing any fifo options is recommended. Default:
none.</p>

<p>The following PCI bus Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;pci_burst&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; will
enable PCI burst mode. This should work on all but a few
broken PCI chipsets, and will increase performance. Default:
off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;pci_retry&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; will
allow the driver to rely on PCI Retry to program the ViRGE
registers. pci_burst must be enabled for this to work. This
will increase performance, especially for small fills/blits,
because the driver does not have to poll the ViRGE before
send- ing it commands to make sure it is ready. It should
work on most recent PCI chipsets. Default: off.</p>

<p>The following additional Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShowCache&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable viewing offscreen cache memory. A development
debug option. Default: off.</p>

<p>SUPPORT For assistance with this driver, or Xorg in
general, check the Xorg web site at http://www.x.org. If you
find a problem with Xorg or have a question not answered in
the FAQ please use our bug report form avail- able on the
web site. When reporting problems with the driver send as
much detail as possible, including chipset type, a server
output log, and operating system specifics.</p>
