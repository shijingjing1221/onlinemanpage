<p>NAME file - determine file type</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS file [ -bchikLnNprsvz ] [ -f namefile ] [ -F
separator ] [ -m magic- files ] file ... file -C [ -m
magicfile ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents version 4.17 of
the file command.</p>

<p>File tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.
There are three sets of tests, performed in this order:
filesystem tests, magic number tests, and language tests.
The first test that succeeds causes the file type to be
printed.</p>

<p>The type printed will usually contain one of the words
text (the file contains only printing characters and a few
common control characters and is probably safe to read on an
ASCII terminal), executable (the file contains the result of
compiling a program in a form understand- able to some UNIX
kernel or another), or data meaning anything else (data is
usually binary or non-printable). Exceptions are well-known
file formats (core files, tar archives) that are known to
contain binary data. When modifying the file
/usr/share/file/magic or the pro- gram itself, preserve
these keywords . People depend on knowing that all the
readable files in a directory have the word text printed.
Dont do as Berkeley did and change shell commands text to
shell script. Note that the file /usr/share/file/magic is
built mechani- cally from a large number of small files in
the subdirectory Magdir in the source distribution of this
program.</p>

<p>The filesystem tests are based on examining the return
from a stat(2) system call. The program checks to see if the
file is empty, or if its some sort of special file. Any
known file types appropriate to the system you are running
on (sockets, symbolic links, or named pipes (FIFOs) on those
systems that implement them) are intuited if they are
defined in the system header file &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;.</p>

<p>The magic number tests are used to check for files with
data in partic- ular fixed formats. The canonical example of
this is a binary exe- cutable (compiled program) a.out file,
whose format is defined in a.out.h and possibly exec.h in
the standard include directory. These files have a magic
number stored in a particular place near the beginning of
the file that tells the UNIX operating system that the file
is a binary executable, and which of several types thereof.
The concept of magic number has been applied by extension to
data files. Any file with some invariant identifier at a
small fixed offset into the file can usually be described in
this way. The information identi- fying these files is read
from the compiled magic file /usr/share/file/magic.mgc , or
/usr/share/file/magic if the compile file does not exist. In
addition file will look in $HOME/.magic.mgc , or
$HOME/.magic for magic entries.</p>

<p>If a file does not match any of the entries in the magic
file, it is examined to see if it seems to be a text file.
ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non- ISO 8-bit extended-ASCII character
sets (such as those used on Macin- tosh and IBM PC systems),
UTF-8-encoded Unicode, UTF-16-encoded Uni- code, and EBCDIC
character sets can be distinguished by the different ranges
and sequences of bytes that constitute printable text in
each set. If a file passes any of these tests, its character
set is reported. ASCII, ISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and
extended-ASCII files are iden- tified as text because they
will be mostly readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and
EBCDIC are only character data because, while they contain
text, it is text that will require translation before it can
be read. In addition, file will attempt to determine other
charac- teristics of text-type files. If the lines of a file
are terminated by CR, CRLF, or NEL, instead of the
Unix-standard LF, this will be reported. Files that contain
embedded escape sequences or overstriking will also be
identified.</p>

<p>Once file has determined the character set used in a
text-type file, it will attempt to determine in what
language the file is written. The language tests look for
particular strings (cf names.h) that can appear anywhere in
the first few blocks of a file. For example, the keyword .br
indicates that the file is most likely a troff(1) input
file, just as the keyword struct indicates a C program.
These tests are less reliable than the previous two groups,
so they are performed last. The language test routines also
test for some miscellany (such as tar(1) archives).</p>

<p>Any file that cannot be identified as having been
written in any of the character sets listed above is simply
said to be data.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b, --brief Do not prepend filenames to output
lines (brief mode).</p>

<p>-c, --checking-printout Cause a checking printout of the
parsed form of the magic file. This is usually used in
conjunction with -m to debug a new magic file before
installing it.</p>

<p>-C, --compile Write a magic.mgc output file that
contains a pre-parsed ver- sion of file.</p>

<p>-f, --files-from namefile Read the names of the files to
be examined from namefile (one per line) before the argument
list. Either namefile or at least one filename argument must
be present; to test the stan- dard input, use - as a
filename argument.</p>

<p>-F, --separator separator Use the specified string as
the separator between the filename and the file result
returned. Defaults to :.</p>

<p>-h, --no-dereference option causes symlinks not to be
followed (on systems that sup- port symbolic links). This is
the default if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is
not defined.</p>

<p>-i, --mime Causes the file command to output mime type
strings rather than the more traditional human readable
ones. Thus it may say text/plain; charset=us-ascii rather
than ASCII text. In order for this option to work, file
changes the way it han- dles files recognised by the command
itself (such as many of the text file types, directories
etc), and makes use of an alternative magic file. (See FILES
section, below).</p>

<p>-k, --keep-going Dont stop at the first match, keep
going.</p>

<p>-L, --dereference option causes symlinks to be followed,
as the like-named option in ls(1) (on systems that support
symbolic links). This is the default if the environment
variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined.</p>

<p>-m, --magic-file list Specify an alternate list of files
containing magic numbers. This can be a single file, or a
colon-separated list of files. If a compiled magic file is
found alongside, it will be used instead. With the -i or
--mime option, the program adds &quot;.mime&quot; to each
file name.</p>

<p>-n, --no-buffer Force stdout to be flushed after
checking each file. This is only useful if checking a list
of files. It is intended to be used by programs that want
filetype output from a pipe.</p>

<p>-N, --no-pad Don t pad filenames so that they align in
the output.</p>

<p>-p, --preserve-date On systems that support utime(2) or
utimes(2), attempt to pre- serve the access time of files
analyzed, to pretend that file(2) never read them.</p>

<p>-r, --raw Don t translate unprintable characters to .
Normally file translates unprintable characters to their
octal representa- tion.</p>

<p>-s, --special-files Normally, file only attempts to read
and determine the type of argument files which stat(2)
reports are ordinary files. This prevents problems, because
reading special files may have pecu- liar consequences.
Specifying the -s option causes file to also read argument
files which are block or character special files. This is
useful for determining the filesystem types of the data in
raw disk partitions, which are block special files. This
option also causes file to disregard the file size as
reported by stat(2) since on some systems it reports a zero
size for raw disk partitions.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print the version of the program and
exit.</p>

<p>-z, --uncompress Try to look inside compressed
files.</p>

<p>--help Print a help message and exit.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/file/magic.mgc Default compiled list of
magic numbers</p>

<p>/usr/share/file/magic Default list of magic numbers</p>

<p>/usr/share/file/magic.mime.mgc Default compiled list of
magic numbers, used to output mime types when the -i option
is specified.</p>

<p>/usr/share/file/magic.mime Default list of magic
numbers, used to output mime types when the -i option is
specified.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variable MAGIC can be used
to set the default magic number file name. If that variable
is set, then file will not attempt to open $HOME/.magic .
file adds &quot;.mime&quot; and/or &quot;.mgc&quot; to the
value of this variable as appropriate. The environment
variable POSIXLY_CORRECT controls (on systems that support
symbolic links), if file will attempt to follow symlinks or
not. If set, then file follows symlink, otherwise it does
not. This is also controlled by the L and h options.</p>

<p>STANDARDS CONFORMANCE This program is believed to exceed
the System V Interface Definition of FILE(CMD), as near as
one can determine from the vague language con- tained
therein. Its behaviour is mostly compatible with the System
V program of the same name. This version knows more magic,
however, so it will produce different (albeit more accurate)
output in many cases.</p>

<p>The one significant difference between this version and
System V is that this version treats any white space as a
delimiter, so that spaces in pattern strings must be
escaped. For example, &gt;10 string language impress
(imPRESS data) in an existing magic file would have to be
changed to &gt;10 string language impress (imPRESS data) In
addition, in this version, if a pattern string contains a
backslash, it must be escaped. For example g i n d a 0
string tw Toolkit document a A n d r in an existing magic
file would have to be changed to 0 string \begindata Andrew
Toolkit document</p>

<p>SunOS releases 3.2 and later from Sun Microsystems
include a file(1) command derived from the System V one, but
with some extensions. My version differs from Sun s only in
minor ways. It includes the exten- sion of the &amp;
operator, used as, for example, &gt;16 long&amp;0x7fffffff
&gt;0 not stripped</p>

<p>MAGIC DIRECTORY The magic file entries have been
collected from various sources, mainly USENET, and
contributed by various authors. Christos Zoulas (address
below) will collect additional or corrected magic file
entries. A con- solidation of magic file entries will be
distributed periodically.</p>

<p>The order of entries in the magic file is significant.
Depending on what system you are using, the order that they
are put together may be incorrect. If your old file command
uses a magic file, keep the old magic file around for
comparison purposes (rename it to
/usr/share/file/magic.orig).</p>

<p>HISTORY There has been a file command in every UNIX
since at least Research Version 4 (man page dated November,
1973). The System V version intro- duced one significant
major change: the external list of magic number types. This
slowed the program down slightly but made it a lot more
flexible.</p>

<p>This program, based on the System V version, was written
by Ian Darwin &lt;ian@darwinsys.com&gt; without looking at
anybody else s source code.</p>

<p>John Gilmore revised the code extensively, making it
better than the first version. Geoff Collyer found several
inadequacies and provided some magic file entries.

<p>BUGS There must be a better way to automate the
construction of the Magic file from all the glop in magdir.
What is it? Better yet, the magic file should be compiled
into binary (say, ndbm(3) or, better yet, fixed-length ASCII
strings for use in heterogenous network environ- ments) for
faster startup. Then the program would run as fast as the
Version 7 program of the same name, with the flexibility of
the System V version.</p>

<p>File uses several algorithms that favor speed over
accuracy, thus it can be misled about the contents of text
files.</p>

<p>The support for text files (primarily for programming
languages) is simplistic, inefficient and requires
recompilation to update.</p>

<p>There should be an else clause to follow a series of
continuation lines.</p>

<p>The magic file and keywords should have regular
expression support. Their use of ASCII TAB as a field
delimiter is ugly and makes it hard to edit the files, but
is entrenched.</p>

<p>It might be advisable to allow upper-case letters in
keywords for e.g., troff(1) commands vs man page macros.
Regular expression support would make this easy.</p>

<p>The program doesn t grok FORTRAN. It should be able to
figure FORTRAN by seeing some keywords which appear indented
at the start of line. Regular expression support would make
this easy.</p>

<p>The list of keywords in ascmagic probably belongs in the
Magic file. This could be done by using some keyword like *
for the offset value.</p>

<p>Another optimisation would be to sort the magic file so
that we can just run down all the tests for the first byte,
first word, first long, etc, once we have fetched it.
Complain about conflicts in the magic file entries. Make a
rule that the magic entries sort based on file offset rather
than position within the magic file?</p>

<p>The program should provide a way to give an estimate of
how good a guess is. We end up removing guesses (e.g. From
as first 5 chars of file) because they are not as good as
other guesses (e.g. News- groups: versus Return-Path:).
Still, if the others dont pan out, it should be possible to
use the first guess.</p>

<p>This program is slower than some vendors file commands.
The new sup- port for multiple character codes makes it even
slower.</p>

<p>This manual page, and particularly this section, is too
long.</p>

<p>RETURN CODE Returns 0 on success, and non-zero on
error.</p>

<p>If the file named by the file operand does not exist,
cannot be read, or the type of the file named by the file
operand cannot be determined, this is not be considered an
error that affects the exit status.</p>
