<p>NAME semanage - SELinux Policy Management tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS semanage {login|user|port|interface|fcontext}
-l [-n] semanage login -{a|d|m} [-sr] login_name semanage
user -{a|d|m} [-LrRP] selinux_name semanage port -{a|d|m}
[-tr] [-p protocol] port | port_range semanage interface
-{a|d|m} [-tr] interface_spec semanage fcontext -{a|d|m}
[-frst] file_spec</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION semanage is used to configure certain
elements of SELinux policy with- out requiring modification
to or recompilation from policy sources. This includes the
mapping from Linux usernames to SELinux user identi- ties
(which controls the initial security context assigned to
Linux users when they login and bounds their authorized role
set) as well as security context mappings for various kinds
of objects, such as network ports, interfaces, and nodes
(hosts) as well as the file context map- ping. See the
EXAMPLES section below for some examples of common usage.
Note that the semanage login command deals with the mapping
from Linux usernames (logins) to SELinux user identities,
while the semanage user command deals with the mapping from
SELinux user identities to autho- rized role sets. In most
cases, only the former mapping needs to be adjusted by the
administrator; the latter is principally defined by the base
policy and usually does not require modification.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a, --add Add a OBJECT record NAME</p>

<p>-d, --delete Delete a OBJECT record NAME</p>

<p>-f, --ftype File Type. This is used with fcontext.
Requires a file type as shown in the mode field by ls, e.g.
use -d to match only directories or -- to match only regular
files.</p>

<p>-h, --help display this message</p>

<p>-l, --list List the OBJECTS</p>

<p>-L, --level Default SELinux Level for SELinux use, s0
Default. (MLS/MCS Sys- tems only)</p>

<p>-m, --modify Modify a OBJECT record NAME</p>

<p>-n, --noheading Do not print heading when listing
OBJECTS.</p>

<p>-p, --proto Protocol for the specified port
(tcp|udp).</p>

<p>-r, --range MLS/MCS Security Range (MLS/MCS Systems
only)</p>

<p>-R, --role SELinux Roles. You must enclose multiple
roles within quotes, separate by spaces. Or specify -R
multiple times.</p>

<p>-P, --prefix SELinux Prefix. Prefix added to home_dir_t
and home_t for labeling users home directories.</p>

<p>-s, --seuser SELinux user name</p>

<p>-t, --type SELinux Type for the object</p>

<p>EXAMPLE # View SELinux user mappings $ semanage user -l
# Allow joe to login as staff_u $ semanage login -a -s
staff_u joe # Add file-context for everything under /web
(used by restorecon) $ semanage fcontext -a -t
httpd_sys_content_t &quot;/web(/.*)?&quot; # Allow Apache to
listen on port 81 $ semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp
81</p>
