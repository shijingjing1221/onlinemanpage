<p>NAME nntpsend.ctl - list of sites to feed via
nntpsend</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file &lt;pathetc in
inn.conf&gt;/nntpsend.ctl specifies the default list of
sites to be fed by nntpsend(8).</p>

<p>Comments begin with a number sign (#) and continue
through the end of the line. Blank lines and comments are
ignored. All other lines should consist of four fields
separated by a colon.</p>

<p>The first field is the name of the site as specified in
the newsfeeds file.</p>

<p>The second field should be the hostname or IP address of
the remote site.</p>

<p>The third field, if non-empty, specifies the default
head truncation size of sites batchfile. If this field is
empty, no truncation is performed. This field may be of the
form maxsize-truncsize, in which case it is passed to
shrinkfile as -m maxsize -s truncsize; otherwise it is of
the form truncsize, in which case it is passed as -s
truncsize.</p>

<p>The fourth field specifies some default flags passed to
innxmit(8). The flag -a is always given to innxmit and need
not appear here. If no -t timeout flag is given in this
field or on the nntpsend command line, -t 180 will be given
to innxmit.</p>
