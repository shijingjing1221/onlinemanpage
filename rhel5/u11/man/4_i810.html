<p>NAME i810 - Intel 8xx integrated graphics chipsets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;i810&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION i810 is an Xorg driver for Intel integrated
graphics chipsets. The driver supports depths 8, 15, 16 and
24. All visual types are sup- ported in depth 8. For the
i810/i815 other depths support the True- Color and
DirectColor visuals. For the i830M and later, only the True-
Color visual is supported for depths greater than 8. The
driver sup- ports hardware accelerated 3D via the Direct
Rendering Infrastructure (DRI), but only in depth 16 for the
i810/i815 and depths 16 and 24 for the 830M and later.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE i810 supports the i810, i810-DC100,
i810e, i815, i830M, 845G, 852GM, 855GM, 865G, 915G, 915GM,
945G, 945GM, 965G, 965Q and 946GZ chipsets.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5x) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The Intel 8xx and 9xx families of integrated graphics
chipsets has a unified memory architecture and uses system
memory for video ram. For the i810 and i815 family of
chipset, operating system support for allo- cating system
memory for video use is required in order to use this
driver. For the 830M and later, this is required in order
for the driver to use more video ram than has been
pre-allocated at boot time by the BIOS. This is usually
achieved with an &quot;agpgart&quot; or &quot;agp&quot; ker-
nel driver. Linux, and recent versions of FreeBSD, OpenBSD
and NetBSD have such kernel drivers available.</p>

<p>By default 8 Megabytes of system memory are used for
graphics. For the 830M and later, the default is 8 Megabytes
when DRI is not enabled and 32 Megabytes with DRI is
enabled. This amount may be changed with the VideoRam entry
in the config file Device section. It may be set to any
reasonable value up to 64MB for older chipsets or 128MB for
newer chipsets. It is advisable to check the Xorg log file
to check if any features have been disabled because of
insufficient video memory. In particular, DRI support or
tiling mode may be disabled with insuffi- cient video
memory. Either of these being disabled will reduce perfor-
mance for 3D applications. Note however, that increasing
this value too much will reduce the amount of system memory
available for other applications.</p>

<p>The driver makes use of the video BIOS to program video
modes for the 830M and later. This limits the video modes
that can be used to those provided by the video BIOS, and to
those that will fit into the amount of video memory that the
video BIOS is aware of.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable acceleration. Default: acceleration is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable software cursor. Default: software cursor is
disable and a hardware cursor is used for configurations
where the hardware cursor is available.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ColorKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
sets the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay key.
Default: undefined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CacheLines&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
allows the user to change the amount of graphics memory used
for 2D acceleration and video. Decreasing this amount leaves
more for 3D textures. Increasing it can improve 2D per-
formance at the expense of 3D performance.</p>

<p>This option only takes effect when XAA acceleration is
enabled.</p>

<p>Default: depends on the resolution, depth, and available
video memory. The driver attempts to allocate space for at 3
screenfuls of pixmaps plus an HD-sized XV video. The default
used for a specific con- figuration can be found by
examining the Xorg log file.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DRI&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable or
enable DRI support. Default: DRI is enabled for con-
figurations where it is supported.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported for the i810
and i815 chipsets:</p>

<p>Option &quot;DDC&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable or
enable DDC support. Default: enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Dac6Bit&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable or
disable 6-bits per RGB for 8-bit modes. Default: 8-bits per
RGB for 8-bit modes.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XvMCSurfaces&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
option enables XvMC. The integer parameter specifies the
number of surfaces to use. Valid values are 6 and 7.
Default: XvMC is disabled.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported for the 830M
and later chipsets:</p>

<p>Option &quot;VBERestore&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
or disable the use of VBE save/restore for saving and
restoring the initial text mode. This is disabled by default
because it causes lockups on some platforms. However, there
are some cases where it must enabled for the correct
restoration of the initial video mode. If you are having a
problem with that, try enabling this option. Default:
Disabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;VideoKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This is
the same as the &quot;ColorKey&quot; option described above.
It is provided for compatibility with most other
drivers.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XVideo&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable or
enable XVideo support. Default: XVideo is enabled for
configurations where it is supported.</p>

<p>Option &quot;MonitorLayout&quot; &quot;anystr&quot;
Allow different monitor configurations. e.g.
&quot;CRT,LFP&quot; will con- figure a CRT on Pipe A and an
LFP on Pipe B. Regardless of the primary heads pipe it is
always configured as
&quot;&lt;PIPEA&gt;,&lt;PIPEB&gt;&quot;. Additionally you
can add different configu- rations such as
&quot;CRT+DFP,LFP&quot; which would put a digital flat panel
and a CRT on pipe A, and a local flat panel on pipe B. For
single pipe configurations you can just specify the monitors
types on Pipe A, such as &quot;CRT+DFP&quot; which will
enable the CRT and DFP on Pipe A. Valid monitors are CRT,
LFP, DFP, TV, CRT2, LFP2, DFP2, TV2 and NONE. NOTE: Some
configurations of monitor types may fail, this depends on
the Video BIOS and system con- figuration. Default: Not
configured, and will use the current heads pipe and
monitor.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Clone&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
Clone mode on pipe B. This will setup the second head as a
complete mirror of the monitor attached to pipe A. NOTE:
Video overlay functions will not work on the second head in
this mode. If you require this, then use the MonitorLayout
above and do (as an example) &quot;CRT+DFP,NONE&quot; to
configure both a CRT and DFP on Pipe A to achieve local
mirroring and disable the use of this option. Default: Clone
mode on pipe B is disabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CloneRefresh&quot; &quot;integer&quot; When
the Clone option is specified we can drive the second moni-
tor at a different refresh rate than the primary. Default:
60Hz.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CheckLid&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; On
mobile platforms its desirable to monitor the lid status and
switch the outputs accordingly when the lid is opened or
closed. By default this option is on, but may incur a very
minor perfor- mance penalty as we need to poll a register on
the card to check for this activity. It can be turned off
using this option. This only works with the 830M, 852GM and
855GM systems. Default: enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;FlipPrimary&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; When
using a dual pipe system, it may be preferable to switch the
primary screen to the alternate pipe to display on the other
monitor connection. NOTE: Using this option may cause text
mode to be restored incorrectly, and thus should be used
with cau- tion. Default: disabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DisplayInfo&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; It
has been found that a certain BIOS call can lockup the
Xserver because of a problem in the Video BIOS. The log file
will identify if you are suffering from this problem and
tell you to turn this option off. Default: enabled</p>

<p>Option &quot;DevicePresence&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Tell the driver to perform an active detect of the currently
connected monitors. This option is useful if the monitor was
not connected when the machine has booted, but unfortunately
it doesnt always work and is extremely dependent upon the
Video BIOS. Default: disabled</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;90&quot; Rotate the
desktop 90 degrees counterclockwise. Other valid options are
0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees. The RandR extension is used for
rotation functionality. So this option allows the Xserver to
start with a rotated mode of operation. Default: 0
degrees.</p>

<p>Option &quot;LinearAlloc&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Allows more memory for the offscreen allocator. This usually
helps in situations where HDTV movies are required to play
but not enough offscreen memory is usually available. Set
this to 8160 for upto 1920x1080 HDTV support. Default 0KB
(off).</p>
