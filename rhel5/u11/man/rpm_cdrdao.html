<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>DESCRIPTION cdrdao creates audio and data CD-Rs in
disk-at-once (DAO) mode driven by a description file called
toc-file. In DAO mode it is possible to create non standard
track pre-gaps that have other lengths than 2 sec- onds and
contain nonzero audio data. This is for example useful to
divide live recordings into tracks where 2 second gaps would
be kind of irritating.</p>

<p>Instead of a toc-file a cue file (used by a famous
DOS/Windows master- ing tool) may be used. See the CUE FILES
section for more details.</p>

<p>COMMANDS The first argument must be one of the following
commands:</p>

<p>show-toc Print out a summary about what will be written
to the CD-R.</p>

<p>read-toc Analyze each track of the inserted CD and
create a toc-file that can be used to make a more or less
exact copy of the CD. This command does not read out the
audio or data tracks, use read-cd for this purpose.</p>

<p>You can specify a filename for the data file via the
--datafile option.</p>

<p>read-cd Copies all tracks of the inserted CD to an image
file and cre- ates a corresponding toc-file. The name of the
image file defaults to &quot;data.bin&quot; if no --datafile
option is given.</p>

<p>read-cddb Tries to retrieve title and artist data from a
CDDB server for the CD represented by the given toc-file.
The retrieved data is added as CD-TEXT data for language 0
to the toc-file. Existing CD-TEXT data for language 0 will
be overwritten.</p>

<p>show-data Print out all samples that would be written to
the CD-R. Each line contains the sample number (starting at
0) and the decimal sample value for the left and right
channel. Useful to check if the byte order of audio files is
correct.</p>

<p>read-test Check if all data can be read from the audio
files that are defined in the toc-file. This will also check
the communication with the slave process that is responsible
for writing the audio data to the CD-recorder. Mainly used
for testing.</p>

<p>disk-info Shows information about the inserted CD-R. If
the CD-R has an open session it will also print the start of
the last and cur- rent session which is used by mkisofs to
create an image for a second or higher session.</p>

<p>msinfo Shows information required for creating multi
session disks with mkisofs. The output is meant for
processing by scripts.</p>

<p>unlock Tries to unlock the recorder device after a
failed write or sim- ulation run. If you cannot eject the CD
after a cdrdao run try this command.</p>

<p>blank Blanks a CD-RW. The CD-RW is minimally blanked by
default. Use option --blank-mode to select another blanking
mode. Sometimes the blanking speed must be manually reduced
for a successful blanking operation. Use option --speed to
select another blank- ing speed.</p>

<p>simulate Like write but laser stays cold. It is a
shortcut for write--simulate.</p>

<p>write Write the CD-R according to the specifications in
the toc-file.</p>

<p>copy Performs all steps to copy a CD. The device
containing the source CD must be specified with option
--source-device and the recorder device with option
--device. If only a single device is available the option
--source-device must be omitted and cdr- dao will prompt to
insert the CD-R after an image of the source CD was
created.</p>

<p>The image file with name
&quot;cddata&lt;pid&gt;.bin&quot; will be created in the
current working directory if no --datafile option is given.
The created image will be removed after it has been
written.</p>

<p>If option --on-the-fly is given no image file is created
and the data will be directly piped from the reading device
to the CD recorder.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --device [prot:]bus,id,lun Sets the SCSI address
of the CD-recorder in form of a bus/id/lun triple, e.g.
0,2,0 for the logical unit 0 of SCSI device with ID 2 on bus
0. ATAPI devices can be specified by using the pre- fix
ATAPI:, e.g. ATAPI:0,0,0. On some systems a device node may
be specified directly, e.g. /dev/sg0 on Linux systems. Linux
2.6 users may also try the newer ATAPI interface with the
ATA: prefix.</p>

<p>--source-device [prot:]bus,id,lun Like above but used
for the copy command to specify the source device.</p>

<p>--driver driver-id:option-flags Force usage of specified
driver instead of the automatically determined driver.
Available driver IDs: cdd2600, plextor, plextor-scan,
generic-mmc, generic-mmc-raw, ricoh-mp6200, yamaha-cdr10x,
teac-cdr55, sony-cdu920, sony- cdu948, taiyo-yuden, toshiba.
Specifying an illegal driver ID will give a list of
available drivers. Option flags may be used to modify the
behavior of some drivers. See README for details.</p>

<p>--source-driver driver-id:option-flags Like above but
used for the device specified with option
--source-device.</p>

<p>--speed value Set the writing speed to value. Default is
the highest possible speed.</p>

<p>--blank-mode mode Sets the blanking mode. Available
modes are full and minimal. Please consider that the data of
minimally blanked disks may be easily recovered. Use the
full blanking mode for completely erasing all data. The
default blanking mode is minimal.</p>

<p>--datafile file Used for read-toc,read-cd and copy. Set
the default data file placed in the toc-file by
read-toc.Use-toindicateSTDIN. For commands read-cd and copy
it specifies the name of the created image file.</p>

<p>--read-raw Only used for commands read-cd and read-toc.
All data sectors will be written as 2352 byte blocks
including the sector header and L-EC data to the image file.
The track mode will be set to MODE1_RAW or MODE2_RAW in the
created toc-file.</p>

<p>--read-subchan mode Used by commands read-cd, read-toc
and copy. Specifies the type of sub-channel data that is
extracted from the source CD and written to the track image
or copied to the destination CD. Mode may be rw for reading
packed R-W sub-channel data (de- interleaved and error
corrected) and rw_raw for reading raw R-W sub-channel data
(not de-interleaved, not error corrected, L-EC data included
in the track image). If this option is not speci- fied no
sub-channel data will be extracted.</p>

<p>--no-mode2-mixed Only used for commands read-cd and
read-toc. If we have MODE2_FORM1 or MODE2_FORM2, don t
extract it as MODE2_FORM_MIX. toc-file.</p>

<p>--tao-source This option indicates to the commands
read-toc and read-cd that the source CD was written in TAO
mode. It will be assumed that the pre-gap length between all
tracks (except between two audio tracks) is the standard 150
blocks plus the number of link blocks (usually 2). The
number of link blocks can be controlled with option
--tao-source-adjust.</p>

<p>Use this option only if read-toc or read-cd give error
messages in the transition areas between two tracks. If you
use this option with pressed CDs or CDs written in DAO mode
you will get wrong results.</p>

<p>--tao-source-adjust link-blocks Specifies the number of
link blocks for tracks written in TAO mode. This option has
only an effect if option --tao-source is given.</p>

<p>--fast-toc Only used for command read-toc. This option
suppresses the pre- gap length and index mark extraction
which speeds up the read- toc process. Standard 2 second
pre-gaps (but no silence!) will be placed into the toc-file.
The resulting CD will sound like the source CD. Only the CD
player s display will behave slightly different in the
transition area between two tracks.</p>

<p>This option might help, too, if read-toc fails with your
drive otherwise.</p>

<p>--buffers buffer-count Specifies the number of buffers
that are allocated to avoid buffer under runs. The minimal
buffer count is fixed to 10, default is 32 except on FreeBSD
systems, on which default is 20. Each buffer holds 1 second
of audio data so that dividing buffer-count by the writing
speed gives the maximum time for which reading of audio data
may be stalled.</p>

<p>--multi If this option is given the session will not be
closed after the audio data is successfully written. It is
possible to append another session on such disks, e.g. to
create a CD-EXTRA.</p>

<p>--overburn By default cdrdao will not allow to write
more data on a medium than specified by the current medium.
This option allows to ignore this condition.</p>

<p>--eject Eject the CD-R after writing or write
simulation.</p>

<p>--swap Swap the byte order of all samples that are send
to the CD- recorder.</p>

<p>--session session-nr Used for read-toc and read-cd to
specify the session which should be processed on multi
session CDs.</p>

<p>--reload Indicates that the tray may be opened before
writing without prompting the user to reset the disk status
after a simulation run.</p>

<p>--force Forces the execution of an operation that
otherwise would not be performed.</p>

<p>--paranoia-mode mode Sets the correction mode for
digital audio extraction. 0: No checking, data is copied
directly from the drive. 1: Perform overlapped reading to
avoid jitter. 2: Like 1 but with addi- tional checks of the
read audio data. 3: Like 2 but with addi- tional scratch
detection and repair.</p>

<p>The extraction speed reduces from 0 to 3.</p>

<p>Default is the full paranoia mode (3).</p>

<p>--keepimage If a CD is copied with command copy this
option will cause that the created image is not removed
after the copy process has fin- ished.</p>

<p>--on-the-fly Perform CD copy on the fly without creating
an image file.</p>

<p>--with-cddb Enables the automatic fetching of CDDB data
for use as CD-TEXT data for commands copy, read-toc and
read-cd.</p>

<p>--cddb-servers server-list Sets space or , separated
list of CDDB servers used for com- mand read-cddb or for
commands where the --with-cddb option is active. A server
entry may have the following forms:</p>

<p>&lt;server&gt; Connect to &lt;server&gt;, default cddbp
port (888), use cddbp proto- col.</p>

<p>&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt; Connect to &lt;server&gt;,
port &lt;port&gt;, use cddbp protocol.</p>

<p>&lt;server&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt; Connect to
&lt;server&gt;, default http port (80), use http protocol,
url: &lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt; Connect
to &lt;server&gt;, port &lt;port&gt;, use http protocol,
url: &lt;cgi- bin-path&gt;.</p>


<p>&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;:&lt;proxy-server&gt;
Connect to &lt;proxy-server&gt;, default http port (80), use
http pro- tocol, url:
http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;.</p>


<p>&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;:&lt;proxy-server&gt;:&lt;proxy-port&gt;
Connect to &lt;proxy-server&gt;, port &lt;proxy-port&gt;,
use http protocol, url:
http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;.</p>

<p>The &lt;cgi-bin-path&gt; is usually
&quot;/~cddb/cddb.cgi&quot;.</p>

<p>All servers of the server list will be tried in the
given order until a successful connection can be
established. For http proxy servers the first successful
connected http proxy server will be used independent of the
ability to connect to the target http server.</p>

<p>Example: freedb.freedb.org:/~cddb/cddb.cgi</p>

<p>--cddb-timeout timeout Sets the timeout in seconds used
for connections to CDDB servers.</p>

<p>--cddb-directory directory Specifies the local CDDB
database directory where fetched CDDB records will be
stored. If this option is not given a fetched CDDB record
will not be stored locally.</p>

<p>--tmpdir directory Specifies the directory in which to
store temporary data files created from decoding MP3 and Ogg
Vorbis files. By default, &quot;/tmp&quot; is used.</p>

<p>--keep Upon exit from cdrdao, do not delete temporary
WAV files created from MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files.</p>

<p>--save Saves some of the current options to the settings
file &quot;$HOME/.cdrdao&quot; and exit. See section
&acute;SETTINGS&acute; for more details.</p>

<p>-n Suppresses the 10 second pause before writing or
simulating.</p>

<p>-v verbose-level Sets verbose level. Levels &gt; 2 are
debug levels which produce a lot of output.</p>

<p>TOC FILES The toc-file describes what data is written to
the CD-R and allows con- trol over track/index positions,
pre-gaps and sub-channel information. It is a simple text
file, use your favorite text editor to create it.</p>

<p>A toc-file contains an optional header and a sequence of
track specifications. Comments starting with // reaching
until end of line can be placed anywhere.</p>

<p>Header CATALOG &quot;ddddddddddddd&quot; Specifies the
optional catalog number of the CD. The string must contain
exactly 13 digits.</p>

<p>The following flags specify the type of session that
will be created. It is used to create the correct CD-TOC
format and to check the consis- tency of the track modes for
the desired session type. If multiple flags are given the
last one will take effect.</p>

<p>CD_DA The disc contains only audio tracks.</p>

<p>CD_ROM The disc contains just mode 1 tracks or mode 1
and audio tracks (mixed mode CD).</p>

<p>CD_ROM_XA The disc contains mode 2 form 1 or mode 2 form
2 tracks. Audio tracks are allowed, too. This type must be
used if multi session disks are created (option
--multi).</p>

<p>CD_TEXT { ... } Defines global CD-TEXT data like the
album title and the used languages. See the CD-TEXT section
below for the syntax of the CD-TEXT block contents.</p>

<p>Track Specification TRACK &lt;track-mode&gt;
[&lt;sub-channel-mode&gt;] Starts a new track, the track
number is incremented by 1. The length of a track must be at
least 4 seconds. The block length of the input data depends
on the &lt;track-mode&gt;: AUDIO: 2352 bytes (588 samples),
MODE1: 2048 bytes, MODE1_RAW: 2352 bytes, MODE2: 2336 bytes,
MODE2_FORM1: 2048 bytes, MODE2_FORM2: 2324 bytes,
MODE2_FORM_MIX: 2336 bytes including the sub-header,
MODE2_RAW: 2352 bytes. The &lt;sub-channel-mode&gt; is
optional. If given it specifies the type of sub-channel data
for each sector. RW: packed R-W sub-channel data (96 bytes,
L-EC data will be gener- ated if required), RW_RAW: raw R-W
sub-channel data (interleaved and L-EC data already
calculated, 96 bytes). The block length is increased by the
sub-channel data length if a &lt;sub-channel-mode&gt; is
specified. If the input data length is not a multiple of the
block length it will be padded with zeros.</p>

<p>The following flags may follow the track start
statement. They are used to set sub-channel information for
the current track. Each flag is optional. If not given the
following defaults are used: copy not per- mitted, no pre
emphasis, two channel audio, no ISRC code.</p>

<p>[ NO ] COPY Sets or clears the copy permitted flag.</p>

<p>[ NO ] PRE_EMPHASIS Sets or clears the pre emphasis flag
(only for audio tracks).</p>

<p>TWO_CHANNEL_AUDIO Indicates that track contains two
channel audio data (only for audio tracks).</p>

<p>FOUR_CHANNEL_AUDIO Indicates that track contains four
channel audio data (only for audio tracks).</p>

<p>ISRC &quot;CCOOOYYSSSSS&quot; Sets ISRC code of track
(only for audio tracks). C: country code (upper case letters
or digits) O: owner code (upper case letters or digits) Y:
year (digits) S: serial number (digits)</p>

<p>An optional CD-TEXT block that defines the CD-TEXT data
for this track may follow. See the CD-TEXT section below for
the syntax of the CD-TEXT block contents.</p>

<p>CD_TEXT { ... }</p>

<p>At least one of the following statements must appear to
specify the data for the current track. Lengths and start
positions may be expressed in samples (1/44100 seconds) for
audio tracks or in bytes for data tracks. It is also
possible to give the length in blocks with the MSF format
MM:SS:FF specifying minutes, seconds and frames (0 &lt;= FF
&lt; 75) . A frame equals one block.</p>

<p>If more than one statement is used the track will be
composed by con- catenating the data in the specified
order.</p>

<p>SILENCE &lt;length&gt; Adds zero audio data of specified
length to the current audio track. Useful to create silent
pre-gaps.</p>

<p>ZERO &lt;length&gt; Adds zero data to data tracks. Must
be used to define pre- or post-gaps between tracks of
different mode.</p>

<p>[ FILE | AUDIOFILE ] &quot;&lt;filename&gt;&quot;
&lt;start&gt; [ &lt;length&gt; ] Adds the audio data of
specified file to the current audio track. It is possible to
select a portion of an audio file with &lt;start&gt; and
&lt;length&gt; which allows non destructive cutting. The
first sample of an audio file is addressed with
&lt;start&gt; = 0. If &lt;length&gt; is omitted or set to 0
all audio data from &lt;start&gt; until the end of file is
used.</p>

<p>Audio files may have raw or WAVE format with 16 bits per
sample, 44.1 kHz sampling rate, stereo. Raw files must have
the layout MSBLeft LSBLeft MSBRight LSBRight ... (big endian
byte order). WAVE files are expected to have little endian
byte order. The option --swap reverses the expected byte
order for all raw and WAVE files. Only filenames with a
&quot;.wav&quot; ending are treated as WAVE files, all other
names are assumed to be raw audio files. Use tools like
sox(1) to convert other file formats to supported
formats.</p>

<p>Specifying a &quot;-&quot; as filename causes data to be
read from STDIN. Currently only raw files are supported from
STDIN.</p>

<p>If you are unsure about the byte order of your audio
files try the command show-data. If the byte order is
correct you will see a sequence of increasing or decreasing
numbers for both channels. Otherwise numbers are jumping
between very high and low values - high volume static.</p>

<p>DATAFILE &quot;&lt;filename&gt;&quot; [ &lt;length&gt; ]
Adds data from given file to the current data track. If
&lt;length&gt; is omitted the actual file length will be
used.</p>

<p>FIFO &quot;&lt;fifo path&gt;&quot; &lt;length&gt; Adds
data from specified FIFO path to the current audio or data
track. &lt;length&gt; must specify the amount of data that
will be read from the FIFO. The value is always in terms of
bytes (scalar value) or in terms of the block length (MSF
value).</p>

<p>START [ MM:SS:FF ] Defines the length of the pre-gap
(position where index switches from 0 to 1). If the MSF
value is omitted the current track length is used. If the
current track length is not a multiple of the block length
the pre-gap length will be rounded up to next block
boundary.</p>

<p>If no START statement is given the track will not have a
pre- gap.</p>

<p>PREGAP MM:SS:FF This is an alternate way to specify a
pre-gap with zero audio data. It may appear before the first
SILENCE, ZERO or FILE statement. Either PREGAP or START can
be used within a track specification. It is equivalent to
the sequence SILENCE MM:SS:FF START for audio tracks or ZERO
MM:SS:FF START for data tracks.</p>

<p>Nothing prevents mixing DATAFILE/ZERO and AUDIOFILE/
SILENCE statements within the same track. The results,
however, are undefined.</p>

<p>The end of a track specification may contain zero or
more index incre- ment statements:</p>

<p>INDEX MM:SS:FF Increments the index number at given
position within the track. The first statement will
increment from 1 to 2. The position is relative to the real
track start, not counting an existing pre- gap.</p>

<p>CD-TEXT Blocks A CD-TEXT block may be placed in the
global section to define data valid for the whole CD and in
each track specification of a toc-file. The global section
must define a language map that is used to map a
language-number to country codes. Up to 8 different
languages can be defined:</p>

<p>LANGUAGE_MAP { 0 : c1 1 : c2 ... 7 : c7 } The country
code may be an integer value in the range 0..255 or one of
the following countries (the corresponding integer value is
placed in braces behind the token): EN(9, English) It is
just necessary to define a mapping for the used
languages.</p>

<p>If no mapping exists for a language-number the data for
this language will be ignored.</p>

<p>For each language a language block must exist that
defines the actual data for a certain language.</p>

<p>LANGUAGE language-number { cd-text-item cd-text-data
cd-text-item cd- text-data ... } Defines the CD-TEXT items
for given language-number which must be defined in the
language map.</p>

<p>The cd-text-data may be either a string enclosed by
&quot; or binary data like { 0, 10, 255, ... } where each
integer number must be in the range 0..255. The cd-text-item
may be one of the following:</p>

<p>TITLE String data: Title of CD or track.</p>

<p>PERFORMER String data.</p>

<p>SONGWRITER String data.</p>

<p>COMPOSER String data.</p>

<p>ARRANGER String data.</p>

<p>MESSAGE String data. Message to the user.</p>

<p>DISC_ID String data: Should only appear in the global
CD-TEXT block. The format is usually: XY12345</p>

<p>GENRE Mixture of binary data (genre code) and string
data. Should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block. Useful
entries will be cre- ated by gcdmaster.</p>

<p>TOC_INFO1 Binary data: Optional table of contents 1.
Should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block.</p>

<p>TOC_INFO2 Binary data: Optional table of contents 2.
Should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block.</p>

<p>UPC_EAN String data: This item should only appear in the
global CD-TEXT block. Was always an empty string on the
CD-TEXT CDs I had access to.</p>

<p>ISRC String data: ISRC code of track. The format is
usually: CC-OOO- YY-SSSSS</p>

<p>SIZE_INFO Binary data: Contains summary about all
CD-TEXT data and should only appear in the global CD-TEXT
block. The data will be auto- matically (re)created when the
CD-TEXT data is written.</p>

<p>If one of the CD-TEXT items TITLE, PERFORMER,
SONGWRITER, COM- POSER, ARRANGER, ISRC is defined for at
least on track or in the global section it must be defined
for all tracks and in the global section. If a DISC_ID item
is defined in the global sec- tion, an ISRC entry must be
defined for each track.</p>

<p>CUE FILES Cue files may be used wherever a toc-file is
expected. The correspond- ing bin file is not taken from the
FILE statement of a cue file but constructed from the cue
file name by replacing &quot;.cue&quot; by &quot;.bin&quot;.
The cue file must have exactly one FILE statement.</p>

<p>Currently, following track modes are supported:
MODE1/2048, MODE1/2352, MODE2/2336, MODE2/2352. The CATALOG,
ISRC and POSTGAP statements are parsed but not evaluated,
yet.</p>

<p>SETTINGS Some of the command line options can be stored
as settings at following locations. The files will be read
on startup of cdrdao in that order:</p>

<p>1. /etc/cdrdao.conf</p>

<p>2. /etc/defaults/cdrdao</p>

<p>3. $HOME/.cdrdao</p>

<p>Command line options will overwrite the loaded settings.
The settings file contains name - value pairs separated by a
colon. String values must be enclosed by &quot;. The file is
automatically written if the command line option --save is
used but it is also possible to modify it manu- ally.
Following values are defined:</p>

<p>write_device Device used for operations simulate, write,
copy, blank, disk- info and unlock. Corresponding option:
--device</p>
