<p>NAME simpleftp - Rudimentary FTP client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS simpleftp url [...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION simpleftp is a Perl script script that
provides basic support for fetching files with FTP in a
batch oriented fashion. It takes one or more FTP URLS on the
command line. The file(s) will be retrieved from the remote
server and placed in the current directory with the same
basename as on the remote; e.g.,
&quot;ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CON- FIG/active.gz&quot;
is stored as active.gz in the current directory.</p>

<p>BUGS simpleftp is an extremely poor substitute for more
complete programs like the freely available wget or ncftp
utilities. It was written only to provide elementary support
in INN for non-interactive fetching of the files in
&lt;ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/&gt; without
requiring administrators to install yet another package. Its
shortcomings as a general purpose program are too numerous
to mention, but one that stands out is that simpleftp does
not understand the complete syntax of URLs, only the
hostname and pathname parts -- it will not understand
username, password, port or parameter strings.</p>

<p>The Perl libraries that it uses have the advantage of
coming with Perl, even older versions of Perl, but are not
&quot;-w&quot; safe and do not work nearly as well as
Net::FTP.</p>
