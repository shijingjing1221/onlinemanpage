<p>PERSONALITY(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
PERSONALITY(2)</p>

<p>NAME personality - set the process execution domain</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/personality.h&gt;</p>

<p>int personality(unsigned long persona);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Linux supports different execution domains,
or personalities, for each process. Among other things,
execution domains tell Linux how to map signal numbers into
signal actions. The execution domain system allows Linux to
provide limited support for binaries compiled under other
Unix-like operating systems.</p>

<p>This function will return the current personality() when
persona equals 0xffffffff. Otherwise, it will make the
execution domain referenced by persona the new execution
domain of the current process.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, the previous persona is
returned. On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL The kernel was unable to change the
personality.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO personality() is Linux-specific and should
not be used in programs intended to be portable.</p>
