<p>NAME scrollkeeper-preinstall - generate on OMF file,
based on an existing OMF file, which has the correct URL for
a document</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS scrollkeeper-preinstall [ -n ] url
input-omf-file output-omf-file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION scrollkeeper-preinstall creates the OMF file
output-omf-file by reading the given existing OMF file
input-omf-file and replacing the URL for a resource
(typically a document) with the URL given by url. This is
typically done as part of the build process for an
application, since the actual location that a document is
installed is not known until the application is built.</p>

<p>If output-omf-file is specified with a path, and that
path does not exist, the path is created.</p>

<p>The url is typically the &quot;file:&quot; URI followed
by the absolute path to a document which is (or will be)
installed. (eg. &quot;file:/usr/doc/scroll-
keeper/scrollkeeper.sgml&quot;)</p>

<p>OPTIONS -n Use the network to retrieve the DTD if it is
not available via the systems XML catalog.</p>
