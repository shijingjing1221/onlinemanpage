<p>NAME incoming.conf - names and addresses that feed us
news</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file &lt;pathetc in
inn.conf&gt;/incoming.conf consists of three types of
entries: key/value, peer and group. Comments are from the
hash charac- ter # to the end of the line. Blank lines are
ignored. All key/value entries within each type must not be
duplicated.</p>

<p>Key/value entries are a keyword immediately followed by
a colon, at least one blank and a value. For example:</p>

<p>max-connections: 10</p>

<p>A legal key does not contains blanks, colons, nor #.
There are 3 different types of values: integers, booleans,
and strings. Integers are as to be expected. A boolean value
is either true or false (case is significant). A string
value is any other sequence of charac- ters. If the string
needs to contain whitespace, then it must be quoted with
double quotes.</p>

<p>Peer entries look like:</p>

<p>peer &lt;name&gt; { # body }</p>

<p>The word peer is required. &lt;name&gt;is a label for
this peer. The &lt;name&gt; is any string valid as a key.
The body of a peer entry con- tains some number of key/value
entries.</p>

<p>Group entries look like:</p>

<p>group &lt;name&gt; { # body }</p>

<p>The word group is required. The &lt;name&gt; is any
string valid as a key. The body of a group entry contains
any number of the three types of entries. So key/value pairs
can be defined inside a group, and peers can be nested
inside a group, and other groups can be nested inside a
group.</p>

<p>Key/value entries that are defined outside of all peer
and group entries are said to be at global scope. Global
key/value entries act as defaults for peers. When innd(8)
looks for a specific value in a peer entry (for example, the
maximum number of connections to allow), if the value is not
defined in the peer entry, then the enclosing groups are
examined for the entry (starting at the closest enclosing
group). If there are no enclosing groups, or the enclosing
groups dont define the key/value, then the value at global
scope is used.</p>

<p>A small example could be:</p>

<p># Global value applied to all peers that have # no value
of their own. max-connections: 5</p>

<p># A peer definition. peer uunet { hostname:
usenet1.uu.net }</p>

<p>peer vixie { hostname: gw.home.vix.com max-connections:
10 # override global value. }</p>

<p># A group of two peers who can open more # connections
than normal group fast-sites { max-connections: 15</p>

<p># Another peer. The max-connections value from the #
fast-sites group scope is used. The hostname value #
defaults to the peers name. peer data.ramona.vix.com { }</p>

<p>peer bb.home.vix.com { hostname: bb.home.vix.com
max-connections: 20 # he can really cook. } }</p>

<p>Given the above configuration file, the defined peers
would have the following values for the max-connections
key.</p>

<p>uunet 5 vixie 10 data.ramona.vix.com 15 bb.home.vix.com
20</p>

<p>Ten keys are allowed:</p>

<p>hostname: This key requires a string value. It is a list
of hostnames sep- arated by a comma. A hostname is the hosts
FQDN, or the dotted quad ip-address of the peer. If this key
is not present in a peer block, the hostname defaults to the
label of the peer.</p>

<p>streaming: This key requires a boolean value. It defines
whether streaming commands are allowed from this peer.
(default=true)</p>

<p>max-connections: This key requires a positive integer
value. It defines the maxi- mum number of connections
allowed. A value of zero specifies an unlimited number of
maximum connections ( unlimited or none can be used as
synonym). (default=0)</p>

<p>hold-time: This key requires a positive integer value.
It defines the hold time before closing, if the connection
is over max-connections. A value of zero specifies immediate
close. (default=0)</p>

<p>password: This key requires a string value. It is used
if you wish to require a peer to supply a password.
(default=no password)</p>

<p>identd: This key requires a string value. It is used if
you wish to require a peer s user name retrieved through
identd match the specified string. Note that currently
innd(8) does not implement any timeout in identd callbacks,
so enabling this option may cause innd to hang if the remote
peer does not respond to ident callbacks in a reasonable
timeframe (default=no identd)</p>

<p>patterns: This key requires a string value. It is a list
of news- feeds(5)-style list of newsgroups which are to be
accepted from this host. (default=&quot;*&quot;)</p>

<p>email: This key requires a string value. Reserved for
future use. (default=empty)</p>

<p>comment: This key requires a string value. Reserved for
future use. (default=empty)</p>

<p>skip: This key requires a boolean value. Setting this
entry causes this peer to be skipped. (default=false)</p>

<p>noresendid: This key requires a boolean value. It
defines whether innd(8) should send 431 RESENDID responses
if a message is offered that is being received from another
peer. This can be useful for peers that resend messages
right away, as innfeed does. (default=false)</p>

<p>nolist: This key requires a boolean value. It defines
whether a peer is allowed to issue list command.
(default=false)</p>
