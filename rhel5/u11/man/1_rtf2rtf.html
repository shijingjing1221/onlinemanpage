<p>NAME rtf2rtf - programs to postprocess the raw RTF
generated by the mapping files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rtf2rtf [options] ..</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents briefly the
rtf2rtf commands. This manual page was written for the
Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program
does not have a manual page for rtf2rtf.</p>

<p>rtf2rtf is a program to postprocess the raw RTF
generated by the map- ping files.</p>

<p>It is used by other programs in sgml-tools (v1), and
usually normal user does not need to use this program
directly.</p>

<p>Following is quoted from the README in the source
tree.</p>

<p>(Begin Quotes)</p>

<p>Im not proud of this code. Its a hack foisted upon a
hack, nested within another hack or two. It sort of works
well enough for my pur- poses (generating WinHelp .RTF files
for my documents), but it could definitely use a
redesign/rewrite. It started as a simple pertubation of the
html2html filter, but got ugly very quickly...</p>

<p>I shamelessly blame the RTF format for most of the
hackery here -- RTF is not a _language_ like LaTeX or ROFF
-- its just a file format. So, we cant rely on RTF to do
even simple things like &quot;insert a paragraph break here
only if the previous token was not also a paragraph break.
Since the SGML front end has no conditional processing
capabilities, multiple blank likes in the SGML get
translated to multiple para breaks in the RTF. Thats why we
use a &quot;lex&quot; filter (rtf2rtf) to postprocess the
raw RTF generated by the mapping files.</p>

<p>Again: I offer this to the Linuxdoc community with the
hopes that it will be useful to others and that someone else
can help flesh out the missing pieces. What? Missing pieces?
Yes, recall that I say it works &quot;well enough for my
purposes&quot;. The replacement files (general, map- ping)
started out like as the latex replacement files. Much of
them still _are_ the latex replacement files. I only
converted those parts that are actually used by my
documents. Your documents may require more of the files to
be translated to RTF.</p>

<p>Since Im using these mappings for actual documentation,
I plan on maintaining this backend, so please send me any
improvements -- Ill coordinate with Greg to make sure they
get into the the next official release.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The programs does not support normal command
line option.</p>
