<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>The first action values listed below are administrative
and are nor- mally used only in the tux program.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_STARTUP starts the tux subsystem, and takes a
NULL req. TODO: Only root can use TUX_ACTION_STARTUP.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_SHUTDOWN stops the tux subsystem, and takes
any req, even a zero-filled req.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_STARTTHREAD is called once per thread with a
req-&gt;thread_nr element monotonically increasing from
0.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_STOPTHREAD is not currently used by the tux
daemon because all threads are automatically stopped on
TUX_ACTION_SHUTDOWN. It remains available because it may be
useful in circumstances that the tux daemon does not yet
handle.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_REGISTER_MODULE Register a user-space module
identified by the req-&gt;modulename string. One VFS name
can be registered only once.</p>

<p>req-&gt;version_major, req-&gt;version_minor, and
req-&gt;version_patch have to be set appropriately from
TUX_MAJOR_VERSION, TUX_MINOR_VERSION, and
TUX_PATCHLEVEL_VERSION, respectively; the kernel will
sanity-check binary compatibility of the module.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_UNREGISTER_MODULE Unregister a user-space
module identified by the req-&gt;modulename string. Only
registered modules can be unregis- tered.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_CURRENT_DATE Set the current date string to
req-&gt;new_date. The date string must be RFC 1123-compliant
and increase monotonically. The tux daemon normally calls
this once per second.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_REGISTER_MIMETYPE Sets the extension
req-&gt;objectname to map to mimetype req-&gt;object_addr.
The tux daemon normally registers the mime types in
/etc/tux.mime.types, but modules could conceivably create
their own mimetype mappings.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_QUERY_VERSION Return the major version, minor
version, and patchlevel of the kernel TUX subsystem, encoded
in the return value as (TUX_MAJOR_VERSION &lt;&lt; 24) |
(TUX_MINOR_VERSION &lt;&lt; 16) | TUX_PATCHLEVEL_VERSION If
the system call sets errno to EINVAL, assume major version
2, minor version 1.</p>

<p>The rest of the action values are used to respond to TUX
events. The general architecture is that TUXs event loop is
invoked to catch HTTP events, and then responses are
generated in response to those events.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_EVENTLOOP invokes the TUX event loop the TUX
subsystem will either immediately return with a new request
req, or will wait for new requests to arrive.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_GET_OBJECT issues a request for the URL
object named in req-&gt;objectname. If the object is not
immediately available then the currently handled request is
suspended, and a new request is returned, or the TUX
subsystem waits for new requests.</p>

<p>A URL object is a data stream that is accessed via a URL
and is directly associated with a file pointed to by that
URL. (In the future, we may extend the concept of a URL
object.)</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_SEND_OBJECT sends the current URL object to
the client.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_READ_OBJECT reads the current URL object into
the address specified by req-&gt;object_addr.
TUX_ACTION_READ_OBJECT must not be called unless
req-&gt;objectlen &gt;= 0.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_READ_HEADERS reads a non-zero-delimited
string into req-&gt;object_addr, with the length of the
string kept in req-&gt;objectlen. This is a workaround used
to read fields that tux does not currently parse; if you
need it, report it as a bug so that more fields can be added
to user_req (unless your use is so specialized that it will
be of no general utility).</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_POSTPONE_REQ postpones the request, meaning
that no tux sys- tem calls will return data for this request
until TUX_ACTION_CON- TINUE_REQ is called.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_CONTINUE_REQ continues a postponed request.
Unlike a normal TUX_ACTION, it takes as its argument the
socket descriptor (this allows it to be called from a
program that is unrelated to the program that called
TUX_ACTION_POSTPONE_REQ if necessary). It is called like
this: ret = tux(TUX_ACTION_CONTINUE_REQ, (user_req_t
*)socket);</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_READ_POST_DATA is an atomic action (it will
always return with the same request, no need to handle a new
request) that puts the non-zero-delimited POST data, up to
the maximum set in req-&gt;objectlen (and limited by
/proc/sys/net/tux/max_header_len), into req-&gt;object_addr,
ands resets req-&gt;objectlen to the length.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_REDIRECT_REQ causes the request to be
redirected to the sec- ondary server. (No need to call
TUX_ACTION_FINISH_REQ.)</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_FINISH_REQ finishes and logs the request.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_FINISH_CLOSE_REQ is like
TUX_ACTION_FINISH_REQ except that it also closes HTTP 1.1
keepalive connections.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_SEND_BUFFER is like TUX_ACTION_SEND_OBJECT
except that it sends whatever is in the req-&gt;object_addr
buffer. This can be used as a generic output buffer.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_WATCH_PROXY_SOCKET sets up a non-TUX socket
to be used with TUX_ACTION_WAIT_PROXY_SOCKET. The socket
must be a network socket. The function is atomic. Repeated
calls to this action will replace the pre- vious proxy
socket, so there is no need to deinitialize it. The socket
file descriptor must be put into req-&gt;object_addr.</p>

<p>TUX_ACTION_WAIT_PROXY_SOCKET postpones the current
request until there are input packets on the socket that was
set up via TUX_ACTION_WATCH_PROXY_SOCKET. The proxy socket
has a keepalive timer running. The request will be resumed
once there is input activity on the socket - the module can
use nonblocking recv() on the socket to process input
packets.</p>

<p>user_req_t req is the request returned by the TUX
subsystem. Defined fields depend on the version. For major
version 2, they are: typedef struct user_req_s { int
version_major; int version_minor; int version_patch;</p>

<p>int http_version; int http_method;</p>

<p>int sock; int event; int thread_nr; void *id; void
*priv;</p>

<p>int http_status; int bytes_sent; char *object_addr; int
module_index; char modulename[MAX_MODULENAME_LEN];</p>

<p>unsigned int client_host; unsigned int objectlen; char
query[MAX_URI_LEN]; char objectname[MAX_URI_LEN];</p>

<p>unsigned int cookies_len; char
cookies[MAX_COOKIE_LEN];</p>

<p>char content_type[MAX_FIELD_LEN]; char

referer[MAX_FIELD_LEN];</p>

<p>char *post_data; char new_date[DATE_LEN]; int
keep_alive; } user_req_t; For major version 3, they are:
typedef struct user_req_s { uint32_t version_major; uint32_t
version_minor; uint32_t version_patch; uint32_t
http_version; uint32_t http_method; uint32_t

} user_req_t;</p>

<p>version_major Always set to TUX_MAJOR_VERSION, used to
flag binary incompati- bility.</p>

<p>version_minor Always set to TUX_MINOR_VERSION, used to
flag binary incompati- bility.</p>

<p>version_patch Always set to TUX_PATCHLEVEL_VERSION, used
to flag binary incom- patibility.</p>

<p>http_version One of HTTP_1_0 or HTTP_1_1</p>

<p>http_method One of METHOD_NONE, METHOD_GET, METHOD_HEAD,
METHOD_POST, or METHOD_PUT</p>

<p>sock Socket file descriptor; writing to this will send
data to the connected client associated with this request.
Do not read from this socket file descriptor; you could
potentially confuse the HTTP engine.</p>

<p>event Private, per-request state for use in tux modules.
The system will preserve this value as long as a request is
active.</p>

<p>thread_nr Thread index; see discussion of
TUX_ACTION_STARTTHREAD.</p>

<p>id A tux-daemon-internal value that is used to multiplex
requests to the correct modules.</p>

<p>priv Works just like event, except that it is a pointer
to private data instead of an integer.</p>

<p>http_status Set the error status as an integer for error
reporting. The status is good by default, so it should not
be modified except to report errors.</p>

<p>bytes_sent When you write to sock, you must set
bytes_sent to the total number of bytes sent since the last
tux() operation on this req, or the log entry s bytes sent
counter will be incorrect. (This may change or disappear in
future versions of tux.)</p>

<p>object_addr Set to an address for a buffer of at least
req-&gt;objectlen size into which to read an object from the
URL cache with the TUX_ACTION_READ_OBJECT action.
TUX_ACTION_READ_OBJECT must not be called unless
req-&gt;objectlen &gt;= 0, and TUX implicitly relies on
req-&gt;object_addr being at least req-&gt;objectlen in
size.</p>

<p>module_index Used by the tux(8) daemon to determine
which loadable module to associate with a req.</p>

<p>modulename The name of the module as set by
TUX_ACTION_REGISTER_MODULE; private data to the tux
daemon.</p>

<p>client_host The IP address of the host to which sock is
connected.</p>

<p>objectlen The size of a file that satisfies the current
request and which is currently living in the URL cache. This
is set if a request returns after TUX_ACTION_GET_OBJECT. A
module should make sure that the buffer at
req-&gt;object_addr is at least req-&gt;objectlen in size
before calling TUX_ACTION_READ_OBJECT.</p>

<p>query The full query string sent from the client.</p>

<p>objectname Specifies the name of a URL to get with the
TUX_ACTION_GET_OBJECT action. If the URL is not immediately
available (that is, is not in the URL cache), the request is
queued and the tux subsystem may go on to other ready
requests while waiting.</p>

<p>cookies_len If cookies are in the request header,
cookies_len contains the length of the cookies string</p>

<p>cookies If cookies are in the request header, cookies is
the string in which the cookies are passed to the
module.</p>

<p>content_type The Content-Type header value for the
request</p>

<p>user_agent The User-Agent header value for the
request</p>

<p>accept The Accept header value for the request</p>

<p>accept_charset The Accept-Charset header value for the
request</p>

<p>accept_encoding The Accept-Encoding header value for the
request</p>

<p>accept_language The Accept-Language header value for the
request</p>

<p>cache_control The Cache-Control header value for the
request</p>

<p>if_modified_since The If-Modified-Since header value for
the request</p>

<p>negotiate The Negotiate header value for the request</p>

<p>pragma The Pragma header value for the request</p>

<p>referer The Referer header value for the request</p>

<p>post_data For POST requests, the incoming data is placed
in post_data.</p>

<p>new_date Returns the current date/time</p>

<p>keep_alive The KeepAlive header value for the
request</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE tux() returns the following values: enum
tux_reactions { TUX_RETURN_USERSPACE_REQUEST = 0,
TUX_RETURN_EXIT = 1, TUX_RETURN_SIGNAL = 2, };</p>

<p>TUX_RETURN_USERSPACE_REQUEST means that the kernel has
put a new request into req; the request must be responded to
with one of TUX_ACTION_GET_OBJECT, TUX_ACTION_SEND_OBJECT,
TUX_ACTION_READ_OBJECT, or TUX_ACTION_FINISH_REQ.</p>

<p>TUX_RETURN_EXIT means that TUX has been stopped.</p>

<p>TUX_RETURN_SIGNAL means that a signal has occured. No
new request is scheduled.</p>

<p>ERRORS Any negative value (such as -EFAULT, -EINVAL) is
an indication of an error.</p>
