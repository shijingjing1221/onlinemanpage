<p>NAME ImageMagick - is a free software suite for the
creation, modification and display of bitmap images. convert
input-file [options] output-file</p>

<p>OVERVIEW ImageMagickTM, version 6.2.0, is a free
software suite for the cre- ation, modification and display
of bitmap images. It can read, convert and write images in a
large variety of formats. Images can be cropped, colors can
be changed, various effects can be applied, images can be
rotated and combined, and text, lines, polygons, ellipses
and B&eacute;zier curves can be added to images and
stretched and rotated.</p>

<p>ImageMagick is free software: it is delivered with full
source code and can be freely used, copied, modified and
distributed. Its license is compatible with the GPL. It runs
on all major operating systems.</p>

<p>Most of the functionality of ImageMagick can be used
interactively from the command line; more often, however,
the features are used from pro- grams written in the
programming languages Perl, C, C++, Python, PHP, Ruby,
Tcl/Tk or Java, for which ready-made ImageMagick interfaces
(PerlMagick, Magick++, PythonMagick, MagickWand for PHP,
RMagick, TclMagick, and JMagick) are available. This makes
it possible to modify or create images automatically and
dynamically.</p>

<p>ImageMagick supports many image formats (over 90 major
formats) includ- ing popular formats like TIFF, JPEG, PNG,
PDF, PhotoCD, and GIF.</p>

<p>ImageMagick includes a number of command-line utilities
for manipulat- ing images. Most of you are probably accustom
to editing images one at a time with a graphical user
interface (GUI) with such programs as gimp or Photoshop.
However, a GUI is not always convenient. Suppose you want to
process an image dynamically from a web script or you want
to apply the same operations to many images or repeat a
specific operation at different times to the same or
different image. For these types of operations, the
command-line image processing utility is appropriate.</p>

<p>In the paragraphs below, find a short description for
each command-line tool.Click on the program name to get
details on the program usage and a list of command-line
options that alters how the program performs. If you are
just getting acquianted with ImageMagick, start at the top
of the list, the convert program, and work your way dowm.
Also be sure to peruse Anthony Thyssen s tutorial on how to
use ImageMagick utilities to convert, compose, or edit
images from the command-line.</p>

<p>convert</p>

<p>convert between image formats as well as resize an
image, blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw on, flip, join,
re-sample, and much more.</p>

<p>identify</p>

<p>describes the format and characteristics of one or more
image files. mogrify</p>

<p>resize an image, blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw on,
flip, join, re-sample, and much more. Mogrify overwrites the
original image file, whereas, convert writes to a different
image file.</p>

<p>composite</p>

<p>overlaps one image over another.</p>

<p>montage</p>

<p>create a composite image by combining several separate
images. The images are tiled on the composite image
optionall adorned with a border, frame, image name, and
more.</p>

<p>compare</p>

<p>mathematically and visually annotate the difference
between an image and its reconstruction..</p>

<p>display</p>

<p>displays an image or image sequence on any X server.</p>

<p>animate</p>

<p>animates an image sequence on any X server.</p>

<p>import saves any visible window on an X server and
outputs it as an image file. You can capture a single
window, the entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the
screen.</p>

<p>conjure</p>

<p>interprets and executes scripts written in the Magick
Scripting Language (MSL).</p>
