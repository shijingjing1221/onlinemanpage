<p>MYSQLD_SAFE(1) MySQL Database System MYSQLD_SAFE(1)</p>

<p>NAME mysqld_safe - MySQL server startup script
safe_mysqld - MySQL server startup script</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysqld_safe options</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mysqld_safe is the recommended way to start
a mysqld server on Unix and NetWare. mysqld_safe adds some
safety features such as restarting the server when an error
occurs and logging runtime information to an error log file.
NetWare-specific behaviors are listed later in this
section.</p>

<p>Note To preserve backward compatibility with older
versions of MySQL, MySQL binary distributions still include
safe_mysqld as a symbolic link to mysqld_safe. However, you
should not rely on this because it is removed as of MySQL
5.1.</p>

<p>By default, mysqld_safe before MySQL 5.0.27 tries to
start an executable named mysqld-max if it exists, and
mysqld otherwise. Be aware of the implications of this
behavior:</p>

<p>&middot; On Linux, the MySQL-Max RPM relies on this
mysqld_safe behavior. The RPM installs an executable named
mysqld-max, which causes mysqld_safe to automatically use
that executable rather than mysqld from that point on.</p>

<p>&middot; If you install a MySQL-Max distribution that
includes a server named mysqld-max, and then upgrade later
to a non-Max version of MySQL, mysqld_safe will still
attempt to run the old mysqld-max server. If you perform
such an upgrade, you should manually remove the old
mysqld-max server to ensure that mysqld_safe runs the new
mysqld server.</p>

<p>To override the default behavior and specify explicitly
the name of the server you want to run, specify a --mysqld
or --mysqld-version option to mysqld_safe. You can also use
--ledir to indicate the directory where mysqld_safe should
look for the server.</p>

<p>Many of the options to mysqld_safe are the same as the
options to mysqld. See Section 5.1.2, Server Command
Options.</p>

<p>Options unknown to mysqld_safe are passed to mysqld if
they are specified on the command line, but ignored if they
are specified in the [mysqld_safe] group of an option file.
See Section 4.2.3.3, Using Option Files.</p>

<p>mysqld_safe reads all options from the [mysqld],
[server], and [mysqld_safe] sections in option files. For
example, if you specify a [mysqld] section like this,
mysqld_safe will find and use the --log-error option:</p>

<p>[mysqld] log-error=error.log</p>

<p>For backward compatibility, mysqld_safe also reads
[safe_mysqld] sections, although you should rename such
sections to [mysqld_safe] in MySQL 5.0 installations.</p>

<p>mysqld_safe supports the following options. It also
reads option files and supports the options for processing
them described at Section 4.2.3.3.1, Command-Line Options
that Affect Option-File Handling.</p>

<p>&middot; --help</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit. (Added in MySQL
5.0.3)</p>

<p>&middot; --autoclose</p>

<p>(NetWare only) On NetWare, mysqld_safe provides a screen
presence. When you unload (shut down) the mysqld_safe NLM,
the screen does not by default go away. Instead, it prompts
for user input:</p>

<p>*&lt;NLM has terminated; Press any key to close the
screen&gt;*</p>

<p>If you want NetWare to close the screen automatically
instead, use the --autoclose option to mysqld_safe.</p>

<p>&middot; --basedir=path</p>

<p>The path to the MySQL installation directory.</p>

<p>&middot; --core-file-size=size</p>

<p>The size of the core file that mysqld should be able to
create. The option value is passed to ulimit -c.</p>

<p>&middot; --datadir=path</p>

<p>The path to the data directory.</p>

<p>&middot; --defaults-extra-file=path</p>

<p>The name of an option file to be read in addition to the
usual option files. This must be the first option on the
command line if it is used. As of MySQL 5.0.6, if the file
does not exist or is otherwise inaccessible, the server will
exit with an error.</p>

<p>&middot; --defaults-file=file_name</p>

<p>The name of an option file to be read instead of the
usual option files. This must be the first option on the
command line if it is used.</p>

<p>&middot; --ledir=path</p>

<p>If mysqld_safe cannot find the server, use this option
to indicate the path name to the directory where the server
is located.</p>

<p>&middot; --log-error=file_name</p>

<p>Write the error log to the given file. See Section
5.2.1, The Error Log.</p>

<p>&middot; --mysqld=prog_name</p>

<p>The name of the server program (in the ledir directory)
that you want to start. This option is needed if you use the
MySQL binary distribution but have the data directory
outside of the binary distribution. If mysqld_safe cannot
find the server, use the --ledir option to indicate the path
name to the directory where the server is located.</p>

<p>&middot; --mysqld-version=suffix</p>

<p>This option is similar to the --mysqld option, but you
specify only the suffix for the server program name. The
basename is assumed to be mysqld. For example, if you use
--mysqld-version=debug, mysqld_safe starts the mysqld-debug
program in the ledir directory. If the argument to
--mysqld-version is empty, mysqld_safe uses mysqld in the
ledir directory.</p>

<p>&middot; --nice=priority</p>

<p>Use the nice program to set the server&acute;s
scheduling priority to the given value.</p>

<p>&middot; --no-defaults</p>

<p>Do not read any option files. This must be the first
option on the command line if it is used.</p>

<p>&middot; --open-files-limit=count</p>

<p>The number of files that mysqld should be able to open.
The option value is passed to ulimit -n. Note that you need
to start mysqld_safe as root for this to work properly!</p>

<p>&middot; --pid-file=file_name</p>

<p>The path name of the process ID file.</p>

<p>&middot; --port=port_num</p>

<p>The port number that the server should use when
listening for TCP/IP connections. The port number must be
1024 or higher unless the server is started by the root
system user.</p>

<p>&middot; --skip-kill-mysqld</p>

<p>Do not try to kill stray mysqld processes at startup.
This option works only on Linux.</p>

<p>&middot; --socket=path</p>

<p>The Unix socket file that the server should use when
listening for local connections.</p>

<p>&middot; --timezone=timezone</p>

<p>Set the TZ time zone environment variable to the given
option value. Consult your operating system documentation
for legal time zone specification formats.</p>

<p>&middot; --user={user_name|user_id}</p>

<p>Run the mysqld server as the user having the name
user_name or the numeric user ID user_id. (User in this
context refers to a system login account, not a MySQL user
listed in the grant tables.)</p>

<p>If you execute mysqld_safe with the --defaults-file or
--defaults-extra-file option to name an option file, the
option must be the first one given on the command line or
the option file will not be used. For example, this command
will not use the named option file:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; mysqld_safe --port=port_num
--defaults-file=file_name</p>

<p>Instead, use the following command:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; mysqld_safe --defaults-file=file_name
--port=port_num</p>

<p>The mysqld_safe script is written so that it normally
can start a server that was installed from either a source
or a binary distribution of MySQL, even though these types
of distributions typically install the server in slightly
different locations. (See Section 2.7, Installation Layouts
.) mysqld_safe expects one of the following conditions to be
true:</p>

<p>&middot; The server and databases can be found relative
to the working directory (the directory from which
mysqld_safe is invoked). For binary distributions,
mysqld_safe looks under its working directory for bin and
data directories. For source distributions, it looks for
libexec and var directories. This condition should be met if
you execute mysqld_safe from your MySQL installation
directory (for example, /usr/local/mysql for a binary
distribution).</p>

<p>&middot; If the server and databases cannot be found
relative to the working directory, mysqld_safe attempts to
locate them by absolute path names. Typical locations are
/usr/local/libexec and /usr/local/var. The actual locations
are determined from the values configured into the
distribution at the time it was built. They should be
correct if MySQL is installed in the location specified at
configuration time.</p>

<p>Because mysqld_safe tries to find the server and
databases relative to its own working directory, you can
install a binary distribution of MySQL anywhere, as long as
you run mysqld_safe from the MySQL installation
directory:</p>

<p>shell&gt; cd mysql_installation_directory shell&gt;
bin/mysqld_safe &amp;</p>

<p>If mysqld_safe fails, even when invoked from the MySQL
installation directory, you can specify the --ledir and
--datadir options to indicate the directories in which the
server and databases are located on your system.</p>

<p>Normally, you should not edit the mysqld_safe script.
Instead, configure mysqld_safe by using command-line options
or options in the [mysqld_safe] section of a my.cnf option
file. In rare cases, it might be necessary to edit
mysqld_safe to get it to start the server properly. However,
if you do this, your modified version of mysqld_safe might
be overwritten if you upgrade MySQL in the future, so you
should make a copy of your edited version that you can
reinstall.</p>

<p>On NetWare, mysqld_safe is a NetWare Loadable Module
(NLM) that is ported from the original Unix shell script. It
starts the server as follows:</p>

<p>1. Runs a number of system and option checks.</p>

<p>2. Runs a check on MyISAM tables.</p>

<p>3. Provides a screen presence for the MySQL server.</p>

<p>4. Starts mysqld, monitors it, and restarts it if it
terminates in error.</p>

<p>5. Sends error messages from mysqld to the host_name.err
file in the data directory.</p>

<p>6. Sends mysqld_safe screen output to the host_name.safe
file in the data directory.</p>
