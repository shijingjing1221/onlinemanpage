<p>NAME libblkid - block device identification library</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;blkid/blkid.h&gt;</p>

<p>cc file.c -lblkid</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The libblkid library is used to identify
block devices (disks) as to their content (e.g. filesystem
type) as well as extracting additional information such as
filesystem labels/volume names, unique identi- fiers/serial
numbers, etc. A common use is to allow use of LABEL= and
UUID= tags instead of hard-coding specific block device
names into con- figuration files.</p>

<p>Block device information is normally kept in a cache
file /etc/blkid/blkid.tab and is verified to still be valid
before being returned to the user (if the user has read
permission on the raw block device, otherwise not). The
cache file also allows unprivileged users (normally anyone
other than root, or those not in the &quot;disk&quot; group)
to locate devices by label/id.</p>

<p>In situations where one is getting information about a
single known device, it does not impact performance whether
the cache is used or not (unless you are not able to read
the block device directly). If you are dealing with multiple
devices use of the cache is highly recom- mended (even if
empty) as devices will be scanned at most one time, and the
on-disk cache will be updated if possible. There is rarely a
rea- son not to use the cache.</p>

<p>In some cases (modular kernels), block devices are not
even visible until after they are accessed the first time,
so it is critical that there is some way to locate these
devices without enumerating only vis- ible devices, so the
use of the cache file is required in this situa- tion.</p>

<p>AUTHOR libblkid was written by Andreas Dilger for the
ext2 filesystem util- ties, with input from Ted Ts o. The
library was subsequently heavily modified by Ted Tso.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/blkid/blkid.tab Caches data extracted from
each recognized block device.</p>
