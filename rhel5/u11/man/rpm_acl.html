<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) ACL(5) BSD File
Formats Manual ACL(5)</p>

<p>NAME acl - Access Control Lists</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes POSIX Access
Control Lists, which are used to define more fine-grained
discretionary access rights for files and direc- tories.</p>

<p>ACL TYPES Every object can be thought of as having
associated with it an ACL that governs the discretionary
access to that object; this ACL is referred to as an access
ACL. In addition, a directory may have an associated ACL
that governs the initial access ACL for objects created
within that directory; this ACL is referred to as a default
ACL.</p>

<p>ACL ENTRIES An ACL consists of a set of ACL entries. An
ACL entry specifies the access permissions on the associated
object for an individual user or a group of users as a
combination of read, write and search/execute permis-
sions.</p>

<p>An ACL entry contains an entry tag type, an optional
entry tag qualifier, and a set of permissions. We use the
term qualifier to denote the entry tag qualifier of an ACL
entry.</p>

<p>The qualifier denotes the identifier of a user or a
group, for entries with tag types of ACL_USER or ACL_GROUP,
respectively. Entries with tag types other than ACL_USER or
ACL_GROUP have no defined qualifiers.</p>

<p>The following entry tag types are defined:</p>

<p>ACL_USER_OBJ The ACL_USER_OBJ entry denotes access
rights for the file owner.</p>

<p>ACL_USER ACL_USER entries denote access rights for users
identified by the entrys qualifier.</p>

<p>ACL_GROUP_OBJ The ACL_GROUP_OBJ entry denotes access
rights for the file group.</p>

<p>ACL_GROUP ACL_GROUP entries denote access rights for
groups identified by the entrys qualifier.</p>

<p>ACL_MASK The ACL_MASK entry denotes the maximum access
rights that can be granted by entries of type ACL_USER,
ACL_GROUP_OBJ, or ACL_GROUP.</p>

<p>ACL_OTHER The ACL_OTHER entry denotes access rights for
pro- cesses that do not match any other entry in the
ACL.</p>

<p>When an access check is performed, the ACL_USER_OBJ and
ACL_USER entries are tested against the effective user ID.
The effective group ID, as well as all supplementary group
IDs are tested against the ACL_GROUP_OBJ and ACL_GROUP
entries.</p>

<p>VALID ACLs A valid ACL contains exactly one entry with
each of the ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, and ACL_OTHER tag
types. Entries with ACL_USER and ACL_GROUP tag types may
appear zero or more times in an ACL. An ACL that contains
entries of ACL_USER or ACL_GROUP tag types must contain
exactly one entry of the ACL_MASK tag type. If an ACL
contains no entries of ACL_USER or ACL_GROUP tag types, the
ACL_MASK entry is optional.</p>

<p>All user ID qualifiers must be unique among all entries
of ACL_USER tag type, and all group IDs must be unique among
all entries of ACL_GROUP tag type.</p>

<p>The acl_get_file() function returns an ACL with zero ACL
entries as the default ACL of a directory, if the directory
is not associated with a default ACL. The acl_set_file()
function also accepts an ACL with zero ACL entries as a
valid default ACL for directories, denoting that the
directory shall not be associated with a default ACL. This
is equivalent to using the acl_delete_def_file()
function.</p>

<p>CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN ACL ENTRIES AND FILE PERMISSION
BITS The permissions defined by ACLs are a superset of the
permissions speci- fied by the file permission bits. The
permissions defined for the file owner correspond to the
permissions of the ACL_USER_OBJ entry. The per- missions
defined for the file group correspond to the permissions of
the ACL_GROUP_OBJ entry, if the ACL has no ACL_MASK entry.
If the ACL has an ACL_MASK entry, then the permissions
defined for the file group corre- spond to the permissions
of the ACL_MASK entry. The permissions defined for the other
class correspond to the permissions of the ACL_OTHER_OBJ
entry.</p>

<p>Modification of the file permission bits results in the
modification of the permissions in the associated ACL
entries. Modification of the per- missions in the ACL
entries results in the modification of the file per- mission
bits.</p>

<p>OBJECT CREATION AND DEFAULT ACLs The access ACL of a
file object is initialized when the object is created with
any of the creat(), mkdir(), mknod(), mkfifo(), or open()
functions. If a default ACL is associated with a directory,
the mode parameter to the functions creating file objects
and the default ACL of the directory are used to determine
the ACL of the new object:</p>

<p>1. The new object inherits the default ACL of the
containing directory as its access ACL.</p>

<p>2. The access ACL entries corresponding to the file
permission bits are modified so that they contain no
permissions that are not contained in the permissions
specified by the mode parameter.</p>

<p>If no default ACL is associated with a directory, the
mode parameter to the functions creating file objects and
the file creation mask (see umask(2)) are used to determine
the ACL of the new object:</p>

<p>1. The new object is assigned an access ACL containing
entries of tag types ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, and
ACL_OTHER. The permissions of these entries are set to the
permissions specified by the file cre- ation mask.</p>

<p>2. The access ACL entries corresponding to the file
permission bits are modified so that they contain no
permissions that are not contained in the permissions
specified by the mode parameter.</p>

<p>ACCESS CHECK ALGORITHM A process may request read,
write, or execute/search access to a file object protected
by an ACL. The access check algorithm determines whether
access to the object will be granted.</p>

<p>1. If the effective user ID of the process matches the
user ID of the file object owner, then</p>

<p>if the ACL_USER_OBJ entry contains the requested
permissions, access is granted,</p>

<p>else access is denied.</p>

<p>2. else if the effective user ID of the process matches
the qualifier of any entry of type ACL_USER, then</p>

<p>if the matching ACL_USER entry and the ACL_MASK entry
contain the requested permissions, access is granted,</p>

<p>else access is denied.</p>

<p>3. else if the effective group ID or any of the
supplementary group IDs of the process match the file group
or the qualifier of any entry of type ACL_GROUP, then</p>

<p>if the ACL contains an ACL_MASK entry, then</p>

<p>if the ACL_MASK entry and any of the matching
ACL_GROUP_OBJ or ACL_GROUP entries contain the requested
permissions, access is granted,</p>

<p>else access is denied.</p>

<p>else (note that there can be no ACL_GROUP entries
without an ACL_MASK entry)</p>

<p>if the ACL_GROUP_OBJ entry contains the requested
permis- sions, access is granted,</p>

<p>else access is denied.</p>

<p>4. else if the ACL_OTHER entry contains the requested
permissions, access is granted.</p>

<p>5. else access is denied.</p>

<p>ACL TEXT FORMS A long and a short text form for
representing ACLs is defined. In both forms, ACL entries are
represented as three colon separated fields: an ACL entry
tag type, an ACL entry qualifier, and the discretionary
access permissions. The first field contains one of the
following entry tag type keywords:</p>

<p>user A user ACL entry specifies the access granted to
either the file owner (entry tag type ACL_USER_OBJ) or a
specified user (entry tag type ACL_USER).</p>

<p>group A group ACL entry specifies the access granted to
either the file group (entry tag type ACL_GROUP_OBJ) or a
speci- fied group (entry tag type ACL_GROUP).</p>

<p>mask A mask ACL entry specifies the maximum access which
can be granted by any ACL entry except the user entry for
the file owner and the other entry (entry tag type
ACL_MASK).</p>

<p>other An other ACL entry specifies the access granted to
any pro- cess that does not match any user or group ACL
entries (entry tag type ACL_OTHER).</p>

<p>The second field contains the user or group identifier
of the user or group associated with the ACL entry for
entries of entry tag type ACL_USER or ACL_GROUP, and is
empty for all other entries. A user identi- fier can be a
user name or a user ID number in decimal form. A group
identifier can be a group name or a group ID number in
decimal form.</p>

<p>The third field contains the discretionary access
permissions. The read, write and search/execute permissions
are represented by the r, w, and x characters, in this
order. Each of these characters is replaced by the -
character to denote that a permission is absent in the ACL
entry. When converting from the text form to the internal
representation, permissions that are absent need not be
specified.</p>

<p>White space is permitted at the beginning and end of
each ACL entry, and immediately before and after a field
separator (the colon character).</p>

<p>LONG TEXT FORM The long text form contains one ACL entry
per line. In addition, a number sign (#) may start a comment
that extends until the end of the line. If an ACL_USER,
ACL_GROUP_OBJ or ACL_GROUP ACL entry contains permissions
that are not also contained in the ACL_MASK entry, the entry
is followed by a number sign, the string effective:, and the
effective access per- missions defined by that entry. This
is an example of the long text form:</p>

<p>user::rw- user:lisa:rw- #effective:r-- group::r--
group:toolies:rw- #effective:r-- mask::r-- other::r--</p>

<p>SHORT TEXT FORM The short text form is a sequence of ACL
entries separated by commas, and is used for input. Comments
are not supported. Entry tag type keywords may either appear
in their full unabbreviated form, or in their single letter
abbreviated form. The abbreviation for user is u, the
abbreviation for group is g, the abbreviation for mask is m,
and the abbreviation for other is o. The permissions may
contain at most one each of the follow- ing characters in
any order: r, w, x. These are examples of the short text
form:</p>

<p>u::rw-,u:lisa:rw-,g::r--,g:toolies:rw-,m::r--,o::r--
g:toolies:rw,u:lisa:rw,u::wr,g::r,o::r,m::r</p>

<p>RATIONALE IEEE 1003.1e draft 17 defines Access Control
Lists that include entries of tag type ACL_MASK, and defines
a mapping between file permission bits that is not constant.
The standard working group defined this relatively complex
interface in order to ensure that applications that are
compliant with IEEE 1003.1 (POSIX.1) will still function as
expected on systems with ACLs. The IEEE 1003.1e draft 17
contains the rationale for choosing this interface in
section B.23.</p>

<p>CHANGES TO THE FILE UTILITIES On a system that supports
ACLs, the file utilities ls(1), cp(1), and mv(1) change
their behavior in the following way:</p>

<p>&middot; For files that have a default ACL or an access
ACL that contains more than the three required ACL entries,
the ls(1) utility in the long form produced by ls -l
displays a plus sign (+) after the permission string.</p>

<p>&middot; If the -p flag is specified, the cp(1) utility
also preserves ACLs. If this is not possible, a warning is
produced.</p>

<p>&middot; The mv(1) utility always preserves ACLs. If
this is not possible, a warning is produced.</p>

<p>The effect of the chmod(1) utility, and of the chmod(2)
system call, on the access ACL is described in
CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN ACL ENTRIES AND FILE PERMISSION
BITS.</p>

<p>STANDARDS The IEEE 1003.1e draft 17 (POSIX.1e) document
describes several secu- rity extensions to the IEEE 1003.1
standard. While the work on 1003.1e has been abandoned, many
UNIX style systems implement parts of POSIX.1e draft 17, or
of earlier drafts.</p>

<p>Linux Access Control Lists implement the full set of
functions and utili- ties defined for Access Control Lists
in POSIX.1e, and several exten- sions. The implementation is
fully compliant with POSIX.1e draft 17; extensions are
marked as such. The Access Control List manipulation
functions are defined in the ACL library (libacl, -lacl).
The POSIX com- pliant interfaces are declared in the
&lt;sys/acl.h&gt; header. Linux-specific extensions to these
functions are declared in the &lt;acl/libacl.h&gt;
header.</p>
