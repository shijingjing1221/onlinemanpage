POSTMASTER(1)</p>

<p>NAME postmaster - PostgreSQL multiuser database
server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS postmaster [ -A 0 | 1 ] [ -B nbuffers ] [ -c
name=value ] [ -d debug-level ] [ -D datadir ] [ -F ] [ -h
hostname ] [ -i ] [ -k directory ] [ -l ] [ -N
max-connections ] [ -o extra-options ] [ -p port ] [ -S ] [
--name=value ] [ -n | -s ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION postmaster is the PostgreSQL multiuser
database server. In order for a client application to access
a database it connects (over a network or locally) to a
running postmaster. The postmaster then starts a separate
server process (postgres(1)) to handle the connection. The
postmas- ter also manages the communication among server
processes.</p>

<p>By default the postmaster starts in the foreground and
prints log mes- sages to the standard error stream. In
practical applications the post- master should be started as
a background process, perhaps at boot time.</p>

<p>One postmaster always manages the data from exactly one
database clus- ter. A database cluster is a collection of
databases that is stored at a common file system location
(the data area). More than one post- master process can run
on a system at one time, so long as they use different data
areas and different communication ports (see below). A data
area is created with initdb(1).</p>

<p>When the postmaster starts it needs to know the location
of the data area. The location must be specified by the -D
option or the PGDATA environment variable; there is no
default. Typically, -D or PGDATA points directly to the data
area directory created by initdb. Other possible file
layouts are discussed in the documentation.</p>

<p>OPTIONS postmaster accepts the following command line
arguments. For a detailed discussion of the options consult
the documentation. You can also save typing most of these
options by setting up a configuration file.</p>

<p>-A 0|1 Enables run-time assertion checks, which is a
debugging aid to detect programming mistakes. This option is
only available if assertions were enabled when PostgreSQL
was compiled. If so, the default is on.</p>

<p>-B nbuffers Sets the number of shared buffers for use by
the server pro- cesses. The default value of this parameter
is chosen automati- cally by initdb; refer to the
documentation for more informa- tion.</p>

<p>-c name=value Sets a named run-time parameter. The
configuration parameters supported by PostgreSQL are
described in the documentation. Most of the other command
line options are in fact short forms of such a parameter
assignment. -c can appear multiple times to set multiple
parameters.</p>

<p>-d debug-level Sets the debug level. The higher this
value is set, the more debugging output is written to the
server log. Values are from 1 to 5.</p>

<p>-D datadir Specifies the file system location of the
data directory or con- figuration file(s). See the
documentation for details.</p>

<p>-F Disables fsync calls for improved performance, at the
risk of data corruption in the event of a system crash.
Specifying this option is equivalent to disabling the fsync
configuration param- eter. Read the detailed documentation
before using this!</p>

<p>--fsync=true has the opposite effect of this option.</p>

<p>-h hostname Specifies the IP host name or address on
which the postmaster is to listen for TCP/IP connections
from client applications. The value can also be a
comma-separated list of addresses, or * to specify listening
on all available interfaces. An empty value specifies not
listening on any IP addresses, in which case only
Unix-domain sockets can be used to connect to the
postmaster. Defaults to listening only on localhost.
Specifying this option is equivalent to setting the
listen_addresses configuration parameter.</p>

<p>-i Allows remote clients to connect via TCP/IP (Internet
domain) connections. Without this option, only local
connections are accepted. This option is equivalent to
setting listen_addresses to * in postgresql.conf or via
-h.</p>

<p>This option is deprecated since it does not allow access
to the full functionality of listen_addresses. It s usually
better to set listen_addresses directly.</p>

<p>-k directory Specifies the directory of the Unix-domain
socket on which the postmaster is to listen for connections
from client applica- tions. The default is normally /tmp,
but can be changed at build time.</p>

<p>-l Enables secure connections using SSL. PostgreSQL must
have been compiled with support for SSL for this option to
be available. For more information on using SSL, refer to
the documentation.</p>

<p>-N max-connections Sets the maximum number of client
connections that this postmas- ter will accept. By default,
this value is 32, but it can be set as high as your system
will support. (Note that -B is required to be at least twice
-N. See the documentation for a discussion of system
resource requirements for large numbers of client con-
nections.) Specifying this option is equivalent to setting
the max_connections configuration parameter.</p>

<p>-o extra-options The command line-style options
specified in extra-options are passed to all server
processes started by this postmaster. See postgres(1) for
possibilities. If the option string contains any spaces, the
entire string must be quoted.</p>

<p>-p port Specifies the TCP/IP port or local Unix domain
socket file extension on which the postmaster is to listen
for connections from client applications. Defaults to the
value of the PGPORT environment variable, or if PGPORT is
not set, then defaults to the value established during
compilation (normally 5432). If you specify a port other
than the default port, then all client applications must
specify the same port using either command- line options or
PGPORT.</p>

<p>-S Specifies that the postmaster process should start up
in silent mode. That is, it will disassociate from the users
(control- ling) terminal, start its own process group, and
redirect its standard output and standard error to
/dev/null.</p>

<p>Using this switch discards all logging output, which is
probably not what you want, since it makes it very difficult
to trou- bleshoot problems. See below for a better way to
start the post- master in the background.</p>

<p>--silent-mode=false has the opposite effect of this
option.</p>

<p>--name=value Sets a named run-time parameter; a shorter
form of -c.</p>

<p>Two additional command line options are available for
debugging prob- lems that cause a server process to die
abnormally. The ordinary strat- egy in this situation is to
notify all other server processes that they must terminate
and then reinitialize the shared memory and semaphores. This
is because an errant server process could have corrupted
some shared state before terminating. These options select
alternative behaviors of the postmaster in this situation.
Neither option is intended for use in ordinary
operation.</p>

<p>These special-case options are:</p>

<p>-n postmaster will not reinitialize shared data
structures. A knowledgeable system programmer can then use a
debugger to exam- ine shared memory and semaphore state.</p>

<p>-s postmaster will stop all other server processes by
sending the signal SIGSTOP, but will not cause them to
terminate. This per- mits system programmers to collect core
dumps from all server processes by hand.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT PGCLIENTENCODING Default character encoding
used by clients. (The clients may override this
individually.) This value can also be set in the
configuration file.</p>

<p>PGDATA Default data directory location</p>

<p>PGDATESTYLE Default value of the datestyle run-time
parameter. (The use of this environment variable is
deprecated.)</p>

<p>PGPORT Default port (preferably set in the configuration
file)</p>

<p>TZ Server time zone</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS A failure message mentioning semget or
shmget probably indicates you need to configure your kernel
to provide adequate shared memory and semaphores. For more
discussion see the documentation.</p>

<p>Tip: You may be able to postpone reconfiguring your
kernel by decreasing shared_buffers to reduce the shared
memory consump- tion of PostgreSQL, and/or by reducing
max_connections to reduce the semaphore consumption.</p>

<p>A failure message suggesting that another postmaster is
already running should be checked carefully, for example by
using the command</p>

<p>$ ps ax | grep postmaster</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>$ ps -ef | grep postmaster</p>

<p>depending on your system. If you are certain that no
conflicting post- master is running, you may remove the lock
file mentioned in the mes- sage and try again.</p>

<p>A failure message indicating inability to bind to a port
may indicate that that port is already in use by some
non-PostgreSQL process. You may also get this error if you
terminate the postmaster and immediately restart it using
the same port; in this case, you must simply wait a few
seconds until the operating system closes the port before
trying again. Finally, you may get this error if you specify
a port number that your operating system considers to be
reserved. For example, many versions of Unix consider port
numbers under 1024 to be trusted and only permit the Unix
superuser to access them.</p>

<p>NOTES If at all possible, do not use SIGKILL to kill the
postmaster. Doing so will prevent postmaster from freeing
the system resources (e.g., shared memory and semaphores)
that it holds before terminating. This may cause problems
for starting a fresh postmaster run.</p>

<p>To terminate the postmaster normally, the signals
SIGTERM, SIGINT, or SIGQUIT can be used. The first will wait
for all clients to terminate before quitting, the second
will forcefully disconnect all clients, and the third will
quit immediately without proper shutdown, resulting in a
recovery run during restart. The SIGHUP signal will reload
the server configuration files.</p>

<p>The utility command pg_ctl(1) can be used to start and
shut down the postmaster safely and comfortably.</p>

<p>The -- options will not work on FreeBSD or OpenBSD. Use
-c instead. This is a bug in the affected operating systems;
a future release of PostgreSQL will provide a workaround if
this is not fixed.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To start postmaster in the background using
default values, type:</p>

<p>$ nohup postmaster &gt;logfile 2&gt;&amp;1 &lt;/dev/null
&amp;</p>

<p>To start postmaster with a specific port:</p>

<p>$ postmaster -p 1234</p>

<p>This command will start up postmaster communicating
through the port 1234. In order to connect to this
postmaster using psql, you would need to run it as</p>

<p>$ psql -p 1234</p>

<p>or set the environment variable PGPORT:</p>

<p>$ export PGPORT=1234 $ psql</p>

<p>Named run-time parameters can be set in either of these
styles:</p>

<p>$ postmaster -c work_mem=1234 $ postmaster
--work-mem=1234</p>

<p>Either form overrides whatever setting might exist for
work_mem in postgresql.conf. Notice that underscores in
parameter names can be written as either underscore or dash
on the command line.</p>

<p>Tip: Except for short-term experiments, it s probably
better practice to edit the setting in postgresql.conf than
to rely on a command-line switch to set a parameter.</p>
