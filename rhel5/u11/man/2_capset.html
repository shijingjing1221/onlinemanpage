<p>CAPGET(2) Linux Programmer s Manual CAPGET(2)</p>

<p>NAME capget, capset - set/get process capabilities</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #undef _POSIX_SOURCE #include
&lt;sys/capability.h&gt;</p>

<p>int capget(cap_user_header_t header, cap_user_data_t
data);</p>

<p>int capset(cap_user_header_t header, const
cap_user_data_t data);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These two functions are the raw kernel
interface for getting and set- ting capabilities. The kernel
API is likely to change and use of these functions (in
particular the format of the cap_user_*_t types) is sub-
ject to change with each kernel revision.</p>

<p>These system calls are specific to Linux. The portable
interfaces are cap_set_proc(3) and cap_get_proc(3).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL One of the arguments was invalid.</p>

<p>EPERM An attempt was made to add a capability to the
Permitted set, or to set a capability in the Effective or
Inheritable sets that is not in the Permitted set.</p>

<p>Linux 2.1 17th May 1998 CAPGET(2)</p>
