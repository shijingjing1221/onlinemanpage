<p>NAME elksemu - Embedded Linux Kernel Subset emulator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /lib/elksemu program [arguments]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Elksemu is a program that allows 8086 ELKS
programs to be run under Linux-i386. These programs can be
compiled using the bcc(1) C compiler.</p>

<p>Yom may use the binfmt-misc module under Linux 2.1.43 or
greater as described in the elksemu README which will cause
the kernel to run elksemu with the correct arguments
whenever the user tries to execute an ELKS executable
directly.</p>

<p>OPTIONS There are no flag options to elksemu, the first
argument is the name of the program to run the rest are
arguments that are passed to the Elks program.</p>

<p>SECURITY The elksemu program may be installed suid-root
and in this event it is able to run execute only (chmod 111)
elks executables and act correctly on the suid permission
bits on any executable. This should be considered a security
hazard so elksemu does not have to be installed suid-root.
If you consider using this facility you should also be aware
that it will override the nosuid mount(8) option.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO bcc(1), as86(1), ld86(1)</p>

<p>BUGS Elksemu is incomplete.</p>

<p>The program may still have security bugs!</p>
