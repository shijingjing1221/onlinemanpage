<p>TAIL(1) User Commands TAIL(1)</p>

<p>NAME tail - output the last part of files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tail [OPTION]... [FILE]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Print the last 10 lines of each FILE to
standard output. With more than one FILE, precede each with
a header giving the file name. With no FILE, or when FILE is
-, read standard input.</p>

<p>Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options too.</p>

<p>--retry keep trying to open a file even if it is
inaccessible when tail starts or if it becomes inaccessible
later; useful when follow- ing by name, i.e., with
--follow=name</p>

<p>-c, --bytes=N output the last N bytes</p>

<p>-f, --follow[={name|descriptor}] output appended data as
the file grows; -f, --follow, and --fol- low=descriptor are
equivalent</p>

<p>-F same as --follow=name --retry</p>

<p>-n, --lines=N output the last N lines, instead of the
last 10</p>

<p>--max-unchanged-stats=N with --follow=name, reopen a
FILE which has not changed size after N (default 5)
iterations to see if it has been unlinked or renamed (this
is the usual case of rotated log files)</p>

<p>--pid=PID with -f, terminate after process ID, PID
dies</p>

<p>-q, --quiet, --silent never output headers giving file
names</p>

<p>-s, --sleep-interval=S with -f, sleep for approximately
S seconds (default 1.0) between iterations.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose always output headers giving file
names</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>If the first character of N (the number of bytes or
lines) is a +, print beginning with the Nth item from the
start of each file, other- wise, print the last N items in
the file. N may have a multiplier suf- fix: b 512, k 1024, m
1024*1024.</p>

<p>With --follow (-f), tail defaults to following the file
descriptor, which means that even if a tailed file is
renamed, tail will continue to track its end. This default
behavior is not desirable when you really want to track the
actual name of the file, not the file descrip- tor (e.g.,
log rotation). Use --follow=name in that case. That causes
tail to track the named file by reopening it periodically to
see if it has been removed and recreated by some other
program.</p>

<p>_POSIX2_VERSIONCOMPATIBILITY ISSUES: On older systems,
the leading - can be replaced by + in the obso- lete option
syntax with the same meaning as in counts, and obsolete
usage overrides normal usage when the two conflict. This
obsolete behavior can be enabled or disabled with the
_POSIX2_VERSION environ- ment variable, but portable scripts
should avoid commands whose behav- ior depends on this
variable. For example, use tail -- - main.c or tail main.c
rather than the ambiguous tail - main.c, tail -c4 or tail -c
10 4 rather than the ambiguous tail -c 4, and tail ./+4 or
tail -n +4 rather than the ambiguous tail +4 . You can work
around those compatibility problems by setting
_POSIX2_VERSION=199209 in your environment.</p>
