<p>NAME cups-driverd - cups driver daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cups-driverd cat ppd-name cups-driverd list
request_id limit options</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cups-driverd shows or lists PPD files. It is
run in response to CUPS- Add-Modify-Printer or
CUPS-Get-Devices requests. The first form
(&quot;cups-driverd cat ppd-name&quot;) writes the named PPD
file to stdout. The output format is an uncompressed PPD
file.</p>

<p>The second form lists the available manufacturers or PPD
files to std- out as indicated by the options argument. The
output format is an IPP response message. The request_id
argument is the request ID from the original IPP request,
typically 1. The Ilimit argument is the limit value from the
original IPP request - 0 means no limit. Finally, the
options argument is a space-delimited list of attributes
(&quot;name=value name=value cups-driverd looks for the
ppd-make and requested-attributes attributes and tailors the
output accordingly.</p>

<p>DRIVERS Drivers can be static PPD files under the
/usr/share/cups/model direc- tory or programs under the
/usr/lib/cups/driver directory. Static PPD files must
conform to the Adobe PPD File Format Specification version
4.3 and may be compressed using the gzip(1) program. Driver
programs must implement the command-line interface shown in
the next section. Driver programs provide an interface to
dynamically-generated PPD files. The following arguments are
currently defined:</p>

<p>drivername list Lists the supported PPD files to
stdout.</p>

<p>drivername cat ppdname Writes the named PPD file to
stdout. When run with the single argument &quot;list&quot;,
the program must list the available PPD files it can
generate to stdout using the following format:
&quot;drivername:ppdname&quot; language &quot;make&quot;
&quot;make and model&quot; &quot;1284 device id&quot;</p>

<p>Drivername is the name of the driver program. Ppdname is
the name used to select the given driver. Language is the
locale associated with the default language of the PPD file,
typically &quot;en&quot;. Make is the Manufac- turer name
from the PPD file. Make and model is the NickName name from
the PPD file. 1284 device id is the 1284DeviceId from the
PPD file, if any. When the driver program is run with the
&quot;cat ppdname&quot; arguments, it must write the named
PPD file to stdout, uncompressed. If the named PPD file does
not exist, the driver program must not write any output to
stdout and report the error to stderr instead. Error
messages can be relayed back to cupsd by writing them to
stderr. The following pre- fixes are recognized:</p>

<p>DEBUG: [drivername] Debugging messages</p>

<p>ERROR: [drivername] Error messages</p>

<p>INFO: [drivername] Informational messages</p>
