<p>RSH(1) RSH(1)</p>

<p>NAME rsh - remote shell</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rsh host [-l username] [-n] [-d] [-k realm] [-f
| -F] [-x] [-PN | -PO] command</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rsh connects to the specified host, and
executes the specified command. Rsh copies its standard
input to the remote command, the standard out- put of the
remote command to its standard output, and the standard
error of the remote command to its standard error. This
implementation of rsh will accept any port for the standard
error stream. Interrupt, quit and terminate signals are
propagated to the remote command; rsh normally terminates
when the remote command does.</p>

<p>Each user may have a private authorization list in a
file .k5login in his login directory. Each line in this file
should contain a Kerberos principal name of the form
principal/instance@realm. If there is a ~/.k5login file,
then access is granted to the account if and only if the
originating user is authenticated to one of the principals
named in the ~/.k5login file. Otherwise, the originating
user will be granted access to the account if and only if
the authenticated principal name of the user can be mapped
to the local account name using the aname -&gt; lname
mapping rules (see krb5_anadd(8) for more details).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -l username sets the remote username to
username. Otherwise, the remote username will be the same as
the local username.</p>

<p>-x causes the network session traffic to be encrypted.
This applies only to the input and output streams, and not
the com- mand line.</p>

<p>-f cause nonforwardable Kerberos credentials to be
forwarded to the remote machine for use by the specified
command. They will be removed when command finishes. This
option is mutually exclu- sive with the -F option.</p>

<p>-F cause forwardable Kerberos credentials to be
forwarded to the remote machine for use by the specified
command. They will be removed when command finishes. This
option is mutually exclu- sive with the -f option.</p>

<p>-k realm causes rsh to obtain tickets for the remote
host in realm instead of the remote hosts realm as
determined by krb_real- mofhost(3).</p>

<p>-d turns on socket debugging (via setsockopt(2)) on the
TCP sockets used for communication with the remote host.</p>

<p>-n redirects input from the special device /dev/null
(see the BUGS section below).</p>

<p>-PN</p>

<p>-PO Explicitly request new or old version of the
Kerberos rcmd protocol. The new protocol avoids many
security problems found in the old one, but is not
interoperable with older servers. (An &quot;input/output
error&quot; and a closed connection is the most likely
result of attempting this combination.) If neither option is
specified, some simple heuristics are used to guess which to
try.</p>

<p>If you omit command, then instead of executing a single
command, you will be logged in on the remote host using
rlogin(1).</p>

<p>Shell metacharacters which are not quoted are
interpreted on the local machine, while quoted
metacharacters are interpreted on the remote machine. Thus
the command</p>

<p>rsh otherhost cat remotefile &gt;&gt; localfile</p>

<p>appends the remote file remotefile to the local file
localfile, while</p>

<p>rsh otherhost cat remotefile &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;
otherremotefile</p>

<p>appends remotefile to otherremotefile.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/hosts ~/.k5login (on remote host) - file
containing Kerberos principals that are allowed access.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO rlogin(1), kerberos(3), krb_sendauth(3),
krb_realmofhost(3), kshd(8)</p>

<p>BUGS If you are using csh(1) and put a rsh(1) in the
background without redirecting its input away from the
terminal, it will block even if no reads are posted by the
remote command. If no input is desired you should redirect
the input of rsh to /dev/null using the -n option.</p>

<p>You cannot run an interactive command (like rogue(6) or
vi(1)); use rlogin(1).</p>

<p>Stop signals stop the local rsh process only; this is
arguably wrong, but currently hard to fix for reasons too
complicated to explain here.</p>
