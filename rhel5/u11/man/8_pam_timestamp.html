<p>NAME pam_timestamp - authenticate using cached
successful authentication attempts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS auth sufficient /lib/security/pam_timestamp.so
session optional /lib/security/pam_timestamp.so</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In a nutshell, pam_timestamp caches
successful authentication attempts, and allows you to use a
recent successful attempt as the basis for
authentication.</p>

<p>When an application opens a session using pam_timestamp,
a timestamp file is created in the timestampdir directory
for the user. When an application attempts to authenticate
the user, a pam_timestamp will treat a sufficiently- recent
timestamp file as grounds for succeeding.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS debug turns on debugging via syslog(3).</p>

<p>timestampdir=name tells pam_timestamp.so where to place
and search for timestamp files. This should match the
directory configured for sudo(1) in the sudoers(5) file.</p>

<p>timestamp_timeout=number tells pam_timestamp.so how long
it should treat timestamp files as valid after their last
modification date. This should match the value configured
for sudo(1) in the sudoers(5) file.</p>

<p>verbose attempt to inform the user when access is
granted.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE /etc/pam.d/some-config-tool: auth sufficient
/lib/security/pam_timestamp.so verbose auth required
/lib/security/pam_unix.so session required
/lib/security/pam_permit.so session optional
/lib/security/pam_timestamp.so</p>

<p>CAVEATS Users can get confused when they arent always
asked for passwords when running a given program. Some users
reflexively begin typing informa- tion before noticing that
its not being asked for.</p>

<p>BUGS Let s hope not, but if you find any, please email
the author.</p>
