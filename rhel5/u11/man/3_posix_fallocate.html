<p>POSIX_FALLOCATE(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
POSIX_FALLOCATE(3)</p>

<p>NAME posix_fallocate - allocate file space</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _XOPEN_SOURCE 600 #include
&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_fallocate(int fd, off_t offset, off_t
len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The function posix_fallocate() ensures that
disk space is allocated for the file referred to by the
descriptor fd for the bytes in the range starting at offset
and continuing for len bytes. After a successful call to
posix_fallocate(), subsequent writes to bytes in the
specified range are guaranteed not to fail because of lack
of disk space.</p>

<p>If the size of the file is less than offset+len, then
the file is increased to this size; otherwise the file size
is left unchanged.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE posix_fallocate() returns zero on success,
or an error number on fail- ure. Note that errno is not
set.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF fd is not a valid file descriptor, or is
not opened for writing.</p>

<p>EFBIG offset+len exceeds the maximum file size.</p>

<p>EINVAL offset or len was less than 0.</p>

<p>ENODEV fd does not refer to a regular file.</p>

<p>ENOSPC There is not enough space left on the device
containing the file referred to by fd.</p>

<p>ESPIPE fd refers to a pipe of file descriptor.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY posix_fallocate() is available since glibc
2.1.94.</p>
