<p>NAME alsactl - advanced controls for ALSA soundcard
driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS alsactl [options] [store|restore|names]
&lt;card # or id&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION alsactl is used to control advanced settings
for the ALSA soundcard drivers. It supports multiple
soundcards. If your card has features that you cant seem to
control from a mixer application, you have come to the right
place.</p>

<p>COMMANDS store saves the current driver state for the
selected soundcard to the configuration file.</p>

<p>restore loads driver state for the selected soundcard
from the configu- ration file.</p>

<p>names generates list of available device names for
applications. The card number or id is ignored for this
command. The list is always gen- erated for all available
cards.</p>

<p>If no soundcards are specified, setup for all cards will
be saved or loaded.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, --help Help: show available flags and
commands.</p>

<p>-f, --file Select the configuration file to use. The
default is /etc/asound.state or /etc/asound.names (for the
names command).</p>

<p>-F, --force Used with restore command. Try to restore
the matching control elements as much as possible. This
option is set as default now.</p>

<p>-P, --pedantic Used with restore command. Don t restore
mismatching control elements. This option was the old
default behavior.</p>

<p>-d, --debug Use debug mode: a bit more verbose.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print alsactl version number.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/asound.state (or whatever file you specify
with the -f flag) is used to store current settings for your
soundcards. The settings include all the usual soundcard
mixer settings. More importantly, als- actl is capable of
controlling other card-specific features that mixer apps
usually dont know about.</p>

<p>The configuration file is generated automatically by
running alsactl store. Editing the configuration file by
hand may be necessary for some soundcard features (e.g.
enabling/disabling automatic mic gain, digital output,
joystick/game ports, some future MIDI routing options,
etc).</p>

<p>/etc/asound.names (or whatever file you specify with the
-f flag) is used to store the list of device names available
in your system. The list does not contain all virtual names,
because the name space is infinite, but it detects present
hardware and generates list of common names. The user /
system administrator / another configuration tool might
modify the file to add virtual names as well.</p>
