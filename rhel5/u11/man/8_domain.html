<p>NAME domain - nnrpd domain resolver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS domain domainname</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program can be used in readers.conf to
grant access based on the subdomain part of the remote
hostname. In particular, it only returns success if the
remote hostname ends in domainname. (A leading dot on
domainname is optional; even without it, the argument must
match on dot-separated boundaries). The &quot;username&quot;
returned is whatever initial part of the remote hostname
remains after domainname is removed. It is an error if there
is no initial part (that is, if the remote hostname is
exactly the specified domainname).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following readers.conf(5) fragment grants
access to hosts with internal domain names:</p>

<p>auth internal { res: &quot;domain .internal&quot;
default-domain: &quot;example.com&quot; }</p>

<p>access internal { users: &quot;*@example.com&quot;
newsgroups: example.* }</p>

<p>Access is granted to the example.* groups for all
connections from hosts that resolve to hostnames ending in
&quot;.internal&quot;; a connection from
&quot;foo.internal&quot; would match access groups as
&quot;foo@example.com&quot;.</p>

<p>BUGS It seems the code does not confirm that the
matching part is actually at the end of the remote hostname
(e.g., &quot;domain: example.com&quot; would match the
remote host &quot;foo.example.com.org&quot; by ignoring the
trailing &quot;.org&quot; part).</p>

<p>Does this resolver actually provide any useful
functionality not avail- able by using wildcards in the
readers.conf(5) hosts parameter? If so, the example above
should reflect this functionality.</p>
