<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) TELNET(1)
TELNET(1)</p>

<p>NAME telnet - user interface to the TELNET protocol</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS telnet [-8] [-E] [-F] [-K] [-L] [-S tos] [-X
authtype] [-a] [-c] [-d] [-e escapechar] [-f] [-k realm] [-l
user] [-n tracefile] [-r] [-x] [host [port]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The telnet command is used to communicate
with another host using the TELNET protocol. If telnet is
invoked without the host argument, it enters command mode,
indicated by its prompt ( telnet&gt;). In this mode, it
accepts and executes the commands listed below. If it is
invoked with arguments, it performs an open command with
those arguments.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -8 Specify an 8-bit data path. This causes an
attempt to negotiate the TELNET BINARY option on both input
and output.</p>

<p>-E Stop any character from being recognized as an escape
character.</p>

<p>-F forward a forwardable copy of the local credentials
to the remote system.</p>

<p>-K Specify no automatic login to the remote system.</p>

<p>-L Specify an 8-bit data path on output. This causes the
BINARY option to be negotiated on output.</p>

<p>-S tos Set the IP type-of-service (TOS) option for the
telnet connec- tion to the value tos, which can be a numeric
TOS value (in dec- imal, or a hex value preceded by 0x, or
an octal value preceded by a leading 0) or, on systems that
support it, a symbolic TOS name found in the /etc/iptos
file.</p>

<p>-X atype Disable the atype type of authentication.</p>

<p>-a Attempt automatic login. This sends the user name via
the USER variable of the ENVIRON option, if supported by the
remote sys- tem. The name used is that of the current user
as returned by getlogin(2) if it agrees with the current
user ID; otherwise it is the name associated with the user
ID.</p>

<p>-c Disable the reading of the user s .telnetrc file.
(See the tog- gle skiprc command on this man page.)</p>

<p>-d Set the initial value of the debug flag to TRUE</p>

<p>-e escape char Set the initial telnet escape character
or telnet rlogin escape character to escape char. If escape
char is omitted, then there will be no escape character.</p>

<p>-f forward a copy of the local credentials to the remote
system.</p>

<p>-k realm If Kerberos authentication is being used,
request that telnet obtain tickets for the remote host in
realm realm instead of the remote host s realm, as
determined by krb_realmofhost(3).</p>

<p>-l user If the remote system understands the ENVIRON
option, then user will be sent to the remote system as the
value for the variable USER. This option implies the -a
option. This option may also be used with the open
command.</p>

<p>-n tracefile Open tracefile for recording trace
information. See the set tracefile command below.</p>

<p>-r Specify a user interface similar to rlogin(1). In
this mode, the telnet rlogin escape character is set to the
tilde (~) char- acter, unless modified by the -e option.</p>

<p>-x Turn on encryption of the data stream. When this
option is turned on, telnet will exit with an error if
authentication can- not be negotiated or if encryption
cannot be turned on.</p>

<p>host Indicates the name, alias, or Internet address of
the remote host.</p>

<p>port Indicates a port number (address of an
application). If the port is not specified, the default
telnet port (23) is used.</p>

<p>When in rlogin mode, ~ is the telnet rlogin escape
character; a line of the form ~. disconnects from the remote
host. Similarly, the line ~^Z suspends the telnet session.
The line ~^] escapes to the normal telnet escape prompt.</p>

<p>Once a connection has been opened, telnet will attempt
to enable the TELNET LINEMODE option. If this fails, then
telnet will revert to one of two input modes: either
character at a time or old line by line, depending on what
the remote system supports.</p>

<p>When LINEMODE is enabled, character processing is done
on the local system, under the control of the remote system.
When input editing or character echoing is to be disabled,
the remote system will relay that information. The remote
system will also relay changes to any special characters
that happen on the remote system, so that they can take
effect on the local system.</p>

<p>In character at a time mode, most text typed is
immediately sent to the remote host for processing.</p>

<p>In old line by line mode, all text is echoed locally,
and (nor- mally) only completed lines are sent to the remote
host. The local echo character (initially ^E) may be used to
turn off and on the local echo. (This would mostly be used
to enter passwords without the password being echoed).</p>

<p>If the LINEMODE option is enabled, or if the localchars
flag is TRUE (the default for old line by line ; see below),
the users quit, intr, and flush characters are trapped
locally, and sent as TELNET pro- tocol sequences to the
remote side. If LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then the
user s susp and eof are also sent as TELNET protocol
sequences, and quit is sent as a TELNET ABORT instead of
BREAK. There are options (see toggle autoflush and toggle
autosynch below) which cause this action to flush subsequent
output to the terminal (until the remote host acknowledges
the TELNET sequence) and flush previous termi- nal input (in
the case of quit and intr).</p>

<p>While connected to a remote host, telnet command mode
may be entered by typing the telnet escape character
(initially ^]). When in command mode, the normal terminal
editing conventions are available.</p>

<p>The following telnet commands are available. Only enough
of each com- mand to uniquely identify it need be typed
(this is also true for argu- ments to the mode, set, toggle,
unset, slc, environ, and display com- mands).</p>

<p>auth argument ... The auth command manipulates the
information sent through the TELNET AUTHENTICATE option.
Valid arguments for the auth com- mand are as follows:</p>

<p>disable type Disables the specified type of
authentication. To obtain a list of available types, use the
auth disable ? com- mand.</p>

<p>enable type Enables the specified type of
authentication. To obtain a list of available types, use the
auth enable ? com- mand.</p>

<p>status Lists the current status of the various types of
authen- tication.</p>

<p>close Close a TELNET session and return to command
mode.</p>

<p>display argument ... Displays some or all of the set and
toggle values (see below).</p>

<p>encrypt argument ... The encrypt command manipulates the
information sent through the TELNET ENCRYPT option.</p>

<p>Note: Because of export controls, the TELNET ENCRYPT
option is not supported outside of the United States and
Canada.</p>

<p>Valid arguments for the encrypt command are as
follows:</p>

<p>disable type [input|output] Disables the specified type
of encryption. If you omit the input and output, both input
and output are disabled. To obtain a list of available
types, use the encrypt dis- able ? command.</p>

<p>enable type]fP [input|output] Enables the specified type
of encryption. If you omit input and output, both input and
output are enabled. To obtain a list of available types, use
the encrypt enable ? command.</p>

<p>input This is the same as the encrypt start input
command.</p>

<p>-input This is the same as the encrypt stop input
command.</p>

<p>output This is the same as the encrypt start output
command.</p>

<p>-output This is the same as the encrypt stop output
command.</p>

<p>start [input|output] Attempts to start encryption. If
you omit input and out- put, both input and output are
enabled. To obtain a list of available types, use the
encrypt enable ? command.</p>

<p>status Lists the current status of encryption.</p>

<p>stop [input|output] Stops encryption. If you omit input
and output, encryp- tion is on both input and output.</p>

<p>type type Sets the default type of encryption to be used
with later encrypt start or encrypt stop commands.</p>

<p>environ arguments ... The environ command is used to
manipulate the the variables that my be sent through the
TELNET ENVIRON option. The initial set of variables is taken
from the users environment, with only the DISPLAY and
PRINTER variables being exported by default. The USER
variable is also exported if the -a or -l options are
used.</p>

<p>Valid arguments for the environ command are:</p>

<p>define variable value Define the variable variable to
have a value of value. Variables defined by this command are
not automatically exported. The value may be enclosed in
single or double quotes so that tabs and spaces may be
included.</p>

<p>undefine variable Remove variable from the list of
environment variables.</p>

<p>export variable Mark the variable variable to be
exported to the remote side.</p>

<p>unexport variable Mark the variable variable to not be
exported unless explicitly asked for by the remote side.</p>

<p>list List the current set of environment variables.
Those marked with a * will be sent automatically; those
marked with a + will be sent if the other end requests their
values, and other variables will not be sent.</p>

<p>? Prints out help information for the environ
command.</p>

<p>logout Sends the TELNET LOGOUT option to the remote
side. This command is similar to a close command; however,
if the remote side does not support the LOGOUT option,
nothing happens. If, however, the remote side does support
the LOGOUT option, this command should cause the remote side
to close the TELNET connection. If the remote side also
supports the concept of suspending a users session for later
reattachment, the logout argument indicates that you should
terminate the session immediately.</p>

<p>mode type Type is one of several options, depending on
the state of the TELNET session. The remote host is asked
for permission to go into the requested mode. If the remote
host is capable of entering that mode, the requested mode
will be entered.</p>

<p>character Disable the TELNET LINEMODE option, or, if the
remote side does not understand the LINEMODE option, then
enter character at a time mode.</p>

<p>line Enable the TELNET LINEMODE option, or, if the
remote side does not understand the LINEMODE option, then
attempt to enter old-line-by-line mode.</p>

<p>isig (-isig) Attempt to enable (disable) the TRAPSIG
mode of the LINEMODE option. This requires that the LINEMODE
option be enabled.</p>

<p>edit (-edit) Attempt to enable (disable) the EDIT mode
of the LINEMODE option. This requires that the LINEMODE
option be enabled.</p>

<p>softtabs (-softtabs) Attempt to enable (disable) the
SOFT_TAB mode of the LINEMODE option. This requires that the
LINEMODE option be enabled.</p>

<p>litecho (-litecho) Attempt to enable (disable) the
LIT_ECHO mode of the LINEMODE option. This requires that the
LINEMODE option be enabled.</p>

<p>? Prints out help information for the mode command.</p>

<p>open host [-a] [[-l] user] [-port] Open a connection to
the named host. If no port number is spec- ified, telnet
will attempt to contact a TELNET server at the default port.
The host specification may be either a host name (see
hosts(5) or an Internet address specified in the dot
notation (see inet(3). After establishing a connection, the
file .telnetrc in the users home directory is opened. Lines
beginning with a # are comment lines. Blank lines are
ignored. Lines that begin without white space are the start
of a machine entry. The first thing on the line is the name
of the machine that is being connected to. The rest of the
line, and succes- sive lines that begin with white space are
assumed to be telnet commands and are processed as if they
had been typed in manually to the telnet command prompt.</p>

<p>-a Attempt automatic login. This sends the user name via
the USER variable of the ENVIRON option, if supported by the
remote system. The name used is that of the current user as
returned by getlogin(2) if it agrees with the current user
ID; otherwise it is the name associated with the user
ID.</p>

<p>[-l] user may be used to specify the user name to be
passed to the remote system via the ENVIRON option.</p>

<p>-port When connecting to a non-standard port, telnet
omits any automatic initiation of TELNET options. When the
port number is preceded by a minus sign, the initial option
negotiation is done.</p>

<p>quit Close any open TELNET session and exit telnet. An
end of file (in command mode) will also close a session and
exit.</p>

<p>send arguments Sends one or more special character
sequences to the remote host. The following are the
arguments which may be specified (more than one argument may
be specified at a time):</p>

<p>abort Sends the TELNET ABORT (Abort processes)
sequence.</p>

<p>ao Sends the TELNET AO (Abort Output) sequence, which
should cause the remote system to flush all output from the
remote system to the users terminal.</p>

<p>ayt Sends the TELNET AYT (Are You There) sequence, to
which the remote system may or may not choose to
respond.</p>

<p>brk Sends the TELNET BRK (Break) sequence, which may
have significance to the remote system.</p>

<p>ec Sends the TELNET EC (Erase Character) sequence, which
should cause the remote system to erase the last charac- ter
entered.</p>

<p>el Sends the TELNET EL (Erase Line) sequence, which
should cause the remote system to erase the line currently
being entered.</p>

<p>eof Sends the TELNET EOF (End Of File) sequence.</p>

<p>eor Sends the TELNET EOR (End of Record) sequence.</p>

<p>escape Sends the current escape character (initially
^.</p>

<p>ga Sends the TELNET GA (Go Ahead) sequence, which likely
has no significance to the remote system.</p>

<p>getstatus If the remote side supports the TELNET STATUS
command, getstatus will send the subnegotiation to request
that the server send its current option status.</p>

<p>ip Sends the TELNET IP (Interrupt Process) sequence,
which should cause the remote system to abort the currently
running process.</p>

<p>nop Sends the TELNET NOP (No OPeration) sequence.</p>

<p>susp Sends the TELNET SUSP (SUSPend process)
sequence.</p>

<p>synch Sends the TELNET SYNCH sequence. This sequence
causes the remote system to discard all previously typed
(but not yet read) input. This sequence is sent as TCP
urgent data (and may not work if the remote system is a
4.2BSD system -- if it doesnt work, a lower case r may be
echoed on the terminal).</p>

<p>do cmd</p>

<p>dont cmd</p>

<p>will cmd</p>

<p>wont cmd Sends the TELNET DO cmd sequence. Cmd can be
either a decimal number between 0 and 255, or a symbolic
name for a specific TELNET command. Cmd can also be either
help or ? to print out help information, including a list of
known symbolic names.</p>

<p>? Prints out help information for the send command.</p>

<p>set argument value</p>

<p>unset argument value The set command will set any one of
a number of telnet variables to a specific value or to TRUE.
The special value off turns off the function associated with
the variable; this is equivalent to using the unset command.
The unset command will disable or set to FALSE any of the
specified functions. The values of vari- ables may be
interrogated with the display command. The vari- ables which
may be set or unset, but not toggled, are listed here. In
addition, any of the variables for the toggle command may be
explicitly set or unset using the set and unset
commands.</p>

<p>ayt If telnet is in localchars mode, or LINEMODE is
enabled, and the status character is typed, a TELNET AYT
sequence (see send ayt preceding) is sent to the remote
host. The initial value for the &quot;Are You There&quot;
character is the terminals status character.</p>

<p>echo This is the value (initially ^E) which, when in
line by line mode, toggles between doing local echo- ing of
entered characters (for normal processing), and suppressing
echoing of entered characters (for entering, say, a
password).</p>

<p>eof If telnet is operating in LINEMODE or old line by
line mode, entering this character as the first charac- ter
on a line will cause this character to be sent to the remote
system. The initial value of the eof character is taken to
be the terminals eof character.</p>

<p>erase If telnet is in mode (see toggle localchars
below), and if telnet is operating in character at a time
mode, then when this character is typed, a TELNET EC
sequence (see send ec above) is sent to the remote system.
The initial value for the erase character is taken to be the
terminals erase character.</p>

<p>escape This is the telnet escape character (initially
^[) which causes entry into telnet command mode (when con-
nected to a remote system).</p>

<p>flushoutput If telnet is in localchars mode (see toggle
localchars below) and the flushoutput character is typed, a
TELNET AO sequence (see send ao above) is sent to the remote
host. The initial value for the flush character is taken to
be the terminals flush character.</p>

<p>forw1</p>

<p>forw2 If telnet is operating in LINEMODE, these are the
charac- ters that, when typed, cause partial lines to be
for- warded to the remote system. The initial value for the
forwarding characters are taken from the terminals eol and
eol2 characters.</p>

<p>interrupt If telnet is in localchars mode (see toggle
localchars below) and the interrupt character is typed, a
TELNET IP sequence (see send ip above) is sent to the remote
host. The initial value for the interrupt character is taken
to be the terminals intr character.</p>

<p>kill If telnet is in localchars mode (see toggle
localchars below), and if telnet is operating in character
at a time mode, then when this character is typed, a TELNET
EL sequence (see send el above) is sent to the remote
system. The initial value for the kill character is taken to
be the terminals kill character.</p>

<p>lnext If telnet is operating in LINEMODE or old line by
line mode, then this character is taken to be the ter- minal
s lnext character. The initial value for the lnext character
is taken to be the terminals lnext character.</p>

<p>quit If telnet is in localchars mode (see toggle
localchars below) and the quit character is typed, a TELNET
BRK sequence (see send brk above) is sent to the remote
host. The initial value for the quit character is taken to
be the terminals quit character.</p>

<p>reprint If telnet is operating in LINEMODE or old line
by line mode, then this character is taken to be the ter-
minal s reprint character. The initial value for the reprint
character is taken to be the terminals reprint
character.</p>

<p>rlogin This is the rlogin escape character. If set, the
normal TELNET escape character is ignored unless it is
preceded by this character at the beginning of a line. This
char- acter, at the beginning of a line followed by a
&quot;.&quot; closes the connection; when followed by a ^Z
it suspends the telnet command. The initial state is to
disable the rlogin escape character.</p>

<p>start If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been
enabled, then this character is taken to be the termi- nal s
start character. The initial value for the kill character is
taken to be the terminals start character.</p>

<p>stop If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been
enabled, then this character is taken to be the termi- nal s
stop character. The initial value for the kill character is
taken to be the terminals stop character.</p>

<p>susp If telnet is in localchars mode, or LINEMODE is
enabled, and the suspend character is typed, a TELNET SUSP
sequence (see send susp above) is sent to the remote host.
The initial value for the suspend character is taken to be
the terminals suspend character.</p>

<p>tracefile This is the file to which the output, caused
by netdata or option tracing being TRUE, will be written. If
it is set to -, then tracing information will be written to
standard output (the default).</p>

<p>worderase If telnet is operating in LINEMODE or old line
by line mode, then this character is taken to be the ter-
minal s worderase character. The initial value for the
worderase character is taken to be the terminals worderase
character.</p>

<p>? Displays the legal set (unset) commands.</p>

<p>slc state The slc command (Set Local Characters) is used
to set or change the state of the the special characters
when the TELNET LINEMODE option has been enabled. Special
characters are characters that get mapped to telnet commands
sequences (like ip or quit ) or line editing characters
(like erase and kill). By default, the local special
characters are exported.</p>

<p>check Verify the current settings for the current
special char- acters. The remote side is requested to send
all the current special character settings, and if there are
any discrepancies with the local side, the local side will
switch to the remote value.</p>

<p>export Switch to the local defaults for the special
characters. The local default characters are those of the
local ter- minal at the time when telnet was started.</p>

<p>import Switch to the remote defaults for the special
characters. The remote default characters are those of the
remote system at the time when the TELNET connection was
estab- lished.</p>

<p>? Prints out help information for the slc command.</p>

<p>status Show the current status of telnet. This includes
the peer one is connected to, as well as the current
mode.</p>

<p>toggle arguments ... Toggle (between TRUE and FALSE)
various flags that control how telnet responds to events.
These flags may be set explicitly to TRUE or FALSE using the
set and unset commands listed above. More than one argument
may be specified. The state of these flags may be
interrogated with the display command. Valid argu- ments
are:</p>

<p>authdebug Turns on debugging information for the
authentication code.</p>

<p>autoflush If autoflush and localchars are both TRUE ,
then when the ao, or quit characters are recognized (and
transformed into TELNET sequences; see set above for
details), telnet refuses to display any data on the user s
terminal until the remote system acknowledges (via a TELNET
TIMING MARK option) that it has processed those TELNET
sequences. The initial value for this toggle is TRUE if the
terminal user had not done an &quot;stty noflsh&quot;,
otherwise FALSE (see stty(1).</p>

<p>autodecrypt When the TELNET ENCRYPT option is
negotiated, by default the actual encryption (decryption) of
the data stream does not start automatically. The
autoencrypt (autode- crypt) command states that encryption
of the output (input) stream should be enabled as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>Note: Because of export controls, the TELNET ENCRYPT
option is not supported outside the United States and
Canada.</p>

<p>autologin If the remote side supports the TELNET
AUTHENTICATION option telnet attempts to use it to perform
automatic authentication. If the AUTHENTICATION option is
not sup- ported, the users login name are propagated through
the TELNET ENVIRON option. This command is the same as spec-
ifying the -a option on the open command.</p>

<p>autosynch If autosynch and localchars are both TRUE,
then when either the intr or quit characters is typed (see
set above for descriptions of the intr and quit characters),
the resulting TELNET sequence sent is followed by the TELNET
SYNCH sequence. This procedure should cause the remote
system to begin throwing away all previously typed input
until both of the TELNET sequences have been read and acted
upon. The initial value of this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p>binary Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on
both input and output.</p>

<p>inbinary Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on
input.</p>

<p>outbinary Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on
output.</p>

<p>crlf If this is TRUE, then carriage returns will be sent
as &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;. If this is FALSE, then carriage
returns will be send as &lt;CR&gt;&lt;NUL&gt;. The initial
value for this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p>crmod Toggle carriage return mode. When this mode is
enabled, most carriage return characters received from the
remote host will be mapped into a carriage return followed
by a line feed. This mode does not affect those characters
typed by the user, only those received from the remote host.
This mode is not very useful unless the remote host only
sends carriage return, but never line feed. The initial
value for this toggle is FALSE .</p>

<p>debug Toggles socket level debugging (useful only to the
super user). The initial value for this toggle is FALSE
.</p>

<p>encdebug Turns on debugging information for the
encryption code.</p>

<p>localchars If this is TRUE , then the flush, interrupt,
quit, erase, and kill characters (see set above) are
recognized locally, and transformed into (hopefully)
appropriate TELNET control sequences (respectively ao, ip,
brk, ec, and el; see send above). The initial value for this
tog- gle is TRUE in old line by line mode, and FALSE in
character at a time mode. When the LINEMODE option is
enabled, the value of localchars is ignored, and assumed to
always be TRUE. If LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then quit
is sent as abort, and eof and suspend are sent as eof and
susp, see send above).</p>

<p>netdata Toggles the display of all network data (in
hexadecimal format). The initial value for this toggle is
FALSE.</p>

<p>options Toggles the display of some internal telnet
protocol pro- cessing (having to do with TELNET options).
The initial value for this flag is FALSE .</p>

<p>prettydump When the netdata flag is enabled, if
prettydump is enabled the output from the netdata command
will be for- matted in a more user-readable format. Spaces
are put between each character in the output, and the
beginning of any TELNET escape sequence is preceded by a *
to aid in locating them.</p>

<p>skiprc When the skiprc flag is TRUE, TELNET skips the
reading of the .telnetrc file in the user s home directory
when con- nections are opened. The initial value for this
flag is FALSE.</p>

<p>termdata Toggles the display of all terminal data (in
hexadecimal format). The initial value for this flag is
FALSE.</p>

<p>verbose_encrypt When the verbose_encrypt flag is TRUE,
TELNET prints out a message each time encryption is enabled
or disabled. The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
Note: Because of export controls, data encryption is not
sup- ported outside of the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>? Displays the legal toggle commands.</p>

<p>z Suspend telnet.</p>

<p>! [command] Execute a single command in a subshell on
the local system. If command is omitted, then an interactive
subshell is invoked.</p>

<p>? command Get help. With no arguments, prints a help
summary. If a com- mand is specified, will print the help
information for just that command.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Telnet uses at least the HOME, SHELL,
DISPLAY, and TERM environment variables. Other environment
variables may be propagated to the other side via the TELNET
ENVIRON option.</p>

<p>FILES ~/.telnetrc user-customized telnet startup values
~/.k5login (on remote host) - file containing Kerberos
princi- pals that are allowed access.</p>

<p>HISTORY The Telnet command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>NOTES On some remote systems, echo has to be turned off
manually when in old line by line mode.</p>

<p>In old line by line mode or LINEMODE the terminals eof
character is only recognized (and sent to the remote system)
when it is the first character on a line.</p>
