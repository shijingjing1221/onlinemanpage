<p>NAME iptstate - A top-like display of IP Tables state
table entries</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS iptstate [-dfhlLRst] [-b d|p|s|t] [-D address]
[-S address] [-r sec- onds]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION iptstate displays information held in the IP
Tables state table in real-time in a top-like format. Output
can be sorted by any field, or any field reversed. Users can
choose to have the output only print once and exit. Refresh
rate is also customizable.</p>

<p>COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS -b This option tells IPTState how
to sort the output. The options are: d Destination IP p
Protocol s State t TTL</p>

<p>-d Do not dynamically size the window based on terminal
sizing information; instead use default iptstate sizing.</p>

<p>-D address Only show states with a destination of the IP
address given.</p>

<p>-f Filter anything on loopback.</p>

<p>-h Display help message.</p>

<p>-l Resolve all IP address to domain names. This
truncates from the Source address from the right (you know
your own domain) and destination addresses from the left
(domains are most helpful here). Warning: this can take a
long time to startup due to all the resolving.</p>

<p>-L Hide states related to DNS lookups (i.e. that have a
destination port of 53). This is useful when in name
resolution mode.</p>

<p>-r seconds This tells IPTState what refresh rate you
want (ignored when used with -s).</p>

<p>-R Sort in reverse.</p>

<p>-s Single-run mode. This will print the state table
formatted on the screen once without using curses.</p>

<p>-S Only show states with a source of the IP address
given.</p>

<p>-t Show totals (total states, total TCP states,
etc.)</p>

<p>INTERACTIVE OPTIONS The following my be used while
IPTState is running to change its behav- ior (unless you use
-s).</p>

<p>d Toggle between letting iptstate dynamically size the
columns and using the old default sizes</p>

<p>f Toggle filtering of loopback</p>

<p>l Toggle DNS lookups on IP addresses</p>

<p>m Toggle tagging of truncated hostnames</p>

<p>n Toggle display of DNS-related entries</p>

<p>q Quit</p>

<p>r Toggle reverse sorting</p>

<p>s Change sorting to the next field</p>

<p>t Toggle display of totals</p>

<p>space Immediately update the display. Use this if you
resize the win- dow.</p>

<p>BUGS There are no known bugs at this time.</p>

<p>BUG REPORTS All bugs should be reported to Phil Dibowitz
&lt;phil@ipom.com&gt;, NOT your local distribution bug list.
Please see the README and BUGS for more information on bug
reports. Please read the WISHLIST before sending in features
you hope to see.</p>

<p>NOTES The truncation of names in lookup mode happens
from the right for source because you most likely know your
own domain name, and from the left for destination because
knowing your users are connection to &quot;mail.a.&quot;
doesnt help much.</p>
