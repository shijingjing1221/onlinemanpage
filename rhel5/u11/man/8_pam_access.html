<p>NAME pam_access - PAM module for logdaemon style login
access control</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_access.so [debug] [nodefgroup] [noaudit]
[accessfile=file] [fieldsep=sep] [listsep=sep]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_access PAM module is mainly for
access management. It provides logdaemon style login access
control based on login names, host or domain names, internet
addresses or network numbers, or on terminal line names in
case of non-networked logins.</p>

<p>By default rules for access management are taken from
config file /etc/security/access.conf if you don t specify
another file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS accessfile=/path/to/access.conf Indicate an
alternative access.conf style configuration file to override
the default. This can be useful when different services need
different access lists.</p>

<p>debug A lot of debug informations are printed with
syslog(3).</p>

<p>noaudit Do not report logins from disallowed hosts and
ttys to the audit subsystem.</p>

<p>fieldsep=separators This option modifies the field
separator character that pam_access will recognize when
parsing the access configuration file. For example:
fieldsep=| will cause the default : character to be treated
as part of a field value and | becomes the field separator.
Doing this may be useful in conjuction with a system that
wants to use pam_access with X based applications, since the
PAM_TTY item is likely to be of the form
&quot;hostname:0&quot; which includes a : character in its
value. But you should not need this.</p>

<p>listsep=separators This option modifies the list
separator character that pam_access will recognize when
parsing the access configuration file. For example:
listsep=, will cause the default (space) and (tab)
characters to be treated as part of a list element value and
, becomes the only list element separator. Doing this may be
useful on a system with group information obtained from a
Windows domain, where the default built-in groups
&quot;Domain Users&quot;, &quot;Domain Admins&quot; contain
a space.</p>

<p>nodefgroup User tokens which are not enclosed in
parentheses will not be matched against the group database.
The backwards compatible default is to try the group
database match for all tokens. Without the option the
parentheses do not have any special meaning which means that
matching user accounts and/or groups with parentheses in
name is still possible.</p>

<p>MODULE SERVICES PROVIDED All services are supported.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_SUCCESS Access was granted.</p>

<p>PAM_PERM_DENIED Access was not granted.</p>

<p>PAM_IGNORE pam_setcred was called which does
nothing.</p>

<p>PAM_ABORT Not all relevant data or options could be
gotten.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN The user is not known to the
system.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/security/access.conf Default configuration
file</p>

<p>SEE ALSO access.conf(5), pam.d(8), pam(8).</p>

<p>AUTHORS The logdaemon style login access control scheme
was designed and implemented by Wietse Venema. The
pam_access PAM module was developed by Alexei Nogin
&lt;alexei@nogin.dnttm.ru&gt;. The IPv6 support and the
network(address) / netmask feature was developed and
provided by Mike Becher
&lt;mike.becher@lrz-muenchen.de&gt;.</p>
