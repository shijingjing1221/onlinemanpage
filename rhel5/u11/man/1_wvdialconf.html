<p>WVDIALCONF(1) WVDIALCONF(1)</p>

<p>NAME wvdialconf - build a configuration file for
wvdial(1)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION wvdialconf detects your modem, its maximum
baud rate, and a good ini- tialization string and generates
or updates the wvdial(1) configuration file based on this
information.</p>

<p>wvdialconf is completely non-interactive. You still need
to edit /etc/wvdial.conf to specify the phone number, login
name, and password of your internet account in order for
wvdial(1) to work.</p>

<p>It is safe to run wvdialconf if a configuration file
already exists. In that case, only the Modem, Baud, Init,
and Init2 options are changed in the [Dialer Defaults]
section, and only if autodetection is success- ful.</p>

<p>BUGS We re willing to entertain the possibility. Let us
know if you have any problems by sending an e-mail to
&lt;wvdial@nit.ca&gt;.</p>

<p>Also, there is now a mailing list for discussion about
wvdial. If you are having problems, or have anything else to
say, send e-mail to &lt;wvdial-list@lists.nit.ca&gt;.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS An exit status of 0 means that a modem was
detected and the configura- tion file was updated
successfully.</p>

<p>Any other value means that something went wrong and the
configuration file was unchanged.</p>
