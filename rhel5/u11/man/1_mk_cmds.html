<p>NAME mk_cmds - error table compiler</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mk_cmds file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Mk_cmds converts a table listing command
names and associated help mes- sages into a C source file
suitable for use with the ss(3) library.</p>

<p>The source file name must end with a suffix of .ct ; the
file con- sists of a declaration supplying the name of the
command table:</p>

<p>command_table name</p>

<p>followed by entries of the form:</p>

<p>[ request | unimplemented ] name, &quot; string &quot;[,
abbrev]...;</p>

<p>and a final</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>to indicate the end of the table.</p>

<p>A C source file is generated which should be compiled
and linked with the object files use the ss library.</p>

<p>A # in the source file is treated as a comment
character, and all remaining text to the end of the source
line will be ignored.</p>

<p>BUGS Since the original mk_cmds uses a very simple
parser based on yacc(1), and this current version of mk_cmds
uses an awk/sed combination of scripts, its error recovery
leaves much to be desired.</p>
