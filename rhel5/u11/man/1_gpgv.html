<p>NAME gpgv signature verification tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gpgv [options] [signed files]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gpgv is the OpenPGP signature checking
tool.</p>

<p>This program is a stripped down version of gpg which is
able only to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than
the fully blown gpg and uses a different (and simpler) way
to check that the public keys used to make the signature are
trustworthy. There are no options files and only very few
options are implemented.</p>

<p>gpgv assumes that all keys in the keyring are
trustworthy. By default it uses a keyring named
trustedkeys.gpg which is assumed to be in the home directory
as defined by GnuPG or set by an option or an environ- ment
variable. An option may be used to specify another keyring
or even multiple keyrings.</p>

<p>OPTIONS gpgv recognizes these options:</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Gives more information during processing.
If used twice, the input data is listed in detail.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Try to be as quiet as possible.</p>

<p>--keyring file Add file to the list of keyrings. If file
begins with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the
HOME directory. If the filename does not contain a slash, it
is assumed to be in the home-directory (&quot;~/.gnupg&quot;
if --homedir is not used). The filename may be prefixed with
a scheme:</p>

<p>&quot;gnupg-ring:&quot; is the default one.</p>

<p>--homedir directory Set the name of the home directory
to directory If this option is not used, it defaults to
&quot;~/.gnupg&quot;. It does not make sense to use this in
an options file. This also over- rides the environment
variable &quot;GNUPGHOME&quot;.</p>

<p>--status-fd n Write special status strings to the file
descriptor n. See the file DETAILS in the documentation for
a listing of them.</p>

<p>--logger-fd n Write log output to file descriptor n and
not to stderr.</p>

<p>--ignore-time-conflict GnuPG normally checks that the
timestamps associated with keys and signatures have
plausible values. However, some- times a signature seems to
be older than the key due to clock problems. This option
makes these checks just warnings.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The program returns 0 if everything was
fine, 1 if at least one signa- ture was bad, and other error
codes for fatal errors.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES gpgv pgpfile</p>

<p>gpgv sigfile [files] Verify the signature of the file.
The second form is used for detached signatures, where
sigfile is the detached signature (either ASCII armored or
binary) and [files] are the signed data; if this is not
given the name of the file holding the signed data is
constructed by cutting off the extension (&quot;.asc&quot;,
&quot;.sig&quot; or &quot;.sign&quot;) from sigfile.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT HOME Used to locate the default home
directory.</p>

<p>GNUPGHOME If set directory used instead of
&quot;~/.gnupg&quot;.</p>

<p>FILES ~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg The default keyring with
the allowed keys</p>
