<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

COMMANDS SUDO(8)</p>

<p>NAME sudo, sudoedit - execute a command as another
user</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sudo -h | -K | -k | -L | -V</p>

<p>sudo -v [-AknS] [-p prompt]</p>

<p>sudo -l[l] [-AknS] [-g groupname|#gid] [-p prompt] [-U
username] [-u username|#uid] [command]</p>

<p>sudo [-AbEHnPS] [-C fd] [-g groupname|#gid] [-p prompt]
[-r role] [-t type] [-u username|#uid] [VAR=value] [-i | -s]
[command]</p>

<p>sudoedit [-AnS] [-C fd] [-g groupname|#gid] [-p prompt]
[-u username|#uid] file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sudo allows a permitted user to execute a
command as the superuser or another user, as specified in
the sudoers file. The real and effective uid and gid are set
to match those of the target user as specified in the passwd
file and the group vector is initialized based on the group
file (unless the -P option was specified). If the invoking
user is root or if the target user is the same as the
invoking user, no password is required. Otherwise, sudo
requires that users authenticate themselves with a password
by default (NOTE: in the default configuration this is the
users password, not the root password). Once a user has been
authenticated, a timestamp is updated and the user may then
use sudo without a password for a short period of time (5
minutes unless overridden in sudoers).</p>

<p>When invoked as sudoedit, the -e option (described
below), is implied.</p>

<p>sudo determines who is an authorized user by consulting
the file /etc/sudoers. By running sudo with the -v option, a
user can update the time stamp without running a command.
The password prompt itself will also time out if the users
password is not entered within 5 minutes (unless overridden
via sudoers).</p>

<p>If a user who is not listed in the sudoers file tries to
run a command via sudo, mail is sent to the proper
authorities, as defined at configure time or in the sudoers
file (defaults to root). Note that the mail will not be sent
if an unauthorized user tries to run sudo with the -l or -v
option. This allows users to determine for themselves
whether or not they are allowed to use sudo.</p>

<p>If sudo is run by root and the SUDO_USER environment
variable is set, sudo will use this value to determine who
the actual user is. This can be used by a user to log
commands through sudo even when a root shell has been
invoked. It also allows the -e option to remain useful even
when being run via a sudo-run script or program. Note
however, that the sudoers lookup is still done for root, not
the user specified by SUDO_USER.</p>

<p>sudo can log both successful and unsuccessful attempts
(as well as errors) to syslog(3), a log file, or both. By
default sudo will log via syslog(3) but this is changeable
at configure time or via the sudoers file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS sudo accepts the following command line
options:</p>

<p>-A Normally, if sudo requires a password, it will read
it from the current terminal. If the -A (askpass) option is
specified, a (possibly graphical) helper program is executed
to read the users password and output the password to the
standard output. If the SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable is
set, it specifies the path to the helper program. Otherwise,
the value specified by the askpass option in sudoers(5) is
used.</p>

<p>-b The -b (background) option tells sudo to run the
given command in the background. Note that if you use the -b
option you cannot use shell job control to manipulate the
process.</p>

<p>-C fd Normally, sudo will close all open file
descriptors other than standard input, standard output and
standard error. The -C (close from) option allows the user
to specify a starting point above the standard error (file
descriptor three). Values less than three are not permitted.
This option is only available if the administrator has
enabled the closefrom_override option in sudoers(5).</p>

<p>-E The -E (preserve environment) option will override
the env_reset option in sudoers(5)). It is only available
when either the matching command has the SETENV tag or the
setenv option is set in sudoers(5).</p>

<p>-e The -e (edit) option indicates that, instead of
running a command, the user wishes to edit one or more
files. In lieu of a command, the string &quot;sudoedit&quot;
is used when consulting the sudoers file. If the user is
authorized by sudoers the following steps are taken:</p>

<p>1. Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited
with the owner set to the invoking user.</p>

<p>2. The editor specified by the SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or
EDITOR environment variables is run to edit the temporary
files. If none of SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or EDITOR are set, the
first program listed in the editor sudoers variable is
used.</p>

<p>3. If they have been modified, the temporary files are
copied back to their original location and the temporary
versions are removed.</p>

<p>If the specified file does not exist, it will be
created. Note that unlike most commands run by sudo, the
editor is run with the invoking user s environment
unmodified. If, for some reason, sudo is unable to update a
file with its edited version, the user will receive a
warning and the edited copy will remain in a temporary
file.</p>

<p>-g group Normally, sudo sets the primary group to the
one specified by the passwd database for the user the
command is being run as (by default, root). The -g (group)
option causes sudo to run the specified command with the
primary group set to group. To specify a gid instead of a
group name, use #gid. When running commands as a gid, many
shells require that the # be escaped with a backslash (). If
no -u option is specified, the command will be run as the
invoking user (not root). In either case, the primary group
will be set to group.</p>

<p>-H The -H (HOME) option sets the HOME environment
variable to the homedir of the target user (root by default)
as specified in passwd(5). By default, sudo does not modify
HOME (see set_home and always_set_home in sudoers(5)).</p>

<p>-h The -h (help) option causes sudo to print a usage
message and exit.</p>

<p>-i [command] The -i (simulate initial login) option runs
the shell specified in the passwd(5) entry of the target
user as a login shell. This means that login-specific
resource files such as .profile or .login will be read by
the shell. If a command is specified, it is passed to the
shell for execution. Otherwise, an interactive shell is
executed. sudo attempts to change to that user s home
directory before running the shell. It also initializes the
environment, leaving DISPLAY and TERM unchanged, setting
HOME, SHELL, USER, LOGNAME, and PATH, as well as the
contents of /etc/environment on Linux and AIX systems. All
other environment variables are removed.</p>

<p>-K The -K (sure kill) option is like -k except that it
removes the users timestamp entirely and may not be used in
conjunction with a command or other option. This option does
not require a password.</p>

<p>-k When used by itself, the -k (kill) option to sudo
invalidates the users timestamp by setting the time on it to
the Epoch. The next time sudo is run a password will be
required. This option does not require a password and was
added to allow a user to revoke sudo permissions from a
.logout file.</p>

<p>When used in conjunction with a command or an option
that may require a password, the -k option will cause sudo
to ignore the users timestamp file. As a result, sudo will
prompt for a password (if one is required by sudoers) and
will not update the users timestamp file.</p>

<p>-L The -L (list defaults) option will list out the
parameters that may be set in a Defaults line along with a
short description for each. This option is useful in
conjunction with grep(1).</p>

<p>-l[l] [command] If no command is specified, the -l
(list) option will list the allowed (and forbidden) commands
for the invoking user (or the user specified by the -U
option) on the current host. If a command is specified and
is permitted by sudoers, the fully-qualified path to the
command is displayed along with any command line arguments.
If command is specified but not allowed, sudo will exit with
a status value of 1. If the -l option is specified with an l
argument (i.e. -ll), or if -l is specified multiple times, a
longer list format is used.</p>

<p>-n The -n (non-interactive) option prevents sudo from
prompting the user for a password. If a password is required
for the command to run, sudo will display an error messages
and exit.</p>

<p>-P The -P (preserve group vector) option causes sudo to
preserve the invoking user s group vector unaltered. By
default, sudo will initialize the group vector to the list
of groups the target user is in. The real and effective
group IDs, however, are still set to match the target
user.</p>

<p>-p prompt The -p (prompt) option allows you to override
the default password prompt and use a custom one. The
following percent (%) escapes are supported:</p>

<p>%H expanded to the local hostname including the domain
name (on if the machines hostname is fully qualified or the
fqdn sudoers option is set)</p>

<p>%h expanded to the local hostname without the domain
name</p>

<p>%p expanded to the user whose password is being asked
for (respects the rootpw, targetpw and runaspw flags in
sudoers)</p>

<p>%U expanded to the login name of the user the command
will be run as (defaults to root)</p>

<p>%u expanded to the invoking users login name</p>

<p>%% two consecutive % characters are collapsed into a
single % character</p>

<p>The prompt specified by the -p option will override the
system password prompt on systems that support PAM unless
the passprompt_override flag is disabled in sudoers.</p>

<p>-r role The -r (role) option causes the new (SELinux)
security context to have the role specified by role.</p>

<p>-S The -S (stdin) option causes sudo to read the
password from the standard input instead of the terminal
device.</p>

<p>-s [command] The -s (shell) option runs the shell
specified by the SHELL environment variable if it is set or
the shell as specified in passwd(5). If a command is
specified, it is passed to the shell for execution.
Otherwise, an interactive shell is executed.</p>

<p>-t type The -t (type) option causes the new (SELinux)
security context to have the type specified by type. If no
type is specified, the default type is derived from the
specified role.</p>

<p>-U user The -U (other user) option is used in
conjunction with the -l option to specify the user whose
privileges should be listed. Only root or a user with sudo
ALL on the current host may use this option.</p>

<p>-u user The -u (user) option causes sudo to run the
specified command as a user other than root. To specify a
uid instead of a user name, use #uid. When running commands
as a uid, many shells require that the # be escaped with a
backslash ( ). Note that if the targetpw Defaults option is
set (see sudoers(5)) it is not possible to run commands with
a uid not listed in the password database.</p>

<p>-V The -V (version) option causes sudo to print the
version number and exit. If the invoking user is already
root the -V option will print out a list of the defaults
sudo was compiled with as well as the machine s local
network addresses.</p>

<p>-v If given the -v (validate) option, sudo will update
the users timestamp, prompting for the user s password if
necessary. This extends the sudo timeout for another 5
minutes (or whatever the timeout is set to in sudoers) but
does not run a command.</p>

<p>-- The -- option indicates that sudo should stop
processing command line arguments. It is most useful in
conjunction with the -s option.</p>

<p>Environment variables to be set for the command may also
be passed on the command line in the form of VAR=value, e.g.
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pkg/lib. Variables passed on the
command line are subject to the same restrictions as normal
environment variables with one important exception. If the
setenv option is set in sudoers, the command to be run has
the SETENV tag set or the command matched is ALL, the user
may set variables that would overwise be forbidden. See
sudoers(5) for more information.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES Upon successful execution of a program,
the exit status from sudo will simply be the exit status of
the program that was executed.</p>

<p>Otherwise, sudo quits with an exit value of 1 if there
is a configuration/permission problem or if sudo cannot
execute the given command. In the latter case the error
string is printed to stderr. If sudo cannot stat(2) one or
more entries in the users PATH an error is printed on
stderr. (If the directory does not exist or if it is not
really a directory, the entry is ignored and no error is
printed.) This should not happen under normal circumstances.
The most common reason for stat(2) to return
&quot;permission denied&quot; is if you are running an
automounter and one of the directories in your PATH is on a
machine that is currently unreachable.</p>

<p>SECURITY NOTES sudo tries to be safe when executing
external commands.</p>

<p>There are two distinct ways to deal with environment
variables. By default, the env_reset sudoers option is
enabled. This causes commands to be executed with a minimal
environment containing TERM, PATH, HOME, SHELL, LOGNAME,
USER and USERNAME in addition to variables from the invoking
process permitted by the env_check and env_keep sudoers
options. There is effectively a whitelist for environment
variables.</p>

<p>If, however, the env_reset option is disabled in
sudoers, any variables not explicitly denied by the
env_check and env_delete options are inherited from the
invoking process. In this case, env_check and env_delete
behave like a blacklist. Since it is not possible to
blacklist all potentially dangerous environment variables,
use of the default env_reset behavior is encouraged.</p>

<p>In all cases, environment variables with a value
beginning with () are removed as they could be interpreted
as bash functions. The list of environment variables that
sudo allows or denies is contained in the output of sudo -V
when run as root.</p>

<p>Note that the dynamic linker on most operating systems
will remove variables that can control dynamic linking from
the environment of setuid executables, including sudo.
Depending on the operating system this may include _RLD*,
DYLD_*, LD_*, LDR_*, LIBPATH, SHLIB_PATH, and others. These
type of variables are removed from the environment before
sudo even begins execution and, as such, it is not possible
for sudo to preserve them.</p>

<p>To prevent command spoofing, sudo checks &quot;.&quot;
and &quot;&quot; (both denoting current directory) last when
searching for a command in the users PATH (if one or both
are in the PATH). Note, however, that the actual PATH
environment variable is not modified and is passed unchanged
to the program that sudo executes.</p>

<p>sudo will check the ownership of its timestamp directory
(/var/run/sudo by default) and ignore the directorys
contents if it is not owned by root or if it is writable by
a user other than root. On systems that allow non-root users
to give away files via chown(2), if the timestamp directory
is located in a directory writable by anyone (e.g., /tmp),
it is possible for a user to create the timestamp directory
before sudo is run. However, because sudo checks the
ownership and mode of the directory and its contents, the
only damage that can be done is to &quot;hide&quot; files by
putting them in the timestamp dir. This is unlikely to
happen since once the timestamp dir is owned by root and
inaccessible by any other user, the user placing files there
would be unable to get them back out. To get around this
issue you can use a directory that is not world-writable for
the timestamps (/var/adm/sudo for instance) or create
/var/run/sudo with the appropriate owner (root) and
permissions (0700) in the system startup files.</p>

<p>sudo will not honor timestamps set far in the future.
Timestamps with a date greater than current_time + 2 *
TIMEOUT will be ignored and sudo will log and complain. This
is done to keep a user from creating his/her own timestamp
with a bogus date on systems that allow users to give away
files.</p>

<p>Please note that sudo will normally only log the command
it explicitly runs. If a user runs a command such as sudo su
or sudo sh, subsequent commands run from that shell will not
be logged, nor will sudos access control affect them. The
same is true for commands that offer shell escapes
(including most editors). Because of this, care must be
taken when giving users access to commands via sudo to
verify that the command does not inadvertently give the user
an effective root shell. For more information, please see
the PREVENTING SHELL ESCAPES section in sudoers(5).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT sudo utilizes the following environment
variables:</p>

<p>EDITOR Default editor to use in -e (sudoedit) mode if
neither SUDO_EDITOR nor VISUAL is set</p>

<p>HOME In -s or -H mode (or if sudo was configured with
the --enable-shell-sets-home option), set to homedir of the
target user</p>

<p>PATH Set to a sane value if the secure_path sudoers
option is set.</p>

<p>SHELL Used to determine shell to run with -s option</p>

<p>SUDO_ASKPASS Specifies the path to a helper program used
to read the password if no terminal is available or if the
-A option is specified.</p>

<p>SUDO_COMMAND Set to the command run by sudo</p>

<p>SUDO_EDITOR Default editor to use in -e (sudoedit)
mode</p>

<p>SUDO_GID Set to the group ID of the user who invoked
sudo</p>

<p>SUDO_PROMPT Used as the default password prompt</p>

<p>SUDO_PS1 If set, PS1 will be set to its value for the
program being run</p>

<p>SUDO_UID Set to the user ID of the user who invoked
sudo</p>

<p>SUDO_USER Set to the login of the user who invoked
sudo</p>

<p>USER Set to the target user (root unless the -u option
is specified)</p>

<p>VISUAL Default editor to use in -e (sudoedit) mode if
SUDO_EDITOR is not set</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sudoers List of who can run what</p>

<p>/var/run/sudo Directory containing timestamps</p>

<p>/etc/environment Initial environment for -i mode on
Linux and AIX</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Note: the following examples assume suitable
sudoers(5) entries.</p>

<p>To get a file listing of an unreadable directory:</p>

<p>$ sudo ls /usr/local/protected</p>

<p>To list the home directory of user yaz on a machine
where the file system holding ~yaz is not exported as
root:</p>

<p>$ sudo -u yaz ls ~yaz</p>

<p>To edit the index.html file as user www:</p>

<p>$ sudo -u www vi ~www/htdocs/index.html</p>

<p>To view system logs only accessible to root and users in
the adm group:</p>

<p>$ sudo -g adm view /var/log/syslog</p>

<p>To run an editor as jim with a different primary
group:</p>

<p>$ sudo -u jim -g audio vi ~jim/sound.txt</p>

<p>To shutdown a machine:</p>

<p>$ sudo shutdown -r +15 &quot;quick reboot&quot;</p>

<p>To make a usage listing of the directories in the /home
partition. Note that this runs the commands in a sub-shell
to make the cd and file redirection work.</p>

<p>$ sudo sh -c &quot;cd /home ; du -s * | sort -rn &gt;

<p>AUTHORS Many people have worked on sudo over the years;
this version consists of code written primarily by:</p>

<p>See the HISTORY file in the sudo distribution or visit
http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/history.html for a short history of
sudo.</p>

<p>CAVEATS There is no easy way to prevent a user from
gaining a root shell if that user is allowed to run
arbitrary commands via sudo. Also, many programs (such as
editors) allow the user to run commands via shell escapes,
thus avoiding sudo s checks. However, on most systems it is
possible to prevent shell escapes with sudo s noexec
functionality. See the sudoers(5) manual for details.</p>

<p>It is not meaningful to run the cd command directly via
sudo, e.g.,</p>

<p>$ sudo cd /usr/local/protected</p>

<p>since when the command exits the parent process (your
shell) will still be the same. Please see the EXAMPLES
section for more information.</p>

<p>If users have sudo ALL there is nothing to prevent them
from creating their own program that gives them a root shell
regardless of any ! elements in the user specification.</p>

<p>Running shell scripts via sudo can expose the same
kernel bugs that make setuid shell scripts unsafe on some
operating systems (if your OS has a /dev/fd/ directory,
setuid shell scripts are generally safe).</p>
