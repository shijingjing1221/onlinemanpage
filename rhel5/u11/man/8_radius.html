<p>NAME radius - nnrpd RADIUS password authenticator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS radius [-h] [-f config]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION radius is an nnrpd authenticator, accepting
a username and password from nnrpd (given to nnrpd by a
reader connection) and attempting to authenticate that
username and password against a RADIUS server. See
readers.conf(5) for more information on how to configure an
nnrpd authenticator. It is useful for a site that already
does user authen- tication via RADIUS and wants to
authenticate news reading connections as well.</p>

<p>By default, radius reads pathetc/radius.conf for
configuration informa- tion, but a different configuration
file can be specified with -f. See radius.conf(5) for a
description of the configuration file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f config Read config instead of
pathetc/radius.conf for configuration infor- mation.</p>

<p>-h Print out a usage message and exit.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following readers.conf(5) fragment tells
nnrpd to authenticate all connections using this
authenticator:</p>

<p>auth radius { auth: radius default: &lt;FAIL&gt;
default-domain: example.com }</p>

<p>&quot;@example.com&quot; will be appended to the
user-supplied identity, and if RADIUS authentication failes,
the user will be assigned an identity of
&quot;&lt;FAIL&gt;@example.com&quot;.</p>

<p>BUGS It has been reported that this authenticator doesnt
work with Ascend RADIUS servers, but does work with Cistron
RADIUS servers. Its also believed to work with Livingston s
RADIUS server. Contributions to make it work better with
different types of RADIUS servers would be gratefully
accepted.</p>

<p>This code has not been audited against the RADIUS
protocol and may not implement it correctly.</p>

<p>HISTORY The RADIUS authenticator was originally written
by Aidan Cully. This documentation was written by Russ
Allbery &lt;rra@stanford.edu&gt;.</p>
