<p>NAME perlfaq7 - General Perl Language Issues ($Revision:
1.28 $, $Date: 2005/12/31 00:54:37 $)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This section deals with general Perl
language issues that dont clearly fit into any of the other
sections.</p>

<p>Can I get a BNF/yacc/RE for the Perl language?</p>

<p>There is no BNF, but you can paw your way through the
yacc grammar in perly.y in the source distribution if youre
particularly brave. The grammar relies on very smart
tokenizing code, so be prepared to venture into toke.c as
well.</p>

<p>In the words of Chaim Frenkel: &quot;Perls grammar can
not be reduced to BNF. The work of parsing perl is
distributed between yacc, the lexer, smoke and
mirrors.&quot;</p>

<p>What are all these $@%&amp;* punctuation signs, and how
do I know when to use them?</p>

<p>They are type specifiers, as detailed in perldata:</p>

<p>$ for scalar values (number, string or reference) @ for
arrays % for hashes (associative arrays) &amp; for
subroutines (aka functions, procedures, methods) * for all
types of that symbol name. In version 4 you used them like
pointers, but in modern perls you can just use
references.</p>

<p>There are couple of other symbols that youre likely to
encounter that arent really type specifiers:</p>

<p>&lt;&gt; are used for inputting a record from a
filehandle. takes a reference to something.</p>

<p>Note that &lt;FILE&gt; is neither the type specifier for
files nor the name of the handle. It is the
&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; operator applied to the handle FILE. It
reads one line (well, record--see &quot;$/&quot; in perlvar)
from the handle FILE in scalar context, or all lines in list
context. When performing open, close, or any other operation
besides &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; on files, or even when talk-
ing about the handle, do not use the brackets. These are
correct: &quot;eof(FH)&quot;, &quot;seek(FH, 0, 2)&quot; and
&quot;copying from STDIN to FILE&quot;.</p>

<p>Do I always/never have to quote my strings or use
semicolons and com- mas?</p>

<p>Normally, a bareword doesnt need to be quoted, but in
most cases prob- ably should be (and must be under &quot;use
strict&quot;). But a hash key con- sisting of a simple word
(that isnt the name of a defined subroutine) and the
left-hand operand to the &quot;=&gt;&quot; operator both
count as though they were quoted:</p>

<p>This is like this ------------ ---------------
$foo{line} $foo{line} bar =&gt; stuff bar =&gt; stuff</p>

<p>The final semicolon in a block is optional, as is the
final comma in a list. Good style (see perlstyle) says to
put them in except for one-liners:</p>

<p>if ($whoops) { exit 1 } @nums = (1, 2, 3);</p>

<p>if ($whoops) { exit 1; } @lines = ( &quot;There Beren
came from mountains cold&quot;, &quot;And lost he wandered
under leaves&quot;, );</p>

<p>How do I skip some return values?</p>

<p>One way is to treat the return values as a list and
index into it:</p>

<p>$dir = (getpwnam($user))[7];</p>

<p>Another way is to use undef as an element on the
left-hand-side:</p>

<p>($dev, $ino, undef, undef, $uid, $gid) =
stat($file);</p>

<p>You can also use a list slice to select only the
elements that you need:</p>

<p>($dev, $ino, $uid, $gid) = ( stat($file) )[0,1,4,5];</p>

<p>How do I temporarily block warnings?</p>

<p>If you are running Perl 5.6.0 or better, the &quot;use
warnings&quot; pragma allows fine control of what warning
are produced. See perllexwarn for more details.</p>

<p>{ no warnings; # temporarily turn off warnings $a = $b +
$c; # I know these might be undef }</p>

<p>Additionally, you can enable and disable categories of
warnings. You turn off the categories you want to ignore and
you can still get other categories of warnings. See
perllexwarn for the complete details, including the category
names and hierarchy.</p>

<p>{ no warnings uninitialized; $a = $b + $c; }</p>

<p>If you have an older version of Perl, the $^W variable
(documented in perlvar) controls runtime warnings for a
block:</p>

<p>{ local $^W = 0; # temporarily turn off warnings $a = $b
+ $c; # I know these might be undef }</p>

<p>Note that like all the punctuation variables, you cannot
currently use my() on $^W, only local().</p>

<p>Whas an extension?</p>

<p>An extension is a way of calling compiled C code from
Perl. Reading perlxstut is a good place to learn more about
extensions.</p>

<p>Why do Perl operators have different precedence than C
operators?</p>

<p>Actually, they don t. All C operators that Perl copies
have the same precedence in Perl as they do in C. The
problem is with operators that C doesn t have, especially
functions that give a list context to every- thing on their
right, eg. print, chmod, exec, and so on. Such func- tions
are called &quot;list operators&quot; and appear as such in
the precedence table in perlop.</p>

<p>A common mistake is to write:</p>

<p>unlink $file die &quot;snafu&quot;;</p>

<p>This gets interpreted as:</p>

<p>unlink ($file die &quot;snafu&quot;);</p>

<p>To avoid this problem, either put in extra parentheses
or use the super low precedence &quot;or&quot; operator:</p>

<p>(unlink $file) die &quot;snafu&quot;; unlink $file or
die &quot;snafu&quot;;</p>

<p>The &quot;English&quot; operators (&quot;and&quot;,
&quot;or&quot;, &quot;xor&quot;, and &quot;not&quot;)
deliberately have precedence lower than that of list
operators for just such situa- tions as the one above.</p>

<p>Another operator with surprising precedence is
exponentiation. It binds more tightly even than unary minus,
making &quot;-2**2&quot; product a neg- ative not a positive
four. It is also right-associating, meaning that
&quot;2**3**2&quot; is two raised to the ninth power, not
eight squared.</p>

<p>Although it has the same precedence as in C, Perls
&quot;?:&quot; operator pro- duces an lvalue. This assigns
$x to either $a or $b, depending on the trueness of
$maybe:</p>

<p>($maybe ? $a : $b) = $x;</p>

<p>How do I declare/create a structure?</p>

<p>In general, you dont &quot;declare&quot; a structure.
Just use a (probably anonymous) hash reference. See perlref
and perldsc for details. Heres an example:</p>

<p>$person = {}; # new anonymous hash $person-&gt;{AGE} =
24; # set field AGE to 24 $person-&gt;{NAME} =
&quot;Nat&quot;; # set field NAME to &quot;Nat&quot;</p>

<p>If youre looking for something a bit more rigorous, try
perltoot.</p>

<p>How do I create a module?</p>

<p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p>perlmod, perlmodlib, perlmodstyle explain modules in all
the gory details. perlnewmod gives a brief overview of the
process along with a couple of suggestions about style.</p>

<p>If you need to include C code or C library interfaces in
your module, youll need h2xs. h2xs will create the module
distribution structure and the initial interface files youll
need. perlxs and perlxstut explain the details.</p>

<p>If you dont need to use C code, other tools such as
ExtUtils::Module- Maker and Module::Starter, can help you
create a skeleton module dis- tribution.</p>

<p>You may also want to see Sam Tregars &quot;Writing Perl
Modules for CPAN&quot; (
http://apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=14 ) which is
the best hands-on guide to creating module
distributions.</p>

<p>How do I create a class?</p>

<p>See perltoot for an introduction to classes and objects,
as well as perlobj and perlbot.</p>

<p>How can I tell if a variable is tainted?</p>

<p>You can use the tainted() function of the Scalar::Util
module, avail- able from CPAN (or included with Perl since
release 5.8.0). See also &quot;Laundering and Detecting
Tainted Data&quot; in perlsec.</p>

<p>Whas a closure?</p>

<p>Closures are documented in perlref.</p>

<p>Closure is a computer science term with a precise but
hard-to-explain meaning. Closures are implemented in Perl as
anonymous subroutines with lasting references to lexical
variables outside their own scopes. These lexicals magically
refer to the variables that were around when the subroutine
was defined (deep binding).</p>

<p>Closures make sense in any programming language where
you can have the return value of a function be itself a
function, as you can in Perl. Note that some languages
provide anonymous functions but are not capa- ble of
providing proper closures: the Python language, for example.
For more information on closures, check out any textbook on
functional programming. Scheme is a language that not only
supports but encour- ages closures.</p>

<p>Heres a classic function-generating function:</p>

<p>sub add_function_generator { return sub { shift() +
shift() }; }</p>

<p>$add_sub = add_function_generator(); $sum =
$add_sub-&gt;(4,5); # $sum is 9 now.</p>

<p>The closure works as a function template with some
customization slots left out to be filled later. The
anonymous subroutine returned by add_function_generator()
isn t technically a closure because it refers to no lexicals
outside its own scope.</p>

<p>Contrast this with the following make_adder() function,
in which the returned anonymous function contains a
reference to a lexical variable outside the scope of that
function itself. Such a reference requires that Perl return
a proper closure, thus locking in for all time the value
that the lexical had when the function was created.</p>

<p>sub make_adder { my $addpiece = shift; return sub {
shift() + $addpiece }; }</p>

<p>$f1 = make_adder(20); $f2 = make_adder(555);</p>

<p>Now &quot;&amp;$f1($n)&quot; is always 20 plus whatever
$n you pass in, whereas &quot;&amp;$f2($n)&quot; is always
555 plus whatever $n you pass in. The $addpiece in the
closure sticks around.</p>

<p>Closures are often used for less esoteric purposes. For
example, when you want to pass in a bit of code into a
function:</p>

<p>my $line; timeout( 30, sub { $line = &lt;STDIN&gt; }
);</p>

<p>If the code to execute had been passed in as a string,
&rsquo;$line = &lt;STDIN&gt;&rsquo;, there would have been
no way for the hypothetical timeout() function to access the
lexical variable $line back in its callers scope.</p>

<p>What is variable suicide and how can I prevent it?</p>

<p>This problem was fixed in perl 5.004_05, so preventing
it means upgrad- ing your version of perl. ;)</p>

<p>Variable suicide is when you (temporarily or
permanently) lose the value of a variable. It is caused by
scoping through my() and local() interacting with either
closures or aliased foreach() iterator vari- ables and
subroutine arguments. It used to be easy to inadvertently
lose a variables value this way, but now its much harder.
Take this code:</p>

<p>my $f = foo; sub T { while ($i++ &lt; 3) { my $f = $f;
$f .= $i; print $f, &quot;0 } } T; print &quot;Finally
$f0;</p>

<p>If you are experiencing variable suicide, that &quot;my
$f&quot; in the subrou- tine doesnt pick up a fresh copy of
the $f whose value is &lt;foo&gt;. The output shows that
inside the subroutine the value of $f leaks through when it
shouldnt, as in this output:</p>

<p>foobar foobarbar foobarbarbar Finally foo</p>

<p>The $f that has &quot;bar&quot; added to it three times
should be a new $f &quot;my $f&quot; should create a new
lexical variable each time through the loop. The expected
output is:</p>

<p>foobar foobar foobar Finally foo</p>

<p>How can I pass/return a {Function, FileHandle, Array,
Hash, Method, Regex}?</p>

<p>With the exception of regexes, you need to pass
references to these objects. See &quot;Pass by
Reference&quot; in perlsub for this particular ques- tion,
and perlref for information on references.</p>

<p>See &quot;Passing Regexes&quot;, below, for information
on passing regular expressions.</p>

<p>Passing Variables and Functions Regular variables and
functions are quite easy to pass: just pass in a reference
to an existing or anonymous variable or function:</p>

<p>func( ome_scalar );</p>

<p>func( @some_array ); func( [ 1 .. 10 ] );</p>

<p>func( some_hash ); func( { this =&gt; 10, that =&gt; 20
} );</p>

<p>func( some_func ); func( sub { $_[0] ** $_[1] } );</p>

<p>Passing Filehandles As of Perl 5.6, you can represent
filehandles with scalar variables which you treat as any
other scalar.</p>

<p>open my $fh, $filename or die &quot;Cannot open
$filename! $!&quot;; func( $fh );</p>

<p>sub func { my $passed_fh = shift;</p>

<p>my $line = &lt;$fh&gt;; }</p>

<p>Before Perl 5.6, you had to use the *FH or &quot;H&quot;
notations. These are &quot;typeglobs&quot;--see
&quot;Typeglobs and Filehandles&quot; in perldata and
especially &quot;Pass by Reference&quot; in perlsub for more
information.</p>

<p>Passing Regexes To pass regexes around, you ll need to
be using a release of Perl sufficiently recent as to support
the &quot;qr//&quot; construct, pass around strings and use
an exception-trapping eval, or else be very, very
clever.</p>

<p>Heres an example of how to pass in a string to be regex
compared using &quot;qr//&quot;:</p>

<p>sub compare($$) { my ($val1, $regex) = @_; my $retval =
$val1 =~ /$regex/; return $retval; } $match =
compare(&quot;old McDonald&quot;, qr/d.*D/i);</p>

<p>Notice how &quot;qr//&quot; allows flags at the end.
That pattern was com- piled at compile time, although it was
executed later. The nifty &quot;qr//&quot; notation wasn t
introduced until the 5.005 release. Before that, you had to
approach this problem much less intuitively. For example,
here it is again if you dont have &quot;qr//&quot;:</p>

<p>sub compare($$) { my ($val1, $regex) = @_; my $retval =
eval { $val1 =~ /$regex/ }; die if $@; return $retval; }</p>

<p>$match = compare(&quot;old McDonald&quot;,
q/($?i)d.*D/);</p>

<p>Make sure you never say something like this:</p>

<p>return eval &quot;al =~ /$regex/&quot;; # WRONG</p>

<p>or someone can sneak shell escapes into the regex due to
the double interpolation of the eval and the double-quoted
string. For exam- ple:</p>

<p>$pattern_of_evil = danger ${ system(&quot;rm -rf *
&amp;&quot;) } danger;</p>

<p>eval &quot;tring =~ /$pattern_of_evil/&quot;;</p>

<p>Those preferring to be very, very clever might see the
OReilly book, Mastering Regular Expressions, by Jeffrey
Friedl. Page 273s Build_MatchMany_Function() is particularly
interesting. A complete citation of this book is given in
perlfaq2.</p>

<p>Passing Methods To pass an object method into a
subroutine, you can do this:</p>

<p>call_a_lot(10, $some_obj, &quot;methname&quot;) sub
call_a_lot { my ($count, $widget, $trick) = @_; for (my $i =
0; $i &lt; $count; $i++) { $widget-&gt;$trick(); } }</p>

<p>Or, you can use a closure to bundle up the object, its
method call, and arguments:</p>

<p>my $whatnot = sub { $some_obj-&gt;obfuscate(@args) };
func($whatnot); sub func { my $code = shift; &amp;$code();
}</p>

<p>You could also investigate the can() method in the
UNIVERSAL class (part of the standard perl
distribution).</p>

<p>How do I create a static variable?</p>

<p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p>Perl doesn t have &quot;static&quot; variables, which
can only be accessed from the function in which they are
declared. You can get the same effect with lexical
variables, though.</p>

<p>You can fake a static variable by using a lexical
variable which goes out of scope. In this example, you
define the subroutine &quot;counter&quot;, and it uses the
lexical variable $count. Since you wrap this in a BEGIN
block, $count is defined at compile-time, but also goes out
of scope at the end of the BEGIN block. The BEGIN block also
ensures that the sub- routine and the value it uses is
defined at compile-time so the subrou- tine is ready to use
just like any other subroutine, and you can put this code in
the same place as other subroutines in the program text
(i.e. at the end of the code, typically). The subroutine
&quot;counter&quot; still has a reference to the data, and
is the only way you can access the value (and each time you
do, you increment the value). The data in chunk of memory
defined by $count is private to &quot;counter&quot;.</p>

<p>BEGIN { my $count = 1; sub counter { $count++ } }</p>

<p>my $start = count();</p>

<p>.... # code that calls count();</p>

<p>my $end = count();</p>

<p>In the previous example, you created a function-private
variable because only one function remembered its reference.
You could define multiple functions while the variable is in
scope, and each function can share the &quot;private&quot;
variable. Its not really &quot;static&quot; because you can
access it outside the function while the lexical variable is
in scope, and even create references to it. In this example,
&quot;incre- ment_count&quot; and &quot;return_count&quot;
share the variable. One function adds to the value and the
other simply returns the value. They can both access $count,
and since it has gone out of scope, there is no other way to
access it.</p>

<p>BEGIN { my $count = 1; sub increment_count { $count++ }
sub return_count { $count } }</p>

<p>To declare a file-private variable, you still use a
lexical variable. A file is also a scope, so a lexical
variable defined in the file can- not be seen from any other
file.</p>

<p>See &quot;Persistent Private Variables&quot; in perlsub
for more information. The discussion of closures in perlref
may help you even though we did not use anonymous
subroutines in this answer. See &quot;Persistent Private
Variables&quot; in perlsub for details.</p>

<p>What s the difference between dynamic and lexical
(static) scoping? Between local() and my()?</p>

<p>&quot;local($x)&quot; saves away the old value of the
global variable $x and assigns a new value for the duration
of the subroutine which is visible in other functions called
from that subroutine. This is done at run-time, so is called
dynamic scoping. local() always affects global variables,
also called package variables or dynamic variables.</p>

<p>&quot;my($x)&quot; creates a new variable that is only
visible in the current subroutine. This is done at
compile-time, so it is called lexical or static scoping.
my() always affects private variables, also called lexical
variables or (improperly) static(ly scoped) variables.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<p>sub visible { print &quot;var has value $var0; }</p>

<p>sub dynamic { local $var = local; # new temporary value
for the still-global visible(); # variable called $var }</p>

<p>sub lexical { my $var = private; # new private variable,
$var visible(); # (invisible outside of sub scope) }</p>

<p>$var = global;</p>

<p>visible(); # prints global dynamic(); # prints local
lexical(); # prints global</p>

<p>Notice how at no point does the value
&quot;private&quot; get printed. Thats because $var only has
that value within the block of the lexical() function, and
it is hidden from called subroutine.</p>

<p>In summary, local() doesnt make what you think of as
private, local variables. It gives a global variable a
temporary value. my() is what youre looking for if you want
private variables.</p>

<p>See &quot;Private Variables via my()&quot; in perlsub
and &quot;Temporary Values via local()&quot; in perlsub for
excruciating details.</p>

<p>How can I access a dynamic variable while a similarly
named lexical is in scope?</p>

<p>If you know your package, you can just mention it
explicitly, as in $Some_Pack::var. Note that the notation
$::var is not the dynamic $var in the current package, but
rather the one in the &quot;main&quot; package, as though
you had written $main::var.</p>

<p>use vars $var; local $var = &quot;global&quot;; my $var
= &quot;lexical&quot;;</p>

<p>print &quot;lexical is $var0; print &quot;global is
$main::var0;</p>

<p>Alternatively you can use the compiler directive our()
to bring a dynamic variable into the current lexical
scope.</p>

<p>require 5.006; # our() did not exist before 5.6 use vars
$var;</p>

<p>local $var = &quot;global&quot;; my $var =
&quot;lexical&quot;;</p>

<p>print &quot;lexical is $var0;</p>

<p>{ our $var; print &quot;global is $var0; }</p>

<p>Whas the difference between deep and shallow
binding?</p>

<p>In deep binding, lexical variables mentioned in
anonymous subroutines are the same ones that were in scope
when the subroutine was created. In shallow binding, they
are whichever variables with the same names happen to be in
scope when the subroutine is called. Perl always uses deep
binding of lexical variables (i.e., those created with
my()). However, dynamic variables (aka global, local, or
package variables) are effectively shallowly bound. Consider
this just one more reason not to use them. See the answer to
&quot;Whats a closure?&quot;.</p>

<p>Why doest &quot;my($foo) = &lt;FILE&gt;;&quot; work
right?</p>

<p>&quot;my()&quot; and &quot;local()&quot; give list
context to the right hand side of &quot;=&quot;. The
&lt;FH&gt; read operation, like so many of Perl s functions
and opera- tors, can tell which context it was called in and
behaves appropri- ately. In general, the scalar() function
can help. This function does nothing to the data itself
(contrary to popular myth) but rather tells its argument to
behave in whatever its scalar fashion is. If that function
doesn t have a defined scalar behavior, this of course
doesnt help you (such as with sort()).</p>

<p>To enforce scalar context in this particular case,
however, you need merely omit the parentheses:</p>

<p>local($foo) = &lt;FILE&gt;; # WRONG local($foo) =
scalar(&lt;FILE&gt;); # ok local $foo = &lt;FILE&gt;; #
right</p>

<p>You should probably be using lexical variables anyway,
although the issue is the same here:</p>

<p>my($foo) = &lt;FILE&gt;; # WRONG my $foo = &lt;FILE&gt;;
# right</p>

<p>How do I redefine a builtin function, operator, or
method?</p>

<p>Why do you want to do that? :-)</p>

<p>If you want to override a predefined function, such as
open(), then youll have to import the new definition from a
different module. See &quot;Overriding Built-in
Functions&quot; in perlsub. Theres also an example in
&quot;Class::Template&quot; in perltoot.</p>

<p>If you want to overload a Perl operator, such as
&quot;+&quot; or &quot;**&quot;, then youll want to use the
&quot;use overload&quot; pragma, documented in overload.</p>

<p>If youre talking about obscuring method calls in parent
classes, see &quot;Overridden Methods&quot; in perltoot.</p>

<p>Whas the difference between calling a function as
&amp;foo and foo()?</p>

<p>When you call a function as &amp;foo, you allow that
function access to your current @_ values, and you bypass
prototypes. The function doesnt get an empty @_--it gets
yours! While not strictly speaking a bug (its documented
that way in perlsub), it would be hard to consider this a
feature in most cases.</p>

<p>When you call your function as &quot;&amp;foo()&quot;,
then you do get a new @_, but prototyping is still
circumvented.</p>

<p>Normally, you want to call a function using
&quot;foo()&quot;. You may only omit the parentheses if the
function is already known to the compiler because it already
saw the definition (&quot;use&quot; but not
&quot;require&quot;), or via a forward reference or
&quot;use subs&quot; declaration. Even in this case, you get
a clean @_ without any of the old values leaking through
where they dont belong.</p>

<p>How do I create a switch or case statement?</p>

<p>This is explained in more depth in the perlsyn. Briefly,
theres no official case statement, because of the variety of
tests possible in Perl (numeric comparison, string
comparison, glob comparison, regex matching, overloaded
comparisons, ...). Larry couldnt decide how best to do this,
so he left it out, even though its been on the wish list
since perl1.</p>

<p>Starting from Perl 5.8 to get switch and case one can
use the Switch extension and say:</p>

<p>use Switch;</p>

<p>after which one has switch and case. It is not as fast
as it could be because it s not really part of the language
(its done using source filters) but it is available, and its
very flexible.</p>

<p>But if one wants to use pure Perl, the general answer is
to write a construct like this:</p>

<p>for ($variable_to_test) { if (/pat1/) { } # do something
elsif (/pat2/) { } # do something else elsif (/pat3/) { } #
do something else else { } # default }</p>

<p>Here s a simple example of a switch based on pattern
matching, this time lined up in a way to make it look more
like a switch statement. We ll do a multiway conditional
based on the type of reference stored in
$whatchamacallit:</p>

<p>SWITCH: for (ref $whatchamacallit) {</p>

<p>/^$/ &amp;&amp; die &quot;not a reference&quot;;</p>

<p>/SCALAR/ &amp;&amp; do { print_scalar($$ref); last
SWITCH; };</p>

<p>/ARRAY/ &amp;&amp; do { print_array(@$ref); last SWITCH;
};</p>

<p>/HASH/ &amp;&amp; do { print_hash(%$ref); last SWITCH;
};</p>

<p>/CODE/ &amp;&amp; do { warn &quot;cant print function
ref&quot;; last SWITCH; };</p>

<p># DEFAULT</p>

<p>warn &quot;User defined type skipped&quot;;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>See &quot;perlsyn/&quot;Basic BLOCKs and Switch
Statements&quot;&quot; for many other exam- ples in this
style.</p>

<p>Sometimes you should change the positions of the
constant and the vari- able. For example, lets say you
wanted to test which of many answers you were given, but in
a case-insensitive way that also allows abbrevi- ations. You
can use the following technique if the strings all start
with different characters or if you want to arrange the
matches so that one takes precedence over another, as
&quot;SEND&quot; has precedence over &quot;STOP&quot;
here:</p>

<p>chomp($answer = &lt;&gt;); if (&quot;SEND&quot; =~
/^Q$answer/i) { print &quot;Action is send0 } elsif
(&quot;STOP&quot; =~ /^Q$answer/i) { print &quot;Action is
stop0 } elsif (&quot;ABORT&quot; =~ /^Q$answer/i) { print
&quot;Action is abort0 } elsif (&quot;LIST&quot; =~
/^Q$answer/i) { print &quot;Action is list0 } elsif
(&quot;EDIT&quot; =~ /^Q$answer/i) { print &quot;Action is
edit0 }</p>

<p>A totally different approach is to create a hash of
function refer- ences.</p>

<p>my %commands = ( &quot;happy&quot; =&gt; joy,
&quot;sad&quot;, =&gt; sullen, &quot;done&quot; =&gt; sub {
die &quot;See ya!&quot; }, &quot;mad&quot; =&gt; angry,
);</p>

<p>print &quot;How are you? &quot;; chomp($string =
&lt;STDIN&gt;); if ($commands{$string}) {
$commands{$string}-&gt;(); } else { print &quot;No such
command: $string0; }</p>

<p>How can I catch accesses to undefined variables,
functions, or methods?</p>

<p>The AUTOLOAD method, discussed in
&quot;Autoloading&quot; in perlsub and &quot;AUTOLOAD: Proxy
Methods&quot; in perltoot, lets you capture calls to unde-
fined functions and methods.</p>

<p>When it comes to undefined variables that would trigger
a warning under &quot;use warnings&quot;, you can promote
the warning to an error.</p>

<p>use warnings FATAL =&gt; qw(uninitialized);</p>

<p>Why cat a method included in this same file be
found?</p>

<p>Some possible reasons: your inheritance is getting
confused, youve misspelled the method name, or the object is
of the wrong type. Check out perltoot for details about any
of the above cases. You may also use &quot;print
ref($object)&quot; to find out the class $object was blessed
into.</p>

<p>Another possible reason for problems is because youve
used the indi- rect object syntax (eg, &quot;find Guru
&quot;Samy&quot;&quot;) on a class name before Perl has seen
that such a package exists. Its wisest to make sure your
packages are all defined before you start using them, which
will be taken care of if you use the &quot;use&quot;
statement instead of &quot;require&quot;. If not, make sure
to use arrow notation (eg.,
&quot;Guru-&gt;find(&quot;Samy&quot;)&quot;) instead. Object
notation is explained in perlobj.</p>

<p>Make sure to read about creating modules in perlmod and
the perils of indirect objects in &quot;Method
Invocation&quot; in perlobj.</p>

<p>How can I find out my current package?</p>

<p>If you re just a random program, you can do this to find
out what the currently compiled package is:</p>

<p>my $packname = __PACKAGE__;</p>

<p>But, if youre a method and you want to print an error
message that includes the kind of object you were called on
(which is not necessar- ily the same as the one in which you
were compiled):</p>

<p>sub amethod { my $self = shift; my $class = ref($self)
$self; warn &quot;called me from a $class object&quot;;
}</p>

<p>How can I comment out a large block of perl code?</p>

<p>You can use embedded POD to discard it. Enclose the
blocks you want to comment out in POD markers. The
&lt;=begin&gt; directive marks a section for a specific
formatter. Use the &quot;comment&quot; format, which no
formatter should claim to understand (by policy). Mark the
end of the block with &lt;=end&gt;.</p>

<p># program is here</p>

<p>=begin comment</p>

<p>all of this stuff</p>

<p>here will be ignored by everyone</p>

<p>=end comment</p>

<p>=cut</p>

<p># program continues</p>

<p>The pod directives cannot go just anywhere. You must put
a pod direc- tive where the parser is expecting a new
statement, not just in the middle of an expression or some
other arbitrary grammar production.</p>

<p>See perlpod for more details.</p>

<p>How do I clear a package?</p>

<p>Use this code, provided by Mark-Jason Dominus:</p>

<p>sub scrub_package { no strict refs; my $pack = shift;
die &quot;Shouldnt delete main package&quot; if $pack eq
&quot;&quot; $pack eq &quot;main&quot;; my $stash = *{$pack
. ::}{HASH}; my $name; foreach $name (keys %$stash) { my
$fullname = $pack . :: . $name; # Get rid of everything with
that name. undef $$fullname; undef @$fullname; undef
%$fullname; undef &amp;$fullname; undef *$fullname; } }</p>

<p>Or, if youre using a recent release of Perl, you can
just use the Sym- bol::delete_package() function
instead.</p>

<p>How can I use a variable as a variable name?</p>

<p>Beginners often think they want to have a variable
contain the name of a variable.</p>

<p>$fred = 23; $varname = &quot;fred&quot;; ++$$varname; #
$fred now 24</p>

<p>This works sometimes, but it is a very bad idea for two
reasons.</p>

<p>The first reason is that this technique only works on
global variables. That means that if $fred is a lexical
variable created with my() in the above example, the code
wouldn t work at all: you d accidentally access the global
and skip right over the private lexical altogether. Global
variables are bad because they can easily collide
accidentally and in general make for non-scalable and
confusing code.</p>

<p>Symbolic references are forbidden under the &quot;use
strict&quot; pragma. They are not true references and
consequently are not reference counted or garbage
collected.</p>

<p>The other reason why using a variable to hold the name
of another vari- able is a bad idea is that the question
often stems from a lack of understanding of Perl data
structures, particularly hashes. By using symbolic
references, you are just using the package s symbol-table
hash (like %main::) instead of a user-defined hash. The
solution is to use your own hash or a real reference
instead.</p>

<p>$USER_VARS{&quot;fred&quot;} = 23; $varname =
&quot;fred&quot;; $USER_VARS{$varname}++; # not
$$varname++</p>

<p>There were using the %USER_VARS hash instead of symbolic
references. Sometimes this comes up in reading strings from
the user with variable references and wanting to expand them
to the values of your perl pro- gram s variables. This is
also a bad idea because it conflates the program-addressable
namespace and the user-addressable one. Instead of reading a
string and expanding it to the actual contents of your pro-
grams own variables:</p>

<p>$str = this has a $fred and $barney in it; $str =~
s/(w+)/$1/eeg; # need double eval</p>

<p>it would be better to keep a hash around like %USER_VARS
and have vari- able references actually refer to entries in
that hash:</p>

<p>$str =~ s/+)/$USER_VARS{$1}/g; # no /e here at all</p>

<p>That s faster, cleaner, and safer than the previous
approach. Of course, you dont need to use a dollar sign. You
could use your own scheme to make it less confusing, like
bracketed percent symbols, etc.</p>

<p>$str = this has a %fred% and %barney% in it; $str =~
s/%(1008</p>

<p>Another reason that folks sometimes think they want a
variable to con- tain the name of a variable is because they
dont know how to build proper data structures using hashes.
For example, let s say they wanted two hashes in their
program: %fred and %barney, and that they wanted to use
another scalar variable to refer to those by name.</p>

<p>$name = &quot;fred&quot;; $$name{WIFE} =
&quot;wilma&quot;; # set %fred</p>

<p>$name = &quot;barney&quot;; $$name{WIFE} =
&quot;betty&quot;; # set %barney</p>

<p>This is still a symbolic reference, and is still saddled
with the prob- lems enumerated above. It would be far better
to write:</p>

<p>$folks{&quot;fred&quot;}{WIFE} = &quot;wilma&quot;;
$folks{&quot;barney&quot;}{WIFE} = &quot;betty&quot;;</p>

<p>And just use a multilevel hash to start with.</p>

<p>The only times that you absolutely must use symbolic
references are when you really must refer to the symbol
table. This may be because its something that cant take a
real reference to, such as a format name. Doing so may also
be important for method calls, since these always go through
the symbol table for resolution.</p>

<p>In those cases, you would turn off &quot;strict
&rsquo;refs&rsquo;&quot; temporarily so you can play around
with the symbol table. For example:</p>

<p>@colors = qw(red blue green yellow orange purple
violet); for my $name (@colors) { no strict refs; # renege
for the block *$name = sub { &quot;&lt;FONT
COLOR=$name&gt;@_&lt;/FONT&gt;&quot; }; }</p>

<p>All those functions (red(), blue(), green(), etc.)
appear to be sepa- rate, but the real code in the closure
actually was compiled only once.</p>

<p>So, sometimes you might want to use symbolic references
to directly manipulate the symbol table. This doesn t matter
for formats, handles, and subroutines, because they are
always global--you can t use my() on them. For scalars,
arrays, and hashes, though--and usually for subrou- tines--
you probably only want to use hard references.</p>

<p>What does &quot;bad interpreter&quot; mean?</p>

<p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p>The &quot;bad interpreter&quot; message comes from the
shell, not perl. The actual message may vary depending on
your platform, shell, and locale settings.</p>

<p>If you see &quot;bad interpreter - no such file or
directory&quot;, the first line in your perl script (the
&quot;shebang&quot; line) does not contain the right path to
perl (or any other program capable of running scripts).
Sometimes this happens when you move the script from one
machine to another and each machine has a different path to
perl---/usr/bin/perl versus /usr/local/bin/perl for
instance. It may also indicate that the source machine has
CRLF line terminators and the destination machine has LF
only: the shell tries to find /usr/bin/perl&lt;CR&gt;, but
cant.</p>

<p>If you see &quot;bad interpreter: Permission
denied&quot;, you need to make your script executable.</p>

<p>In either case, you should still be able to run the
scripts with perl explicitly:</p>

<p>% perl script.pl</p>

<p>If you get a message like &quot;perl: command not
found&quot;, perl is not in your PATH, which might also mean
that the location of perl is not where you expect it so you
need to adjust your shebang line.</p>
