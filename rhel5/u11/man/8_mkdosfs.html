<p>MKDOSFS(8) MKDOSFS(8)</p>

<p>NAME mkdosfs - create an MS-DOS file system under
Linux</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mkdosfs [ -A ] [ -b sector-of-backup ] [ -c ] [
-l filename ] [ -C ] [ -f number-of-FATs ] [ -F FAT-size ] [
-h number-of-hidden-sectors ] [ -i volume-id ] [ -I ] [ -m
message-file ] [ -n volume-name ] [ -r root- dir-entries ] [
-R number-of-reserved-sectors ] [ -s sectors-per-clus- ter ]
[ -S logical-sector-size ] [ -v ] device [ block-count ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mkdosfs is used to create an MS-DOS file
system under Linux on a device (usually a disk partition).
device is the special file corresponding to the device (e.g
/dev/hdXX). block-count is the number of blocks on the
device. If omitted, mkdosfs automatically determiness the
file system size.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A Use Atari variation of the MS-DOS filesystem.
This is default if mkdosfs is run on an Atari, then this
option turns off Atari format. There are some differences
when using Atari format: If not directed otherwise by the
user, mkdosfs will always use 2 sectors per cluster, since
GEMDOS doesnt like other values very much. It will also obey
the maximum number of sectors GEMDOS can handle. Larger
filesystems are managed by raising the logi- cal sector
size. Under Atari format, an Atari-compatible serial number
for the filesystem is generated, and a 12 bit FAT is used
only for filesystems that have one of the usual floppy sizes
(720k, 1.2M, 1.44M, 2.88M), a 16 bit FAT otherwise. This can
be overridden with the -F option. Some PC-specific boot
sector fields aren t written, and a boot message (option -m)
is ignored.</p>

<p>-b sector-of-backup Selects the location of the backup
boot sector for FAT32. Default depends on number of reserved
sectors, but usually is sector 6. The backup must be within
the range of reserved sec- tors.</p>

<p>-c Check the device for bad blocks before creating the
file system.</p>

<p>-C Create the file given as device on the command line,
and write the to-be-created file system to it. This can be
used to create the new file system in a file instead of on a
real device, and to avoid using dd in advance to create a
file of appropriate size. With this option, the block-count
must be given, because otherwise the intended size of the
file system wouldnt be known. The file created is a sparse
file, which actually only contains the meta-data areas (boot
sector, FATs, and root direc- tory). The data portions won t
be stored on the disk, but the file nevertheless will have
the correct size. The resulting file can be copied later to
a floppy disk or other device, or mounted through a loop
device.</p>

<p>-f number-of-FATs Specify the number of file allocation
tables in the file system. The default is 2. Currently the
Linux MS-DOS file system does not support more than 2
FATs.</p>

<p>-F FAT-size Specifies the type of file allocation tables
used (12, 16 or 32 bit). If nothing is specified, mkdosfs
will automatically select between 12 and 16 bit, whatever
fits better for the filesystem size. 32 bit FAT (FAT32
format) must (still) be selected explicitly if you want
it.</p>

<p>-h number-of-hidden-sectors Select the number of hidden
sectors in the volume. Apparently some digital cameras get
indigestion if you feed them a CF card without such hidden
sectors, this option allows you to satisfy them. Assumes
&acute;0&acute; if no value is given on the command
line.</p>

<p>-i volume-id Sets the volume ID of the newly created
filesystem; volume-id is a 32-bit hexadecimal number (for
example, 2e24ec82). The default is a number which depends on
the filesystem creation time.</p>

<p>-I Normally you are not allowed to use any full fixed
disk devices. mkdosfs will complain and tell you that it
refuses to work. This is different when usind MO disks. One
doesnt always need partitions on MO disks. The filesytem can
go directly to the whole disk. Under other OSes this is
known as the superfloppy format.</p>

<p>This switch will force mkdosfs to work properly.</p>

<p>-l filename Read the bad blocks list from filename.</p>

<p>-m message-file Sets the message the user receives on
attempts to boot this filesystem without having properly
installed an operating sys- tem. The message file must not
exceed 418 bytes once line feeds have been converted to
carriage return-line feed combinations, and tabs have been
expanded. If the filename is a hyphen (-), the text is taken
from standard input.</p>

<p>-n volume-name Sets the volume name (label) of the
filesystem. The volume name can be up to 11 characters long.
The default is no label.</p>

<p>-r root-dir-entries Select the number of entries
available in the root directory. The default is 112 or 224
for floppies and 512 for hard disks.</p>

<p>-R number-of-reserved-sectors Select the number of
reserved sectos. With FAT32 format at least 2 reserved
sectors are needed, the default is 32. Otherwise the default
is 1 (only the boot sector).</p>

<p>-s sectors-per-cluster Specify the number of disk
sectors per cluster. Must be a power of 2, i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8,
... 128.</p>

<p>-S logical-sector-size Specify the number of bytes per
logical sector. Must be a power of 2 and greater than or
equal to 512, i.e. 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, or
32768.</p>

<p>-v Verbose execution.</p>

<p>BUGS mkdosfs can not create bootable filesystems. This
isnt as easy as you might think at first glance for various
reasons and has been discussed a lot already. mkdosfs simply
will not support it ;)</p>
