<p>MKNODAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual MKNODAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME mknodat - create a special or ordinary file
relative to a directory file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mknodat(int dirfd, const char *pathname, mode_t
mode, dev_t dev);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mknodat() system call operates in
exactly the same way as mknod(2), except for the differences
described in this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it
is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor dirfd (rather than relative to the current
working directory of the calling process, as is done by
mknod(2) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in pathname is relative and dirfd
is the special value AT_FDCWD, then pathname is interpreted
relative to the current working directory of the calling
process (like mknod(2)).</p>

<p>If the pathname given in pathname is absolute, then
dirfd is ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, mknodat() returns 0. On error,
-1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for mknod(2) can also
occur for mknodat(). The following additional errors can
occur for mknodat():</p>

<p>EBADF dirfd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR pathname is a relative path and dirfd is a file
descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
mknodat().</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is non-standard but is
proposed for inclusion in a future revision of POSIX.1.</p>

<p>VERSIONS mknodat() was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16.</p>
