<p>STRINGS(1) GNU Development Tools STRINGS(1)</p>

<p>NAME strings - print the strings of printable characters
in files.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS strings [-afov] [-min-len] [-n min-len]
[--bytes=min-len] [-t radix] [--radix=radix] [-e encoding]
[--encoding=encoding] [-] [--all] [--print-file-name] [-T
bfdname] [--target=bfdname] [--help] [--version] file...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For each file given, GNU strings prints the
printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters
long (or the number given with the options below) and are
followed by an unprintable character. By default, it only
prints the strings from the initialized and loaded sections
of object files; for other types of files, it prints the
strings from the whole file.</p>

<p>strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of
non-text files.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a --all - Do not scan only the initialized and
loaded sections of object files; scan the whole files.</p>

<p>-f --print-file-name Print the name of the file before
each string.</p>

<p>--help Print a summary of the program usage on the
standard output and exit.</p>

<p>-min-len -n min-len --bytes=min-len Print sequences of
characters that are at least min-len characters long,
instead of the default 4.</p>

<p>-o Like -t o. Some other versions of strings have -o act
like -t d instead. Since we can not be compatible with both
ways, we simply chose one.</p>

<p>-t radix --radix=radix Print the offset within the file
before each string. The single character argument specifies
the radix of the offset---o for octal, x for hexadecimal, or
d for decimal.</p>

<p>-e encoding --encoding=encoding Select the character
encoding of the strings that are to be found. Possible
values for encoding are: s = single-7-bit-byte characters
(ASCII, ISO 8859, etc., default), S = single-8-bit-byte
characters, b = 16-bit bigendian, l = 16-bit littleendian, B
= 32-bit bigen- dian, L = 32-bit littleendian. Useful for
finding wide character strings.</p>

<p>-T bfdname --target=bfdname Specify an object code
format other than your systems default for- mat.</p>

<p>-v --version Print the program version number on the
standard output and exit.</p>

<p>@file Read command-line options from file. The options
read are inserted in place of the original @file option. If
file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will
be treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p>Options in file are separated by whitespace. A
whitespace charac- ter may be included in an option by
surrounding the entire option in either single or double
quotes. Any character (including a backslash) may be
included by prefixing the character to be included with a
backslash. The file may itself contain additional @file
options; any such options will be processed recursively.</p>
