<p>RACOON.CONF(5) BSD File Formats Manual
RACOON.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME racoon.conf - configuration file for racoon</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION racoon.conf is the configuration file for
the racoon(8) ISAKMP daemon. racoon(8) negotiates security
associations for itself (ISAKMP SA, or phase 1 SA) and for
kernel IPsec (IPsec SA, or phase 2 SA). The file consists of
a sequence of directives and statements. Each directive is
composed by a tag and statements, enclosed by { and } .
Lines begin- ning with # are comments.</p>

<p>Meta Syntax Keywords and special characters that the
parser expects exactly are dis- played using this font.
Parameters are specified with this font. Square brackets ( [
and ]) are used to show optional keywords and parameters.
Note that you have to pay attention when this manual is
describing port numbers. The port number is always enclosed
by [ and ]. In this case, the port number is not an optional
keyword. If it is possible to omit the port number, the
expression becomes [[port]]. The vertical bar ( | ) is used
to indicate a choice between optional parameters. Paren-
theses ( ( and )) are used to group keywords and parameters
when nec- essary. Major parameters are listed below.</p>

<p>number means a hexadecimal or a decimal number. The
former must be prefixed with 0x. string path file means any
string enclosed in &quot; (double quotes). address means
IPv6 and/or IPv4 address. port means a TCP/UDP port number.
The port number is always enclosed by [ and ]. timeunit is
one of following: sec, secs, second, seconds, min, mins,
minute, minutes, hour, hours.</p>

<p>Privilege separation privsep { statements } specifies
privilege separation parameters. When enabled, these enable
racoon(8) to operate with an unprivileged instance doing
most of the work, while a privileged instance takes care of
per- forming the following operations as root: reading PSK
and private keys, launching hook scripts, and validating
passwords against system databases or against PAM.</p>

<p>user user; The user to which the unprivileged instance
of racoon(8), should switch. This can be a quoted user name
or a numeric UID. group group; The group to which the
unprivileged instance of racoon(8), should switch. This can
be a quoted group name or a numeric GID. chroot path; A
directory to which the unprivileged instance of racoon(8)
should chroot(2). This directory should hold a tree where
the following files must be reachable: /dev/random
/dev/urandom the certificates the file containing the Xauth
banner</p>

<p>The PSK file, the private keys, and the hook scripts are
accessed through the privileged instance of racoon(8) and do
not need to be reachable in the chroot(2) ed tree.</p>

<p>Path Specification This section specify various paths
used by racoon. When running in priv- ilege separation mode,
certificate and script paths are mandatory. path include
path; specifies a path to include a file. See File
Inclusion. path pre_shared_key file; specifies a file
containing pre-shared key(s) for various ID(s). See
Pre-shared key File. path certificate path; racoon(8) will
search this directory if a certificate or certifi- cate
request is received. If you run with privilege separation,
racoon(8) will refuse to use a certificate stored outside of
this directory. path backupsa file; specifies a file to
which SA information which is negotiated by racoon should be
stored. racoon(8) will install SA(s) from the file when
started with the -B flag. The file is growing because
racoon(8) simply adds SAs to it. You should maintain the
file manually. path script path; racoon(8) will search this
directory for scripts hooks. If you run with privilege
separation, racoon(8) will refuse to execute a script stored
outside of this directory. path pidfile file; specifies file
where to store PID of process. If path starts with / it is
treated as an absolute path, otherwise relative to VARRUN
directory specified at compilation time. Default is
racoon.pid.</p>

<p>File Inclusion include file other configuration files
can be included.</p>

<p>Identifier Specification is obsolete. It must be defined
at each remote directive.</p>

<p>Timer Specification timer { statements } specifies
various timer values.</p>

<p>counter number; the maximum number of retries to send.
The default is 5. interval number timeunit; the interval to
resend, in seconds. The default time is 10 seconds. persend
number; the number of packets per send. The default is 1.
phase1 number timeunit; the maximum time it should take to
complete phase 1. The default time is 15 seconds. phase2
number timeunit; the maximum time it should take to complete
phase 2. The default time is 10 seconds. natt_keepalive
number timeunit; interval between sending NAT-Traversal
keep-alive pack- ets. The default time is 20 seconds. Set to
0s to dis- able keep-alive packets.</p>

<p>Listening Port Specification listen { statements } If no
listen directive is specified, racoon(8) will listen on all
available interface addresses. The following is the list of
valid statements:</p>

<p>isakmp address [[port]]; If this is specified, racoon(8)
will only listen on address. The default port is 500, which
is specified by IANA. You can provide more than one address
definition. isakmp_natt address [port]; Same as isakmp but
also sets the socket options to accept UDP-encapsulated ESP
traffic for NAT-Traversal. If you plan to use NAT-T, you
should provide at least one address with port 4500, which is
specified by IANA. There is no default. strict_address;
require that all addresses for ISAKMP must be bound. This
statement will be ignored if you do not specify any address.
The listen section can also be used to specify the admin
socket mode and ownership, if racoon was built with support
for admin port. adminsock path [owner group mode]; path,
owner, and group are the socket path, owner, and group; they
must be quoted. Defaults are /var/racoon/racoon.sock, UID 0,
and GID 0. mode is the access mode in octal, default is
0600. adminsock disabled; This directive tells racoon to not
listen on the admin socket.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Global Parameters gss_id_enc enctype;
Older versions of racoon(8) used ISO-Latin-1 as the encoding
of the GSS-API identifier attribute. For interoperability
with Microsoft Windows GSS-API authentication scheme, the
default encoding has been changed to UTF-16LE. The
gss_id_enc parameter allows racoon(8) to be configured to
use the old encoding for compatibility with existing
racoon(8) installations. The follow- ing are valid values
for enctype:</p>

<p>utf-16le Use UTF-16LE to encode the GSS-API identifier
attribute. This is the default encoding. This encoding is
compati- ble with Microsoft Windows. latin1 Use ISO-Latin-1
to encode the GSS-API identifier attribute. This is the
encoding used by older versions of racoon(8).</p>

<p>pfkey_buffer kBytes Specifies the soket send/receive
buffer size in kilobytes. Numer- ous kernel PF_KEY
implementations have problems with dumping SAD/SDP with
large amount of entries (this happens when 100s to 1000s of
tunnels are configured).</p>

<p>The default value of 0 leaves everything at the
OS-specific default value. If the default buffer size is
greater than what is specified here racoon will not decrease
it.</p>

<p>This problem is known to be fixed in Linux 2.6.25 and
later.</p>

<p>Remote Nodes Specifications remote (address | anonymous)
[[port]] [inherit parent] { statements } specifies the
parameters for IKE phase 1 for each remote node. The default
port is 500. If anonymous is specified, the state- ments
apply to all peers which do not match any other remote
directive.</p>

<p>Sections with inherit parent statements (where parent is
either address or a keyword anonymous) have all values
predefined to those of a given parent. In these sections it
is enough to rede- fine only the changed parameters.</p>

<p>The following are valid statements.</p>

<p>exchange_mode (main | aggressive | base); defines the
exchange mode for phase 1 when racoon is the initiator. It
also means the acceptable exchange mode when racoon is
responder. More than one mode can be specified by separating
them with a comma. All of the modes are acceptable. The
first exchange mode is what racoon uses when it is the
initiator. doi ipsec_doi; means to use IPsec DOI as
specified in RFC 2407. You can omit this statement.
situation identity_only; means to use SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY as
specified in RFC 2407. You can omit this statement.
identifier idtype; is obsolete. Instead, use my_identifier.
my_identifier idtype ...; specifies the identifier sent to
the remote host and the type to use in the phase 1
negotiation. address, fqdn, user_fqdn, keyid, and asn1dn can
be used as an idtype. Use them in the following way:
my_identifier address [address]; the type is the IP address.
This is the default type if you do not specify an identifier
to use. my_identifier user_fqdn string; the type is a
USER_FQDN (user fully-qualified domain name). my_identifier
fqdn string; the type is a FQDN (fully-qualified domain
name). my_identifier keyid file; the type is a KEY_ID.
my_identifier asn1dn [string]; the type is an ASN.1
distinguished name. If string is omitted, racoon(8) will get
the DN from the Subject field in the certificate.
xauth_login [string]; specifies the login to use in
client-side Hybrid authen- tication. It is available only if
racoon(8) has been built with this option. The associated
password is looked up in the pre-shared key files, using the
login string as the key id. peers_identifier idtype ...;
specifies the peer s identifier to be received. If it is not
defined then racoon(8) will not verify the peers identifier
in ID payload transmitted from the peer. If it is defined,
the behavior of the verification depends on the flag of
verify_identifier. The usage of idtype is the same as
my_identifier except that the individual com- ponent values
of an asn1dn identifier may specified as * to match any
value (e.g. &quot;C=XX, O=MyOrg, OU=*, CN=Mine&quot;).
Alternative acceptable peer identifiers may be specified by
repeating the peers_identifier statement. verify_identifier
(on | off); If you want to verify the peers identifier, set
this to on. In this case, if the value defined by
peers_identifier is not the same as the peer s identifier in
the ID payload, the negotiation will failed. The default is
off. certificate_type certspec; specifies a certificate
specification. certspec is one of followings: x509 certfile
privkeyfile; certfile means a file name of a certificate.
privkeyfile means a file name of a secret key. ca_type
cacertspec; specifies a root certificate authority
specification. cacertspec is one of followings: x509
cacertfile; cacertfile means a file name of the root
certifi- cate authority. Default is /etc/openssl/cert.pem
mode_cfg (on | off); Gather network information through
ISAKMP mode configura- tion. Default is off. peers_certfile
(dnssec | certfile); If dnssec is defined, racoon(8) will
ignore the CERT pay- load from the peer, and try to get the
peers certificate from DNS instead. If certfile is defined,
racoon(8) will ignore the CERT payload from the peer, and
will use this certificate as the peers certificate. script
script phase1_up script script phase1_down Shell scripts
that get executed when a phase 1 SA goes up or down. Both
scripts get either phase1_up or phase1_down as first
argument, and the following vari- ables are set in their
environment: LOCAL_ADDR The local address of the phase 1 SA.
LOCAL_PORT The local port used for IKE for the phase 1 SA.
REMOTE_ADDR The remote address of the phase 1 SA.
REMOTE_PORT The remote port used for IKE for the phase 1 SA.
The following variables are only set if mode_cfg was
enabled: INTERNAL_ADDR4 An IPv4 internal address obtained by
ISAKMP mode config. INTERNAL_NETMASK4 An IPv4 internal
netmask obtained by ISAKMP mode config. INTERNAL_DNS4
Internal DNS server IPv4 address obtained by ISAKMP mode
config. INTERNAL_NBNS4 Internal WINS server IPv4 address
obtained by ISAKMP mode config. send_cert (on | off); If you
do not want to send a certificate for some reason, set this
to off. The default is on. send_cr (on | off); If you do not
want to send a certificate request for some reason, set this
to off. The default is on. verify_cert (on | off); If you do
not want to verify the peer s certificate for some reason,
set this to off. The default is on. lifetime time number
timeunit; Define a lifetime of a certain time which will be
pro- posed in the phase 1 negotiations. Any proposal will be
accepted, and the attribute(s) will be not proposed to the
peer if you do not specify it (them). They can be
individually specified in each proposal. ike_frag (on |
off); Enable receiver-side IKE fragmentation, if racoon(8)
has been built with this feature. This extension is there to
work around broken firewalls that do not work with frag-
mented UDP packets. IKE fragmentation is always enabled on
the sender-side, and it is used if the peer advertises
itself as IKE fragmentation capable. esp_frag fraglen; This
option is only relevant if you use NAT traversal in tunnel
mode. Its purpose is to work around broken DSL routers that
reject UDP fragments, by fragmenting the IP packets before
ESP encapsulation. The result is ESP over UDP of fragmented
packets instead of fragmented ESP over UDP packets (i.e.,
IP:UDP:ESP:frag(IP) instead of frag(IP:UDP:ESP:IP)). fraglen
is the maximum size of the fragments. 552 should work
anywhere, but the higher fraglen is, the better is the
performance.</p>

<p>Note that because PMTU discovery is broken on many
sites, you will have to use MSS clamping if you want TCP to
work correctly. initial_contact (on | off); enable this to
send an INITIAL-CONTACT message. The default value is on.
This message is useful only when the implementation of the
responder chooses an old SA when there are multiple SAs with
different established time, and the initiator reboots. If
racoon did not send the message, the responder would use an
old SA even when a new SA was established. The KAME stack
has the switch in the system wide value
net.key.preferred_oldsa. when the value is zero, the stack
always uses a new SA. passive (on | off); If you do not want
to initiate the negotiation, set this to on. The default
value is off. It is useful for a server. proposal_check
level; specifies the action of lifetime length and PFS of
the phase 2 selection on the responder side, and the action
of lifetime check in phase 1. The default level is strict.
If the level is: obey the responder will obey the initiator
anytime. strict If the responders length is longer than the
ini- tiator s one, the responder uses the initiators one.
Otherwise it rejects the proposal. If PFS is not required by
the responder, the responder will obey the proposal. If PFS
is required by both sides and if the responders group is not
equal to the initiator s one, then the responder will reject
the proposal. claim If the responders length is longer than
the ini- tiators one, the responder will use the initia- tor
s one. If the responders length is shorter than the
initiator s one, the responder uses its own length AND sends
a RESPONDER-LIFETIME notify message to an initiator in the
case of lifetime (phase 2 only). For PFS, this directive
behaves the same as strict. exact If the initiator s length
is not equal to the responder s one, the responder will
reject the proposal. If PFS is required by both sides and if
the responders group is not equal to the ini- tiators one,
then the responder will reject the proposal. support_proxy
(on | off); If this value is set to on, then both values of
ID pay- loads in the phase 2 exchange are always used as the
addresses of end-point of IPsec-SAs. The default is off.
generate_policy (on | off); This directive is for the
responder. Therefore you should set passive to on in order
that racoon(8) only becomes a responder. If the responder
does not have any policy in SPD during phase 2 negotiation,
and the direc- tive is set to on, then racoon(8) will choose
the first proposal in the SA payload from the initiator, and
gener- ate policy entries from the proposal. It is useful to
negotiate with clients whose IP address is allocated
dynamically. Note that an inappropriate policy might be
installed into the responder s SPD by the initiator, so
other communications might fail if such policies are
installed due to a policy mismatch between the initiator and
the responder. This directive is ignored in the ini- tiator
case. The default value is off. nat_traversal (on | off |
force); This directive enables use of the NAT-Traversal
IPsec extension (NAT-T). NAT-T allows one or both peers to
reside behind a NAT gateway (i.e., doing address- or
port-translation). Presence of NAT gateways along the path
is discovered during phase 1 handshake and if found, NAT-T
is negotiated. When NAT-T is in charge, all ESP and AH
packets of a given connection are encapsulated into UDP
datagrams (port 4500, by default). Possible values are: on
NAT-T is used when a NAT gateway is detected between the
peers. off NAT-T is not proposed/accepted. This is the
default. force NAT-T is used regardless if a NAT is detected
between the peers or not. Please note that NAT-T support is
a compile-time option. Although it is enabled in the source
distribution by default, it may not be available in your
particular build. In that case you will get a warning when
using any NAT-T related config options. dpd_delay delay;
This option activates the DPD and sets the time (in sec-
onds) allowed between 2 proof of liveness requests. The
default value is 0, which disables DPD monitoring, but still
negotiates DPD support. dpd_retry delay; If dpd_delay is
set, this sets the delay (in seconds) to wait for a proof of
liveness before considering it as failed and send another
request. The default value is 5. dpd_maxfail number; If
dpd_delay is set, this sets the maximum number of proof of
liveness to request (without reply) before con- sidering the
peer is dead. The default value is 5. nonce_size number;
define the byte size of nonce value. Racoon can send any
value although RFC2409 specifies that the value MUST be
between 8 and 256 bytes. The default size is 16 bytes.
proposal { sub-substatements } encryption_algorithm
algorithm; specify the encryption algorithm used for the
phase 1 negotiation. This directive must be defined.
algorithm is one of following: des, 3des, blowfish, cast128,
aes for Oakley. For other transforms, this statement should
not be used. hash_algorithm algorithm; define the hash
algorithm used for the phase 1 negotiation. This directive
must be defined. algorithm is one of following: md5, sha1,
sha256, sha384, sha512 for Oakley. authentication_method
type; defines the authentication method used for the phase 1
negotiation. This directive must be defined. type is one of:
pre_shared_key, rsasig, gssapi_krb, hybrid_rsa_server, or
hybrid_rsa_client. dh_group group; define the group used for
the Diffie-Hellman exponentiations. This directive must be
defined. group is one of following: modp768, modp1024,
modp1536, modp2048, modp3072, modp4096, modp6144, modp8192.
Or you can define 1, 2, 5, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18 as the DH
group number. When you want to use aggressive mode, you must
define the same DH group in each proposal. lifetime time
number timeunit; define lifetime of the phase 1 SA proposal.
Refer to the description of the lifetime direc- tive defined
in the remote directive. gss_id string; define the GSS-API
endpoint name, to be included as an attribute in the SA, if
the gssapi_krb authentication method is used. If this is not
defined, the default value of host/hostname is used, where
hostname is the value returned by the hostname(1)
command.</p>

<p>Policy Specifications The policy directive is obsolete,
policies are now in the SPD. racoon(8) will obey the policy
configured into the kernel by setkey(8), and will construct
phase 2 proposals by combining sainfo specifications in
racoon.conf, and policies in the kernel.</p>

<p>Sainfo Specifications sainfo (source_id destination_id |
anonymous) [from idtype [string]] { statements } defines the
parameters of the IKE phase 2 (IPsec-SA establish- ment).
source_id and destination_id are constructed like:</p>

<p>address address [/ prefix] [[port]] ul_proto</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>subnet address [/ prefix] [[port]] ul_proto</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>idtype string</p>

<p>It means exactly the content of ID payload. This is not
like a filter rule. For example, if you define
3ffe:501:4819::/48 as source_id. 3ffe:501:4819:1000:/64 will
not match.</p>

<p>In case of longest prefix (selecting single host)
address instructs to send ID type of ADDRESS, while subnet
instructs to send ID type of SUBNET. Otherwise these
instructions are identi- cal.</p>

<p>pfs_group group; define the group of Diffie-Hellman
exponentiations. If you do not require PFS then you can omit
this directive. Any proposal will be accepted if you do not
specify one. group is one of following: modp768, modp1024,
modp1536, modp2048, modp3072, modp4096, modp6144, modp8192.
Or you can define 1, 2, 5, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18 as the DH
group number. lifetime time number timeunit; define how long
an IPsec-SA will be used, in timeunits. Any proposal will be
accepted, and no attribute(s) will be proposed to the peer
if you do not specify it(them). See the proposal_check
directive. my_identifier idtype ...; is obsolete. It does
not make sense to specify an iden- tifier in the phase
2.</p>

<p>racoon(8) does not have a list of security protocols to
be nego- tiated. The list of security protocols are passed
by SPD in the kernel. Therefore you have to define all of
the potential algo- rithms in the phase 2 proposals even if
there are algorithms which will not be used. These
algorithms are define by using the following three
directives, with a single comma as the separator. For
algorithms that can take variable-length keys, algorithm
names can be followed by a key length, like blowfish 448.
racoon(8) will compute the actual phase 2 proposals by
computing the permutation of the specified algorithms, and
then combining them with the security protocol specified by
the SPD. For exam- ple, if des, 3des, hmac_md5, and
hmac_sha1 are specified as algo- rithms, we have four
combinations for use with ESP, and two for AH. Then, based
on the SPD settings, racoon(8) will construct the actual
proposals. If the SPD entry asks for ESP only, there will be
4 proposals. If it asks for both AH and ESP, there will be 8
proposals. Note that the kernel may not support the algo-
rithm you have specified. encryption_algorithm algorithms;
des, 3des, des_iv64, des_iv32, rc5, rc4, idea, 3idea,
cast128, blowfish, null_enc, twofish, rijndael, aes (used
with ESP) authentication_algorithm algorithms; des, 3des,
des_iv64, des_iv32, hmac_md5, hmac_sha1, hmac_sha256,
hmac_sha384, hmac_sha512, non_auth (used with ESP
authentication and AH) compression_algorithm algorithms;
deflate (used with IPComp)</p>

<p>Logging level log level; define logging level. level is
one of following: notify, debug, and debug2. The default is
notify. If you set the logging level too high on slower
machines, IKE negotiation can fail due to tim- ing
constraint changes.</p>

<p>Specifying the way to pad padding { statements }
specified padding format. The following are valid
statements: randomize (on | off); enable using a randomized
value for padding. The default is on. randomize_length (on |
off); the pad length is random. The default is off.
maximum_length number; define a maximum padding length. If
randomize_length is off, this is ignored. The default is 20
bytes. exclusive_tail (on | off); means to put the number of
pad bytes minus one into the last part of the padding. The
default is on. strict_check (on | off); means to constrain
the peer to set the number of pad bytes. The default is
off.</p>

<p>ISAKMP mode configuration settings mode_cfg { statements
} Defines the information to return for remote hosts ISAKMP
mode config requests. Also defines the authentication source
for remote peers authenticating through hybrid auth.</p>

<p>The following are valid statements: auth_source (system
| radius | pam); Specify the source for authentication of
users through hybrid auth. system means to use the Unix user
database. This is the default. radius means to use a RADIUS
server. It works only if racoon(8) was built with libra-
dius support, and the configuration is done in
radius.conf(5). pam means to use PAM. It works only if
racoon(8) was built with libpam support. conf_source (local
| radius); Specify the source for IP addresses and netmask
allocated through ISAKMP mode config. local means to use the
local IP pool defined by the network4 and pool_size
keywords. This is the default. radius means to use a RADIUS
server. It works only if racoon(8) was built with libra-
dius support, and the configuration is done in
radius.conf(5). RADIUS configuration requires RADIUS
authentication. accounting (none | radius | pam); Enable or
disable accounting for Xauth logins and logouts. Default is
none, which disable accounting. radius enable RADIUS
accounting. It works only if racoon(8) was built with
libradius support, and the con- figuration is done in
radius.conf(5). RADIUS accounting require RADIUS
authentication. pam enable PAM account- ing. It works only
if racoon(8) was built with libpam support. PAM accounting
requires PAM authentication. pool_size size Specify the size
of the IP address pool, either local or allocated through
RADIUS. conf_source selects the local pool or the RADIUS
configuration, but in both configura- tions, you cannot have
more than size users connected at the same time. The default
is 255. network4 address; netmask4 address; The local IP
pool base address and network mask from which dynamically
allocated IPv4 addresses should be taken. This is used if
conf_source is set to local or if the RADIUS server returned
255.255.255.254. Default is 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0. dns4 address;
The IPv4 address for a DNS server. nbns4 address; The IPv4
address for a WINS server. banner path; The path of a file
displayed on the client at connection time. Default is
/etc/motd. auth_throttle delay; On each failed Xauth
authentication attempt, refuse new attempts for delay more
seconds. This is to avoid dic- tionary attacks on Xauth
passwords. Default is one sec- ond. Set to zero to disable
authentication delay. pfs_group group; Sets the PFS group
used in the client proposal (Cisco VPN client only). Default
is 0. save_passwd (on | off); Allow the client to save the
Xauth password (Cisco VPN client only). Default is off.</p>

<p>Special directives complex_bundle (on | off); defines
the interpretation of proposal in the case of SA bundle.
Normally IP AH ESP IP payload is proposed as AH tunnel and
ESP tunnel . The interpretation is more common to other IKE
imple- mentations, however, it allows very limited set of
combinations for proposals. With the option enabled, it will
be proposed as AH transport and ESP tunnel. The default
value is off.</p>

<p>Pre-shared key File The pre-shared key file defines
pairs of identifiers and corresponding shared secret keys
which are used in the pre-shared key authentication method
in phase 1. The pair in each line is separated by some
number of blanks and/or tab characters like in the hosts(5)
file. Key can include blanks because everything after the
first blanks is interpreted as the secret key. Lines
starting with # are ignored. Keys which start with 0x are
interpreted as hexadecimal strings. Note that the file must
be owned by the user ID running racoon(8) (usually the
privileged user), and must not be accessible by others.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following shows how the remote directive
should be configured.</p>

<p>path pre_shared_key
&quot;/usr/local/v6/etc/psk.txt&quot; ; remote anonymous {
exchange_mode aggressive,main,base; lifetime time 24 hour;
proposal { encryption_algorithm 3des; hash_algorithm sha1;
authentication_method pre_shared_key; dh_group 2; } }</p>

<p>sainfo anonymous { pfs_group 2; lifetime time 12 hour ;
encryption_algorithm 3des, blowfish 448, twofish, rijndael ;
authentication_algorithm hmac_sha1, hmac_md5 ;
compression_algorithm deflate ; }</p>

<p>The following is a sample for the pre-shared key
file.</p>
