<p>NAME soxexam - SoX Examples (CHEAT SHEET)</p>

<p>CONVERSIONS Introduction</p>

<p>In general, SoX will attempt to take an input sound file
format and convert it into a new file format using a similar
data type and sample rate. For instance, &quot;sox monkey.au
monkey.wav&quot; would try and convert the mono 8000Hz u-law
sample .au file that comes with SoX to a 8000Hz u-law .wav
file.</p>

<p>If an output format doesnt support the same data type as
the input file then SoX will generally select a default data
type to save it in. You can override the default data type
selection by using command line options. This is also useful
for producing an output file with higher or lower precision
data and/or sample rate.</p>

<p>Most file formats that contain headers can automatically
be read in. When working with header-less file formats then
a user must manually tell SoX the data type and sample rate
using command line options.</p>

<p>When working with header-less files (raw files), you may
take advantage of the pseudo-file types of .ub, .uw, .sb,
.sw, .ul, and .sl. By using these extensions on your
filenames you will not have to specify the corresponding
options on the command line.</p>

<p>Precision</p>

<p>The following data types and formats can be represented
by their total uncompressed bit precision. When converting
from one data type to another care must be taken to insure
it has an equal or greater preci- sion. If not then the
audio quality will be degraded. This is not always a bad
thing when your working with things such as voice audio and
are concerned about disk space or bandwidth of the audio
data.</p>

<p>Data Format Precision ___________ _________ unsigned
byte 8-bit signed byte 8-bit u-law 14-bit A-law 13-bit
unsigned word 16-bit signed word 16-bit ADPCM 16-bit GSM
16-bit unsigned long 32-bit signed long 32-bit ___________
_________</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p>Use the -V option on all your command lines. It makes
SoX print out its idea of what is going on. -V is your
friend.</p>

<p>To convert from unsigned bytes at 8000 Hz to signed
words at 8000 Hz:</p>

<p>sox -r 8000 -c 1 filename.ub newfile.sw</p>

<p>To convert from Apples AIFF format to Microsoft s WAV
format:</p>

<p>sox filename.aiff filename.wav</p>

<p>To convert from mono raw 8000 Hz 8-bit unsigned PCM data
to a WAV file:</p>

<p>sox -r 8000 -u -b -c 1 filename.raw filename.wav</p>

<p>SoX may even be used to convert sample rates.
Downconverting will reduce the bandwidth of a sample, but
will reduce storage space on your disk. All such conversions
are lossy and will introduce some noise. You should really
pass your sample through a low pass filter prior to
downconverting as this will prevent alias signals (which
would sound like additional noise). For example to convert
from a sample recorded at 11025 Hz to a u-law file at 8000
Hz sample rate:</p>

<p>sox infile.wav -t au -r 8000 -U -b -c 1
outputfile.au</p>

<p>To add a low-pass filter (note use of stdout for output
of the first stage and stdin for input on the second
stage):</p>

<p>sox infile.wav -t raw -s -w -c 1 - lowpass 3700 | sox -t
raw -r 11025 -s -w -c 1 - -t au -r 8000 -U -b -c 1
ofile.au</p>

<p>If you hear some clicks and pops when converting to
u-law or A-law, reduce the output level slightly, for
example this will decrease it by 20%:</p>

<p>sox infile.wav -t au -r 8000 -U -b -c 1 -v .8
outputfile.au</p>

<p>SoX is great to use along with other command line
programs by passing data between the programs using
pipelines. The most common example is to use mpg123 to
convert mp3 files in to wav files. The following com- mand
line will do this:</p>

<p>mpg123 -b 10000 -s filename.mp3 | sox -t raw -r 44100 -s
-w -c 2 - filename.wav</p>

<p>When working with totally unknown audio data then the
&quot;auto&quot; file for- mat may be of use. It attempts to
guess what the file type is and then you may save it into a
known audio format.</p>

<p>sox -V -t auto filename.snd filename.wav</p>

<p>It is important to understand how the internals of SoX
work with com- pressed audio including u-law, A-law, ADPCM,
or GSM. SoX takes ALL input data types and converts them to
uncompressed 32-bit signed data. It will then convert this
internal version into the requested output format. This
means additional noise can be introduced from decompress-
ing data and then recompressing. If applying multiple
effects to audio data, it is best to save the intermediate
data as PCM data. After the final effect is performed, then
you can specify it as a compressed out- put format. This
will keep noise introduction to a minimum.</p>

<p>The following example applies various effects to an 8000
Hz ADPCM input file and then end up with the final file as
44100 Hz ADPCM.</p>

<p>sox firstfile.wav -r 44100 -s -w secondfile.wav sox
secondfile.wav thirdfile.wav swap sox thirdfile.wav -a -b
finalfile.wav mask</p>

<p>Under a DOS shell, you can convert several audio files
to an new output format using something similar to the
following command line:</p>

<p>FOR %X IN (*.RAW) DO sox -r 11025 -w -s -t raw $X
$X.wav</p>

<p>EFFECTS Special thanks goes to Juergen Mueller
(jmeuller@uia.au.ac.be) for this write up on effects.</p>

<p>Introduction:</p>

<p>The core problem is that you need some experience in
using effects in order to say &quot;that any old sound file
sounds with effects absolutely hip&quot;. There isnt any
rule-based system which tell you the correct set- ting of
all the parameters for every effect. But after some time you
will become an expert in using effects.</p>

<p>Here are some examples which can be used with any music
sample. (For a sample where only a single instrument is
playing, extreme parameter setting may make well-known
&quot;typically&quot; or &quot;classical&quot; sounds. Like-
wise, for drums, vocals or guitars.)</p>

<p>Single effects will be explained and some given
parameter settings that can be used to understand the theory
by listening to the sound file with the added effect.</p>

<p>Using multiple effects in parallel or in series can
result either in a very nice sound or (mostly) in a dramatic
overloading in variations of sounds such that your ear may
follow the sound but you will feel unsat- isfied. Hence, for
the first time using effects try to compose them as
minimally as possible. We dont regard the composition of
effects in the examples because too many combinations are
possible and you really need a very fast machine and a lot
of memory to play them in real-time.</p>

<p>However, real-time playing of sounds will greatly speed
up learning and/or tuning the parameter settings for your
sounds in order to get that &quot;perfect&quot; effect.</p>

<p>Basically, we will use the &quot;play&quot; front-end of
SoX since it is easier to listen sounds coming out of the
speaker or earphone instead of look- ing at cryptic data in
sound files.</p>

<p>For easy listening of file.xxx (&quot;xxx&quot; is any
sound format):</p>

<p>play file.xxx effect-name effect-parameters</p>

<p>Or more SoX-like (for &quot;dsp&quot; output on a
UNIX/Linux computer):</p>

<p>sox file.xxx -t ossdsp -w -s /dev/dsp effect-name
effect-parame- ters</p>

<p>or (for &quot;au&quot; output):</p>

<p>sox file.xxx -t sunau -w -s /dev/audio effect-name
effect-parame- ters</p>

<p>And for date freaks:</p>

<p>sox file.xxx file.yyy effect-name effect-parameters</p>

<p>Additional options can be used. However, in this case,
for real-time playing youll need a very fast machine.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>I played all examples in real-time on a Pentium 100 with
32 MB and Linux 2.0.30 using a self-recorded sample ( 3:15
min long in &quot;wav&quot; for- mat with 44.1 kHz sample
rate and stereo 16 bit ). The sample should not contain any
of the effects. However, if you take any recording of a
sound track from radio or tape or CD, and it sounds like a
live concert or ten people are playing the same rhythm with
their drums or funky- grooves, then take any other sample.
(Typically, less then four dif- ferent instruments and no
synthesizer in the sample is suitable. Like- wise, the
combination vocal, drums, bass and guitar.)</p>

<p>Effects:</p>

<p>Echo</p>

<p>An echo effect can be naturally found in the mountains,
standing some- where on a mountain and shouting a single
word will result in one or more repetitions of the word (if
not, turn a bit around and try again, or climb to the next
mountain).</p>

<p>However, the time difference between shouting and
repeating is the delay (time), its loudness is the decay.
Multiple echos can have dif- ferent delays and decays.</p>

<p>It is very popular to use echos to play an instrument
with itself together, like some guitar players (Brain May
from Queen) or vocalists are doing. For music samples of
more than one instrument, echo can be used to add a second
sample shortly after the original one.</p>

<p>This will sound as if you are doubling the number of
instruments play- ing in the same sample:</p>

<p>play file.xxx echo 0.8 0.88 60.0 0.4</p>

<p>If the delay is very short, then it sound like a
(metallic) robot play- ing music:</p>

<p>play file.xxx echo 0.8 0.88 6.0 0.4</p>

<p>Longer delay will sound like an open air concert in the
mountains:</p>

<p>play file.xxx echo 0.8 0.9 1000.0 0.3</p>

<p>One mountain more, and:</p>

<p>play file.xxx echo 0.8 0.9 1000.0 0.3 1800.0 0.25</p>

<p>Echos</p>

<p>Like the echo effect, echos stand for &quot;ECHO in
Sequel&quot;, that is the first echos takes the input, the
second the input and the first echos, the third the input
and the first and the second echos, ... and so on. Care
should be taken using many echos (see introduction); a
single echos has the same effect as a single echo.</p>

<p>The sample will be bounced twice in symmetric echos:</p>

<p>play file.xxx echos 0.8 0.7 700.0 0.25 700.0 0.3</p>

<p>The sample will be bounced twice in asymmetric
echos:</p>

<p>play file.xxx echos 0.8 0.7 700.0 0.25 900.0 0.3</p>

<p>The sample will sound as if played in a garage:</p>

<p>play file.xxx echos 0.8 0.7 40.0 0.25 63.0 0.3</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>The chorus effect has its name because it will often be
used to make a single vocal sound like a chorus. But it can
be applied to other instrument samples too.</p>

<p>It works like the echo effect with a short delay, but
the delay isnt constant. The delay is varied using a
sinusoidal or triangular modula- tion. The modulation depth
defines the range the modulated delay is played before or
after the delay. Hence the delayed sound will sound slower
or faster, that is the delayed sound tuned around the
original one, like in a chorus where some vocals are a bit
out of tune.</p>

<p>The typical delay is around 40ms to 60ms, the speed of
the modulation is best near 0.25Hz and the modulation depth
around 2ms.</p>

<p>A single delay will make the sample more overloaded:</p>

<p>play file.xxx chorus 0.7 0.9 55.0 0.4 0.25 2.0 -t</p>

<p>Two delays of the original samples sound like this:</p>

<p>play file.xxx chorus 0.6 0.9 50.0 0.4 0.25 2.0 -t 60.0
0.32 0.4 1.3 -s</p>

<p>A big chorus of the sample is (three additional
samples):</p>

<p>play file.xxx chorus 0.5 0.9 50.0 0.4 0.25 2.0 -t 60.0
0.32 0.4 2.3 -t 40.0 0.3 0.3 1.3 -s</p>

<p>Flanger</p>

<p>The flanger effect is like the chorus effect, but the
delay varies between 0ms and maximal 5ms. It sound like wind
blowing, sometimes faster or slower including changes of the
speed.</p>

<p>The flanger effect is widely used in funk and soul
music, where the guitar sound varies frequently slow or a
bit faster.</p>

<p>The typical delay is around 3ms to 5ms, the speed of the
modulation is best near 0.5Hz.</p>

<p>Now, lets groove the sample:</p>

<p>play file.xxx flanger 0.6 0.87 3.0 0.9 0.5 -s</p>

<p>listen carefully between the difference of sinusoidal
and triangular modulation:</p>

<p>play file.xxx flanger 0.6 0.87 3.0 0.9 0.5 -t</p>

<p>If the decay is a bit lower, than the effect sounds more
popular:</p>

<p>play file.xxx flanger 0.8 0.88 3.0 0.4 0.5 -t</p>

<p>The drunken loudspeaker system:</p>

<p>play file.xxx flanger 0.9 0.9 4.0 0.23 1.3 -s</p>

<p>Reverb</p>

<p>The reverb effect is often used in audience hall which
are to small or contain too many many visitors which disturb
(dampen) the reflection of sound at the walls. Reverb will
make the sound be perceived as if it were in a large hall.
You can try the reverb effect in your bathroom or garage or
sport halls by shouting loud some words. Youll hear the
words reflected from the walls.</p>

<p>The biggest problem in using the reverb effect is the
correct setting of the (wall) delays such that the sound is
realistic and doesnt sound like music playing in a tin can
or has overloaded feedback which destroys any illusion of
playing in a big hall. To help you obtain realistic reverb
effects, you should decide first how long the reverb should
take place until it is not loud enough to be registered by
your ears. This is be done by varying the reverb time
&quot;t&quot;. To simulate small halls, use 200ms. To
simulate large halls, use 1000ms. Clearly, the walls of such
a hall arent far away, so you should define its set- ting be
given every wall its delay time. However, if the wall is to
far away for the reverb time, you wont hear the reverb, so
the nearest wall will be best at &quot;t/4&quot; delay and
the farthest at &quot;t/2&quot;. You can try other distances
as well, but it wont sound very realistic. The walls
shouldnt stand to close to each other and not in a multiple
integer distance to each other ( so avoid wall like: 200.0
and 202.0, or some- thing like 100.0 and 200.0 ).</p>

<p>Since audience halls do have a lot of walls, we will
start designing one beginning with one wall:</p>

<p>play file.xxx reverb 1.0 600.0 180.0</p>

<p>One wall more:</p>

<p>play file.xxx reverb 1.0 600.0 180.0 200.0</p>

<p>Next two walls:</p>

<p>play file.xxx reverb 1.0 600.0 180.0 200.0 220.0
240.0</p>

<p>Now, why not a futuristic hall with six walls:</p>

<p>play file.xxx reverb 1.0 600.0 180.0 200.0 220.0 240.0
280.0 300.0</p>

<p>If you run out of machine power or memory, then stop as
many applica- tions as possible (every interrupt will
consume a lot of CPU time which for bigger halls is
absolutely necessary).</p>

<p>Phaser</p>

<p>The phaser effect is like the flanger effect, but it
uses a reverb instead of an echo and does phase shifting.
Youll hear the difference in the examples comparing both
effects (simply change the effect name). The delay
modulation can be sinusoidal or triangular, preferable is
the later for multiple instruments. For single instrument
sounds, the sinu- soidal phaser effect will give a sharper
phasing effect. The decay shouldn t be to close to 1.0 which
will cause dramatic feedback. A good range is about 0.5 to
0.1 for the decay.</p>

<p>We will take a parameter setting as for the flanger
before (gain-out is lower since feedback can raise the
output dramatically):</p>

<p>play file.xxx phaser 0.8 0.74 3.0 0.4 0.5 -t</p>

<p>The drunken loudspeaker system (now less alcohol):</p>

<p>play file.xxx phaser 0.9 0.85 4.0 0.23 1.3 -s</p>

<p>A popular sound of the sample is as follows:</p>

<p>play file.xxx phaser 0.89 0.85 1.0 0.24 2.0 -t</p>

<p>The sample sounds if ten springs are in your ears:</p>

<p>play file.xxx phaser 0.6 0.66 3.0 0.6 2.0 -t</p>

<p>Compander</p>

<p>The compander effect allows the dynamic range of a
signal to be com- pressed or expanded. For most situations,
the attack time (response to the music getting louder)
should be shorter than the decay time because our ears are
more sensitive to suddenly loud music than to suddenly soft
music.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you are listening to Strauss
&quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; in a noisy environment
such as a car. If you turn up the volume enough to hear the
soft passages over the road noise, the loud sections will be
too loud. You could try this:</p>

<p>play file.xxx compand 0.3,1 -90,-90,-70,-70,-60,-20,0,0
-5 0 0.2</p>

<p>The transfer function (&quot;-90,...&quot;) says that
very soft sounds between -90 and -70 decibels (-90 is about
the limit of 16-bit encoding) will remain unchanged. That
keeps the compander from boosting the volume on
&quot;silent&quot; passages such as between movements.
However, sounds in the range -60 decibels to 0 decibels
(maximum volume) will be boosted so that the 60-dB dynamic
range of the original music will be compressed 3-to-1 into a
20-dB range, which is wide enough to enjoy the music but
narrow enough to get around the road noise. The -5 dB output
gain is needed to avoid clipping (the number is inexact, and
was derived by experimentation). The 0 for the initial
volume will work fine for a clip that starts with a bit of
silence, and the delay of 0.2 has the effect of causing the
compander to react a bit more quickly to sudden volume
changes.</p>

<p>Changing the Rate of Playback</p>

<p>You can use stretch to change the rate of playback of an
audio sample while preserving the pitch. For example to play
at 1/2 the speed:</p>

<p>play file.wav stretch 2</p>

<p>To play a file at twice the speed:</p>

<p>play file.wav stretch .5</p>

<p>Other related options are &quot;speed&quot; to change
the speed of play (and changing the pitch accordingly), and
pitch, to alter the pitch of a sample. For example to speed
a sample so it plays in 1/2 the time (for those Mickey Mouse
voices):</p>

<p>play file.wav speed 2</p>

<p>To raise the pitch of a sample 1 while note (100
cents):</p>

<p>play file.wav pitch 100</p>

<p>Reducing noise in a recording</p>

<p>First find a period of silence in your recording, such
as the beginning or end of a piece. If the first 1.5 seconds
of the recording are silent, do</p>

<p>sox file.wav -t nul /dev/null trim 0 1.5 noiseprof
/tmp/profile</p>

<p>Next, use the noisered effect to actually reduce the
noise:</p>

<p>play file.wav noisered /tmp/profile</p>

<p>Other effects (copy, rate, avg, stat, vibro, lowp,
highp, band, reverb)</p>

<p>The other effects are simple to use. However, an
&quot;easy to use manual&quot; should be given here.</p>

<p>More effects (to do !)</p>

<p>There are a lot of effects around like noise gates,
compressors, waw- waw, stereo effects and so on. They should
be implemented, making SoX more useful in sound mixing
techniques coming together with a great variety of different
sound effects.</p>

<p>Combining effects by using them in parallel or serially
on different channels needs some easy mechanism which is
stable for use in real- time.</p>

<p>Really missing are the the changing of the parameters
and start- ing/stopping of effects while playing samples in
real-time!</p>

<p>Good luck and have fun with all the effects!</p>
