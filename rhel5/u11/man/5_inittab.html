<p>INITTAB(5) Linux System Administrator s Manual
INITTAB(5)</p>

<p>NAME inittab - format of the inittab file used by the
sysv-compatible init process</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The inittab file describes which processes
are started at bootup and during normal operation (e.g.
/etc/init.d/boot, /etc/init.d/rc, get- tys...). Init(8)
distinguishes multiple runlevels, each of which can have its
own set of processes that are started. Valid runlevels are
0-6 plus A, B, and C for ondemand entries. An entry in the
inittab file has the following format:</p>

<p>id:runlevels:action:process</p>

<p>Lines beginning with # are ignored.</p>

<p>id is a unique sequence of 1-4 characters which
identifies an entry in inittab (for versions of sysvinit
compiled with the old libc5 (&lt; 5.2.18) or a.out libraries
the limit is 2 characters).</p>

<p>Note: traditionally, for getty and other login
processes, the value of the id field is kept the same as the
suffix of the cor- responding tty, e.g. 1 for tty1. Some
ancient login accounting programs might expect this, though
I cant think of any.</p>

<p>runlevels lists the runlevels for which the specified
action should be taken.</p>

<p>action describes which action should be taken.</p>

<p>process specifies the process to be executed. If the
process field starts with a + character, init will not do
utmp and wtmp accounting for that process. This is needed
for gettys that insist on doing their own utmp/wtmp
housekeeping. This is also a historic bug.</p>

<p>The runlevels field may contain multiple characters for
different run- levels. For example, 123 specifies that the
process should be started in runlevels 1, 2, and 3. The
runlevels for ondemand entries may con- tain an A, B, or C.
The runlevels field of sysinit, boot, and bootwait entries
are ignored.</p>

<p>When the system runlevel is changed, any running
processes that are not specified for the new runlevel are
killed, first with SIGTERM, then with SIGKILL.</p>

<p>Valid actions for the action field are:</p>

<p>respawn The process will be restarted whenever it
terminates (e.g. getty).</p>

<p>wait The process will be started once when the specified
runlevel is entered and init will wait for its
termination.</p>

<p>once The process will be executed once when the
specified runlevel is entered.</p>

<p>boot The process will be executed during system boot.
The runlevels field is ignored.</p>

<p>bootwait The process will be executed during system
boot, while init waits for its termination (e.g. /etc/rc).
The runlevels field is ignored.</p>

<p>off This does nothing.</p>

<p>ondemand A process marked with an ondemand runlevel will
be executed whenever the specified ondemand runlevel is
called. However, no runlevel change will occur (ondemand
runlevels are a, b, and c).</p>

<p>initdefault An initdefault entry specifies the runlevel
which should be entered after system boot. If none exists,
init will ask for a runlevel on the console. The process
field is ignored.</p>

<p>sysinit The process will be executed during system boot.
It will be exe- cuted before any boot or bootwait entries.
The runlevels field is ignored.</p>

<p>powerwait The process will be executed when the power
goes down. Init is usually informed about this by a process
talking to a UPS con- nected to the computer. Init will wait
for the process to fin- ish before continuing.</p>

<p>powerfail As for powerwait, except that init does not
wait for the pro- cesss completion.</p>

<p>powerokwait This process will be executed as soon as
init is informormed that the power has been restored.</p>

<p>powerfailnow This process will be executed when init is
told that the battery of the external UPS is almost empty
and the power is failing (provided that the external UPS and
the monitoring process are able to detect this
condition).</p>

<p>ctrlaltdel The process will be executed when init
receives the SIGINT sig- nal. This means that someone on the
system console has pressed the CTRL-ALT-DEL key combination.
Typically one wants to execute some sort of shutdown either
to get into single-user level or to reboot the machine.</p>

<p>kbrequest The process will be executed when init
receives a signal from the keyboard handler that a special
key combination was pressed on the console keyboard.</p>

<p>The documentation for this function is not complete yet;
more documentation can be found in the kbd-x.xx packages
(most recent was kbd-0.94 at the time of this writing).
Basically you want to map some keyboard combination to the
&quot;KeyboardSignal&quot; action. For example, to map
Alt-Uparrow for this purpose use the follow- ing in your
keymaps file:</p>

<p>alt keycode 103 = KeyboardSignal</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This is an example of a inittab which resembles
the old Linux inittab:</p>

<p># inittab for linux id:1:initdefault:
rc::bootwait:/etc/rc 1:1:respawn:/etc/getty 9600 tty1
2:1:respawn:/etc/getty 9600 tty2 3:1:respawn:/etc/getty 9600
tty3 4:1:respawn:/etc/getty 9600 tty4</p>

<p>This inittab file executes /etc/rc during boot and
starts gettys on tty1-tty4.</p>

<p>A more elaborate inittab with different runlevels (see
the comments inside):</p>

<p># Level to run in id:2:initdefault:</p>

<p># Boot-time system configuration/initialization script.
si::sysinit:/etc/rc.sysinit</p>

<p># What to do in single-user mode.
~:S:wait:/sbin/sulogin</p>

<p># /etc/init.d executes the S and K scripts upon change #
of runlevel. # # Runlevel 0 is halt. # Runlevel 1 is
single-user. # Runlevels 2-5 are multi-user. # Runlevel 6 is
reboot.</p>

<p>l0:0:wait:/etc/rc 0 l1:1:wait:/etc/rc 1
l2:2:wait:/etc/rc 2 l3:3:wait:/etc/rc 3 l4:4:wait:/etc/rc 4
l5:5:wait:/etc/rc 5 l6:6:wait:/etc/rc 6</p>

<p># What to do at the &quot;3 finger salute&quot;.
ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -r now</p>

<p># Runlevel 2,3: getty on virtual consoles # Runlevel 3:
mgetty on terminal (ttyS0) and modem (ttyS1)
1:23:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty1 2:23:respawn:/sbin/mingetty
tty2 3:23:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty3
4:23:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty4 S0:3:respawn:/sbin/agetty
ttyS0 9600 vt100-nav S1:3:respawn:/sbin/mgetty -x0 -D
ttyS1</p>
