<p>lsusb(8) Linux USB Utilities lsusb(8)</p>

<p>NAME lsusb - list USB devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lsusb [ options ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lsusb is a utility for displaying
information about USB buses in the system and the devices
connected to them.</p>

<p>To make use of all the features of this program, you
need to have a Linux kernel which supports the /proc/bus/usb
interface (e.g., Linux kernel 2.3.15 or newer).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v, --verbose Tells lsusb to be verbose and
display detailed information about the devices shown. This
includes configuration descriptors for the devices current
speed. Class descriptors will be shown, when available, for
USB device classes including hub, audio, HID,
communications, and chipcard.</p>

<p>-s [[bus]:][devnum] Show only devices in specified bus
and/or devnum. Both IDs are given in decimal and may be
omitted.</p>

<p>-d [vendor]:[product] Show only devices with the
specified vendor and product ID. Both IDs are given in
hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-D device Do not scan the /proc/bus/usb directory,
instead display only information about the device whose
device file is given. The device file should be something
like /proc/bus/usb/001/001. This option displays detailed
information like the v option; you must be root to do
this.</p>

<p>-t Tells lsusb to dump the physical USB device hierarchy
as a tree.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print version information on standard
output, then exit suc- cessfully.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS cannot open /proc/bus/usb/nnn/nnn,
Permission denied (13) To get detailed information, lsusb
must open the files in /proc/bus/usb in read-write mode. You
must be root in order to do this.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the specified device is not found, a
non-zero exit code is returned.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/usb.ids A list of all known USB IDs
(vendors, products, classes, sub- classes and
protocols).</p>

<p>/proc/bus/usb An interface to USB devices provided by
the post-2.3.15 Linux kernels. Contains per-bus
subdirectories with per-device files and a devices file
displaying some of the descriptors for each USB device. This
interface is also support by some 2.2 Linux kernels.</p>
