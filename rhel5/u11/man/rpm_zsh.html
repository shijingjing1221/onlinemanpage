<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) ZSH(1) ZSH(1)</p>

<p>NAME zsh - the Z shell</p>

<p>OVERVIEW Because zsh contains many features, the zsh
manual has been split into a number of sections:</p>

<p>zsh Zsh overview (this section) zshmisc Anything not
fitting into the other sections zshexpn Zsh command and
parameter expansion zshparam Zsh parameters zshoptions Zsh
options zshbuiltins Zsh built-in functions zshzle Zsh
command line editing zshcompwid Zsh completion widgets
zshcompsys Zsh completion system zshcompctl Zsh completion
control zshmodules Zsh loadable modules zshzftpsys Zsh
built-in FTP client zshall Meta-man page containing all of
the above</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell)
usable as an interactive login shell and as a shell script
command processor. Of the standard shells, zsh most closely
resembles ksh but includes many enhancements. Zsh has
command line editing, builtin spelling correction,
programmable command completion, shell functions (with
autoloading), a history mech- anism, and a host of other

<p>AUTHOR Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad
&lt;pf@zsh.org&gt;. Zsh is now maintained by the members of
the zsh-workers mailing list &lt;zsh-work-
ers@sunsite.dk&gt;. The development is currently coordinated
by Peter Stephenson &lt;pws@zsh.org&gt;. The coordinator can
be contacted at &lt;coordi- nator@zsh.org&gt;, but matters
relating to the code should generally go to the mailing
list.</p>

<p>The mailing lists are archived; the archives can be
accessed via the administrative addresses listed above.
There is also a hypertext archive, maintained by Geoff Wing
&lt;gcw@zsh.org&gt;, available at
http://www.zsh.org/mla/.</p>

<p>THE ZSH FAQ Zsh has a list of Frequently Asked Questions
(FAQ), maintained by Peter Stephenson &lt;pws@zsh.org&gt;.
It is regularly posted to the newsgroup comp.unix.shell and
the zsh-announce mailing list. The latest version can be
found at any of the Zsh FTP sites, or at
http://www.zsh.org/FAQ/. The contact address for FAQ-related
matters is &lt;faqmaster@zsh.org&gt;.</p>

<p>THE ZSH WEB PAGE Zsh has a web page which is located at
http://www.zsh.org/. This is maintained by Karsten Thygesen
&lt;karthy@zsh.org&gt;, of SunSITE Denmark. The contact
address for web-related matters is
&lt;webmaster@zsh.org&gt;.</p>

<p>THE ZSH USERGUIDE A userguide is currently in
preparation. It is intended to complement the manual, with
explanations and hints on issues where the manual can be
cabbalistic, hierographic, or downright mystifying (for
example, the word hierographic does not exist). It can be
viewed in its current state at http://zsh.sunsite.dk/Guide/.
At the time of writing, chap- ters dealing with startup
files and their contents and the new comple- tion system
were essentially complete.</p>

<p>THE ZSH WIKI A wiki website for zsh has been created at
http://www.zshwiki.org/. This is a site which can be added
to and modified directly by users without any special
permission. You can add your own zsh tips and con-
figurations.</p>

<p>INVOCATION OPTIONS The following flags are interpreted
by the shell when invoked to deter- mine where the shell
will read commands from:</p>

<p>-c Take the first argument as a command to execute,
rather than reading commands from a script or standard
input. If any fur- ther arguments are given, the first one
is assigned to $0, rather than being used as a positional
parameter.</p>

<p>-i Force shell to be interactive.</p>

<p>-s Force shell to read commands from the standard input.
If the -s flag is not present and an argument is given, the
first argument is taken to be the pathname of a script to
execute.</p>

<p>After the first one or two arguments have been
appropriated as described above, the remaining arguments are
assigned to the positional parameters.</p>

<p>For further options, which are common to invocation and
the set builtin, see zshoptions(1).</p>

<p>Options may be specified by name using the -o option. -o
acts like a single-letter option, but takes a following
string as the option name. For example,</p>

<p>zsh -x -o shwordsplit scr</p>

<p>runs the script scr, setting the XTRACE option by the
corresponding letter -x and the SH_WORD_SPLIT option by
name. Options may be turned off by name by using +o instead
of -o. -o can be stacked up with preceding single-letter
options, so for example -xo shwordsplit or -xoshwordsplit is
equivalent to -x -o shwordsplit.</p>

<p>Options may also be specified by name in GNU long option
style, --option-name. When this is done, - characters in the
option name are permitted: they are translated into _, and
thus ignored. So, for example, zsh --sh-word-split invokes
zsh with the SH_WORD_SPLIT option turned on. Like other
option syntaxes, options can be turned off by replacing the
initial - with a + ; thus +-sh-word-split is equivalent to
--no-sh-word-split. Unlike other option syntaxes, GNU-style
long options cannot be stacked with any other options, so
for example -x-shwordsplit is an error, rather than being
treated like -x --shwordsplit.</p>

<p>The special GNU-style option --version is handled; it
sends to stan- dard output the shells version information,
then exits successfully. --help is also handled; it sends to
standard output a list of options that can be used when
invoking the shell, then exits successfully.</p>

<p>Option processing may be finished, allowing following
arguments that start with - or + to be treated as normal
arguments, in two ways. Firstly, a lone - (or +) as an
argument by itself ends option pro- cessing. Secondly, a
special option -- (or +-), which may be spec- ified on its
own (which is the standard POSIX usage) or may be stacked
with preceding options (so -x- is equivalent to -x --).
Options are not permitted to be stacked after -- (so -x-f is
an error), but note the GNU-style option form discussed
above, where --shwordsplit is permitted and does not end
option processing.</p>

<p>Except when the sh/ksh emulation single-letter options
are in effect, the option -b (or +b) ends option processing.
-b is like --, except that further single-letter options can
be stacked after the -b and will take effect as normal.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY Zsh tries to emulate sh or ksh when it is
invoked as sh or ksh respec- tively; more precisely, it
looks at the first letter of the name by which it was
invoked, excluding any initial r (assumed to stand for
restricted), and if that is s or k it will emulate sh or
ksh. Furthermore, if invoked as su (which happens on certain
systems when the shell is executed by the su command), the
shell will try to find an alternative name from the SHELL
environment variable and perform emula- tion based on
that.</p>

<p>In sh and ksh compatibility modes the following
parameters are not spe- cial and not initialized by the
shell: ARGC, argv, cdpath, fignore, fpath, HISTCHARS,
mailpath, MANPATH, manpath, path, prompt, PROMPT, PROMPT2,
PROMPT3, PROMPT4, psvar, status, watch.</p>

<p>The usual zsh startup/shutdown scripts are not executed.
Login shells source /etc/profile followed by $HOME/.profile.
If the ENV environment variable is set on invocation, $ENV
is sourced after the profile scripts. The value of ENV is
subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and
arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a pathname.
Note that the PRIVILEGED option also affects the execution
of startup files.</p>

<p>The following options are set if the shell is invoked as
sh or ksh: NO_BAD_PATTERN, NO_BANG_HIST, NO_BG_NICE,
NO_EQUALS, NO_FUNC- TION_ARGZERO, GLOB_SUBST,
NO_GLOBAL_EXPORT, NO_HUP, INTERACTIVE_COM- MENTS,
KSH_ARRAYS, NO_MULTIOS, NO_NOMATCH, NO_NOTIFY,
POSIX_BUILTINS, NO_PROMPT_PERCENT, RM_STAR_SILENT,
SH_FILE_EXPANSION, SH_GLOB, SH_OPTION_LETTERS,
SH_WORD_SPLIT. Additionally the BSD_ECHO and IGNORE_BRACES
options are set if zsh is invoked as sh. Also, the
KSH_OPTION_PRINT, LOCAL_OPTIONS, PROMPT_BANG, PROMPT_SUBST
and SIN- GLE_LINE_ZLE options are set if zsh is invoked as
ksh.</p>

<p>RESTRICTED SHELL When the basename of the command used
to invoke zsh starts with the letter r or the -r command
line option is supplied at invocation, the shell becomes
restricted. Emulation mode is determined after stripping the
letter r from the invocation name. The following are
disabled in restricted mode:</p>

<p>&middot; changing directories with the cd builtin</p>

<p>&middot; changing or unsetting the PATH, path,
MODULE_PATH, module_path, SHELL, HISTFILE, HISTSIZE, GID,
EGID, UID, EUID, USERNAME, LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
LD_AOUT_LIBRARY_PATH, LD_PRELOAD and LD_AOUT_PRELOAD
parameters</p>

<p>&middot; specifying command names containing /</p>

<p>&middot; specifying command pathnames using hash</p>

<p>&middot; redirecting output to files</p>

<p>&middot; using the exec builtin command to replace the
shell with another command</p>

<p>&middot; using jobs -Z to overwrite the shell process
argument and envi- ronment space</p>

<p>&middot; using the ARGV0 parameter to override argv[0]
for external com- mands</p>

<p>&middot; turning off restricted mode with set +r or
unsetopt RESTRICTED</p>

<p>These restrictions are enforced after processing the
startup files. The startup files should set up PATH to point
to a directory of com- mands which can be safely invoked in
the restricted environment. They may also add further
restrictions by disabling selected builtins.</p>

<p>Restricted mode can also be activated any time by
setting the RESTRICTED option. This immediately enables all
the restrictions described above even if the shell still has
not processed all startup files.</p>

<p>STARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES Commands are first read from
/etc/zshenv; this cannot be overridden. Subsequent behaviour
is modified by the RCS and GLOBAL_RCS options; the former
affects all startup files, while the second only affects
those in the /etc directory. If one of the options is unset
at any point, any subsequent startup file(s) of the
corresponding type will not be read. It is also possible for
a file in $ZDOTDIR to re-enable GLOBAL_RCS. Both RCS and
GLOBAL_RCS are set by default.</p>

<p>Commands are then read from $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv. If the
shell is a login shell, commands are read from /etc/zprofile
and then $ZDOTDIR/.zpro- file. Then, if the shell is
interactive, commands are read from /etc/zshrc and then
$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc. Finally, if the shell is a login shell,
/etc/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are read.</p>

<p>When a login shell exits, the files $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout
and then /etc/zlogout are read. This happens with either an
explicit exit via the exit or logout commands, or an
implicit exit by reading end-of-file from the terminal.
However, if the shell terminates due to execing another
process, the logout files are not read. These are also
affected by the RCS and GLOBAL_RCS options. Note also that
the RCS option affects the saving of history files, i.e. if
RCS is unset when the shell exits, no history file will be
saved.</p>

<p>If ZDOTDIR is unset, HOME is used instead. Those files
listed above as being in /etc may be in another directory,
depending on the installa- tion.</p>

<p>As /etc/zshenv is run for all instances of zsh, it is
important that it be kept as small as possible. In
particular, it is a good idea to put code that does not need
to be run for every single shell behind a test of the form
if [[ -o rcs ]]; then ... so that it will not be executed
when zsh is invoked with the -f option.</p>

<p>Any of these files may be pre-compiled with the zcompile
builtin com- mand (see zshbuiltins(1)). If a compiled file
exists (named for the original file plus the .zwc extension)
and it is newer than the origi- nal file, the compiled file
will be used instead.</p>
