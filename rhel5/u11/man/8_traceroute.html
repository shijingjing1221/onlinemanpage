<p>NAME traceroute - print the route packets trace to
network host</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS traceroute [-46dFITUnrAV] [-f first_ttl] [-g
gate,...] [-i device] [-m max_ttl] [-p port] [-s src_addr]
[-q nqueries] [-N squeries] [-t tos] [-l flow_label] [-w
waittime] [-z sendwait] host [packetlen] traceroute6
[options] tracert [options] tcptraceroute [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION traceroute tracks the route packets take
across an IP network on their way to a given host. It
utilizes the IP protocols time to live (TTL) field and
attempts to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response from each
gateway along the path to the host.</p>

<p>traceroute6 equivalents to traceroute -6 tracert
equivalents to traceroute -I tcptraceroute equivalents to
traceroute -T -p 80</p>

<p>OPTIONS The only required parameter is the name or IP
address of the destina- tion host. This paremeter can be
followed by the size of the probing packet sent to that host
(40 by default). Varying the size of the packet in
conjunction with the -F parameter can be used to obtain
information about the MTU of individual network hops. (The
size parame- ter is useless for TCP probes).</p>

<p>Additional options are:</p>

<p>--help Print help info and exit.</p>

<p>-4, -6 Explicitly force IPv4 or IPv6 traceouting. By
default, the pro- gram will try to resolve the name given,
and choose the appro- priate protocol automatically. If
resolving a host name returns both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
traceroute will use IPv4.</p>

<p>-I Use ICMP ECHO for probes</p>

<p>-T Use TCP SYN for probes</p>

<p>-U Use UDP datagrams for probes (it is default). Only
UDP method is allowed for unprivileged users.</p>

<p>-d Enable socket level debugging (when the Linux kernel
supports it)</p>

<p>-F Set the &quot;Don t Fragment&quot; bit. This tells
intermediate routers not to fragment the packet when they
find it s too big for a network hops MTU.</p>

<p>-f first_ttl Specifies with what TTL to start. Defaults
to 1.</p>

<p>-g gateway Tells traceroute to add an IP source routing
option to the out- going packet that tells the network to
route the packet through the specified gateway. Not very
useful, because most routers have disabled source routing
for security reasons.</p>

<p>-i interface Specifies the interface through which
traceroute should send packets. By default, the interface is
selected according to the routing table.</p>

<p>-m max_ttl Specifies the maximum number of hops (max
time-to-live value) traceroute will probe. The default is
30.</p>

<p>-N squeries Specifies the number of probe packets sent
out simultaneously. Sending several probes concurrently can
speed up traceroute con- siderably. The default value is 15.
Note that some routers and hosts can use ICMP rate
throttling. In such a situation specifying too large number
can lead to loss of some responses.</p>

<p>-n Do not try to map IP addresses to host names when
displaying them.</p>

<p>-p port For UDP tracing, specifies the destination port
base traceroute will use (the destination port number will
be incremented by each probe). For ICMP tracing, specifies
the initial icmp sequence value (incremented by each probe
too). For TCP specifies just the (constant) destination port
to con- nect.</p>

<p>-t tos For IPv4, set the Type of Service (TOS) and
Precedence value. Useful values are 16 (low delay) and 8
(high throughput). Note that in order to use some TOS
precendence values, you have to be super user. For IPv6, set
the Traffic Control value.</p>

<p>-w waittime Set the time (in seconds) to wait for a
response to a probe (default 5.0 sec).</p>

<p>-q nqueries Sets the number of probe packets per hop.
The default is 3.</p>

<p>-r Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to
a host on an attached network. If the host is not on a
directly-attached network, an error is returned. This option
can be used to ping a local host through an interface that
has no route through it.</p>

<p>-s source_addr Chooses an alternative source address.
Note that you must select the address of one of the
interfaces. By default, the address of the outgoing
interface is used.</p>

<p>-z sendwait Minimal time interval between probes
(default 0). If the value is more than 10, then it specifies
a number in milliseconds, else it is a number of seconds
(float point values allowed too). Useful when some routers
use rate-limit for icmp messages.</p>

<p>-A Perform AS path lookups in routing registries and
print results directly after the corresponding addresses</p>

<p>-V Print the version and exit.</p>

<p>This program attempts to trace the route an IP packet
would follow to some internet host by launching a probe
packets with a small ttl (time to live) then listening for
an ICMP &quot;time exceeded&quot; reply from a gate- way. We
start our probes with a ttl of one and increase by one until
we get an ICMP &quot;port unreachable&quot; (or TCP reset),
which means we got to &quot;host&quot;, or hit a max (which
defaults to 30 hops). Three (by default) probes are sent at
each ttl setting and a line is printed showing the ttl,
address of the gateway and round trip time of each probe. If
the probe answers come from different gateways, the address
of each responding system will be printed. If there is no
response within a 5.0 (default) seconds, a &quot;*&quot; is
printed for that probe.</p>

<p>We don t want the destination host to process the UDP
probe packets so the destination port is set to an unlikely
value (you can change it with the -p flag). There is no such
problem for ICMP or TCP tracerout- ing (for TCP we close
sessions immediately after connect).</p>

<p>After the time some additional annotation can be
printed: !H, !N, or !P (host, network or protocol
unreachable), !S (source route failed), !F (fragmentation
needed), !X (communication administratively prohibited), !V
(host precedence violation), !C (precedence cutoff in
effect), or !&lt;num&gt; (ICMP unreachable code
&lt;num&gt;). If almost all the probes result in some kind
of unreachable, traceroute will give up and exit.</p>
