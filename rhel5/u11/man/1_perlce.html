<p>NAME perlce - Perl for WinCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This file gives the instructions for
building Perl5.8 and above for WinCE. Please read and
understand the terms under which this software is
distributed.</p>

<p>BUILD This section describes the steps to be performed
to build PerlCE. You may find additional and newer
information about building perl for WinCE using following
URL:</p>

<p>http://perlce.sourceforge.net</p>

<p>There should also be pre-built binaries there.</p>

<p>Dont be confused by large size of downloaded
distribution or con- structed binaries: entire distribution
could be large for WinCE ideol- ogy, but you may strip it at
your wish and use only required parts.</p>

<p>Tools &amp; SDK</p>

<p>For compiling, you need following:</p>

<p>* Microsoft Embedded Visual Tools * Microsoft Visual C++
* Rainer Keuchels celib-sources * Rainer Keuchels
console-sources</p>

<p>Needed source files can be downloaded via:
www.rainer-keuchel.de/wince/dirlist.html</p>

<p>Make</p>

<p>Please pay attention that starting from 5.8.0 miniperl
*is* built and it facilitates in further building process.
This means that in addition to compiler installation for
mobile device you also need to have Microsoft Visual C++
installed as well.</p>

<p>On the bright side, you do not need to edit any files
from ./win32 sub- directory. Normally you only need to edit
./wince/compile.bat to reflect your system and run it.</p>

<p>File ./wince/compile.bat is actually a wrapper to call
nmake -f make- file.ce with appropriate parameters and it
accepts extra parameters and forwards them to
&quot;nmake&quot; command as additional arguments. You
should pass target this way.</p>

<p>To prepare distribution you need to do following:</p>

<p>* go to ./wince subdirectory * edit file compile.bat *
run compile.bat * run compile.bat dist</p>

<p>makefile.ce has CROSS_NAME macro, and it is used further
to refer to your cross-compilation scheme. You could assign
a name to it, but this is not necessary, because by default
it is assigned after your machine configuration name, such
as &quot;wince-sh3-hpc-wce211&quot;, and this is enough to
distinguish different builds at the same time. This option
could be handy for several different builds on same platform
to perform, say, threaded build. In a following example we
assume that all required environment variables are set
properly for C cross-compiler (a special *.bat file could
fit perfectly to this purpose) and your compile.bat has
proper &quot;MACHINE&quot; parameter set, to, say,
&quot;wince-mips-pocket-wce300&quot;.</p>

<p>compile.bat compile.bat dist compile.bat
CROSS_NAME=mips-wce300-thr &quot;USE_ITHREADS=define&quot;
&quot;USE_IMP_SYS=define&quot; &quot;USE_MULTI=define&quot;
compile.bat CROSS_NAME=mips-wce300-thr
&quot;USE_ITHREADS=define&quot;
&quot;USE_IMP_SYS=define&quot; &quot;USE_MULTI=define&quot;
dist</p>

<p>If all goes okay and no errors during a build, youll get
two indepen- dent distributions:
&quot;wince-mips-pocket-wce300&quot; and
&quot;mips-wce300-thr&quot;.</p>

<p>Target dist prepares distribution file set. Target
zipdist performs same as dist but additionally compresses
distribution files into zip archive.</p>

<p>NOTE: during a build there could be created a number (or
one) of Con- fig.pm for cross-compilation
(&quot;foreign&quot; Config.pm) and those are hidden inside
../xlib/$(CROSS_NAME) with other auxilary files, but, and
this is important to note, there should be *no* Config.pm
for host miniperl. If you ll get an error that perl could
not find Config.pm somewhere in building process this means
something went wrong. Most probably you forgot to specify a
cross-compilation when invoking miniperl.exe to Makefile.PL
When building an extension for cross-compilation your com-
mand line should look like</p>

<p>..niperl.exe -I.. -MCross=mips-wce300-thr
Makefile.PL</p>

<p>or just</p>

<p>..niperl.exe -I.. -MCross Makefile.PL</p>

<p>to refer a cross-compilation that was created last
time.</p>

<p>If you decided to build with fcrypt.c file, please refer
to README.win32 file, as long as all legal considerations
and steps to do are exactly same in this case.</p>

<p>All questions related to building for WinCE devices
could be asked in perlce-users@lists.sourceforge.net mailing
list.</p>

<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The port for Win32 was used as a
reference.</p>
