<p>NAME dhcp6c.conf - configuration file of the DHCPv6
client daemon, dhcp6c</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dhcp6c.conf is a configuration file for
dhcp6c (DHCPv6 client).</p>

<p>dhcp6c is configured by the configuration information
(such as rapid- commit, requesting temp-address, or
prefix-delegation) in this file. dhcp6c.conf is an ASCII
text file and lines that start with # are com- ments.</p>

<p>STATEMENTS interface &lt;interface name&gt; {
[declarations] };</p>

<p>Write configurations for this interface in this
statement. In [decla- rations], options can be
specified.</p>

<p>DECLARATIONS send [dhcpoptions];</p>

<p>With this declaration, dhcp6c sends specified options.
Currently rapid-commit is defined.</p>

<p>send rapid-commit; This declaration enables dhcp6c to
request the dhcp6s server to perform a Rapid Commit.</p>

<p>request [dhcpoptions]; This declaration enables dhcp6c
to request specified options. Cur- rently temp-address,
domain-name-servers, and prefix-delegation are defined.</p>

<p>request domain-name-servers; The DHCPv6 mechanism
provides a way to obtain configuration information such as a
list of available DNS servers or NTP servers. This declara-
tion enables dhcp6c to request a DNS server address from the
DHCPv6 server.</p>

<p>request domain-search-list; This declaration enables
dhcp6c to request a domain search list which dhcp6c uses
when resolving hostnames with DNS.</p>

<p>request prefix-delegation; This declaration enables
dhcp6c to request a Prefix Delegation to the DHCPv6 server.
dhcp6c gets a prefix assignment from the DHCPv6 server.</p>

<p>request temp-address; This declaration enables dhcp6c to
request temporary addresses. dhcp6c requests Non-temporary
Addresses as default. This option makes dhcp6c request
Temporary Addresses.</p>

<p>information-only; This declaration enables dhcp6c to
request host configuration informa- tion from the DHCPv6
server. If dhcp6c doesnt need to be assigned any addresses,
this option should be specified.</p>

<p>address { [&lt;ipv6 address&gt;/&lt;prefix length&gt;];
[prefer-life-time &lt;preferred-lifetime&gt;];
[valid-life-time &lt;valid-lifetime&gt;]; }; This
declaration defines the dhcp6c client preferred IPv6
address, the preferred lifetime of the address, and the
valid lifetime for this interface.</p>

<p>prefix { [&lt;ipv6 prefix&gt;/&lt;prefix length&gt;];
[prefer-life-time &lt;preferred-lifetime&gt;];
[valid-life-time &lt;valid-lifetime&gt;]; }; This
declaration defines the dhcp6c client acting as a requesting
router for the preferred prefix, the prefix length, and the
prefixs preferred lifetime, and valid lifetime for this
interface.</p>

<p>prefer-life-time &lt;preferred-lifetime&gt;; This
declaration sets the preferred lifetime (in seconds) of the
address or prefix. This declaration is valid only in address
or prefix declarations.</p>

<p>valid-life-time &lt;valid-lifetime&gt;; This declaration
sets the valid lifetime (in seconds) of the address or
prefix. This declaration is valid only in address or prefix
declara- tions.</p>

<p>renew-time &lt;renew-time&gt;; This declaration
specifies the Renew Time (in seconds) for this Iden- tity
Association (IA). Renew Time is a T1 value in an IA option.
dhcp6c sets the Renew Time in IA options to the specified
value.</p>

<p>rebind-time &lt;rebind-time&gt;; This declaration
specifies the Rebind Time (in seconds) for this IA. Rebind
Time is T2 value in an IA option. dhcp6c sets the Rebind
Time in IA options to the specified value.</p>

<p>DHCPOPTIONS rapid-commit If this option is used in a
&quot;send [dhcpoptions];&quot; declaration, dhcp6c sends
DHCPv6 messages with a Rapid Commit option.</p>

<p>domain-name-servers If this option is used in a
&quot;request [dhcpoptions];&quot; declaration, dhcp6c
requests the DNS server address via the DHCPv6
mechanism.</p>

<p>prefix-delegation If this option is used in a
&quot;request [dhcpoptions];&quot; declaration, dhcp6c
requests a Prefix Delegation to the DHCPv6 servers.</p>

<p>prefix-delegation-interface &lt;interface name&gt;
Specifies the name of the interface definition in radvd.conf
that dhcp6c will write the prefix declaration for. By
default, dhcp6c will write a radvd.conf prefix declaration
for the interface on which it receives the prefix delegation
lease.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This is a sample of the dhcp6c.conf file.
interface eth0 { send rapid-commit; request
prefix-delegation; request domain-name-servers; request
temp-address; iaid 11111; address { 3ffe:10::10/64;
prefer-life-time 6000; valid-life-time 8000; }; renew-time
11000; rebind-time 21000; };</p>
