<p>NAME chmod - change file access permissions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE... chmod
[OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE... chmod [OPTION]...
--reference=RFILE FILE...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents the GNU version
of chmod. chmod changes the permissions of each given file
according to mode, which can be either a symbolic
representation of changes to make, or an octal number repre-
senting the bit pattern for the new permissions.</p>

<p>The format of a symbolic mode is [ugoa...][[+-=][rwxXs-
tugo...]...][,...]. Multiple symbolic operations can be
given, sepa- rated by commas.</p>

<p>A combination of the letters ugoa controls which users
access to the file will be changed: the user who owns it
(u), other users in the file s group (g), other users not in
the files group (o), or all users (a). If none of these are
given, the effect is as if a were given, but bits that are
set in the umask are not affected.</p>

<p>The operator + causes the permissions selected to be
added to the existing permissions of each file; - causes
them to be removed; and = causes them to be the only
permissions that the file has.</p>

<p>The letters rwxXstugo select the new permissions for the
affected users: read (r), write (w), execute (or access for
directories) (x), execute only if the file is a directory or
already has execute permis- sion for some user (X), set user
or group ID on execution (s), sticky (t), the permissions
granted to the user who owns the file (u), the permissions
granted to other users who are members of the files group
(g), and the permissions granted to users that are in
neither of the two preceding categories (o).</p>

<p>A numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7),
derived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1. Any
omitted digits are assumed to be leading zeros. The first
digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and
sticky (1) attributes. The second digit selects permissions
for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and
execute (1); the third selects permissions for other users
in the files group, with the same values; and the fourth for
other users not in the files group, with the same
values.</p>

<p>chmod never changes the permissions of symbolic links;
the chmod system call cannot change their permissions. This
is not a problem since the permissions of symbolic links are
never used. However, for each sym- bolic link listed on the
command line, chmod changes the permissions of the
pointed-to file. In contrast, chmod ignores symbolic links
encoun- tered during recursive directory traversals.</p>

<p>STICKY FILES On older Unix systems, the sticky bit
caused executable files to be hoarded in swap space. This
feature is not useful on modern VM sys- tems, and the Linux
kernel ignores the sticky bit on files. Other ker- nels may
use the sticky bit on files for system-defined purposes. On
some systems, only the superuser can set the sticky bit on
files.</p>

<p>STICKY DIRECTORIES When the sticky bit is set on a
directory, files in that directory may be unlinked or
renamed only by root or their owner. Without the sticky bit,
anyone able to write to the directory can delete or rename
files. The sticky bit is commonly found on directories, such
as /tmp, that are world-writable.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.</p>

<p>-c, --changes like verbose but report only when a change
is made</p>

<p>--no-preserve-root do not treat / specially (the
default)</p>

<p>--preserve-root fail to operate recursively on /</p>

<p>-f, --silent, --quiet suppress most error messages</p>

<p>-v, --verbose output a diagnostic for every file
processed</p>

<p>--reference=RFILE use RFILEs mode instead of MODE
values</p>

<p>-R, --recursive change files and directories
recursively</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>Each MODE is of the form
[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+.</p>
