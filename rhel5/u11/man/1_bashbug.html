<p>NAME bashbug - report a bug in bash</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS bashbug [address]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION bashbug is a shell script to help the user
compose and mail bug reports concerning bash in a standard
format. bashbug invokes the editor spec- ified by the
environment variable EDITOR on a temporary copy of the bug
report format outline. The user must fill in the appropriate
fields and exit the editor. bashbug then mails the completed
report to bug- bash@gnu.org, or address. If the report
cannot be mailed, it is saved in the file dead.bashbug in
the invoking user s home directory.</p>

<p>The bug report format outline consists of several
sections. The first section provides information about the
machine, operating system, the bash version, and the
compilation environment. The second section should be filled
in with a description of the bug. The third section should
be a description of how to reproduce the bug. The optional
fourth section is for a proposed fix. Fixes are
encouraged.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT bashbug will utilize the following
environment variables if they exist:</p>

<p>EDITOR Specifies the preferred editor. If EDITOR is not
set, bashbug defaults to emacs.</p>

<p>HOME Directory in which the failed bug report is saved
if the mail fails.</p>
