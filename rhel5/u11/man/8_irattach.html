<p>NAME irattach - binds the Linux-IrDA stack to a IrDA
port</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS irattach [ &lt;dev&gt; ] [ -s ] [ -d dongle ] [
-v ] [ -h ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION irattach binds the Linux-IrDA stack to an
IrDA port. It configures the low level of the Linux-IrDA
stack in the kernel. This step is usually necessary before
you (or applications) can use the higher layer of the IrDA
stack.</p>

<p>The irattach command loads the necessary Linux-IrDA
driver, which con- figures the IrDA hardware, and configures
the IrDA stack to operate on the new IrDA port. Multiple
IrDA ports can be activated through multi- ple irattach
commands.</p>

<p>irattach by default uses the irtty driver which connects
to the Linux TTY subsystem and use the standard Linux serial
driver. This works well for most machines and
configurations, but limits the baud rate to 115200bps (IrDA
SIR mode). The mode of operation will work with most FIR
hardware (as found in laptops - they provide serial
emulation) and most serial dongles (provided the proper
dongle type is specified), making it a safe choice. However,
USB dongles and a few FIR hardware don t support serial
emulation and cant be used with the irtty driver.</p>

<p>irattach can also use one of the Linux FIR drivers
(including USB don- gle drivers) instead of the irtty
driver. Most FIR drivers require proper configuration of
module parameters (this is documented below). FIR drivers
allow you to use higher baud rates (generally up to 4Mbps).
In general, Linux FIR support is not as stable and mature,
due to lack of time and documentation.</p>

<p>irattach must be run as root or installed setuid root,
as it requires root privileges. If you have compiled the
IrDA stack as modules (recom- mended), then you will need to
edit the /etc/modules.conf file. See the Infrared-HOWTO for
details.</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;dev&gt; : this is the name of a TTY, an IrDA
interface or IrDA driver. irattach decides to use the irtty
driver or one of the FIR drivers based on this argument.</p>

<p>&middot; TTY name : this is the serial port to be
configured using the irtty driver, such as /dev/ttyS0.
irattach will use the irtty driver, so only SIR will be
available. You need to check your serial configura- tion or
BIOS to know which serial port is the IrDA port that need to
be passed to irattach.</p>

<p>&middot; interface name : this is the device name of an
IrDA interface, such as irda0. irattach will use one of the
FIR drivers (including USB dongle drivers). The selected FIR
driver must be loaded prior to the call to irattach, or the
proper alias for the device name must be set in
/etc/modules.conf.</p>

<p>&middot; module name : this is the name of an FIR driver
module, such as nsc- ircc (see list below). All new IrDA
interfaces created after loading the module will be
configured, so this wont work if the module is already
loaded. This feature is still experimental.</p>

<p>-s : starts discovery of remote IrDA devices (note that
the form &quot;-s 1&quot; is no longer supported)</p>

<p>-v : shows version information (this happens, when no
option is given, too)</p>

<p>-h : shows help information.</p>

<p>-d dongle : attaches an additional dongle driver to the
IrDA port.</p>

<p>You need a dongle driver if you have an infrared device
that connects to your computers serial port (normal 9-pin
serial port connector). These devices are called dongles,
and can currently be used by any SIR driver (IrTTY or
irport). This option is not compatible with FIR drivers, and
only works with the irtty and irport drivers.</p>

<p>The currently known (serial) dongles are:</p>

<p>&middot; esi Extended Systems JetEye PC ESI-9680</p>

<p>&middot; tekram Tekram IrMate IR-210B dongle</p>

<p>&middot; actisys ACTiSYS IR-220L dongle</p>

<p>&middot; actisys+ ACTiSYS IR-220L+ dongle</p>

<p>&middot; girbil Greenwich GIrBIL dongle</p>

<p>&middot; litelink Parallax LiteLink dongle &amp;
Extended Systems JetEye PC ESI-9680B</p>

<p>&middot; airport N.N.</p>

<p>&middot; old_belkin Belkin (old) SmartBeam dongle or any
dongle only capable of 9600 bauds</p>

<p>&middot; ep7211 IR port driver for the Cirrus Logic
EP7211 processor (ARM based)</p>

<p>&middot; mcp2120 Dongles based on the MCP2120
(Microchip)</p>

<p>&middot; act200l ACTiSYS Ir-200L dongles</p>

<p>&middot; ma600 Mobile Action ma600 dongles</p>

<p>FIR DRIVER MODULES If you are one of the lucky people
which have a FIR chipset or USB don- gle that is supported
by one of the Linux-IrDA drivers, you can use irattach with
the interface name of the IrDA port to configure. You will
need to configure /etc/conf.modules appropriately, with at
least an alias of irda0 to the driver name, or load the
driver manually beforehand.</p>

<p>You don t strictly need to use irattach with FIR
drivers, you can use modprobe to load the driver, ifconfig
to bring up the interface and set the various sysctl by
hand, but irattach offer a convenient way to do it.</p>

<p>Of course, you need to know which FIR driver applies to
your hardware. You may use findchip to get information about
the FIR chip. If this doesnt help, the Infrared-HOWTO shows
other means to retrieve these data.</p>

<p>Also, you often need to configure the Linux-serial
driver to ignore the IrDA port, otherwise both drivers will
conflict. This can usually be done with setserial /dev/ttySx
uart none.</p>

<p>The currently known FIR drivers are:</p>

<p>&middot; ali-ircc ALi FIR Controller Driver for ALi
M5123 (options: io, irq, dma). This driver supports SIR, MIR
and FIR (4Mbps) speeds. This chipset is used by e.g.:</p>

<p>The ALi M5123 FIR Controller is embedded in ALi M1543C,
M1535, M1535D, M1535+, M1535D South Bridge.</p>

<p>&middot; irda-usb IrDA-USB device driver, for USB
devices/dongles that comply with the official IrDA-USB class
specification. Note: USB 2.0 is not yet tested. (options:
qos_mtt_bits int, description &quot;Minimum Turn
Time&quot;). This is used, for e.g.:</p>

<p>ACTiSYS ACT-IR2000U</p>

<p>KC Technology KC-180</p>

<p>Extended Systems XTNDAccess ESI-9685</p>

<p>Note that there is another USB driver for those devices
called ir-usb which is NOT compatible with the IrDA stack
and conflict with irda- usb. Because it always loads first,
you have to remove ir-usb com- pletely.</p>

<p>Devices based on the SigmaTel chip are not not compliant
with the IrDA-USB class specification and therfore not
supported by this driver.</p>

<p>&middot; nsc-ircc NSC IrDA device driver (options: io,
irq, dma, dongle_id, qos_mtt_bits). This chipset is used by
e.g.:</p>

<p>IBM ThinkPad dongle_id=0x09</p>

<p>HP OmniBook 6000 dongle_id=0x08</p>

<p>&middot; sa1100_ir Infrared driver for devices based on
the StrongARM SA1100 embedded microprocessor (options:
power_level, tx_lpm). This driver may support FIR on devices
that can do it. This chipset is used by e.g.:</p>

<p>Samsung YOPY, COMPAQ iPAQ, SHARP Zaurus SL5000/5500</p>

<p>&middot; smc-ircc SMC IrCC controller driver (options:
ircc_dma, ircc_irq). This chipset is used by e.g.:</p>

laptops.</p>

<p>&middot; donauboe is a new version of toshoboe and has
better FIR support and compability with the Donauoboe chip
http://libxg.free.fr/lib- irda.html (options: ..). This
chipset is used by e.g.:</p>

<p>Toshiba Libretto 100CT., Tecra 8100, Portege 7020 and
many more Toshiba laptops.</p>

<p>&middot; vlsi_ir VLSI 82C147 SIR/MIR/FIR device driver
This chipset is used by e.g.:</p>

<p>HP Omnibook 800</p>

<p>(options: ..).</p>

<p>&middot; clksrc int, description &quot;clock input
source selection&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; ringsize int array (min = 1, max = 2),
description &quot;tx, rx ring descriptor size&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; sirpulse int, description &quot;sir pulse width
tuning&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; mtt_bits int, description &quot;IrLAP bitfield
representing min-turn- time&quot;</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Attach the IrDA stack to the second serial port
(integrated IrDA port using serial emulation) and start
discovery:</p>

<p>&middot; irattach /dev/ttyS1 -s</p>

<p>Attach the IrDA stack to the first serial port where you
have an exter- nal ACTiSYS serial dongle and start
discovery:</p>

<p>&middot; irattach /dev/ttyS0 -d actisys+ -s</p>

<p>Attach the IrDA stack to the first IrDA-USB dongle and
start discovery:</p>

<p>&middot; modprobe irda-usb ; irattach irda0 -s</p>

<p>Attach the IrDA stack to the NSC FIR (4Mbps) device
driver on a Thinkpad laptop:</p>

<p>&middot; modprobe nsc-ircc dongle_id=0x9 ; irattach
irda0 -s.</p>

<p>Attach the IrDA stack to the NSC FIR (4Mbps) device
driver on a Thinkpad laptop:</p>

<p>&middot; irattach irda0 -s.</p>

<p>This assume that you have added the following entries to
/etc/conf.modules:</p>

<p>options nsc-ircc dongle_id=0x09</p>

<p>alias irda0 nsc-ircc</p>

<p>CAVEATS The following hints are a very short
introduction into the configura- tion of Linux/IrDA. If this
doesn t help read the Linux/IrDA-Tutorial and/or the
Infrared-HOWTO . Before configuring Linux/IrDA make sure
whether you want to configure SIR or FIR. It s recommended
to try SIR first, unless your device is not compatible with
SIR (for example USB dongles).</p>

<p>To get the SIR &quot;serial&quot; device have a look
into the BIOS. Then run dmesg | grep tty to get a survey of
tty devices supported by your machine. Now try to choose the
one, which is probably the IrDA device and use irattach
/dev/ttySx -s.</p>

<p>If you dont succeed with SIR (which seems a rare case)
you may try FIR. First look up the BIOS. Then run findchip
to get information about the IrDA controller chip. Use
setserial /dev/ttySx uart none to avoid conflicts with the
serial driver. Note: dont use setserial if you configure
SIR. Now you may use irattach.</p>

<p>Finally irdadump should show at least your computer
itself. If it doesnt start at the beginning.</p>

<p>This man page deal only with the low level of the IrDA
stack (IrDA ports and IrDA drivers). After this step is
done, you usually need to setup your favorite application to
access the high level IrDA stack (via IrCOMM, IrLPT, IrNET,
IrLAN or IrSOCK), which is documented else- where.</p>

<p>This man page doesnt document the usage of the irport
driver. The irport driver support the same hardware as the
irtty driver, but is configured like a FIR driver.</p>
