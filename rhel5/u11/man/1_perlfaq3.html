<p>PERLFAQ3(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLFAQ3(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlfaq3 - Programming Tools ($Revision: 1.56 $,
$Date: 2005/12/31 00:54:37 $)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This section of the FAQ answers questions
related to programmer tools and programming support.</p>

<p>How do I do (anything)?</p>

<p>Have you looked at CPAN (see perlfaq2)? The chances are
that someone has already written a module that can solve
your problem. Have you read the appropriate manpages? Heres
a brief index:</p>

<p>Basics perldata, perlvar, perlsyn, perlop, perlsub
Execution perlrun, perldebug Functions perlfunc Objects
perlref, perlmod, perlobj, perltie Data Structures perlref,
perllol, perldsc Modules perlmod, perlmodlib, perlsub
Regexes perlre, perlfunc, perlop, perllocale Moving to perl5
perltrap, perl Linking w/C perlxstut, perlxs, perlcall,
perlguts, perlembed Various
http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz (not a
man-page but still useful, a collection of various essays on
Perl techniques)</p>

<p>A crude table of contents for the Perl manpage set is
found in perltoc.</p>

<p>How can I use Perl interactively?</p>

<p>The typical approach uses the Perl debugger, described
in the perlde- bug(1) manpage, on an &quot;empty&quot;
program, like this:</p>

<p>perl -de 42</p>

<p>Now just type in any legal Perl code, and it will be
immediately evalu- ated. You can also examine the symbol
table, get stack backtraces, check variable values, set
breakpoints, and other operations typically found in
symbolic debuggers.</p>

<p>Is there a Perl shell?</p>

<p>The psh (Perl sh) is currently at version 1.8. The Perl
Shell is a shell that combines the interactive nature of a
Unix shell with the power of Perl. The goal is a full
featured shell that behaves as expected for normal shell
activity and uses Perl syntax and functional- ity for
control-flow statements and other things. You can get psh at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/psh/ .</p>

<p>Zoidberg is a similar project and provides a shell
written in perl, configured in perl and operated in perl. It
is intended as a login shell and development environment. It
can be found at http://zoid- berg.sf.net/ or your local CPAN
mirror.</p>

<p>The Shell.pm module (distributed with Perl) makes Perl
try commands which aren t part of the Perl language as shell
commands. perlsh from the source distribution is simplistic
and uninteresting, but may still be what you want.</p>

<p>How do I find which modules are installed on my
system?</p>

<p>You can use the ExtUtils::Installed module to show all
installed dis- tributions, although it can take awhile to do
its magic. The standard library which comes with Perl just
shows up as &quot;Perl&quot; (although you can get those
with Module::CoreList).</p>

<p>use ExtUtils::Installed;</p>

<p>my $inst = ExtUtils::Installed-&gt;new(); my @modules =
$inst-&gt;modules();</p>

<p>If you want a list of all of the Perl module filenames,
you can use File::Find::Rule.</p>

<p>use File::Find::Rule;</p>

<p>my @files = File::Find::Rule-&gt;file()-&gt;name( *.pm
)-&gt;in( @INC );</p>

<p>If you do not have that module, you can do the same
thing with File::Find which is part of the standard
library.</p>

<p>use File::Find; my @files;</p>

<p>find( sub { push @files, $File::Find::name if -f
$File::Find::name &amp;&amp; /.pm$/ },</p>

<p>@INC );</p>

<p>print join &quot;0, @files;</p>

<p>If you simply need to quickly check to see if a module
is available, you can check for its documentation. If you
can read the documentation the module is most likely
installed. If you cannot read the documenta- tion, the
module might not have any (in rare cases).</p>

<p>prompt% perldoc Module::Name</p>

<p>You can also try to include the module in a one-liner to
see if perl finds it.</p>

<p>perl -MModule::Name -e1</p>

<p>How do I debug my Perl programs?</p>

<p>Have you tried &quot;use warnings&quot; or used
&quot;-w&quot;? They enable warnings to detect dubious
practices.</p>

<p>Have you tried &quot;use strict&quot;? It prevents you
from using symbolic ref- erences, makes you predeclare any
subroutines that you call as bare words, and (probably most
importantly) forces you to predeclare your variables with
&quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;use
vars&quot;.</p>

<p>Did you check the return values of each and every system
call? The operating system (and thus Perl) tells you whether
they worked, and if not why.</p>

<p>open(FH, &quot;&gt; /etc/cantwrite&quot;) or die
&quot;Couldnt write to /etc/cantwrite: $!0;</p>

<p>Did you read perltrap? Its full of gotchas for old and
new Perl pro- grammers and even has sections for those of
you who are upgrading from languages like awk and C.</p>

<p>Have you tried the Perl debugger, described in
perldebug? You can step through your program and see what
its doing and thus work out why what its doing isnt what it
should be doing.</p>

<p>How do I profile my Perl programs?</p>

<p>You should get the Devel::DProf module from the standard
distribution (or separately on CPAN) and also use
Benchmark.pm from the standard distribution. The Benchmark
module lets you time specific portions of your code, while
Devel::DProf gives detailed breakdowns of where your code
spends its time.</p>

<p>Heres a sample use of Benchmark:</p>

<p>use Benchmark;</p>

<p>@junk = cat /etc/motd; $count = 10_000;</p>

<p>timethese($count, { map =&gt; sub { my @a = @junk; map {
s/a/b/ } @a; return @a }, for =&gt; sub { my @a = @junk; for
(@a) { s/a/b/ }; return @a }, });</p>

<p>This is what it prints (on one machine--your results
will be dependent on your hardware, operating system, and
the load on your machine):</p>

<p>Benchmark: timing 10000 iterations of for, map... for: 4
secs ( 3.97 usr 0.01 sys = 3.98 cpu) map: 6 secs ( 4.97 usr
0.00 sys = 4.97 cpu)</p>

<p>Be aware that a good benchmark is very hard to write. It
only tests the data you give it and proves little about the
differing complexities of contrasting algorithms.</p>

<p>How do I cross-reference my Perl programs?</p>

<p>The B::Xref module can be used to generate
cross-reference reports for Perl programs.</p>

<p>perl -MO=Xref[,OPTIONS] scriptname.plx</p>

<p>Is there a pretty-printer (formatter) for Perl?</p>

<p>Perltidy is a Perl script which indents and reformats
Perl scripts to make them easier to read by trying to follow
the rules of the perl- style. If you write Perl scripts, or
spend much time reading them, you will probably find it
useful. It is available at
http://perltidy.sourceforge.net</p>

<p>Of course, if you simply follow the guidelines in
perlstyle, you shouldnt need to reformat. The habit of
formatting your code as you write it will help prevent bugs.
Your editor can and should help you with this. The perl-mode
or newer cperl-mode for emacs can provide remarkable amounts
of help with most (but not all) code, and even less
programmable editors can provide significant assistance. Tom
Chris- tiansen and many other VI users swear by the
following settings in vi and its clones:</p>

<p>set ai sw=4 map! ^O {^M}^[O^T</p>

<p>Put that in your .exrc file (replacing the caret
characters with con- trol characters) and away you go. In
insert mode, ^T is for indenting, ^D is for undenting, and
^O is for blockdenting-- as it were. A more complete
example, with comments, can be found at
http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/TOMC/scripts/toms.exrc.gz</p>

<p>The a2ps
http://www-inf.enst.fr/%7Edemaille/a2ps/black+white.ps.gz
does lots of things related to generating nicely printed
output of docu- ments, as does enscript at
http://people.ssh.fi/mtr/genscript/ .</p>

<p>Is there a ctags for Perl?</p>

<p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p>Exuberent ctags supports Perl:
http://ctags.sourceforge.net/</p>

<p>You might also try pltags:
http://www.mscha.com/pltags.zip</p>

<p>Is there an IDE or Windows Perl Editor?</p>

<p>Perl programs are just plain text, so any editor will
do.</p>

<p>If you re on Unix, you already have an IDE--Unix itself.
The UNIX phi- losophy is the philosophy of several small
tools that each do one thing and do it well. Its like a
carpenters toolbox.</p>

<p>If you want an IDE, check the following (in alphabetical
order, not order of preference):</p>

<p>Eclipse http://e-p-i-c.sf.net/</p>

<p>The Eclipse Perl Integration Project integrates Perl
editing/debug- ging with Eclipse.</p>

<p>Enginsite http://www.enginsite.com/</p>

<p>Perl Editor by EngInSite is a complete integrated
development envi- ronment (IDE) for creating, testing, and
debugging Perl scripts; the tool runs on Windows
9x/NT/2000/XP or later.</p>

<p>Komodo http://www.ActiveState.com/Products/Komodo/</p>

<p>ActiveStates cross-platform (as of October 2004, thats
Windows, Linux, and Solaris), multi-language IDE has Perl
support, including a regular expression debugger and remote
debugging.</p>

<p>Open Perl IDE http://open-perl-ide.sourceforge.net/</p>

<p>Open Perl IDE is an integrated development environment
for writing and debugging Perl scripts with ActiveState s
ActivePerl distribu- tion under Windows 95/98/NT/2000.</p>

<p>OptiPerl http://www.optiperl.com/</p>

<p>OptiPerl is a Windows IDE with simulated CGI
environment, including debugger and syntax highlighting
editor.</p>

<p>PerlBuilder http://www.solutionsoft.com/perl.htm</p>

<p>PerlBuidler is an integrated development environment for
Windows that supports Perl development.</p>

<p>visiPerl+ http://helpconsulting.net/visiperl/</p>

<p>From Help Consulting, for Windows.</p>

<p>Visual Perl
http://www.activestate.com/Products/Visual_Perl/</p>

<p>Visual Perl is a Visual Studio.NET plug-in from
ActiveState.</p>

<p>Zeus http://www.zeusedit.com/lookmain.html</p>

<p>Zeus for Window is another Win32 multi-language
editor/IDE that comes with support for Perl:</p>

<p>For editors: if youre on Unix you probably have vi or a
vi clone already, and possibly an emacs too, so you may not
need to download anything. In any emacs the cperl-mode (M-x
cperl-mode) gives you per- haps the best available Perl
editing mode in any editor.</p>

<p>If you are using Windows, you can use any editor that
lets you work with plain text, such as NotePad or WordPad.
Word processors, such as Microsoft Word or WordPerfect,
typically do not work since they insert all sorts of
behind-the-scenes information, although some allow you to
save files as &quot;Text Only&quot;. You can also download
text editors designed specifically for programming, such as
Textpad ( http://www.textpad.com/ ) and UltraEdit (
http://www.ultraedit.com/ ), among others.</p>

<p>If you are using MacOS, the same concerns apply. MacPerl
(for Classic environments) comes with a simple editor.
Popular external editors are BBEdit ( http://www.bbedit.com/
) or Alpha ( http://www.his.com/~jguyer/Alpha/Alpha8.html ).
MacOS X users can use Unix editors as well. Neil Bowers (the
man behind Geekcruises) has a list of Mac editors that can
handle Perl ( http://www.neilbow-
ers.org/macperleditors.html ).</p>

<p>GNU Emacs
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html</p>

<p>MicroEMACS http://www.microemacs.de/</p>

<p>XEmacs http://www.xemacs.org/Download/index.html</p>

<p>Jed http://space.mit.edu/~davis/jed/</p>

<p>or a vi clone such as</p>

<p>Elvis ftp://ftp.cs.pdx.edu/pub/elvis/
http://www.fh-wedel.de/elvis/</p>

<p>Vile http://dickey.his.com/vile/vile.html</p>

<p>Vim http://www.vim.org/</p>

<p>For vi lovers in general, Windows or elsewhere:</p>

<p>http://www.thomer.com/thomer/vi/vi.html</p>

<p>nvi ( http://www.bostic.com/vi/ , available from CPAN in
src/misc/) is yet another vi clone, unfortunately not
available for Windows, but in UNIX platforms you might be
interested in trying it out, firstly because strictly
speaking it is not a vi clone, it is the real vi, or the new
incarnation of it, and secondly because you can embed Perl
inside it to use Perl as the scripting language. nvi is not
alone in this, though: at least also vim and vile offer an
embedded Perl.</p>

<p>The following are Win32 multilanguage editor/IDESs that
support Perl:</p>

<p>Codewright http://www.borland.com/codewright/</p>

<p>MultiEdit http://www.MultiEdit.com/</p>

<p>SlickEdit http://www.slickedit.com/</p>

<p>There is also a toyedit Text widget based editor written
in Perl that is distributed with the Tk module on CPAN. The
ptkdb ( http://world.std.com/~aep/ptkdb/ ) is a Perl/tk
based debugger that acts as a development environment of
sorts. Perl Composer ( http://perlcomposer.sourceforge.net/
) is an IDE for Perl/Tk GUI cre- ation.</p>

<p>In addition to an editor/IDE you might be interested in
a more powerful shell environment for Win32. Your options
include</p>

<p>Bash from the Cygwin package (
http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/ )</p>

<p>Ksh from the MKS Toolkit ( http://www.mks.com/ ), or the
Bourne shell of the U/WIN environment (
http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/ )</p>

<p>Tcsh ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/tcsh/ , see also
http://www.pri- mate.wisc.edu/software/csh-tcsh-book/</p>

<p>Zsh ftp://ftp.blarg.net/users/amol/zsh/ , see also
http://www.zsh.org/</p>

<p>MKS and U/WIN are commercial (U/WIN is free for
educational and research purposes), Cygwin is covered by the
GNU Public License (but that shouldnt matter for Perl use).
The Cygwin, MKS, and U/WIN all contain (in addition to the
shells) a comprehensive set of standard UNIX toolkit
utilities.</p>

<p>If youre transferring text files between Unix and
Windows using FTP be sure to transfer them in ASCII mode so
the ends of lines are appropri- ately converted.</p>

<p>On Mac OS the MacPerl Application comes with a simple
32k text editor that behaves like a rudimentary IDE. In
contrast to the MacPerl Appli- cation the MPW Perl tool can
make use of the MPW Shell itself as an editor (with no 32k
limit).</p>

<p>Affrus is a full Perl development environment with full
debugger support ( http://www.latenightsw.com ).</p>

<p>Alpha is an editor, written and extensible in Tcl, that
nonetheless has built in support for several popular markup
and programming lan- guages including Perl and HTML (
http://www.his.com/~jguyer/Alpha/Alpha8.html ).</p>

<p>BBEdit and BBEdit Lite are text editors for Mac OS that
have a Perl sensitivity mode ( http://web.barebones.com/
).</p>

<p>Pepper and Pe are programming language sensitive text
editors for Mac OS X and BeOS respectively (
http://www.hekkelman.com/ ).</p>

<p>Where can I get Perl macros for vi?</p>

<p>For a complete version of Tom Christiansen s vi
configuration file, see
http://www.cpan.org/authors/Tom_Christiansen/scripts/toms.exrc.gz
, the standard benchmark file for vi emulators. The file
runs best with nvi, the current version of vi out of
Berkeley, which incidentally can be built with an embedded
Perl interpreter--see http://www.cpan.org/src/misc/ .</p>

<p>Where can I get perl-mode for emacs?</p>

<p>Since Emacs version 19 patchlevel 22 or so, there have
been both a perl-mode.el and support for the Perl debugger
built in. These should come with the standard Emacs 19
distribution.</p>

<p>In the Perl source directory, you ll find a directory
called &quot;emacs&quot;, which contains a cperl-mode that
color-codes keywords, provides con- text-sensitive help, and
other nifty things.</p>

<p>Note that the perl-mode of emacs will have fits with
&quot;main&rsquo;foo&quot; (single quote), and mess up the
indentation and highlighting. You are probably using
&quot;main::foo&quot; in new Perl code anyway, so this
shouldn t be an issue.</p>

<p>How can I use curses with Perl?</p>

<p>The Curses module from CPAN provides a dynamically
loadable object mod- ule interface to a curses library. A
small demo can be found at the directory
http://www.cpan.org/authors/Tom_Christiansen/scripts/rep.gz
; this program repeats a command and updates the screen as
needed, ren- dering rep ps axu similar to top.</p>

<p>How can I use X or Tk with Perl?</p>

<p>Tk is a completely Perl-based, object-oriented interface
to the Tk toolkit that doesnt force you to use Tcl just to
get at Tk. Sx is an interface to the Athena Widget set. Both
are available from CPAN. See the directory
http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-category/08_User_Inter-
faces/</p>

<p>Invaluable for Perl/Tk programming are the Perl/Tk FAQ
at http://pha- seit.net/claird/comp.lang.perl.tk/ptkFAQ.html
, the Perl/Tk Reference Guide available at
http://www.cpan.org/authors/Stephen_O_Lidie/ , and the
online manpages at http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/%7Eamund-
son/perl/perltk/toc.html .</p>

<p>How can I make my Perl program run faster?</p>

<p>The best way to do this is to come up with a better
algorithm. This can often make a dramatic difference. Jon
Bentley s book Programming Pearls (that s not a
misspelling!) has some good tips on optimization, too.
Advice on benchmarking boils down to: benchmark and profile
to make sure youre optimizing the right part, look for
better algorithms instead of microtuning your code, and when
all else fails consider just buying faster hardware. You
will probably want to read the answer to the earlier
question &quot;How do I profile my Perl programs?&quot; if
you havent done so already.</p>

<p>A different approach is to autoload seldom-used Perl
code. See the AutoSplit and AutoLoader modules in the
standard distribution for that. Or you could locate the
bottleneck and think about writing just that part in C, the
way we used to take bottlenecks in C code and write them in
assembler. Similar to rewriting in C, modules that have
critical sections can be written in C (for instance, the PDL
module from CPAN).</p>

<p>If you re currently linking your perl executable to a
shared libc.so, you can often gain a 10-25% performance
benefit by rebuilding it to link with a static libc.a
instead. This will make a bigger perl exe- cutable, but your
Perl programs (and programmers) may thank you for it. See
the INSTALL file in the source distribution for more
information.</p>

<p>The undump program was an ancient attempt to speed up
Perl program by storing the already-compiled form to disk.
This is no longer a viable option, as it only worked on a
few architectures, and wasn t a good solution anyway.</p>

<p>How can I make my Perl program take less memory?</p>

<p>When it comes to time-space tradeoffs, Perl nearly
always prefers to throw memory at a problem. Scalars in Perl
use more memory than strings in C, arrays take more than
that, and hashes use even more. While theres still a lot to
be done, recent releases have been addressing these issues.
For example, as of 5.004, duplicate hash keys are shared
amongst all hashes using them, so require no
reallocation.</p>

<p>In some cases, using substr() or vec() to simulate
arrays can be highly beneficial. For example, an array of a
thousand booleans will take at least 20,000 bytes of space,
but it can be turned into one 125-byte bit vector--a
considerable memory savings. The standard Tie::SubstrHash
module can also help for certain types of data structure. If
youre working with specialist data structures (matrices, for
instance) mod- ules that implement these in C may use less
memory than equivalent Perl modules.</p>

<p>Another thing to try is learning whether your Perl was
compiled with the system malloc or with Perls builtin
malloc. Whichever one it is, try using the other one and see
whether this makes a difference. Information about malloc is
in the INSTALL file in the source distribu- tion. You can
find out whether you are using perls malloc by typing
&quot;perl -V:usemymalloc&quot;.</p>

<p>Of course, the best way to save memory is to not do
anything to waste it in the first place. Good programming
practices can go a long way toward this:</p>

<p>* Dont slurp! Don t read an entire file into memory if
you can process it line by line. Or more concretely, use a
loop like this:</p>

<p># # Good Idea # while (&lt;FILE&gt;) { # ... }</p>

<p>instead of this:</p>

<p># # Bad Idea # @data = &lt;FILE&gt;; foreach (@data) { #
... }</p>

<p>When the files youre processing are small, it doesn t
much matter which way you do it, but it makes a huge
difference when they start getting larger.</p>

<p>* Use map and grep selectively Remember that both map
and grep expect a LIST argument, so doing this:</p>

<p>@wanted = grep {/pattern/} &lt;FILE&gt;;</p>

<p>will cause the entire file to be slurped. For large
files, its better to loop:</p>

<p>while (&lt;FILE&gt;) { push(@wanted, $_) if /pattern/;
}</p>

<p>* Avoid unnecessary quotes and stringification Dont
quote large strings unless absolutely necessary:</p>

<p>my $copy = &quot;$large_string&quot;;</p>

<p>makes 2 copies of $large_string (one for $copy and
another for the quotes), whereas</p>

<p>my $copy = $large_string;</p>

<p>only makes one copy.</p>

<p>Ditto for stringifying large arrays:</p>

<p>{ local $, = &quot;0; print @big_array; }</p>

<p>is much more memory-efficient than either</p>

<p>print join &quot;0, @big_array;</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>{ local $&quot; = &quot;0; print &quot;@big_array&quot;;
}</p>

<p>* Pass by reference Pass arrays and hashes by reference,
not by value. For one thing, its the only way to pass
multiple lists or hashes (or both) in a single call/return.
It also avoids creating a copy of all the con- tents. This
requires some judgment, however, because any changes will be
propagated back to the original data. If you really want to
mangle (er, modify) a copy, youll have to sacrifice the
memory needed to make one.</p>

<p>* Tie large variables to disk. For &quot;big&quot; data
stores (i.e. ones that exceed available memory) con- sider
using one of the DB modules to store it on disk instead of
in RAM. This will incur a penalty in access time, but thats
probably better than causing your hard disk to thrash due to
massive swap- ping.</p>

<p>Is it safe to return a reference to local or lexical
data?</p>

<p>Yes. Perls garbage collection system takes care of this
so everything works out right.</p>

<p>sub makeone { my @a = ( 1 .. 10 ); return @a; }</p>

<p>for ( 1 .. 10 ) { push @many, makeone(); }</p>

<p>print $many[4][5], &quot;0;</p>

<p>print &quot;@many0;</p>

<p>How can I free an array or hash so my program
shrinks?</p>

<p>(contributed by Michael Carman)</p>

<p>You usually cant. Memory allocated to lexicals (i.e.
my() variables) cannot be reclaimed or reused even if they
go out of scope. It is reserved in case the variables come
back into scope. Memory allocated to global variables can be
reused (within your program) by using undef()ing and/or
delete().</p>

<p>On most operating systems, memory allocated to a program
can never be returned to the system. Thats why long-running
programs sometimes re- exec themselves. Some operating
systems (notably, systems that use mmap(2) for allocating
large chunks of memory) can reclaim memory that is no longer
used, but on such systems, perl must be configured and
compiled to use the OSs malloc, not perls.</p>

<p>In general, memory allocation and de-allocation isn t
something you can or should be worrying about much in
Perl.</p>

<p>See also &quot;How can I make my Perl program take less
memory?&quot;</p>

<p>How can I make my CGI script more efficient?</p>

<p>Beyond the normal measures described to make general
Perl programs faster or smaller, a CGI program has
additional issues. It may be run several times per second.
Given that each time it runs it will need to be re-compiled
and will often allocate a megabyte or more of system memory,
this can be a killer. Compiling into C ist going to help you
because the process start-up overhead is where the
bottleneck is.</p>

<p>There are two popular ways to avoid this overhead. One
solution involves running the Apache HTTP server (available
from http://www.apache.org/ ) with either of the mod_perl or
mod_fastcgi plugin modules.</p>

<p>With mod_perl and the Apache::Registry module
(distributed with mod_perl), httpd will run with an embedded
Perl interpreter which pre- compiles your script and then
executes it within the same address space without forking.
The Apache extension also gives Perl access to the internal
server API, so modules written in Perl can do just about
any- thing a module written in C can. For more on mod_perl,
see http://perl.apache.org/</p>

<p>With the FCGI module (from CPAN) and the mod_fastcgi
module (available from http://www.fastcgi.com/ ) each of
your Perl programs becomes a permanent CGI daemon
process.</p>

<p>Both of these solutions can have far-reaching effects on
your system and on the way you write your CGI programs, so
investigate them with care.</p>

<p>See http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-cate-
gory/15_World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI/ .</p>

<p>How can I hide the source for my Perl program?</p>

<p>Delete it. :-) Seriously, there are a number of (mostly
unsatisfactory) solutions with varying levels of
&quot;security&quot;.</p>

<p>First of all, however, you cant take away read
permission, because the source code has to be readable in
order to be compiled and interpreted. (That doesnt mean that
a CGI scripts source is readable by people on the web,
though--only by people with access to the filesystem.) So
you have to leave the permissions at the socially friendly
0755 level.</p>

<p>Some people regard this as a security problem. If your
program does insecure things and relies on people not
knowing how to exploit those insecurities, it is not secure.
It is often possible for someone to determine the insecure
things and exploit them without viewing the source. Security
through obscurity, the name for hiding your bugs instead of
fixing them, is little security indeed.</p>

<p>You can try using encryption via source filters
(Starting from Perl 5.8 the Filter::Simple and
Filter::Util::Call modules are included in the standard
distribution), but any decent programmer will be able to
decrypt it. You can try using the byte code compiler and
interpreter described below, but the curious might still be
able to de-compile it. You can try using the native-code
compiler described below, but crack- ers might be able to
disassemble it. These pose varying degrees of difficulty to
people wanting to get at your code, but none can defini-
tively conceal it (true of every language, not just
Perl).</p>

<p>It is very easy to recover the source of Perl programs.
You simply feed the program to the perl interpreter and use
the modules in the B:: hierarchy. The B::Deparse module
should be able to defeat most attempts to hide source.
Again, this is not unique to Perl.</p>

<p>If youre concerned about people profiting from your
code, then the bottom line is that nothing but a restrictive
license will give you legal security. License your software
and pepper it with threatening statements like &quot;This is
unpublished proprietary software of XYZ Corp. Your access to
it does not give you permission to use it blah blah
blah.&quot; We are not lawyers, of course, so you should see
a lawyer if you want to be sure your licenses wording will
stand up in court.</p>

<p>How can I compile my Perl program into byte code or
C?</p>

<p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p>In general, you cant do this. There are some things that
may work for your situation though. People usually ask this
question because they want to distribute their works without
giving away the source code, and most solutions trade disk
space for convenience. You probably wont see much of a speed
increase either, since most solutions simply bundle a Perl
interpreter in the final product (but see &quot;How can I
make my Perl program run faster?&quot;).</p>

<p>The Perl Archive Toolkit ( http://par.perl.org/index.cgi
) is Perls analog to Javas JAR. Its freely available and on
CPAN ( http://search.cpan.org/dist/PAR/ ).</p>

<p>The B::* namespace, often called &quot;the Perl
compiler&quot;, but is really a way for Perl programs to
peek at its innards rather than create pre- compiled
versions of your program. However. the B::Bytecode module
can turn your script into a bytecode format that could be
loaded later by the ByteLoader module and executed as a
regular Perl script.</p>

<p>There are also some commercial products that may work
for you, although you have to buy a license for them.</p>

<p>The Perl Dev Kit (
http://www.activestate.com/Products/Perl_Dev_Kit/ ) from
ActiveState can &quot;Turn your Perl programs into
ready-to-run exe- cutables for HP-UX, Linux, Solaris and
Windows.&quot;</p>

<p>Perl2Exe ( http://www.indigostar.com/perl2exe.htm ) is a
command line program for converting perl scripts to
executable files. It targets both Windows and unix
platforms.</p>

<p>How can I compile Perl into Java?</p>

<p>You can also integrate Java and Perl with the Perl
Resource Kit from O Reilly Media. See
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/prkunix/ .</p>

<p>Perl 5.6 comes with Java Perl Lingo, or JPL. JPL, still
in develop- ment, allows Perl code to be called from Java.
See jpl/README in the Perl source tree.</p>

<p>How can I get &quot;#!perl&quot; to work on
[MS-DOS,NT,...]?</p>

<p>For OS/2 just use</p>

<p>extproc perl -S -your_switches</p>

<p>as the first line in &quot;*.cmd&quot; file
(&quot;-S&quot; due to a bug in cmd.exes &quot;extproc&quot;
handling). For DOS one should first invent a corresponding
batch file and codify it in &quot;ALTERNATE_SHEBANG&quot;
(see the dosish.h file in the source distribution for more
information).</p>

<p>The Win95/NT installation, when using the ActiveState
port of Perl, will modify the Registry to associate the
&quot;.pl&quot; extension with the perl interpreter. If you
install another port, perhaps even building your own
Win95/NT Perl from the standard sources by using a Windows
port of gcc (e.g., with cygwin or mingw32), then youll have
to modify the Reg- istry yourself. In addition to
associating &quot;.pl&quot; with the interpreter, NT people
can use: &quot;SET PATHEXT=%PATHEXT%;.PL&quot; to let them
run the pro- gram &quot;install-linux.pl&quot; merely by
typing &quot;install-linux&quot;.</p>

<p>Under &quot;Classic&quot; MacOS, a perl program will
have the appropriate Creator and Type, so that
double-clicking them will invoke the MacPerl applica- tion.
Under Mac OS X, clickable apps can be made from any
&quot;#!&quot; script using Wil Sanchez DropScript utility:
http://www.wsanchez.net/soft- ware/ .</p>

<p>IMPORTANT!: Whatever you do, PLEASE dont get frustrated,
and just throw the perl interpreter into your cgi-bin
directory, in order to get your programs working for a web
server. This is an EXTREMELY big secu- rity risk. Take the
time to figure out how to do it correctly.</p>

<p>Can I write useful Perl programs on the command
line?</p>

<p>Yes. Read perlrun for more information. Some examples
follow. (These assume standard Unix shell quoting
rules.)</p>

<p># sum first and last fields perl -lane print $F[0] +
$F[-1] *</p>

<p># identify text files perl -le for(@ARGV) {print if -f
&amp;&amp; -T _} *</p>

<p># remove (most) comments from C program perl -0777 -pe
s{/*?}{}gs foo.c</p>

<p># make file a month younger than today, defeating reaper
daemons perl -e $X=24*60*60; utime(time(),time() + 30 *
$X,@ARGV) *</p>

<p># find first unused uid perl -le $i++ while
getpwuid($i); print $i</p>

<p># display reasonable manpath echo $PATH perl -nl -072 -e
s![^/+]*$!man!&amp;&amp;-d&amp;&amp;!$s{$_}++&amp;&amp;push@m,$_;END{print&quot;@m&quot;}</p>

<p>OK, the last one was actually an Obfuscated Perl Contest
entry. :-)</p>

<p>Why dot Perl one-liners work on my DOS/Mac/VMS
system?</p>

<p>The problem is usually that the command interpreters on
those systems have rather different ideas about quoting than
the Unix shells under which the one-liners were created. On
some systems, you may have to change single-quotes to double
ones, which you must NOT do on Unix or Plan9 systems. You
might also have to change a single % to a %%.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p># Unix perl -e print &quot;Hello world0</p>

<p># DOS, etc. perl -e &quot;print</p>

<p># Mac print &quot;Hello world0 (then Run
&quot;Myscript&quot; or Shift-Command-R)</p>

<p># MPW perl -e print &quot;Hello world0</p>

<p># VMS perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello
world0&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>The problem is that none of these examples are reliable:
they depend on the command interpreter. Under Unix, the
first two often work. Under DOS, it s entirely possible that
neither works. If 4DOS was the com- mand shell, youd
probably have better luck like this:</p>

<p>perl -e &quot;print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;Hello
world0Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Under the Mac, it depends which environment you are
using. The MacPerl shell, or MPW, is much like Unix shells
in its support for several quoting variants, except that it
makes free use of the Mac s non-ASCII characters as control
characters.</p>

<p>Using qq(), q(), and qx(), instead of &quot;double
quotes&quot;, single quotes, and backticks, may make
one-liners easier to write.</p>

<p>There is no general solution to all of this. It is a
mess.</p>

<p>[Some of this answer was contributed by Kenneth
Albanowski.]</p>

<p>Where can I learn about CGI or Web programming in
Perl?</p>

<p>For modules, get the CGI or LWP modules from CPAN. For
textbooks, see the two especially dedicated to web stuff in
the question on books. For problems and questions related to
the web, like &quot;Why do I get 500 Errors&quot; or
&quot;Why doesnt it run from the browser right when it runs
fine on the command line&quot;, see the troubleshooting
guides and references in perlfaq9 or in the CGI MetaFAQ:</p>

<p>http://www.perl.org/CGI_MetaFAQ.html</p>

<p>Where can I learn about object-oriented Perl
programming?</p>

<p>A good place to start is perltoot, and you can use
perlobj, perlboot, perltoot, perltooc, and perlbot for
reference.</p>

<p>A good book on OO on Perl is the &quot;Object-Oriented
Perl&quot; by Damian Con- way from Manning Publications, or
&quot;Learning Perl References, Objects, &amp; Modules&quot;
by Randal Schwartz and Tom Phoenix from OReilly Media.</p>

<p>Where can I learn about linking C with Perl?</p>

<p>If you want to call C from Perl, start with perlxstut,
moving on to perlxs, xsubpp, and perlguts. If you want to
call Perl from C, then read perlembed, perlcall, and
perlguts. Dont forget that you can learn a lot from looking
at how the authors of existing extension mod- ules wrote
their code and solved their problems.</p>

<p>You might not need all the power of XS. The Inline::C
module lets you put C code directly in your Perl source. It
handles all the magic to make it work. You still have to
learn at least some of the perl API but you won t have to
deal with the complexity of the XS support files.</p>

<p>ve read perlembed, perlguts, etc., but I cat embed perl
in my C program; what am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Download the ExtUtils::Embed kit from CPAN and run make
test. If the tests pass, read the pods again and again and
again. If they fail, see perlbug and send a bug report with
the output of &quot;make test TEST_VER- BOSE=1&quot; along
with &quot;perl -V&quot;.</p>

<p>When I tried to run my script, I got this message. What
does it mean?</p>

<p>A complete list of Perls error messages and warnings
with explanatory text can be found in perldiag. You can also
use the splain program (distributed with Perl) to explain
the error messages:</p>

<p>perl program 2&gt;diag.out splain [-v] [-p] diag.out</p>

<p>or change your program to explain the messages for
you:</p>

<p>use diagnostics;</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>use diagnostics -verbose;</p>

<p>Whas MakeMaker?</p>

<p>This module (part of the standard Perl distribution) is
designed to write a Makefile for an extension module from a
Makefile.PL. For more information, see
ExtUtils::MakeMaker.</p>
