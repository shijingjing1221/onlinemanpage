<p>PASSWD(5) Linux Programmer s Manual PASSWD(5)</p>

<p>NAME passwd - password file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Passwd is a text file, that contains a list
of the systems accounts, giving for each account some useful
information like user ID, group ID, home directory, shell,
etc. Often, it also contains the encrypted passwords for
each account. It should have general read permission (many
utilities, like ls(1) use it to map user IDs to user names),
but write access only for the superuser.</p>

<p>In the good old days there was no great problem with
this general read permission. Everybody could read the
encrypted passwords, but the hardware was too slow to crack
a well-chosen password, and moreover, the basic assumption
used to be that of a friendly user-community. These days
many people run some version of the shadow password suite,
where /etc/passwd has asterisks (*) instead of encrypted
passwords, and the encrypted passwords are in /etc/shadow
which is readable by the superuser only.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether shadow passwords are used, many
sysadmins use an asterisk in the encrypted password field to
make sure that this user can not authenticate him- or
herself using a password. (But see the Notes below.)</p>

<p>If you create a new login, first put an asterisk in the
password field, then use passwd(1) to set it.</p>

<p>There is one entry per line, and each line has the
format:</p>

<p>account:password:UID:GID:GECOS:directory:shell</p>

<p>The field descriptions are:</p>

<p>account the name of the user on the system. It should
not contain capital letters.</p>

<p>password the encrypted user password, an asterisk (*),
or the letter x . (See pwconv(8) for an explanation of
x.)</p>

<p>UID the numerical user ID.</p>

<p>GID the numerical primary group ID for this user.</p>

<p>GECOS This field is optional and only used for
informational purposes. Usually, it contains the full user
name. GECOS means General Electric Comprehensive Operating
System, which has been renamed to GCOS when GEs large
systems division was sold to Honeywell. Dennis Ritchie has
reported: &quot;Sometimes we sent printer out- put or batch
jobs to the GCOS machine. The gcos field in the password
file was a place to stash the informa- tion for the
$IDENTcard. Not elegant.&quot;</p>

<p>directory the users $HOME directory.</p>

<p>shell the program to run at login (if empty, use
/bin/sh). If set to a non-existing executable, the user will
be unable to login through login(1).</p>

<p>NOTE If you want to create user groups, their GIDs must
be equal and there must be an entry in /etc/group, or no
group will exist.</p>

<p>If the encrypted password is set to an asterisk, the
user will be unable to login using login(1), but may still
login using rlogin(1), run existing processes and initiate
new ones through rsh(1), cron(1), at(1), or mail filters,
etc. Trying to lock an account by simply changing the shell
field yields the same result and additionally allows the use
of su(1).</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd</p>

<p>SEE ALSO login(1), passwd(1), su(1), group(5),
