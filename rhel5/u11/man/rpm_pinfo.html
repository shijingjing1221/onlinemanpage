<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) PINFO(1) PINFO(1)</p>

<p>NAME pinfo - curses based lynx-style info browser</p>

<p>SYNTAX pinfo [options] [infopage]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is a program for viewing info files.
You specify which page you want to read by passing it an
infopage argument. This argument contains the name of an
info page (i.e. bash ). The program will then (by default)
search for it in the current directory, /usr/share/info,
/usr/info, /usr/local/share/info, /usr/local/info. and
/opt/info. The search path can be adjusted by INFOPATH
environment variable or in the configuration file. Pinfo
will also automatically add the suffix -info , -info.Z,
-info.gz, or -info.bz2. At present other suf- fixes are not
recognized, but you can easily add them to the function
openinfo() in filehandling_functions.c.</p>

<p>When the search for info pages fails, man is called with
the infopage argument, and its output is parsed by pinfo.
This means that when you don t have the appropriate info
page, but have a man page instead; the man page will be
viewed.</p>

<p>When no infopage is specified, the default dir page is
shown.</p>

<p>Supported options are</p>

<p>-h, --help - print help information and exit.</p>

<p>-v, --version - print version information and exit.</p>

<p>-m, --manual - uses manual page instead of info by
default. (pinfo -m could be used as a manual pager).
Warning: Everything what follows this option is passed to
the man program. Dont be confused if pinfo options, which
followed -m don t work. When using this option, pinfo does
not parse the info options as usual! It invokes the man part
of program.</p>

<p>You can also call the man function of pinfo in another
way. When pinfo is called with an argv[0] (the program file
name), which contains the word man in it s name, the man
functions are enabled automatically.</p>

<p>Previously there was a symlink to pinfo, called pman,
but I had to remove it from the distribution, since its name
was in conflict with some other utility. Anyway, you can
feel free to create such a link if you wish.</p>

<p>-r, --raw-filename - uses a raw filename first (i.e. the
name which you specified as infopage is considered to be a
real file in the specified location).</p>

<p>-f, --file synonym for -r.</p>

<p>-a, --apropos - if this is set, apropos is called when
no man or info page could be found.</p>

<p>-c, --cut-man-headers - if this is set, man parsing code
will try to cut out the repeated man headers. Use with care.
;)</p>

<p>-s, --squeeze-lines- cut empty lines from manual pages.
This option enables auto cutting of every repeated newline
in a manual page.</p>

<p>-t, --force-manual-tag-table- forces manual detection of
tag table. This allows you to view info pages, which may be
corrupted. (as i.e. version of jeds pages, shipped with
RH5.0). The tag table corruption usually appears in that the
info links, which you follow, move you to quite unexpected
nodes.</p>

<p>--node=nodename, --node nodename- Go to the node
nodename of info file. Since 0.6.7 it is also possible to
specify nodes as in standalone info via file names, like
(gcc)Introduction.</p>

<p>--rcfile=filename, --rcfile filename- Use alternate
configuration file.</p>

<p>--long-manual-links, -l- Use long link names in manuals.
On some sys- tems the manual hierarchy is divided into
subsections like 3ncurses, etc, while on other systems all
belongs to section 3. If this option is what your system is
like, feel free to use it.</p>

<p>--clear-at-exit, -x- Clear screen at exit.</p>

<p>The options are handled by GNU getopt, so you can here
(as in other programs) abbreviate the option names to the
minimal number of charac- ters by which the options
differ.</p>

<p>Warning! If you do not have getopt, these options will
not work!</p>

<p>DEFAULT KEYS WHEN BROWSING INFO FILE Just take a look at
the example configuration file (below), and at the key
descriptions. Keys available in manual viewer differ a bit
from the keys available in info viewer.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT There is a variable $INFOPATH, which can
specify the paths to be searched for info files. Its format
is similar to that of the $PATH variable. An example setting
could look like:</p>

<p>/usr/info:/usr/somewhere/info:/not/even/in/usr/info</p>

<p>etc. Directories are separated by colons.</p>

<p>COLOR AND KEY DEFINITIONS There are configuration files
called ~/.pinforc and [prefix]/etc/pin- forc, for local and
global configuration (where prefix is the prefix of the
directory, where pinfo is installed, i.e. /usr/local, or /).
Heres an example of such a file; well discuss the contents
below:</p>

<p># Here are some color setting. # Whitespace between the
entries is optional. COL_NORMAL = COLOR_WHITE, COLOR_BLACK,
NO_BOLD, NO_BLINK COL_MENUSELECTED = COLOR_RED, COLOR_BLACK,

<p>As you can see, the format is simple. First Ill explain
the color def- initions. First you must enter a color name
(all available color names are present in the example, and
they re self explanatory, I think. There is also a special
color COLOR_DEFAULT, which stands for trans- parency). Then
you enter the foreground color, and the background color.
The BOLD attribute means that we want the foreground color
to be highlighted. (i.e. light blue, light green). BLINK
attribute is the blinking attribute, or highlighted
background in some other configura- tions.</p>

<p>Now let s move to the key definitions. Here we first put
a key name (again all keys are present in the example); then
we enter its value -- either surrounded by apostrophes, or a
keycode number (like in KEY_REFRESH_1), or its mnemonic code
name if its a special key (like i.e. in
KEY_FOLLOWLINK_1).</p>

<p>If you wish to specify key by code value, use the
supplied program testkey to obtain the needed value. It
mainly is a feature, when you want to add some CTRL+letter
keybindings, and similar.</p>

<p>For each function you can bind two keys, i.e. you could
bind both Enter and Cursor Right to the FollowLink-function.
As you can see in the example above, the two key names are
KEY_FOLLOWLINK_1 and KEY_FOL- LOWLINK_2.</p>

<p>Heres an explanation of the key names:</p>

<p>KEY_DOWN</p>

<p>KEY_UP</p>

<p>KEY_LEFT</p>

<p>KEY_RIGHT</p>

<p>KEY_DOWN</p>

<p>KEY_HOME</p>

<p>KEY_BACKSPACE</p>

<p>KEY_NPAGE</p>

<p>KEY_PPAGE</p>

<p>KEY_END [Note: this works probably ONLY with Linux
ncurses]</p>

<p>KEY_F(x)</p>

<p>KEY_CTRL) - this assigns the key value to a ctrl+c
combination. c may be any letter you wish.</p>

<p>KEY_ALT) - this assigns the key value to a alt+c
combination. c may be any letter you wish. If alt key wont
work, you may use ESC+key combination.</p>

<p>c - this means a printable character c. The syntax is
just like in C/C++ ;).</p>

<p>[number] - you can also specify key as its code number.
It is useful e.g. when specifying control keys, and some
nonstandard keys. A numerical value of zero turns given key
binding off.</p>

<p>See manual page for curs_getch (3x) for description of
their meaning.</p>

<p>Warning! Try not to create some serious key binding
conflicts!</p>

<p>The options in the last part of the example
configuration file should be fairly self-explanatory. The
variables that can be set to true or false do the same
things as the command line arguments with the same
names.</p>

<p>MANUAL If this is set to true the default is to first
check for a man page, instead of a texinfo file.</p>

<p>CUT-MAN-HEADERS If set to true, then pinfo tries to cut
off the repeated headers throughout man pages.</p>

<p>CUT-EMPTY-MAN-LINES If set to true, then pinfo tries to
cut off the repeated newlines (i.e. it will shorten each set
of consecutive newlines to one newline).</p>

<p>RAW-FILENAME If set to true, the file argument is taken
to be the name of a file in the current working directory,
i.e. the directories in INFOPATH will only be searched if a
file with this name is not in the working directory.</p>

<p>APROPOS If set to true, apropos is called if no info or
man page is found.</p>

<p>DONT-HANDLE-WITHOUT-TAG-TABLE If set to true , pinfo
will not attempt to display texinfo pages without tag
tables.</p>

<p>HTTPVIEWER Set this to the program you want to use to
follow http links in documents.</p>

<p>FTPVIEWER Set this to the program you want to use to
follow ftp links in documents.</p>

<p>MAILEDITOR Set this to your favorite email program, and
it will be started if you follow an email link in a
document.</p>

<p>PRINTUTILITY Utility, which you use for printing. I.e.
lpr. If you don t use any, you may also try something like
cat &gt;/dev/lp1, or sth. ;)</p>

<p>MANLINKS This specifies the section names, which may be
refer- enced in your man pages (i.e. Xtoolkit man pages
match the section 3Xt (see for example XtVaCreateWidget)
manpage), Xlib function pages match section 3X11, etc. Such
extensions may not be recognized by default, so it is a good
idea to add them).</p>

<p>INFOPATH This allows you to override the default search
path for info pages. The paths should be separated by
colons.</p>

<p>MAN-OPTIONS This specifies the options, which should be
passed to the man program. (see man(1) for description of
what theyre like).</p>

<p>STDERR-REDIRECTION Pinfo allows you to redirect the
stderr output of called programs. For example if you don t
want to see man s error messages about manual page
formatting, you can use STDER-REDIRECTION=&quot;2&gt;
/dev/null&quot;. This is the default.</p>

<p>LONG-MANUAL-LINKS This is another true/false option,
which decides whether your system supports long manual
section names, or not. (i.e. &quot;3ncurses&quot; instead of
&quot;3&quot;).</p>

<p>FILTER-0xB7 This decides, whether you want to convert
0xb7 chars to o, or not. For example for iso-8859-2 fonts
this makes mans list marks a bit nicer ;) (look for exam-
ple at perls man page, to see how those marks look
like).</p>

<p>QUIT-CONFIRMATION This decides whether you want to use
quit confirmation on exit, or not.</p>

<p>QUIT-CONFIRM-DEFAULT This yes/no option determines the
default answer to the QUIT-CONFIRMATION dialog. (default
answer is when you press a key, that does not match the
asked ques- tion).</p>

<p>CLEAR-SCREEN-AT-EXIT This true/false option determines
if you want to have your screen cleared at exit, or no.</p>

<p>CALL-READLINE-HISTORY This true/false option determines
if you want to have a prompt of last history entry whenever
calling read- line wrapper, eg. in subsequent searches.</p>

<p>HIGHLIGHTREGEXP This is an option, through which you may
pass to pinfo regexps, which should be highlighted when
working with document. Warning! This may turn very slow if
you use it without care!</p>

<p>SAFE-USER This option is used to pass the name of user,
to which suid when pinfo is run with root privileges.</p>

<p>SAFE-GROUP This option is used to pass the name of
group, to which suid when pinfo is run with root
privileges.</p>

<p>INTERNATIONALIZATION SUPPORT Pinfo implements general
features of gnu gettext library (the thing, which you need
to see national messages ;). But it is not the end. Pinfo
allows you to use national info pages! You only need to put
them to your info directory, into a subdirectory, which is
called $LANG.</p>
