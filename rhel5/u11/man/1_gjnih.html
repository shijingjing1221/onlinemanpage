<p>NAME gjnih - generate JNI header files from Java class
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gjnih [-stubs] [-jni] [-force] [-old] [-trace]
[-J option] [-add text] [-append text] [-friend text]
[-preprend text] [--classpath=path] [--CLASSPATH=path]
[--bootclasspath=path] [-Idir...] [-d dir...] [-o file] [-td
dir] [-M] [-MM] [-MD] [-MMD] [--version] [--help] [-v]
[--verbose] classname...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &quot;gjnih&quot; program is used to
generate JNI header files from class files. Running it is
equivalent to running &quot;gcjh -jni&quot;.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -stubs This causes &quot;gjnih&quot; to generate
stub files instead of header files. By default the stub file
will be named after the class, with a suf- fix of .c.</p>

<p>-jni This option specifies the default behavior which is
to generate a JNI header or stub.</p>

<p>-force This option forces &quot;gjnih&quot; to write the
output file.</p>

<p>-old This option is accepted but ignored for
compatibility.</p>

<p>-trace This option is accepted but ignored for
compatibility.</p>

<p>-J option This option is accepted but ignored for
compatibility.</p>

<p>-add text Inserts text into the class body. This is
ignored in by &quot;gjnih&quot;.</p>

<p>-append text Inserts text into the header file after the
class declaration. This is ignored in by
&quot;gjnih&quot;.</p>

<p>-friend text Inserts text into the class as a
&quot;friend&quot; declaration. This is ignored by
&quot;gjnih&quot;.</p>

<p>-prepend text Inserts text into the header file before
the class declaration. This is ignored in by
&quot;gjnih&quot;.</p>

<p>--classpath=path --CLASSPATH=path --bootclasspath=path
-Idirectory -d directory -o file These options are all
identical to the corresponding gcj options.</p>

<p>-o file Sets the output file name. This cannot be used
if there is more than one class on the command line.</p>

<p>-td directory Sets the name of the directory to use for
temporary files.</p>

<p>-M Print all dependencies to stdout; suppress ordinary
output.</p>

<p>-MM Print non-system dependencies to stdout; suppress
ordinary output.</p>

<p>-MD Print all dependencies to stdout.</p>

<p>-MMD Print non-system dependencies to stdout.</p>

<p>--help Print help about &quot;gjnih&quot; and exit. No
further processing is done.</p>

<p>--version Print version information for
&quot;gjnih&quot; and exit. No further pro- cessing is
done.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Print extra information while running.</p>

<p>All remaining options are considered to be names of
classes.</p>
