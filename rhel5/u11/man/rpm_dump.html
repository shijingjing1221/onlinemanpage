<p>DESCRIPTION rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can
be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase
individual software packages. A pack- age consists of an
archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the
archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file
attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to
encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce
binary packages.</p>

<p>One of the following basic modes must be selected:
Query, Verify, Sig- nature Check, Install/Upgrade/Freshen,
Uninstall, Initialize Database, Rebuild Database, Resign,
Add Signature, Set Owners/Groups, Show Query- tags, and Show
Configuration.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS These options can be used in all the
different modes.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a longer usage message then normal.</p>

<p>--version Print a single line containing the version
number of rpm being used.</p>

<p>--quiet Print as little as possible - normally only
error messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-v Print verbose information - normally routine progress
messages will be displayed.</p>

<p>-vv Print lots of ugly debugging information.</p>

<p>--rcfile FILELIST Each of the files in the colon
separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for
configuration information. Only the first file in the list
must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value of
$HOME. The default FILELIST is
/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
hat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.</p>

<p>--pipe CMD Pipes the output of rpm to the command
CMD.</p>

<p>--dbpath DIRECTORY Use the database in DIRECTORY rather
than the default path /var/lib/rpm</p>

<p>--root DIRECTORY Use the file system tree rooted at
DIRECTORY for all operations. Note that this means the
database within DIRECTORY will be used for dependency checks
and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if installing, or %prep if
building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>-D, --defineMACRO EXPR Defines MACRO with value
EXPR.</p>

<p>-E, --evalEXPR Prints macro expansion of EXPR.</p>

<p>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
install command is</p>

<p>rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This installs a new package.</p>

<p>The general form of an rpm upgrade command is</p>

<p>rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This upgrades or installs the package currently
installed to a newer version. This is the same as install,
except all other version(s) of the package are removed after
the new package is installed.</p>

<p>rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>This will upgrade packages, but only if an earlier
version currently exists. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified
as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be
downloaded before being installed. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client
support.</p>

<p>--aid Add suggested packages to the transaction set when
needed.</p>

<p>--allfiles Installs or upgrades all the missingok files
in the package, regardless if they exist.</p>

<p>--badreloc Used with --relocate, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those OLDPATHs included in the
binary package relocation hint(s).</p>

<p>--excludepath OLDPATH Dont install files whose name
begins with OLDPATH.</p>

<p>--excludedocs Don t install any files which are marked
as documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo
documents).</p>

<p>--force Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and
--oldpackage.</p>

<p>-h, --hash Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is
unpacked. Use with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.</p>

<p>--ignoresize Dont check mount file systems for
sufficient disk space before installing this package.</p>

<p>--ignorearch Allow installation or upgrading even if the
architectures of the binary package and host dont match.</p>

<p>--ignoreos Allow installation or upgrading even if the
operating systems of the binary package and host dont
match.</p>

<p>--includedocs Install documentation files. This is the
default behavior.</p>

<p>--justdb Update only the database, not the
filesystem.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nosignature Don t verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont do a dependency check before installing or
upgrading a package.</p>

<p>--nosuggest Don t suggest package(s) that provide a
missing dependency.</p>

<p>--noorder Dont reorder the packages for an install. The
list of packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
dependencies.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopre</p>

<p>--nopost</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Dont execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,
%post, %preun, and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerin</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Dont execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerin,
%trig- gerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--oldpackage Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package
with an older one.</p>

<p>--percent Print percentages as files are unpacked from
the package archive. This is intended to make rpm easy to
run from other tools.</p>

<p>--prefix NEWPATH For relocatable binary packages,
translate all file paths that start with the installation
prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.</p>

<p>--relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH For relocatable binary
packages, translate all file paths that start with OLDPATH
in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH. This option
can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATHs in the package
are to be relocated.</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace
files from other, already installed, packages.</p>

<p>--replacepkgs Install the packages even if some of them
are already installed on this system.</p>

<p>--test Do not install the package, simply check for and
report poten- tial conflicts.</p>

<p>ERASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm erase command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-e|--erase} [--allmatches] [--nodeps] [--noscripts]
[--notriggers] [--repackage] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...</p>

<p>The following options may also be used:</p>

<p>--allmatches Remove all versions of the package which
match PACKAGE_NAME. Normally an error is issued if
PACKAGE_NAME matches multiple packages.</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont check dependencies before uninstalling the
packages.</p>

<p>--noscripts</p>

<p>--nopreun</p>

<p>--nopostun Don t execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The --noscripts option during package erase is equivalent
to</p>

<p>--nopreun --nopostun</p>

<p>and turns off the execution of the corresponding %preun,
and %postun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--notriggers</p>

<p>--notriggerun</p>

<p>--notriggerpostun Don t execute any trigger scriptlet of
the named type. The --notriggers option is equivalent to</p>

<p>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</p>

<p>and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun,
and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).</p>

<p>--repackage Re-package the files before erasing. The
previously installed package will be named according to the
macro %_repack- age_name_fmt and will be created in the
directory named by the macro %_repackage_dir (default value
is /var/spool/repackage).</p>

<p>--test Dont really uninstall anything, just go through
the motions. Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for
debugging.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm query command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]</p>

<p>You may specify the format that package information
should be printed in. To do this, you use the</p>

<p>--qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT</p>

<p>option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string. Query
formats are mod- ified versions of the standard printf(3)
formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which
may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs,
and other special characters) and printf(3) type formatters.
As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier
must be omitted however, and replaced by the name of the
header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag
names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion
of the tag name may be omitted as well.</p>

<p>Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with :typetag. Currently, the following types are
supported:</p>

<p>:armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.</p>

<p>:base64 Encode binary data using base64.</p>

<p>:date Use strftime(3) &quot;%c&quot; format.</p>

<p>:day Use strftime(3) &quot;%a %b %d %Y&quot; format.</p>

<p>:depflags Format dependency flags.</p>

<p>:fflags Format file flags.</p>

<p>:hex Format in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>:octal Format in octal.</p>

<p>:perms Format file permissions.</p>

<p>:shescape Escape single quotes for use in a script.</p>

<p>:triggertype Display trigger suffix.</p>

<p>For example, to print only the names of the packages
queried, you could use %{NAME} as the format string. To
print the packages name and dis- tribution information in
two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI- BUTION}. rpm
will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the --querytags argument.</p>

<p>There are two subsets of options for querying: package
selection, and information selection.</p>

<p>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS: PACKAGE_NAME Query installed
package named PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>-a, --all Query all installed packages.</p>

<p>-f, --file FILE Query package owning FILE.</p>

<p>--fileid MD5 Query package that contains a given file
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the file contents.</p>

<p>-g, --group GROUP Query packages with the group of
GROUP.</p>

<p>--hdrid SHA1 Query package that contains a given header
identifier, i.e. the SHA1 digest of the immutable header
region.</p>

<p>-p, --package PACKAGE_FILE Query an (uninstalled)
package PACKAGE_FILE. The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as
an ftp or http style URL, in which case the package header
will be downloaded and queried. See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for
information on rpms internal ftp and http client support.
The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will
be interpreted as an ASCII package manifest. Comments are
permitted, starting with a #, and each line of a package
mani- fest file may include white space separated glob
expressions, including URLs with remote glob expressions,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place
of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments
to the query.</p>

<p>--pkgid MD5 Query package that contains a given package
identifier, i.e. the MD5 digest of the combined header and
payload contents.</p>

<p>--querybynumber HDRNUM Query the HDRNUMth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.</p>

<p>--specfile SPECFILE Parse and query SPECFILE as if it
were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file
lists) is available, this type of query permits rpm to be
used to extract information from spec files without having
to write a specfile parser.</p>

<p>--tid TID Query package(s) that have a given TID
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used
as a transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or
erased within a single transaction have a common
identifier.</p>

<p>--triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME Query packages that are
triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.</p>

<p>--whatprovides CAPABILITY Query all packages that
provide the CAPABILITY capability.</p>

<p>--whatrequires CAPABILITY Query all packages that
requires CAPABILITY for proper function- ing.</p>

<p>PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS: --changelog Display change
information for the package.</p>

<p>-c, --configfiles List only configuration files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>-d, --docfiles List only documentation files (implies
-l).</p>

<p>--dump Dump file information as follows (implies
-l):</p>

<p>path size mtime md5sum mode owner group isconfig isdoc
rdev symlink</p>

<p>--filesbypkg List all the files in each selected
package.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display package information, including name,
version, and description. This uses the --queryformat if one
was specified.</p>

<p>--last Orders the package listing by install time such
that the latest packages are at the top.</p>

<p>-l, --list List files in package.</p>

<p>--provides List capabilities this package provides.</p>

<p>-R, --requires List packages on which this package
depends.</p>

<p>--scripts List the package specific scriptlet(s) that
are used as part of the installation and uninstallation
processes.</p>

<p>-s, --state Display the states of files in the package
(implies -l). The state of each file is one of normal, not
installed, or replaced.</p>

<p>--triggers, --triggerscripts Display the trigger
scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.</p>

<p>VERIFY OPTIONS The general form of an rpm verify command
is</p>

<p>rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]</p>

<p>Verifying a package compares information about the
installed files in the package with information about the
files taken from the package metadata stored in the rpm
database. Among other things, verifying compares the size,
MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of each file.
Any discrepancies are displayed. Files that were not
installed from the package, for example, documentation files
excluded on instal- lation using the
&quot;--excludedocs&quot; option, will be silently
ignored.</p>

<p>The package selection options are the same as for
package querying (including package manifest files as
arguments). Other options unique to verify mode are:</p>

<p>--nodeps Dont verify dependencies of packages.</p>

<p>--nodigest Dont verify package or header digests when
reading.</p>

<p>--nofiles Dont verify any attributes of package
files.</p>

<p>--noscripts Don t execute the %verifyscript scriptlet
(if any).</p>

<p>--nosignature Dont verify package or header signatures
when reading.</p>

<p>--nolinkto</p>

<p>--nomd5</p>

<p>--nosize</p>

<p>--nouser</p>

<p>--nogroup</p>

<p>--nomtime</p>

<p>--nomode</p>

<p>--nordev Dont verify the corresponding file
attribute.</p>

<p>The format of the output is a string of 8 characters, a
possible attribute marker:</p>

<p>c %config configuration file. d %doc documentation file.
g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in
the package payload). l %license license file. r %readme
readme file.</p>

<p>from the package header, followed by the file name. Each
of the 8 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
recorded in the database. A single &quot;.&quot; (period)
means the test passed, while a single &quot;?&quot;
(question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the
(mnemonically emBoldened) character denotes failure of the
corresponding --verify test:</p>

<p>S file Size differs M Mode differs (includes permissions
and file type) 5 MD5 sum differs D Device major/minor number
mismatch L readLink(2) path mismatch U User ownership
differs G Group ownership differs T mTime differs</p>

<p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND DIGEST VERIFICATION The general
forms of rpm digital signature commands are</p>

<p>rpm --import PUBKEY ...</p>

<p>rpm {--checksig} [--nosignature] [--nodigest]
PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>The --checksig option checks all the digests and
signatures contained in PACKAGE_FILE to ensure the integrity
and origin of the package. Note that signatures are now
verified whenever a package is read, and --checksig is
useful to verify all of the digests and signatures asso-
ciated with a package.</p>

<p>Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public
key. An ASCII armored public key can be added to the rpm
database using --import. An imported public key is carried
in a header, and key ring management is performed exactly
like package management. For example, all currently imported
public keys can be displayed by:</p>

<p>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</p>

<p>Details about a specific public key, when imported, can
be displayed by querying. Heres information about the Red
Hat GPG/DSA key:</p>

<p>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just
like packages. Heres how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA
key</p>

<p>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</p>

<p>SIGNING A PACKAGE rpm --addsign|--resign PACKAGE_FILE
...</p>

<p>Both of the --addsign and --resign options generate and
insert new sig- natures for each package PACKAGE_FILE given,
replacing any existing signatures. There are two options for
historical reasons, there is no difference in behavior
currently.</p>

<p>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES In order to sign packages
using GPG, rpm must be configured to run GPG and be able to
find a key ring with the appropriate keys. By default, rpm
uses the same conventions as GPG to find key rings, namely
the $GNUPGHOME environment variable. If your key rings are
not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need to
configure the macro %_gpg_path to be the location of the GPG
key rings to use.</p>

<p>For compatibility with older versions of GPG, PGP, and
rpm, only V3 OpenPGP signature packets should be configured.
Either DSA or RSA ver- ification algorithms can be used, but
DSA is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to sign packages you create
yourself, you also need to create your own public and secret
key pair (see the GPG man- ual). You will also need to
configure the rpm macros</p>

<p>%_signature The signature type. Right now only gpg and
pgp are supported.</p>

<p>%_gpg_name The name of the &quot;user&quot; whose key
you wish to use to sign your packages.</p>

<p>For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as
the user &quot;John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;&quot; from the
key rings located in /etc/rpm/.gpg using the executable
/usr/bin/gpg you would include</p>

<p>%_signature gpg %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg %_gpg_name John
Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt; %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg</p>

<p>in a macro configuration file. Use /etc/rpm/macros for
per-system con- figuration and ~/.rpmmacros for per-user
configuration.</p>

<p>REBUILD DATABASE OPTIONS The general form of an rpm
rebuild database command is</p>

<p>rpm {--initdb|--rebuilddb} [-v] [--dbpath DIRECTORY]
[--root DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>Use --initdb to create a new database if one doesnt
already exist (existing database is not overwritten), use
--rebuilddb to rebuild the database indices from the
installed package headers.</p>

<p>SHOWRC The command</p>

<p>rpm --showrc</p>

<p>shows the values rpm will use for all of the options are
currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).</p>

<p>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS rpm can act as an FTP and/or HTTP
client so that packages can be queried or installed from the
internet. Package files for install, upgrade, and query
operations may be specified as an ftp or http style URL:</p>

<p>ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm</p>

<p>If the :PASSWORD portion is omitted, the password will
be prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the
user and password are omit- ted, anonymous ftp is used. In
all cases, passive (PASV) ftp transfers are performed.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp
URLs:</p>

<p>--ftpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all ftp trans- fers, which allows users to ftp
through firewall machines which use proxy systems. This
option may also be specified by config- uring the macro
%_ftpproxy.</p>

<p>--ftpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the ftp
connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_ftpport.</p>

<p>rpm allows the following options to be used with http
URLs:</p>

<p>--httpproxy HOST The host HOST will be used as a proxy
server for all http trans- fers. This option may also be
specified by configuring the macro %_httpproxy.</p>

<p>--httpport PORT The TCP PORT number to use for the http
connection on the proxy http server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the
macro %_httpport.</p>

<p>LEGACY ISSUES Executing rpmbuild The build modes of rpm
are now resident in the /usr/bin/rpmbuild exe- cutable.
Although legacy compatibility provided by the popt aliases
below has been adequate, the compatibility is not perfect;
hence build mode compatibility through popt aliases is being
removed from rpm. Install the package containing rpmbuild
(usually rpm-build) and see rpmbuild(8) for documentation of
all the rpm build modes previously documented here in
rpm(8).</p>

<p>Add the following lines to /etc/popt if you wish to
continue invoking rpmbuild from the rpm command line:</p>

<p>rpm exec --bp rpmb -bp rpm exec --bc rpmb -bc rpm exec
--bi rpmb -bi rpm exec --bl rpmb -bl rpm exec --ba rpmb -ba
rpm exec --bb rpmb -bb rpm exec --bs rpmb -bs rpm exec --tp

<p>Red Hat, Inc. 09 June 2002 RPM(8) DUMP(8) System
management commands DUMP(8)</p>

<p>NAME dump - ext2/3 filesystem backup</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dump [-level#] [-ackMnqSuv] [-A file] [-B
records] [-b blocksize] [-d density] [-D file] [-e inode
numbers] [-E file] [-f file] [-F script] [-h level] [-I nr
errors] [-jcompression level] [-L label] [-Q file] [-s feet]
[-T date] [-y] [-zcompression level] files-to-dump</p>

<p>dump [-W | -w]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Dump examines files on an ext2/3 filesystem
and determines which files need to be backed up. These files
are copied to the given disk, tape or other storage medium
for safe keeping (see the -f option below for doing remote
backups). A dump that is larger than the output medium is
broken into multiple volumes. On most media the size is
determined by writing until an end-of-media indication is
returned.</p>

<p>On media that cannot reliably return an end-of-media
indication (such as some cartridge tape drives), each volume
is of a fixed size; the actual size is determined by
specifying cartridge media, or via the tape size, density
and/or block count options below. By default, the same
output file name is used for each volume after prompting the
oper- ator to change media.</p>

<p>files-to-dump is either a mountpoint of a filesystem or
a list of files and directories to be backed up as a subset
of a filesystem. In the former case, either the path to a
mounted filesystem or the device of an unmounted filesystem
can be used. In the latter case, certain restrictions are
placed on the backup: -u is not allowed, the only dump level
that is supported is 0 and all the files and directories
must reside on the same filesystem.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported by dump:</p>

<p>-level# The dump level (any integer). A level 0, full
backup, guarantees the entire file system is copied (but see
also the -h option below). A level number above 0,
incremental backup, tells dump to copy all files new or
modified since the last dump of a lower level. The default
level is 0. Historically only levels 0 to 9 were usable in
dump, this version is able to understand any integer as a
dump level.</p>

<p>-a auto-size. Bypass all tape length calculations, and
write until an end-of-media indication is returned. This
works best for most modern tape drives, and is the default.
Use of this option is particularly recommended when
appending to an existing tape, or using a tape drive with
hardware compression (where you can never be sure about the
compression ratio).</p>

<p>-A archive_file Archive a dump table-of-contents in the
specified archive_file to be used by restore(8) to determine
whether a file is in the dump file that is being
restored.</p>

<p>-b blocksize The number of kilobytes per dump record.
The default blocksize is 10, unless the -d option has been
used to specify a tape den- sity of 6250BPI or more, in
which case the default blocksize is 32. Th maximal value is
1024. Note however that, since the IO system slices all
requests into chunks of MAXBSIZE (which can be as low as
64kB), you can experience problems with dump(8) and
restore(8) when using a higher value, depending on your
kernel and/or libC versions.</p>

<p>-B records The number of 1 kB blocks per volume. Not
normally required, as dump can detect end-of-media. When the
specified size is reached, dump waits for you to change the
volume. This option overrides the calculation of tape size
based on length and den- sity. If compression is on this
limits the size of the com- pressed output per volume.
Multiple values may be given as a single argument separated
by commas. Each value will be used for one dump volume in
the order listed; if dump creates more volumes than the
number of values given, the last value will be used for the
remaining volumes. This is useful for filling up already
partially filled media (and then continuing with full size
volumes on empty media) or mixing media of different
sizes.</p>

<p>-c Change the defaults for use with a cartridge tape
drive, with a density of 8000 bpi, and a length of 1700
feet. Specifying a cartridge drive overrides the
end-of-media detection.</p>

<p>-d density Set tape density to density. The default is
1600BPI. Specifying a tape density overrides the
end-of-media detection.</p>

<p>-D file Set the path name of the file storing the
information about the previous full and incremental dumps.
The default location is /etc/dumpdates.</p>

<p>-e inodes Exclude inodes from the dump. The inodes
parameter is a comma separated list of inode numbers (you
can use stat(1) to find the inode number for a file or
directory).</p>

<p>-E file Read list of inodes to be excluded from the dump
from the text file file. The file file should be an ordinary
file containing inode numbers separated by newlines.</p>

<p>-f file Write the backup to file; file may be a special
device file like /dev/st0 (a tape drive), /dev/rsd1c (a
floppy disk drive), an ordinary file, or - (the standard
output). Multiple file names may be given as a single
argument separated by commas. Each file will be used for one
dump volume in the order listed; if the dump requires more
volumes than the number of names given, the last file name
will used for all remaining volumes after prompt- ing for
media changes. If the name of the file is of the form
host:file or user@host:file dump writes to the named file on
the remote host (which should already exist, dump doesn t
create a new remote file) using rmt(8). The default path
name of the remote rmt(8) program is /etc/rmt; this can be
overridden by the environment variable RMT.</p>

<p>-F script Run script at the end of each tape (except for
the last one). The device name and the current volume number
are passed on the command line. The script must return 0 if
dump should continue without asking the user to change the
tape, 1 if dump should continue but ask the user to change
the tape. Any other exit code will cause dump to abort. For
security reasons, dump reverts back to the real user ID and
the real group ID before running the script.</p>

<p>-h level Honor the user nodump flag UF_NODUMP only for
dumps at or above the given level. The default honor level
is 1, so that incre- mental backups omit such files but full
backups retain them.</p>

<p>-I nr errors By default, dump will ignore the first 32
read errors on the file system before asking for operator
intervention. You can change this using this flag to any
value. This is useful when running dump on an active
filesystem where read errors simply indicate an
inconsistency between the mapping and dumping passes.</p>

<p>A value of 0 means that all read errors will be
ignored.</p>

<p>-jcompression level Compress every block to be written
on the tape using bzlib library. This option will work only
when dumping to a file or pipe or, when dumping to a tape
drive, if the tape drive is capable of writing variable
length blocks. You will need at least the 0.4b24 version of
restore in order to extract com- pressed tapes. Tapes
written using compression will not be com- patible with the
BSD tape format. The (optional) parameter spec- ifies the
compression level bzlib will use. The default compres- sion
level is 2. If the optional parameter is specified, there
should be no white space between the option letter and the
parameter.</p>

<p>-k Use Kerberos authentication to talk to remote tape
servers. (Only available if this option was enabled when
dump was com- piled.)</p>

<p>-L label The user-supplied text string label is placed
into the dump header, where tools like restore(8) and
file(8) can access it. Note that this label is limited to be
at most LBLSIZE (currently 16) characters, which must
include the terminating .</p>

<p>-m If this flag is specified, dump will optimise the
output for inodes having been changed but not modified since
the last dump ( changed and modified have the meaning
defined in stat(2) ). For those inodes, dump will save only
the metadata, instead of saving the entire inode contents.
Inodes which are either directories or have been modified
since the last dump are saved in a regular way. Uses of this
flag must be consistent, meaning that either every dump in
an incremental dump set have the flag, or no one has it.</p>

<p>If you use this option, be aware that many programs that
unpack files from archives (e.g. tar, rpm, unzip, dpkg) may
set files mtimes to dates in the past. Files installed in
this way may not be dumped correctly using &quot;dump
-m&quot; if the modified mtime is earlier than the previous
level dump.</p>

<p>Tapes written using such metadata only inodes will not
be com- patible with the BSD tape format or older versions
of restore.</p>

<p>-M Enable the multi-volume feature. The name specified
with f is treated as a prefix and dump writes in sequence to
&lt;prefix&gt;001, &lt;prefix&gt;002 etc. This can be useful
when dumping to files on an ext2 partition, in order to
bypass the 2GB file size limitation.</p>

<p>-n Whenever dump requires operator attention, notify all
operators in the group operator by means similar to a
wall(1).</p>

<p>-q Make dump abort immediately whenever operator
attention is required, without prompting in case of write
errors, tape changes etc.</p>

<p>-Q file Enable the Quick File Access support. Tape
positions for each inode are stored into the file file which
is used by restore (if called with parameter -Q and the
filename) to directly position the tape at the file restore
is currently working on. This saves hours when restoring
single files from large backups, saves the tapes and the
drives head.</p>

<p>It is recommended to set up the st driver to return
logical tape positions rather than physical before calling
dump/restore with parameter -Q. Since not all tape devices
support physical tape positions those tape devices return an
error during dump/restore when the st driver is set to the
default physical setting. Please see the st(4) man page,
option MTSETDRVBUFFER , or the mt(1) man page, on how to set
the driver to return logical tape positions.</p>

<p>Before calling restore with parameter -Q, always make
sure the st driver is set to return the same type of tape
position used during the call to dump. Otherwise restore may
be confused.</p>

<p>This option can be used when dumping to local tapes (see
above) or to local files.</p>

<p>-s feet Attempt to calculate the amount of tape needed
at a particular density. If this amount is exceeded, dump
prompts for a new tape. It is recommended to be a bit
conservative on this option. The default tape length is 2300
feet. Specifying the tape size overrides end-of-media
detection.</p>

<p>-S Size estimate. Determine the amount of space that is
needed to perform the dump without actually doing it, and
display the estimated number of bytes it will take. This is
useful with incremental dumps to determine how many volumes
of media will be needed.</p>

<p>-T date Use the specified date as the starting time for
the dump instead of the time determined from looking in
/etc/dumpdates . The format of date is the same as that of
ctime(3) followed by an rfc822 timezone specification:
either a plus or minus sign fol- lowed by two digits for the
number of hours and two digits for the minutes. For example,
-0800 for eight hours west of Green- wich or +0230 for two
hours and a half east of Greenwich. This timezone offset
takes into account daylight savings time (if applicable to
the timezone): UTC offsets when daylight savings time is in
effect will be different than offsets when daylight savings
time is not in effect. For backward compatibility, if no
timezone is specified, a local time is assumed. This option
is useful for automated dump scripts that wish to dump over
a spe- cific period of time. The -T option is mutually
exclusive from the -u option.</p>

<p>-u Update the file /etc/dumpdates after a successful
dump. The for- mat of /etc/dumpdates is readable by people,
consisting of one free format record per line: filesystem
name, increment level and ctime(3) format dump date followed
by a rfc822 timezone specification (see the -u option for
details). If no timezone offset is specified, times are
interpreted as local. Whenever the file is written, all
dates in the file are converted to the local time zone,
without changing the UTC times. There may be only one entry
per filesystem at each level. The file /etc/dump- dates may
be edited to change any of the fields, if necessary.</p>

<p>-v The -v (verbose) makes dump to print extra
information which could be helpful in debug sessions.</p>

<p>-W Dump tells the operator what file systems need to be
dumped. This information is gleaned from the files
/etc/dumpdates and /etc/fstab. The -W option causes dump to
print out, for all file systems in /etc/dumpdates , and
recognized file systems in /etc/mtab and /etc/fstab. the
most recent dump date and level, and highlights those that
should be dumped. If the -W option is set, all other options
are ignored, and dump exits immediately.</p>

<p>-w Is like -W, but prints only recognized filesystems in
/etc/mtab and /etc/fstab which need to be dumped.</p>

<p>-y Compress every block to be written to the tape using
the lzo library. This doesnt compress as well as the zlib
library but its much faster. This option will work only when
dumping to a file or pipe or, when dumping to a tape drive,
if the tape drive is capable of writing variable length
blocks. You will need at least the 0.4b34 version of restore
in order to extract com- pressed tapes. Tapes written using
compression will not be com- patible with the BSD tape
format.</p>

<p>-zcompression level Compress every block to be written
on the tape using zlib library. This option will work only
when dumping to a file or pipe or, when dumping to a tape
drive, if the tape drive is capable of writing variable
length blocks. You will need at least the 0.4b22 version of
restore in order to extract com- pressed tapes. Tapes
written using compression will not be com- patible with the
BSD tape format. The (optional) parameter spec- ifies the
compression level zlib will use. The default compres- sion
level is 2. If the optional parameter is specified, there
should be no white space between the option letter and the
parameter.</p>

<p>Dump requires operator intervention on these conditions:
end of tape, end of dump, tape write error, tape open error
or disk read error (if there is more than a threshold of nr
errors). In addition to alerting all operators implied by
the -n key, dump interacts with the operator on dumps
control terminal at times when dump can no longer proceed,
or if something is grossly wrong. All questions dump poses
must be answered by typing yes or no, appropriately.</p>

<p>Since making a dump involves a lot of time and effort
for full dumps, dump checkpoints itself at the start of each
tape volume. If writing that volume fails for some reason,
dump will, with operator permission, restart itself from the
checkpoint after the old tape has been rewound and removed,
and a new tape has been mounted.</p>

<p>Dump tells the operator what is going on at periodic
intervals, includ- ing usually low estimates of the number
of blocks to write, the number of tapes it will take, the
time to completion, and the time to the tape change. The
output is verbose, so that others know that the terminal
controlling dump is busy, and will be for some time.</p>

<p>In the event of a catastrophic disk event, the time
required to restore all the necessary backup tapes or files
to disk can be kept to a mini- mum by staggering the
incremental dumps. An efficient method of stag- gering
incremental dumps to minimize the number of tapes
follows:</p>

<p>Always start with a level 0 backup, for example:
/sbin/dump -0u -f /dev/st0 /usr/src</p>

<p>This should be done at set intervals, say once a month
or once every two months, and on a set of fresh tapes that
is saved for- ever.</p>

<p>After a level 0, dumps of active file systems are taken
on a daily basis, using a modified Tower of Hanoi algorithm,
with this sequence of dump levels: 3 2 5 4 7 6 9 8 9 9
...</p>

<p>For the daily dumps, it should be possible to use a
fixed number of tapes for each day, used on a weekly basis.
Each week, a level 1 dump is taken, and the daily Hanoi
sequence repeats beginning with 3. For weekly dumps, another
fixed set of tapes per dumped file system is used, also on a
cyclical basis.</p>

<p>After several months or so, the daily and weekly tapes
should get rotated out of the dump cycle and fresh tapes
brought in.</p>

<p>(The 4.3BSD option syntax is implemented for backward
compatibility but is not documented here.)</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT TAPE If no -f option was specified, dump
will use the device speci- fied via TAPE as the dump device.
TAPE may be of the form tape- name, host:tapename, or
user@host:tapename.</p>

<p>RMT The environment variable RMT will be used to
determine the path- name of the remote rmt(8) program.</p>

<p>RSH Dump uses the contents of this variable to determine
the name of the remote shell command to use when doing
remote backups (rsh, ssh etc.). If this variable is not set,
rcmd(3) will be used, but only root will be able to do
remote backups.</p>

<p>FILES /dev/st0 default tape unit to dump to</p>

<p>/etc/dumpdates dump date records</p>

<p>/etc/fstab dump table: file systems and frequency</p>

<p>/etc/mtab dump table: mounted file systems</p>

<p>SEE ALSO fstab(5), restore(8), rmt(8)</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Many, and verbose.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY The format of the /etc/dumpdates file has
changed in release 0.4b34, however, the file will be read
correctly with either pre-0.4b34 or 0.4b34 and later
versions of dump provided that the machine on which dump is
run did not change timezones (which should be a fairly rare
occurrence).</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS Dump exits with zero status on success.
Startup errors are indicated with an exit code of 1;
abnormal termination is indicated with an exit code of
3.</p>

<p>BUGS It might be considered a bug that this version of
dump can only handle ext2/3 filesystems. Specifically, it
does not work with FAT filesys- tems.</p>

<p>Fewer than 32 read errors (change this with -I) on the
filesystem are ignored. If noticing read errors is
important, the output from dump can be parsed to look for
lines that contain the text read error.</p>

<p>When a read error occurs, dump prints out the
corresponding physical disk block and sector number and the
ext2/3 logical block number. It doesnt print out the
corresponding file name or even the inode number. The user
has to use debugfs(8), commands ncheck and icheck to
translate the ext2blk number printed out by dump into an
inode number, then into a file name.</p>

<p>Each reel requires a new process, so parent processes
for reels already written just hang around until the entire
tape is written.</p>

<p>The estimated number of tapes is not correct if
compression is on.</p>

<p>It would be nice if dump knew about the dump sequence,
kept track of the tapes scribbled on, told the operator
which tape to mount when, and provided more assistance for
the operator running restore.</p>

<p>Dump cannot do remote backups without being run as root,
due to its security history. Presently, it works if you set
it setuid (like it used to be), but this might constitute a
security risk. Note that you can set RSH to use a remote
shell program instead.</p>
