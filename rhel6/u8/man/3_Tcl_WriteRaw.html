<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Used for error
reporting and to look up a channel registered in it.</p>

<p>const char *fileName (in) The name of a local or network
file.</p>

<p>const char *mode (in) Specifies how the file is to be
accessed. May have any of the values allowed for the mode
argument to the Tcl open com- mand.</p>

<p>int permissions (in) POSIX-style permission flags such
as 0644. If a new file is created, these permissions will be
set on the created file.</p>

<p>int argc (in) The number of elements in argv.</p>

<p>const char **argv (in) Arguments for constructing a
command pipeline. These values have the same meaning as the
non-switch arguments to the Tcl exec command.</p>

<p>int flags (in) Specifies the disposition of the stdio
handles in pipeline: OR-ed combination of TCL_STDIN,
TCL_STDOUT, TCL_STDERR, and TCL_ENFORCE_MODE. If TCL_STDIN
is set, stdin for the first child in the pipe is the pipe
channel, otherwise it is the same as the standard input of
the invoking process; likewise for TCL_STDOUT and
TCL_STDERR. If TCL_ENFORCE_MODE is not set, then the pipe
can redirect stdio handles to override the stdio handles for
which TCL_STDIN, TCL_STDOUT and TCL_STDERR have been set. If
it is set, then such redirections cause an error.</p>

<p>ClientData handle (in) Operating system specific handle
for I/O to a file. For Unix this is a file descriptor, for
Win- dows it is a HANDLE.</p>

<p>int readOrWrite (in) OR-ed combination of TCL_READ- ABLE
and TCL_WRITABLE to indi- cate what operations are valid on
handle.</p>

<p>const char *channelName (in) The name of the
channel.</p>

<p>int *modePtr (out) Points at an integer variable that
will receive an OR-ed com- bination of TCL_READABLE and
TCL_WRITABLE denoting whether the channel is open for
reading and writing.</p>

<p>const char *pattern (in) The pattern to match on, passed
to Tcl_StringMatch, or NULL.</p>

<p>Tcl_Channel channel (in) A Tcl channel for input or out-
put. Must have been the return value from a procedure such

<p>Tcl_Obj *readObjPtr (in/out) A pointer to a Tcl Object
in which to store the characters read from the channel.</p>

<p>int charsToRead (in) The number of characters to read
from the channel. If the chan- nels encoding is binary, this
is equivalent to the number of bytes to read from the
channel.</p>

<p>int appendFlag (in) If non-zero, data read from the
channel will be appended to the object. Otherwise, the data
will replace the existing con- tents of the object.</p>

<p>char *readBuf (out) A buffer in which to store the bytes
read from the channel.</p>

<p>int bytesToRead (in) The number of bytes to read from
the channel. The buffer readBuf must be large enough to hold
this many bytes.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *lineObjPtr (in/out) A pointer to a Tcl object
in which to store the line read from the channel. The line
read will be appended to the current value of the
object.</p>

<p>Tcl_DString *lineRead (in/out) A pointer to a Tcl
dynamic string in which to store the line read from the
channel. Must have been initialized by the caller. The line
read will be appended to any data already in the dynamic

from charBuf or byteBuf and out- put to the channel.</p>

<p>Tcl_WideInt offset (in) How far to move the access point
in the channel at which the next input or output operation
will be applied, measured in bytes from the position given
by seek- Mode. May be either positive or negative.</p>

<p>int seekMode (in) Relative to which point to seek; used
with offset to calculate the new access point for the
channel. Legal values are SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, and
SEEK_END.</p>

<p>Tcl_WideInt length (in) The (non-negative) length to
truncate the channel the channel to.</p>

<p>const char *optionName (in) The name of an option
applicable to this channel, such as -block- ing. May have
any of the values accepted by the fconfigure com- mand.</p>

<p>Tcl_DString *optionValue (in) Where to store the value

<p>DESCRIPTION The Tcl channel mechanism provides a
device-independent and platform- independent mechanism for
performing buffered input and output opera- tions on a
variety of file, socket, and device types. The channel
mechanism is extensible to new channel types, by providing a
low-level channel driver for the new type; the channel
driver interface is described in the manual entry for
Tcl_CreateChannel. The channel mecha- nism provides a
buffering scheme modeled after Unixs standard I/O, and it
also allows for nonblocking I/O on channels.</p>

<p>The procedures described in this manual entry comprise
the C APIs of the generic layer of the channel architecture.
For a description of the channel driver architecture and how
to implement channel drivers for new types of channels, see
the manual entry for Tcl_CreateChannel.</p>

<p>TCL_OPENFILECHANNEL Tcl_OpenFileChannel opens a file
specified by fileName and returns a channel handle that can
be used to perform input and output on the file. This API is
modeled after the fopen procedure of the Unix stan- dard I/O
library. The syntax and meaning of all arguments is similar
to those given in the Tcl open command when opening a file.
If an error occurs while opening the channel,
Tcl_OpenFileChannel returns NULL and records a POSIX error
code that can be retrieved with Tcl_GetErrno. In addition,
if interp is non-NULL, Tcl_OpenFileChannel leaves an error
message in interp s result after any error. As of Tcl 8.4,
the object-based API Tcl_FSOpenFileChannel should be used in
pref- erence to Tcl_OpenFileChannel wherever possible.</p>

<p>The newly created channel is not registered in the
supplied inter- preter; to register it, use
Tcl_RegisterChannel, described below. If one of the standard
channels, stdin, stdout or stderr was previously closed, the
act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.</p>

<p>TCL_OPENCOMMANDCHANNEL Tcl_OpenCommandChannel provides a
C-level interface to the functions of the exec and open
commands. It creates a sequence of subprocesses specified by
the argv and argc arguments and returns a channel that can
be used to communicate with these subprocesses. The flags
argument indicates what sort of communication will exist
with the command pipeline.</p>

<p>If the TCL_STDIN flag is set then the standard input for
the first subprocess will be tied to the channel: writing to
the channel will provide input to the subprocess. If
TCL_STDIN is not set, then stan- dard input for the first
subprocess will be the same as this applica- tion s standard
input. If TCL_STDOUT is set then standard output from the
last subprocess can be read from the channel; otherwise it
goes to this application s standard output. If TCL_STDERR is
set, standard error output for all subprocesses is returned
to the channel and results in an error when the channel is
closed; otherwise it goes to this applications standard
error. If TCL_ENFORCE_MODE is not set, then argc and argv
can redirect the stdio handles to override TCL_STDIN,
TCL_STDOUT, and TCL_STDERR; if it is set, then it is an
error for argc and argv to override stdio channels for which
TCL_STDIN, TCL_STDOUT, and TCL_STDERR have been set.</p>

<p>If an error occurs while opening the channel,
Tcl_OpenCommandChannel returns NULL and records a POSIX
error code that can be retrieved with Tcl_GetErrno. In
addition, Tcl_OpenCommandChannel leaves an error mes- sage
in the interpreters result if interp is not NULL.</p>

<p>The newly created channel is not registered in the
supplied inter- preter; to register it, use
Tcl_RegisterChannel, described below. If one of the standard
channels, stdin, stdout or stderr was previously closed, the
act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.</p>

<p>TCL_MAKEFILECHANNEL Tcl_MakeFileChannel makes a
Tcl_Channel from an existing, platform-spe- cific, file
handle. The newly created channel is not registered in the
supplied interpreter; to register it, use
Tcl_RegisterChannel, described below. If one of the standard
channels, stdin, stdout or stderr was previously closed, the
act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.</p>

<p>TCL_GETCHANNEL Tcl_GetChannel returns a channel given
the channelName used to create it with Tcl_CreateChannel and
a pointer to a Tcl interpreter in interp. If a channel by
that name is not registered in that interpreter, the
procedure returns NULL. If the modePtr argument is not NULL,
it points at an integer variable that will receive an OR-ed
combination of TCL_READABLE and TCL_WRITABLE describing
whether the channel is open for reading and writing.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetChannelNames and Tcl_GetChannelNamesEx write the
names of the registered channels to the interpreters result
as a list object. Tcl_GetChannelNamesEx will filter these
names according to the pattern. If pattern is NULL, then it
will not do any filtering. The return value is TCL_OK if no
errors occurred writing to the result, otherwise it is
TCL_ERROR, and the error message is left in the interpreters
result.</p>

<p>TCL_REGISTERCHANNEL Tcl_RegisterChannel adds a channel
to the set of channels accessible in interp. After this
call, Tcl programs executing in that interpreter can refer
to the channel in input or output operations using the name
given in the call to Tcl_CreateChannel. After this call, the
channel becomes the property of the interpreter, and the
caller should not call Tcl_Close for the channel; the
channel will be closed automatically when it is unregistered
from the interpreter.</p>

<p>Code executing outside of any Tcl interpreter can call
Tcl_Register- Channel with interp as NULL, to indicate that
it wishes to hold a ref- erence to this channel.
Subsequently, the channel can be registered in a Tcl
interpreter and it will only be closed when the matching
number of calls to Tcl_UnregisterChannel have been made.
This allows code executing outside of any interpreter to
safely hold a reference to a channel that is also registered
in a Tcl interpreter.</p>

<p>This procedure interacts with the code managing the
standard channels. If no standard channels were initialized
before the first call to Tcl_RegisterChannel, they will get
initialized by that call. See Tcl_StandardChannels for a
general treatise about standard channels and the behaviour
of the Tcl library with regard to them.</p>

<p>TCL_UNREGISTERCHANNEL Tcl_UnregisterChannel removes a
channel from the set of channels acces- sible in interp.
After this call, Tcl programs will no longer be able to use
the channels name to refer to the channel in that
interpreter. If this operation removed the last registration
of the channel in any interpreter, the channel is also
closed and destroyed.</p>

<p>Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
Tcl_UnregisterChan- nel with interp as NULL, to indicate to
Tcl that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If
this is the last reference to the chan- nel, it will now be
closed. Tcl_UnregisterChannel is very similar to
Tcl_DetachChannel except that it will also close the channel
if no fur- ther references to it exist.</p>

<p>TCL_DETACHCHANNEL Tcl_DetachChannel removes a channel
from the set of channels accessible in interp. After this
call, Tcl programs will no longer be able to use the channel
s name to refer to the channel in that interpreter. Beyond
that, this command has no further effect. It cannot be used
on the standard channels (stdout, stderr, stdin), and will
return TCL_ERROR if passed one of those channels.</p>

<p>Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
Tcl_DetachChannel with interp as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
that it no longer holds a ref- erence to that channel. If
this is the last reference to the channel, unlike
Tcl_UnregisterChannel, it will not be closed.</p>

<p>TCL_ISSTANDARDCHANNEL Tcl_IsStandardChannel tests
whether a channel is one of the three stan- dard channels,
stdin, stdout or stderr. If so, it returns 1, otherwise
0.</p>

<p>No attempt is made to check whether the given channel or
the standard channels are initialized or otherwise
valid.</p>

<p>TCL_CLOSE Tcl_Close destroys the channel channel, which
must denote a currently open channel. The channel should not
be registered in any interpreter when Tcl_Close is called.
Buffered output is flushed to the channels output device
prior to destroying the channel, and any buffered input is
discarded. If this is a blocking channel, the call does not
return until all buffered data is successfully sent to the
channels output device. If this is a nonblocking channel and
there is buffered output that cannot be written without
blocking, the call returns immediately; output is flushed in
the background and the channel will be closed once all of
the buffered data has been output. In this case errors
during flushing are not reported.</p>

<p>If the channel was closed successfully, Tcl_Close
returns TCL_OK. If an error occurs, Tcl_Close returns
TCL_ERROR and records a POSIX error code that can be
retrieved with Tcl_GetErrno. If the channel is being closed
synchronously and an error occurs during closing of the
channel and interp is not NULL, an error message is left in
the interpreters result.</p>

<p>Note: it is not safe to call Tcl_Close on a channel that
has been reg- istered using Tcl_RegisterChannel; see the
documentation for Tcl_Regis- terChannel, above, for details.
If the channel has ever been given as the chan argument in a
call to Tcl_RegisterChannel, you should instead use
Tcl_UnregisterChannel, which will internally call Tcl_Close
when all calls to Tcl_RegisterChannel have been matched by
corresponding calls to Tcl_UnregisterChannel.</p>

<p>TCL_READCHARS AND TCL_READ Tcl_ReadChars consumes bytes
from channel, converting the bytes to UTF-8 based on the
channel s encoding and storing the produced data in
readObjPtr s string representation. The return value of
Tcl_ReadChars is the number of characters, up to
charsToRead, that were stored in readObjPtr. If an error
occurs while reading, the return value is -1 and
Tcl_ReadChars records a POSIX error code that can be
retrieved with Tcl_GetErrno.</p>

<p>Setting charsToRead to -1 will cause the command to read
all characters currently available (non-blocking) or
everything until eof (blocking mode).</p>

<p>The return value may be smaller than the value to read,
indicating that less data than requested was available. This
is called a short read. In blocking mode, this can only
happen on an end-of-file. In nonblock- ing mode, a short
read can also occur if there is not enough input cur- rently
available: Tcl_ReadChars returns a short count rather than
waiting for more data.</p>

<p>If the channel is in blocking mode, a return value of
zero indicates an end-of-file condition. If the channel is
in nonblocking mode, a return value of zero indicates either
that no input is currently available or an end-of-file
condition. Use Tcl_Eof and Tcl_InputBlocked to tell which of
these conditions actually occurred.</p>

<p>Tcl_ReadChars translates the various end-of-line
representations into the canonical n internal representation
according to the current end- of-line recognition mode.
End-of-line recognition and the various platform-specific
modes are described in the manual entry for the Tcl
fconfigure command.</p>

<p>As a performance optimization, when reading from a
channel with the encoding binary, the bytes are not
converted to UTF-8 as they are read. Instead, they are
stored in readObjPtr s internal representation as a
byte-array object. The string representation of this object
will only be constructed if it is needed (e.g., because of a
call to Tcl_Get- StringFromObj). In this way, byte-oriented
data can be read from a channel, manipulated by calling
Tcl_GetByteArrayFromObj and related functions, and then
written to a channel without the expense of ever converting
to or from UTF-8.</p>

<p>Tcl_Read is similar to Tcl_ReadChars, except that it
does not do encod- ing conversions, regardless of the
channels encoding. It is depre- cated and exists for
backwards compatibility with non-internationalized Tcl
extensions. It consumes bytes from channel and stores them
in readBuf, performing end-of-line translations on the way.
The return value of Tcl_Read is the number of bytes, up to
bytesToRead, written in readBuf. The buffer produced by
Tcl_Read is not null-terminated. Its contents are valid from
the zeroth position up to and excluding the position
indicated by the return value.</p>

<p>Tcl_ReadRaw is the same as Tcl_Read but does not
compensate for stack- ing. While Tcl_Read (and the other
functions in the API) always get their data from the topmost
channel in the stack the supplied channel is part of,
Tcl_ReadRaw does not. Thus this function is only usable for
transformational channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the
middle of a stack of channels, to move data from the channel
below into the trans- formation.</p>

<p>TCL_GETSOBJ AND TCL_GETS Tcl_GetsObj consumes bytes from
channel, converting the bytes to UTF-8 based on the channel
s encoding, until a full line of input has been seen. If the
channels encoding is binary, each byte read from the channel
is treated as an individual Unicode character. All of the
characters of the line except for the terminating
end-of-line charac- ter(s) are appended to lineObjPtrs
string representation. The end-of- line character(s) are
read and discarded.</p>

<p>If a line was successfully read, the return value is
greater than or equal to zero and indicates the number of
bytes stored in lineObjPtr. If an error occurs, Tcl_GetsObj
returns -1 and records a POSIX error code that can be
retrieved with Tcl_GetErrno. Tcl_GetsObj also returns -1 if
the end of the file is reached; the Tcl_Eof procedure can be
used to distinguish an error from an end-of-file
condition.</p>

<p>If the channel is in nonblocking mode, the return value
can also be -1 if no data was available or the data that was
available did not contain an end-of-line character. When -1
is returned, the Tcl_InputBlocked procedure may be invoked
to determine if the channel is blocked because of input
unavailability.</p>

<p>Tcl_Gets is the same as Tcl_GetsObj except the resulting
characters are appended to the dynamic string given by
lineRead rather than a Tcl object.</p>

<p>TCL_UNGETS Tcl_Ungets is used to add data to the input
queue of a channel, at either the head or tail of the queue.
The pointer input points to the data that is to be added.
The length of the input to add is given by inputLen. A
non-zero value of addAtEnd indicates that the data is to be
added at the end of queue; otherwise it will be added at the
head of the queue. If channel has a sticky EOF set, no data
will be added to the input queue. Tcl_Ungets returns
inputLen or -1 if an error occurs.</p>

<p>TCL_WRITECHARS, TCL_WRITEOBJ, AND TCL_WRITE
Tcl_WriteChars accepts bytesToWrite bytes of character data
at charBuf. The UTF-8 characters in the buffer are converted
to the channels encoding and queued for output to channel.
If bytesToWrite is nega- tive, Tcl_WriteChars expects
charBuf to be null-terminated and it out- puts everything up
to the null.</p>

<p>Data queued for output may not appear on the output
device immediately, due to internal buffering. If the data
should appear immediately, call Tcl_Flush after the call to
Tcl_WriteChars, or set the -buffering option on the channel
to none. If you wish the data to appear as soon as a
complete line is accepted for output, set the -buffering
option on the channel to line mode.</p>

<p>The return value of Tcl_WriteChars is a count of how
many bytes were accepted for output to the channel. This is
either greater than zero to indicate success or -1 to
indicate that an error occurred. If an error occurs,
Tcl_WriteChars records a POSIX error code that may be
retrieved with Tcl_GetErrno.</p>

<p>Newline characters in the output data are translated to
platform-spe- cific end-of-line sequences according to the
-translation option for the channel. This is done even if
the channel has no encoding.</p>

<p>Tcl_WriteObj is similar to Tcl_WriteChars except it
accepts a Tcl object whose contents will be output to the
channel. The UTF-8 charac- ters in writeObjPtrs string
representation are converted to the chan- nels encoding and
queued for output to channel. As a performance optimization,
when writing to a channel with the encoding binary, UTF-8
characters are not converted as they are written. Instead,
the bytes in writeObjPtrs internal representation as a
byte-array object are written to the channel. The byte-array
representation of the object will be constructed if it is
needed. In this way, byte-oriented data can be read from a
channel, manipulated by calling Tcl_GetByteArrayFro- mObj
and related functions, and then written to a channel without
the expense of ever converting to or from UTF-8.</p>

<p>Tcl_Write is similar to Tcl_WriteChars except that it
does not do encoding conversions, regardless of the channels
encoding. It is dep- recated and exists for backwards
compatibility with non-international- ized Tcl extensions.
It accepts bytesToWrite bytes of data at byteBuf and queues
them for output to channel. If bytesToWrite is negative,
Tcl_Write expects byteBuf to be null-terminated and it
outputs every- thing up to the null.</p>

<p>Tcl_WriteRaw is the same as Tcl_Write but does not
compensate for stacking. While Tcl_Write (and the other
functions in the API) always feed their input to the topmost
channel in the stack the supplied chan- nel is part of,
Tcl_WriteRaw does not. Thus this function is only usable for
transformational channel drivers, i.e. drivers used in the
middle of a stack of channels, to move data from the
transformation into the channel below it.</p>

<p>TCL_FLUSH Tcl_Flush causes all of the buffered output
data for channel to be written to its underlying file or
device as soon as possible. If the channel is in blocking
mode, the call does not return until all the buffered data
has been sent to the channel or some error occurred. The
call returns immediately if the channel is nonblocking; it
starts a background flush that will write the buffered data
to the channel even- tually, as fast as the channel is able
to absorb it.</p>

<p>The return value is normally TCL_OK. If an error occurs,
Tcl_Flush returns TCL_ERROR and records a POSIX error code
that can be retrieved with Tcl_GetErrno.</p>

<p>TCL_SEEK Tcl_Seek moves the access point in channel
where subsequent data will be read or written. Buffered
output is flushed to the channel and buffered input is
discarded, prior to the seek operation.</p>

<p>Tcl_Seek normally returns the new access point. If an
error occurs, Tcl_Seek returns -1 and records a POSIX error
code that can be retrieved with Tcl_GetErrno. After an
error, the access point may or may not have been moved.</p>

<p>TCL_TELL Tcl_Tell returns the current access point for a
channel. The returned value is -1 if the channel does not
support seeking.</p>

<p>TCL_TRUNCATECHANNEL Tcl_TruncateChannel truncates the
file underlying channel to a given length of bytes. It
returns TCL_OK if the operation succeeded, and TCL_ERROR
otherwise.</p>

<p>TCL_GETCHANNELOPTION Tcl_GetChannelOption retrieves, in
optionValue, the value of one of the options currently in
effect for a channel, or a list of all options and their
values. The channel argument identifies the channel for
which to query an option or retrieve all options and their
values. If option- Name is not NULL, it is the name of the
option to query; the options value is copied to the Tcl
dynamic string denoted by optionValue. If optionName is
NULL, the function stores an alternating list of option
names and their values in optionValue, using a series of
calls to Tcl_DStringAppendElement. The various preexisting
options and their possible values are described in the
manual entry for the Tcl fconfig- ure command. Other options
can be added by each channel type. These channel type
specific options are described in the manual entry for the
Tcl command that creates a channel of that type; for
example, the addi- tional options for TCP based channels are
described in the manual entry for the Tcl socket command.
The procedure normally returns TCL_OK. If an error occurs,
it returns TCL_ERROR and calls Tcl_SetErrno to store an
appropriate POSIX error code.</p>

<p>TCL_SETCHANNELOPTION Tcl_SetChannelOption sets a new
value newValue for an option optionName on channel. The
procedure normally returns TCL_OK. If an error occurs, it
returns TCL_ERROR; in addition, if interp is non-NULL,
Tcl_SetChannelOption leaves an error message in the
interpreters result.</p>

<p>TCL_EOF Tcl_Eof returns a nonzero value if channel
encountered an end of file during the last input
operation.</p>

<p>TCL_INPUTBLOCKED Tcl_InputBlocked returns a nonzero
value if channel is in nonblocking mode and the last input
operation returned less data than requested because there
was insufficient data available. The call always returns
zero if the channel is in blocking mode.</p>

<p>TCL_INPUTBUFFERED Tcl_InputBuffered returns the number
of bytes of input currently buffered in the internal buffers
for a channel. If the channel is not open for reading, this
function always returns zero.</p>

<p>TCL_OUTPUTBUFFERED Tcl_OutputBuffered returns the number
of bytes of output currently buffered in the internal
buffers for a channel. If the channel is not open for
writing, this function always returns zero.</p>

<p>PLATFORM ISSUES The handles returned from
Tcl_GetChannelHandle depend on the platform and the channel
type. On Unix platforms, the handle is always a Unix file
descriptor as returned from the open system call. On Windows
platforms, the handle is a file HANDLE when the channel was
created with Tcl_OpenFileChannel, Tcl_OpenCommandChannel, or
Tcl_MakeFileChan- nel. Other channel types may return a
different type of handle on Win- dows platforms.</p>
