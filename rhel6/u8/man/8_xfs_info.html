<p>xfs_growfs(8) xfs_growfs(8)</p>

<p>NAME xfs_growfs, xfs_info - expand an XFS filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfs_growfs [ -dilnrxV ] [ -D size ] [ -e
rtextsize ] [ -L size ] [ -m maxpct ] [ -t mtab ] [ -R size
] mount-point xfs_info [ -t mtab ] mount-point</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xfs_growfs expands an existing XFS
filesystem (see xfs(5)). The mount- point argument is the
pathname of the directory where the filesystem is mounted.
The filesystem must be mounted to be grown (see mount(8)).
The existing contents of the filesystem are undisturbed, and
the added space becomes available for additional file
storage.</p>

<p>xfs_info is equivalent to invoking xfs_growfs with the
-n option (see discussion below).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d | -D size Specifies that the data section of
the filesystem should be grown. If the -D size option is
given, the data section is grown to that size, otherwise the
data section is grown to the largest size possible with the
-d option. The size is expressed in filesystem blocks.</p>

<p>-e Allows the real-time extent size to be specified. In
mkfs.xfs(8) this is specified with -r extsize=nnnn.</p>

<p>-i The new log is an internal log (inside the data
section). [NOTE: This option is not implemented]</p>

<p>-l | -L size Specifies that the log section of the
filesystem should be grown, shrunk, or moved. If the -L size
option is given, the log section is changed to be that size,
if possible. The size is expressed in filesystem blocks. The
size of an internal log must be smaller than the size of an
allocation group (this value is printed at mkfs(8) time). If
neither -i nor -x is given with -l, the log continues to be
internal or external as it was before. [NOTE: These options
are not implemented]</p>

<p>-m Specify a new value for the maximum percentage of
space in the filesystem that can be allocated as inodes. In
mkfs.xfs(8) this is specified with -i maxpct=nn.</p>

<p>-n Specifies that no change to the filesystem is to be
made. The filesystem geometry is printed, and argument
checking is per- formed, but no growth occurs.</p>

<p>-r | -R size Specifies that the real-time section of the
filesystem should be grown. If the -R size option is given,
the real-time section is grown to that size, otherwise the
real-time section is grown to the largest size possible with
the -r option. The size is expressed in filesystem blocks.
The filesystem does not need to have contained a real-time
section before the xfs_growfs opera- tion.</p>

<p>-t Specifies an alternate mount table file (default is
/proc/mounts if it exists, else /etc/mtab). This is used
when working with filesystems mounted without writing to
/etc/mtab file - refer to mount(8) for further details.</p>

<p>-V Prints the version number and exits. The mount-point
argument is not required with -V.</p>

<p>xfs_growfs is most often used in conjunction with
logical volumes (see md(4) and lvm(8) on Linux). However, it
can also be used on a regular disk partition, for example if
a partition has been enlarged while retaining the same
starting block.</p>

<p>PRACTICAL USE Filesystems normally occupy all of the
space on the device where they reside. In order to grow a
filesystem, it is necessary to provide added space for it to
occupy. Therefore there must be at least one spare new disk
partition available. Adding the space is often done through
the use of a logical volume manager.</p>
