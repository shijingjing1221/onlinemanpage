<p>NAME vmstat - Report virtual memory statistics</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vmstat [-a] [-n] [-t] [-S unit] [delay [
count]] vmstat [-s] [-n] [-S unit] vmstat [-m] [-n] [delay [
count]] vmstat [-d] [-n] [delay [ count]] vmstat [-p disk
partition] [-n] [delay [ count]] vmstat [-f] vmstat [-V]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vmstat reports information about processes,
memory, paging, block IO, traps, and cpu activity.</p>

<p>The first report produced gives averages since the last
reboot. Addi- tional reports give information on a sampling
period of length delay. The process and memory reports are
instantaneous in either case.</p>

<p>Options The -a switch displays active/inactive memory,
given a 2.5.41 kernel or better.</p>

<p>The -f switch displays the number of forks since boot.
This includes the fork, vfork, and clone system calls, and
is equivalent to the total number of tasks created. Each
process is represented by one or more tasks, depending on
thread usage. This display does not repeat.</p>

<p>The -t switch adds timestamp to the output.</p>

<p>The -m switch displays slabinfo.</p>

<p>The -n switch causes the header to be displayed only
once rather than periodically.</p>

<p>The -s switch displays a table of various event counters
and memory statistics. This display does not repeat.</p>

<p>delay is the delay between updates in seconds. If no
delay is speci- fied, only one report is printed with the
average values since boot.</p>

<p>count is the number of updates. If no count is specified
and delay is defined, count defaults to infinity.</p>

<p>The -d reports disk statistics (2.5.70 or above
required)</p>

<p>The -w enlarges field width for big memory sizes</p>

<p>The -p followed by some partition name for detailed
statistics (2.5.70 or above required)</p>

<p>The -S followed by k or K or m or M switches outputs
between 1000, 1024, 1000000, or 1048576 bytes</p>

<p>The -V switch results in displaying version
information.</p>

<p>FIELD DESCRIPTION FOR VM MODE Procs r: The number of
processes waiting for run time. b: The number of processes
in uninterruptible sleep.</p>

<p>Memory swpd: the amount of virtual memory used. free:
the amount of idle memory. buff: the amount of memory used
as buffers. cache: the amount of memory used as cache.
inact: the amount of inactive memory. (-a option) active:
the amount of active memory. (-a option)</p>

<p>Swap si: Amount of memory swapped in from disk (/s). so:
Amount of memory swapped to disk (/s).</p>

<p>IO bi: Blocks received from a block device (blocks/s).
bo: Blocks sent to a block device (blocks/s).</p>

<p>System in: The number of interrupts per second,
including the clock. cs: The number of context switches per
second.</p>

<p>CPU These are percentages of total CPU time. us: Time
spent running non-kernel code. (user time, including nice
time) sy: Time spent running kernel code. (system time) id:
Time spent idle. Prior to Linux 2.5.41, this includes
IO-wait time. wa: Time spent waiting for IO. Prior to Linux
2.5.41, included in idle. st: Time stolen from a virtual
machine. Prior to Linux 2.6.11, unknown.</p>

<p>FIELD DESCRIPTION FOR DISK MODE Reads total: Total reads
completed successfully merged: grouped reads (resulting in
one I/O) sectors: Sectors read successfully ms: milliseconds
spent reading</p>

<p>Writes total: Total writes completed successfully
merged: grouped writes (resulting in one I/O) sectors:
Sectors written successfully ms: milliseconds spent
writing</p>

<p>IO cur: I/O in progress s: seconds spent for I/O</p>

<p>FIELD DESCRIPTION FOR DISK PARTITION MODE reads: Total
number of reads issued to this partition read sectors: Total
read sectors for partition writes : Total number of writes
issued to this partition requested writes: Total number of
write requests made for partition</p>

<p>FIELD DESCRIPTION FOR SLAB MODE cache: Cache name num:
Number of currently active objects total: Total number of
available objects size: Size of each object pages: Number of
pages with at least one active object totpages: Total number
of allocated pages pslab: Number of pages per slab</p>

<p>NOTES vmstat does not require special permissions.</p>

<p>These reports are intended to help identify system
bottlenecks. Linux vmstat does not count itself as a running
process.</p>

<p>All linux blocks are currently 1024 bytes. Old kernels
may report blocks as 512 bytes, 2048 bytes, or 4096
bytes.</p>

<p>Since procps 3.1.9, vmstat lets you choose units (k, K,
m, M) default is K (1024 bytes) in the default mode</p>

<p>vmstat uses slabinfo 1.1 FIXME</p>

<p>FILES /proc/meminfo /proc/stat /proc/*/stat</p>

<p>SEE ALSO iostat(1), sar(1), mpstat(1), ps(1), top(1),
free(1)</p>

<p>BUGS Does not tabulate the block io per device or count
the number of system calls.</p>
