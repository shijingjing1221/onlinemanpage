<p>WCTYPE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCTYPE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wctype - define character class</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;</p>

<p>wctype_t wctype(const char *property);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wctype() function is defined for valid
character class names as defined in the current locale. The
property argument is a string iden- tifying a generic
character class for which codeset-specific type information
is required. The following character class names shall be
defined in all locales:</p>

<p>alnum digit punct alpha graph space blank lower upper
cntrl print xdigit</p>

<p>Additional character class names defined in the locale
definition file (category LC_CTYPE ) can also be
specified.</p>

<p>The function shall return a value of type wctype_t,
which can be used as the second argument to subsequent calls
of iswctype(). The wctype() function shall determine values
of wctype_t according to the rules of the coded character
set defined by character type information in the programs
locale (category LC_CTYPE ). The values returned by wctype()
shall be valid until a call to setlocale() that modifies the
category LC_CTYPE .</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wctype() function shall return 0 if the
given character class name is not valid for the current
locale (category LC_CTYPE ); otherwise, it shall return an
object of type wctype_t that can be used in calls to
iswctype().</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>
