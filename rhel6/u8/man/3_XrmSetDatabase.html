<p>SYNTAX #include &lt;X11/Xresource.h&gt;</p>

<p>XrmDatabase XrmGetFileDatabase(char *filename);</p>

<p>void XrmPutFileDatabase(XrmDatabase database, char
*stored_db);</p>

<p>XrmDatabase XrmGetStringDatabase(char *data,</p>

<p>void XrmDestroyDatabase(XrmDatabase database);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS filename Specifies the resource database file
name.</p>

<p>database Specifies the database that is to be used.</p>

<p>stored_db Specifies the file name for the stored
database.</p>

<p>data Specifies the database contents using a string.</p>

<p>database Specifies the resource database.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XrmGetFileDatabase function opens the
specified file, creates a new resource database, and loads
it with the specifications read in from the specified file.
The specified file should contain a sequence of entries in
valid ResourceLine format (see section 15.1); the database
that results from reading a file with incorrect syntax is
implementa- tion-dependent. The file is parsed in the
current locale, and the database is created in the current
locale. If it cannot open the spec- ified file,
XrmGetFileDatabase returns NULL.</p>

<p>The XrmPutFileDatabase function stores a copy of the
specified database in the specified file. Text is written to
the file as a sequence of entries in valid ResourceLine
format (see section 15.1). The file is written in the locale
of the database. Entries containing resource names that are
not in the Host Portable Character Encoding or contain- ing
values that are not in the encoding of the database locale,
are written in an implementation-dependent manner. The order
in which entries are written is implementation-dependent.
Entries with repre- sentation types other than String are
ignored.</p>

<p>The XrmGetStringDatabase function creates a new database
and stores the resources specified in the specified
null-terminated string. XrmGet- StringDatabase is similar to
XrmGetFileDatabase except that it reads the information out
of a string instead of out of a file. The string should
contain a sequence of entries in valid ResourceLine format
(see section 15.1) terminated by a null character; the
database that results from using a string with incorrect
syntax is implementation-dependent. The string is parsed in
the current locale, and the database is created in the
current locale.</p>

<p>If database is NULL, XrmDestroyDatabase returns
immediately.</p>

<p>The XrmLocaleOfDatabase function returns the name of the
locale bound to the specified database, as a null-terminated
string. The returned locale name string is owned by Xlib and
should not be modified or freed by the client. Xlib is not
permitted to free the string until the database is
destroyed. Until the string is freed, it will not be modi-
fied by Xlib.</p>

<p>The XrmGetDatabase function returns the database
associated with the specified display. It returns NULL if a
database has not yet been set.</p>

<p>The XrmSetDatabase function associates the specified
resource database (or NULL) with the specified display. The
database previously associ- ated with the display (if any)
is not destroyed. A client or toolkit may find this function
convenient for retaining a database once it is
constructed.</p>

<p>FILE SYNTAX The syntax of a resource file is a sequence
of resource lines termi- nated by newline characters or the
end of the file. The syntax of an individual resource line
is:</p>

<p>ResourceLine = Comment | IncludeFile | ResourceSpec |
&lt;empty line&gt; Comment = &quot;!&quot; {&lt;any
character except null or newline&gt;} IncludeFile =
&quot;#&quot; WhiteSpace &quot;include&quot; WhiteSpace
FileName WhiteSpace FileName = &lt;valid filename for
operating system&gt; ResourceSpec = WhiteSpace ResourceName
WhiteSpace &quot;:&quot; WhiteSpace Value ResourceName =
[Binding] {Component Binding} ComponentName Binding =
&quot;.&quot; | &quot;*&quot; WhiteSpace = {&lt;space&gt; |
&lt;horizontal tab&gt;} Component = &quot;?&quot; |
ComponentName ComponentName = NameChar {NameChar} NameChar =
&quot;a&quot;-&quot;z&quot; | &quot;A&quot;-&quot;Z&quot; |
&quot;0&quot;-&quot;9&quot; | &quot;_&quot; | &quot;-&quot;
Value = {&lt;any character except null or unescaped
newline&gt;}</p>

<p>Elements separated by vertical bar (|) are alternatives.
Curly braces ({...}) indicate zero or more repetitions of
the enclosed elements. Square brackets ([...]) indicate that
the enclosed element is optional. Quotes (&quot;...&quot;)
are used around literal characters.</p>

<p>IncludeFile lines are interpreted by replacing the line
with the con- tents of the specified file. The word include
must be in lower- case. The file name is interpreted
relative to the directory of the file in which the line
occurs (for example, if the file name contains no directory
or contains a relative directory specification).</p>

<p>If a ResourceName contains a contiguous sequence of two
or more Binding characters, the sequence will be replaced
with single . character if the sequence contains only .
characters; otherwise, the sequence will be replaced with a
single * character.</p>

<p>A resource database never contains more than one entry
for a given ResourceName. If a resource file contains
multiple lines with the same ResourceName, the last line in
the file is used.</p>

<p>Any white space characters before or after the name or
colon in a ResourceSpec are ignored. To allow a Value to
begin with white space, the two-character sequence space
(backslash followed by space) is recognized and replaced by
a space character, and the two-character sequence tab
(backslash followed by horizontal tab) is recognized and
replaced by a horizontal tab character. To allow a Value to
con- tain embedded newline characters, the two-character is
sequence 0 recognized and replaced by a newline character.
To allow a Value to be broken across multiple lines in a
text file, the two-character sequence newline (backslash
followed by newline) is recognized and removed from the
value. To allow a Value to contain arbitrary character
codes, the four-character sequence nnn, where each n is a
digit character in the range of 0-7, is recognized and
replaced with a single byte that contains the octal value
specified by the sequence. Finally, the two-character
sequence \ is recognized and replaced with a single
backslash.</p>
