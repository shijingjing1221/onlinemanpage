<p>NAME kate - Advanced text editor for KDE</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kate [-s, --start name] [-u, --use] [-p, --pid
pid] [-e, --encoding name] [-l, --line line] [-c, --column
column] [-i, --stdin] [KDE Generic Options] [Qt Generic
Options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Kate is the KDE Advanced Text Editor.</p>

<p>Kate also provides the editor part for various
applications, under the name KWrite.</p>

<p>Some of Kates many features include configurable syntax
highlighting for languages ranging from C and C++ to HTML to
bash scripts, the abil- ity to create and maintain projects,
a multiple document interface (MDI), and a self-contained
terminal emulator.</p>

<p>But Kate is more than a programmers editor. Its ability
to open sever- al files at once makes it ideal for editing
UNIX&reg;s many configuration files. This document was
written in Kate.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s, --start name Start Kate with a given
session.</p>

<p>-u, --use Use an already running Kate</p>

<p>-p, --pid pid Only try to reuse kate instance with this
pid</p>

<p>-e, --encoding name Set encoding for the file to
open</p>

<p>You can use this to force a file opened in utf-8 format,
for in- stance. (The command iconv -l provides a list of
encodings, which may be helpful to you.)</p>

<p>-l, --line line Navigate to this line</p>

<p>-c, --column column Navigate to this column</p>

<p>-i, --stdin Read the contents of stdin</p>

<p>SEE ALSO kwrite(1)</p>

<p>More detailed user documentation is available from
help:/kate (either enter this URL into Konqueror, or run
khelpcenter help:/kate).</p>

<p>There is also further information available at the Kate
website: http://kate.kde.org/.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To open a file named source.cpp at column 15,
line 25, in an existing Kate window, you could use:</p>

<p>kate -c 15 -l 25 -u source.cpp</p>

<p>If you have an active internet connection, you can take
advantage of KDE s network transparency to open a file from
an ftp site. If you do not have write permission on the
remote server, the file will be opened read only and you
will be prompted for a local filename to save to if you make
changes. If you do have write permission, changes will be
saved transparently over the network.</p>
