<p>IFCONFIG(8) Linux Programmer s Manual IFCONFIG(8)</p>

<p>NAME ifconfig - configure a network interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ifconfig [interface] ifconfig interface
[aftype] options | address ...</p>

<p>NOTE This program is obsolete! For replacement check ip
addr and ip link. For statistics use ip -s link.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Ifconfig is used to configure the
kernel-resident network interfaces. It is used at boot time
to set up interfaces as necessary. After that, it is usually
only needed when debugging or when system tuning is
needed.</p>

<p>If no arguments are given, ifconfig displays the status
of the cur- rently active interfaces. If a single interface
argument is given, it displays the status of the given
interface only; if a single -a argu- ment is given, it
displays the status of all interfaces, even those that are
down. Otherwise, it configures an interface.</p>

<p>Address Families If the first argument after the
interface name is recognized as the name of a supported
address family, that address family is used for decoding and
displaying all protocol addresses. Currently supported
address families include inet (TCP/IP, default), inet6
(IPv6), ax25 (AMPR Packet Radio), ddp (Appletalk Phase 2),
ipx (Novell IPX) and netrom (AMPR Packet radio). All numbers
supplied as parts in IPv4 dot- ted decimal notation may be
decimal, octal, or hexadecimal, as speci- fied in the ISO C
standard (that is, a leading 0x or 0X implies hex- adecimal;
otherwise, a leading 0 implies octal; otherwise, the number
is interpreted as decimal). Use of hexamedial and octal
numbers is not RFC-compliant and therefore its use is
discouraged and may go away.</p>

<p>OPTIONS interface The name of the interface. This is
usually a driver name fol- lowed by a unit number, for
example eth0 for the first Ethernet interface.</p>

<p>up This flag causes the interface to be activated. It is
implic- itly specified if an address is assigned to the
interface.</p>

<p>down This flag causes the driver for this interface to
be shut down.</p>

<p>[-]arp Enable or disable the use of the ARP protocol on
this interface.</p>

<p>[-]promisc Enable or disable the promiscuous mode of the
interface. If selected, all packets on the network will be
received by the interface.</p>

<p>[-]allmulti Enable or disable all-multicast mode. If
selected, all multi- cast packets on the network will be
received by the interface.</p>

<p>metric N This parameter sets the interface metric. It is
not available under GNU/Linux.</p>

<p>mtu N This parameter sets the Maximum Transfer Unit
(MTU) of an inter- face.</p>

<p>dstaddr addr Set the remote IP address for a
point-to-point link (such as PPP). This keyword is now
obsolete; use the pointopoint keyword instead.</p>

<p>netmask addr Set the IP network mask for this interface.
This value defaults to the usual class A, B or C network
mask (as derived from the interface IP address), but it can
be set to any value.</p>

<p>add addr/prefixlen Add an IPv6 address to an
interface.</p>

<p>del addr/prefixlen Remove an IPv6 address from an
interface.</p>

<p>tunnel ::aa.bb.cc.dd Create a new SIT (IPv6-in-IPv4)
device, tunnelling to the given destination.</p>

<p>irq addr Set the interrupt line used by this device. Not
all devices can dynamically change their IRQ setting.</p>

<p>io_addr addr Set the start address in I/O space for this
device.</p>

<p>mem_start addr Set the start address for shared memory
used by this device. Only a few devices need this.</p>

<p>media type Set the physical port or medium type to be
used by the device. Not all devices can change this setting,
and those that can vary in what values they support. Typical
values for type are 10base2 (thin Ethernet), 10baseT
(twisted-pair 10Mbps Ethernet), AUI (external transceiver)
and so on. The special medium type of auto can be used to
tell the driver to auto-sense the media. Again, not all
drivers can do this.</p>

<p>[-]broadcast [addr] If the address argument is given,
set the protocol broadcast address for this interface.
Otherwise, set (or clear) the IFF_BROADCAST flag for the
interface.</p>

<p>[-]pointopoint [addr] This keyword enables the
point-to-point mode of an interface, meaning that it is a
direct link between two machines with nobody else listening
on it. If the address argument is also given, set the
protocol address of the other side of the link, just like
the obsolete dstaddr keyword does. Otherwise, set or clear
the IFF_POINTOPOINT flag for the interface.</p>

<p>hw class address Set the hardware address of this
interface, if the device driver supports this operation. The
keyword must be followed by the name of the hardware class
and the printable ASCII equivalent of the hardware address.
Hardware classes currently supported include ether
(Ethernet), ax25 (AMPR AX.25), ARCnet and netrom (AMPR
NET/ROM).</p>

<p>multicast Set the multicast flag on the interface. This
should not nor- mally be needed as the drivers set the flag
correctly them- selves.</p>

<p>address The IP address to be assigned to this
interface.</p>

<p>txqueuelen length Set the length of the transmit queue
of the device. It is useful to set this to small values for
slower devices with a high latency (modem links, ISDN) to
prevent fast bulk transfers from disturbing interactive
traffic like telnet too much.</p>

<p>NOTES Since kernel release 2.2 there are no explicit
interface statistics for alias interfaces anymore. The
statistics printed for the original address are shared with
all alias addresses on the same device. If you want
per-address statistics you should add explicit accounting
rules for the address using the ipchains(8) command.</p>

<p>Interrupt problems with Ethernet device drivers fail
with EAGAIN. See
http://www.scyld.com/expert/irq-conflict.html for more
information.</p>

<p>BUGS Ifconfig uses obsolete kernel interface. It uses
the ioctl access method to get the full address information,
which limits hardware addresses to 8 bytes. Since an
Infiniband address is 20 bytes, only the first 8 bytes of
Infiniband address are displayed.</p>

<p>While appletalk DDP and IPX addresses will be displayed
they cannot be altered by this command.</p>
