<p>NAME quotacheck - scan a filesystem for disk usage,
create, check and repair quota files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS quotacheck [ -gubcfinvdMmR ] [ -F quota-format
] -a | filesystem</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION quotacheck examines each filesystem, builds
a table of current disk usage, and compares this table
against that recorded in the disk quota file for the
filesystem (this step is ommitted if option -c is speci-
fied). If any inconsistencies are detected, both the quota
file and the current system copy of the incorrect quotas are
updated (the latter only occurs if an active filesystem is
checked which is not advised). By default, only user quotas
are checked. quotacheck expects each filesystem to be
checked to have quota files named [a]quota.user and
[a]quota.group located at the root of the associated
filesystem. If a file is not present, quotacheck will create
it.</p>

<p>If the quota file is corrupted, quotacheck tries to save
as much data as possible. Rescuing data may need user
intervention. With no addi- tional options quotacheck will
simply exit in such a situation. When in interactive mode
(option -i) , the user is asked for advice. Advice can also
be provided from command line (see option -n) , which is
useful when quotacheck is run automatically (ie. from
script) and failure is unacceptable.</p>

<p>quotacheck should be run each time the system boots and
mounts non- valid filesystems. This is most likely to happen
after a system crash.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended to run quotacheck with quotas
turned off for the filesystem. Otherwise, possible damage or
loss to data in the quota files can result. It is also
unwise to run quotacheck on a live filesystem as actual
usage may change during the scan. To prevent this,
quotacheck tries to remount the filesystem read-only before
starting the scan. After the scan is done it remounts the
filesystem read-write. You can disable this with option -m.
You can also make quotacheck ignore the failure to remount
the filesystem read-only with option -M.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b, --backup Forces quotacheck to make backups
of the quota file before writ- ing the new data.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose quotacheck reports its operation as it
progresses. Normally it operates silently. If the option is
specified twice, also the current directory is printed (note
that printing can slow down the scan measurably).</p>

<p>-d, --debug Enable debugging mode. It will result in a
lot of information which can be used in debugging the
program. The output is very verbose and the scan will be
slow.</p>

<p>-u, --user Only user quotas listed in /etc/mtab or on
the filesystems spec- ified are to be checked. This is the
default action.</p>

<p>-g, --group Only group quotas listed in /etc/mtab or on
the filesystems specified are to be checked.</p>

<p>-c, --create-files Dont read existing quota files. Just
perform a new scan and save it to disk. quotacheck also
skips scanning of old quota files when they are not
found.</p>

<p>-f, --force Forces checking and writing of new quota
files on filesystems with quotas enabled. This is not
recommended as the created quota files may be out of
sync.</p>

<p>-M, --try-remount This flag forces checking of
filesystem in read-write mode if a remount fails. Do this
only when you are sure no process will write to a filesystem
while scanning.</p>

<p>-m, --no-remount Dont try to remount filesystem
read-only. See comment with option -M.</p>

<p>-i, --interactive Interactive mode. By default
quotacheck exits when it finds an error. In interactive mode
user is asked for input instead. See option -n.</p>

<p>-n, --use-first-dquot If the quota files become
corrupted, it is possible for dupli- cate entries for a
single user or group ID to exist. Normally in this case,
quotacheck exits or asks user for input. When this option is
set, the first entry found is always used (this option works
in interactive mode too).</p>

<p>-F, --format=format-name Check and fix quota files of
specified format (ie. dont perform format auto-detection).
This is recommended as detection might not work well on
corrupted quota files. Possible format names are: vfsold
Original quota format with 16-bit UIDs / GIDs, vfsv0 Quota
format with 32-bit UIDs / GIDs, 64-bit space usage, 32-bit
inode usage and limits, vfsv1 Quota format with 64-bit quota
limits and usage, rpc (quota over NFS), xfs (quota on XFS
filesystem)</p>

<p>-a, --all Check all mounted non-NFS filesystems in
/etc/mtab</p>

<p>-R, --exclude-root When used together with the -a
option, all filesystems except for the root filesystem are
checked for quotas.</p>

<p>NOTE quotacheck should only be run by super-user.
Non-privileged users are presumably not allowed to read all
the directories on the given filesystem.</p>
