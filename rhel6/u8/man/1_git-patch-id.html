<p>NAME git-patch-id - Compute unique ID for a patch</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git patch-id &lt; &lt;patch&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A &quot;patch ID&quot; is nothing but a SHA1
of the diff associated with a patch, with whitespace and
line numbers ignored. As such, its &quot;reasonably
stable&quot;, but at the same time also reasonably unique,
i.e., two patches that have the same &quot;patch ID&quot;
are almost guaranteed to be the same thing.</p>

<p>IOW, you can use this thing to look for likely duplicate
commits.</p>

<p>When dealing with git diff-tree output, it takes
advantage of the fact that the patch is prefixed with the
object name of the commit, and outputs two 40-byte
hexadecimal strings. The first string is the patch ID, and
the second string is the commit ID. This can be used to make
a mapping from patch ID to commit ID.</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;patch&gt; The diff to create the ID of.</p>
