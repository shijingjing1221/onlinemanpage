<p>NAME ldns-verify-zone - read a DNSSEC signed zone and
verify it.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ldns-verify-zone ZONEFILE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ldns-verify-zone reads a DNS zone file and
verifies it.</p>

<p>RRSIG resource records are checked against the DNSKEY
set at the zone apex.</p>

<p>Each name is checked for an NSEC(3), if appropriate.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Show usage and exit</p>

<p>-a Apex only, check only the zone apex</p>

<p>-e period Signatures may not expire within this period.
Default no period is used.</p>

<p>-i period Signatures must have been valid at least this
long. Default signatures should just be valid now.</p>

<p>-k file A file that contains a trusted DNSKEY or DS rr.
This option may be given more than once.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if -k is not specified, and a default
trust anchor (/var/lib/unbound/root.key) exists and contains
a valid DNSKEY or DS record, it will be used as the trust
anchor.</p>

<p>-p [0-100] Only check this percentage of the zone. Which
names to check is determined randomly. Defaults to 100.</p>

<p>-S Chase signature(s) to a known key. The network may be
accessed to validate the zones DNSKEYs. (implies -k)</p>

<p>-t YYYYMMDDhhmmss | [+|-]offset Set the validation time
either by an absolute time value or as an offset in seconds
from the current time.</p>

<p>-v Show the version and exit</p>

<p>-V number Set the verbosity level (default 3):</p>

<p>0: Be silent 1: Print result, and any errors 2: Same as
1 for now 3: Print result, any errors, and the names that
are being checked 4: Same as 3 for now 5: Print the zone
after it has been read, the result, any errors, and the
names that are being checked</p>

<p>periods are given in ISO 8601 duration format:
P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S</p>

<p>If no file is given standard input is read.</p>

<p>FILES /var/lib/unbound/root.key The file from which
trusted keys are loaded for signature chas- ing, when no -k
option is given.</p>
