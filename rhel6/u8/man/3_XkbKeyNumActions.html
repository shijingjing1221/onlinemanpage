<p>XkbKeyNumActions(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbKeyNumActions(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbKeyNumActions - Computes the number of actions
associated with the key corresponding to keycode</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int XkbKeyNumActions (XkbDescPtr xkb, KeyCode
keycode);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - xkb Xkb description of interest</p>

<p>- keycode keycode of interest</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A key action defines the effect key presses
and releases have on the internal state of the server. For
example, the expected key action associated with pressing
the Shift key is to set the Shift modifier. There is zero or
one key action associated with each keysym bound to each
key.</p>

<p>Just as the entire list of key symbols for the keyboard
mapping is held in the syms field of the client map, the
entire list of key actions for the keyboard mapping is held
in the acts array of the server map. The total size of acts
is specified by size_acts, and the number of entries is
specified by num_acts.</p>

<p>The key_acts array, indexed by keycode, describes the
actions associ- ated with a key. The key_acts array has
min_key_code unused entries at the start to allow direct
indexing using a keycode. If a key_acts entry is zero, it
means the key does not have any actions associated with it.
If an entry is not zero, the entry represents an index into
the acts field of the server map, much as the offset field
of a KeySymMapRec structure is an index into the syms field
of the client map.</p>

<p>The reason the acts field is a linear list of XkbActions
is to reduce the memory consumption associated with a
keymap. Because Xkb allows individual keys to have multiple
shift levels and a different number of groups per key, a
single two-dimensional array of KeySyms would poten- tially
be very large and sparse. Instead, Xkb provides a small two-
dimensional array of XkbActions for each key. To store all
of these individual arrays, Xkb concatenates each array
together in the acts field of the server map.</p>

<p>The key action structures consist only of fields of type
char or unsigned char. This is done to optimize data
transfer when the server sends bytes over the wire. If the
fields are anything but bytes, the server has to sift
through all of the actions and swap any nonbyte fields.
Because they consist of nothing but bytes, it can just copy
them out.</p>

<p>XkbKeyNumActions computes the number of actions
associated with the key corresponding to keycode. This
should be the same value as the result of XkbKeyNumSyms.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The KeySymMapRec structure is defined as
follows:</p>

<p>#define XkbNumKbdGroups 4 #define XkbMaxKbdGroup
(XkbNumKbdGroups-1)</p>

<p>typedef struct { / map to keysyms for a single keycode
*/ unsigned char kt_index[XkbNumKbdGroups]; / key type index
for each group */ unsigned char group_info; / # of groups
and out of range group handling */ unsigned char width; /
max # of shift levels for key */ unsigned short offset; /
index to keysym table in syms array */ } XkbSymMapRec,
*XkbSymMapPtr;</p>
