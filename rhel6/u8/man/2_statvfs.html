<p>STATVFS(3) Linux Programmer s Manual STATVFS(3)</p>

<p>NAME statvfs, fstatvfs - get filesystem statistics</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/statvfs.h&gt;</p>

<p>int statvfs(const char *path, struct statvfs *buf); int
fstatvfs(int fd, struct statvfs *buf);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The function statvfs() returns information
about a mounted filesystem. path is the pathname of any file
within the mounted filesystem. buf is a pointer to a statvfs
structure defined approximately as follows:</p>

<p>struct statvfs { unsigned long f_bsize; /* Filesystem
block size */ unsigned long f_frsize; /* Fragment size */
fsblkcnt_t f_blocks; /* Size of fs in f_frsize units */
fsblkcnt_t f_bfree; /* Number of free blocks */ fsblkcnt_t
f_bavail; /* Number of free blocks for unprivileged users */
fsfilcnt_t f_files; /* Number of inodes */ fsfilcnt_t
f_ffree; /* Number of free inodes */ fsfilcnt_t f_favail; /*
Number of free inodes for unprivileged users */ unsigned
long f_fsid; /* Filesystem ID */ unsigned long f_flag; /*
Mount flags */ unsigned long f_namemax; /* Maximum filename
length */ };</p>

<p>Here the types fsblkcnt_t and fsfilcnt_t are defined in
&lt;sys/types.h&gt;. Both used to be unsigned long.</p>

<p>The field f_flag is a bit mask indicating various
options that were employed when mounting this filesystem. It
contains zero or more of the following flags:</p>

<p>ST_MANDLOCK Mandatory locking is permitted on the
filesystem (see fcntl(2)).</p>

<p>ST_NOATIME Do not update access times; see mount(2).</p>

<p>ST_NODEV Disallow access to device special files on this
filesystem.</p>

<p>ST_NODIRATIME Do not update directory access times; see
mount(2).</p>

<p>ST_NOEXEC Execution of programs is disallowed on this
filesystem.</p>

<p>ST_NOSUID The set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are
ignored by exec(3) for executable files on this
filesystem</p>

<p>ST_RDONLY This filesystem is mounted read-only.</p>

<p>ST_RELATIME Update atime relative to mtime/ctime; see
mount(2).</p>

<p>ST_SYNCHRONOUS Writes are synched to the filesystem
immediately (see the description of O_SYNC in open(2)).</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether all members of the returned
struct have mean- ingful values on all filesystems.</p>

<p>fstatvfs() returns the same information about an open
file referenced by descriptor fd.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES (statvfs()) Search permission is denied
for a component of the path prefix of path. (See also
path_resolution(7).)</p>

<p>EBADF (fstatvfs()) fd is not a valid open file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EFAULT Buf or path points to an invalid address.</p>

<p>EINTR This call was interrupted by a signal.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from the
filesystem.</p>

<p>ELOOP (statvfs()) Too many symbolic links were
encountered in trans- lating path.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG (statvfs()) path is too long.</p>

<p>ENOENT (statvfs()) The file referred to by path does not
exist.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOSYS The filesystem does not support this call.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR (statvfs()) A component of the path prefix of
path is not a directory.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW Some values were too large to be represented
in the returned struct.</p>

<p>ATTRIBUTES Multithreading (see pthreads(7)) The
statvfs() and fstatvfs() functions are thread-safe.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>Only the ST_NOSUID and ST_RDONLY flags of the f_flag
field are speci- fied in POSIX.1. To obtain definitions of
the remaining flags, one must define _GNU_SOURCE.</p>

<p>NOTES The Linux kernel has system calls statfs(2) and
fstatfs(2) to support this library call.</p>

<p>In glibc versions before 2.13, statvfs() populated the
bits of the f_flag field by scanning the mount options shown
in /proc/mounts. How- ever, starting with Linux 2.6.36, the
underlying statfs(2) system call provides the necessary
information via the f_flags field, and since glibc version
2.13, the statvfs() function will use information from that
field rather than scanning /proc/mounts.</p>

<p>The glibc implementations of</p>

<p>pathconf(path, _PC_REC_XFER_ALIGN); pathconf(path,
_PC_ALLOC_SIZE_MIN); pathconf(path,
_PC_REC_MIN_XFER_SIZE);</p>

<p>respectively use the f_frsize, f_frsize, and f_bsize
fields returned by a call to statvfs() with the argument
path.</p>
