<p>NAME prove - Run tests through a TAP harness.</p>

<p>USAGE prove [options] [files or directories]</p>

<p>OPTIONS Boolean options:</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Print all test lines. -l, --lib Add
&rsquo;lib&rsquo; to the path for your tests (-Ilib). -b,
--blib Add &rsquo;blib/lib&rsquo; and
&rsquo;blib/arch&rsquo; to the path for your tests -s,
--shuffle Run the tests in random order. -c, --color Colored
test output (default). --nocolor Do not color test output.
--count Show the X/Y test count when not verbose (default)
--nocount Disable the X/Y test count. -D --dry Dry run. Show
test that would have run. --ext Set the extension for tests
(default &rsquo;.t&rsquo;) -f, --failures Show failed tests.
-o, --comments Show comments. --ignore-exit Ignore exit
status from test scripts. -m, --merge Merge test
scripts&rsquo; STDERR with their STDOUT. -r, --recurse
Recursively descend into directories. --reverse Run the
tests in reverse order. -q, --quiet Suppress some test
output while running tests. -Q, --QUIET Only print summary
results. -p, --parse Show full list of TAP parse errors, if
any. --directives Only show results with TODO or SKIP
directives. --timer Print elapsed time after each test.
--normalize Normalize TAP output in verbose output -T Enable
tainting checks. -t Enable tainting warnings. -W Enable
fatal warnings. -w Enable warnings. -h, --help Display this
help -?, Display this help -H, --man Longer manpage for
prove --norc Don&rsquo;t process default .proverc</p>

<p>Options that take arguments:</p>

<p>-I Library paths to include. -P Load plugin (searches
App::Prove::Plugin::*.) -M Load a module. -e, --exec
Interpreter to run the tests (&rsquo;&rsquo; for compiled
tests.) --harness Define test harness to use. See
TAP::Harness. --formatter Result formatter to use. See
TAP::Harness. -a, --archive Store the resulting TAP in an
archive file. -j, --jobs N Run N test jobs in parallel (try
9.) --state=opts Control prove&rsquo;s persistent state.
--rc=rcfile Process options from rcfile</p>

<p>NOTES .proverc If ~/.proverc or ./.proverc exist they
will be read and any options they contain processed before
the command line options. Options in .proverc are specified
in the same way as command line options:</p>

<p># .proverc --state=hot,fast,save -j9</p>

<p>Additional option files may be specified with the
&quot;--rc&quot; option. Default option file processing is
disabled by the &quot;--norc&quot; option.</p>

<p>Under Windows and VMS the option file is named _proverc
rather than .proverc and is sought only in the current
directory.</p>

<p>Reading from &quot;STDIN&quot; If you have a list of
tests (or URLs, or anything else you want to test) in a
file, you can add them to your tests by using a -:</p>

<p>prove - &lt; my_list_of_things_to_test.txt</p>

<p>See the &quot;README&quot; in the &quot;examples&quot;
directory of this distribution.</p>

<p>Default Test Directory If no files or directories are
supplied, &quot;prove&quot; looks for all files matching the
pattern &quot;t/*.t&quot;.</p>

<p>Colored Test Output Colored test output is the default,
but if output is not to a terminal, color is disabled. You
can override this by adding the &quot;--color&quot;
switch.</p>

<p>Color support requires Term::ANSIColor on Unix-like
platforms and Win32::Console windows. If the necessary
module is not installed colored output will not be
available.</p>

<p>Exit Code If the tests fail &quot;prove&quot; will exit
with non-zero status.</p>

<p>Arguments to Tests It is possible to supply arguments to
tests. To do so separate them from prove s own arguments
with the arisdottle, ::. For example</p>

<p>prove -v t/mytest.t :: --url http://example.com</p>

<p>would run t/mytest.t with the options --url
http://example.com. When running multiple tests they will
each receive the same arguments.</p>

<p>&quot;--exec&quot; Normally you can just pass a list of
Perl tests and the harness will know how to execute them.
However, if your tests are not written in Perl or if you
want all tests invoked exactly the same way, use the
&quot;-e&quot;, or &quot;--exec&quot; switch:</p>

<p>prove --exec &rsquo;/usr/bin/ruby -w&rsquo; t/ prove
--exec &rsquo;/usr/bin/perl -Tw -mstrict -Ilib&rsquo; t/
prove --exec &rsquo;/path/to/my/customer/exec&rsquo;</p>

<p>&quot;--merge&quot; If you need to make sure your
diagnostics are displayed in the correct order relative to
test results you can use the &quot;--merge&quot; option to
merge the test scripts STDERR into their STDOUT.</p>

<p>This guarantees that STDOUT (where the test results
appear) and STDOUT (where the diagnostics appear) will stay
in sync. The harness will display any diagnostics your tests
emit on STDERR.</p>

<p>Caveat: this is a bit of a kludge. In particular note
that if anything that appears on STDERR looks like a test
result the test harness will get confused. Use this option
only if you understand the consequences and can live with
the risk.</p>

<p>&quot;--state&quot; You can ask &quot;prove&quot; to
remember the state of previous test runs and select and/or
order the tests to be run based on that saved state.</p>

<p>The &quot;--state&quot; switch requires an argument
which must be a comma separated list of one or more of the
following options.</p>

<p>&quot;last&quot; Run the same tests as the last time the
state was saved. This makes it possible, for example, to
recreate the ordering of a shuffled test.</p>

<p># Run all tests in random order $ prove -b --state=save
--shuffle</p>

<p># Run them again in the same order $ prove -b
--state=last</p>

<p>&quot;failed&quot; Run only the tests that failed on the
last run.</p>

<p># Run all tests $ prove -b --state=save</p>

<p># Run failures $ prove -b --state=failed</p>

<p>If you also specify the &quot;save&quot; option newly
passing tests will be excluded from subsequent runs.</p>

<p># Repeat until no more failures $ prove -b
--state=failed,save</p>

<p>&quot;passed&quot; Run only the passed tests from last
time. Useful to make sure that no new problems have been
introduced.</p>

<p>&quot;all&quot; Run all tests in normal order. Multple
options may be specified, so to run all tests with the
failures from last time first:</p>

<p>$ prove -b --state=failed,all,save</p>

<p>&quot;hot&quot; Run the tests that most recently failed
first. The last failure time of each test is stored. The
&quot;hot&quot; option causes tests to be run in
most-recent- failure order.</p>

<p>$ prove -b --state=hot,save</p>

<p>Tests that have never failed will not be selected. To
run all tests with the most recently failed first use</p>

<p>$ prove -b --state=hot,all,save</p>

<p>This combination of options may also be specified
thus</p>

<p>$ prove -b --state=adrian</p>

<p>&quot;todo&quot; Run any tests with todos.</p>

<p>&quot;slow&quot; Run the tests in slowest to fastest
order. This is useful in conjunction with the &quot;-j&quot;
parallel testing switch to ensure that your slowest tests
start running first.</p>

<p>$ prove -b --state=slow -j9</p>

<p>&quot;fast&quot; Run test tests in fastest to slowest
order.</p>

<p>&quot;new&quot; Run the tests in newest to oldest order
based on the modification times of the test scripts.</p>

<p>&quot;old&quot; Run the tests in oldest to newest
order.</p>

<p>&quot;fresh&quot; Run those test scripts that have been
modified since the last test run.</p>

<p>&quot;save&quot; Save the state on exit. The state is
stored in a file called .prove (_prove on Windows and VMS)
in the current directory.</p>

<p>The &quot;--state&quot; switch may be used more than
once.</p>

<p>$ prove -b --state=hot --state=all,save</p>

<p>@INC prove introduces a separation between &quot;options
passed to the perl which runs prove&quot; and &quot;options
passed to the perl which runs tests&quot;; this distinction
is by design. Thus the perl which is running a test starts
with the default @INC. Additional library directories can be
added via the &quot;PERL5LIB&quot; environment variable, via
-Ifoo in &quot;PERL5OPT&quot; or via the &quot;-Ilib&quot;
option to prove.</p>

<p>Taint Mode Normally when a Perl program is run in taint
mode the contents of the &quot;PERL5LIB&quot; environment
variable do not appear in @INC.</p>

<p>Because &quot;PERL5LIB&quot; is often used during
testing to add build directories to @INC prove (actually
TAP::Parser::Source::Perl) passes the names of any
directories found in &quot;PERL5LIB&quot; as -I switches.
The net effect of this is that &quot;PERL5LIB&quot; is
honoured even when prove is run in taint mode.</p>

<p>PLUGINS Plugins can be loaded using the
&quot;-PI&lt;plugin&gt;&quot; syntax, eg:</p>

<p>prove -PMyPlugin</p>

<p>This will search for a module named
&quot;App::Prove::Plugin::MyPlugin&quot;, or failing that,
&quot;MyPlugin&quot;. If the plugin can t be found,
&quot;prove&quot; will complain &amp; exit.</p>

<p>You can pass arguments to your plugin by appending
&quot;=arg1,arg2,etc&quot; to the plugin name:</p>

<p>prove -PMyPlugin=fou,du,fafa</p>

<p>Please check individual plugin documentation for more
details.</p>
