<p>NAME amanda-devices - Configuring and Using Amanda
Devices</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Device API specifies a generic interface
between Amanda and storage devices such as tapes or disks.
This manual page describes the device drivers included with
Amanda.</p>

<p>This is a user-level description of the API, and does
not address details that are only of concern to developers.
For that purpose, consult the Amanda source code and
http://wiki.zmanda.com.</p>

<p>The term &quot;device driver&quot; describes the
software that can communicate with some kind of backend
storage, e.g., a tape driver. A &quot;device&quot; is the
storage element itself, usually a piece of hardware. When
discussing a device and its driver as a unit, the term
&quot;device&quot; is sometimes also used to refer to the
combination of device and driver.</p>

<p>SPECIFYING DEVICES Device names take the form TYPE:NODE,
where TYPE selects a device driver, and NODE provides
further information to that driver. The syntax for each
device driver is given in the corresponding section
below.</p>

<p>Devices are described in amanda.conf(5) with
&quot;device&quot; sections, e.g.,</p>

<p>define device top_drive { tapedev
&quot;tape:/dev/nst0&quot; device_property
&quot;BLOCK_SIZE&quot; &quot;131072&quot; } A device
defininition creates a device &quot;alias&quot;, in this
case named top_drive, which can then be named in the global
tapedev parameter:</p>

<p>tapedev &quot;top_drive&quot;</p>

<p>The global tapedev parameter can also specify a literal
device name. For example,</p>

<p>tapedev &quot;file:/amdisks&quot; is equivalent to</p>

<p>tapedev &quot;default&quot; define device default {
tapedev &quot;file:/amdisks&quot; } Device properties
specified outside of any device definition apply to all
devices. This syntax is provided mainly for backward
compatibility, and for simple Amanda configurations. Note
that there is no way to provide properties specific to a
device without defining a device alias.</p>

<p>See amanda.conf(5) for more information on Amanda
configuration.</p>

<p>DEVICES This section lists the device drivers included
with Amanda, and basic instructions for using them. For
complete How-To information, consult the Amanda wiki at
http://wiki.zmanda.com.</p>

<p>Null Device tapedev &quot;null:&quot;</p>

<p>The null device driver only supports writing, and
discards all data. It is generally only useful for testing
purposes.</p>

<p>RAIT Device tapedev
&quot;rait:tape:/dev/rmt/tps0d{4,5,6}n&quot;</p>

<p>The RAIT device driver mirrors or stripes data over
multiple &quot;child&quot; devices. The child devices are
specified using a shell-like syntax, where alternatives are
enclosed in braces and separated by commas.</p>

<p>With two child devices, the RAIT device driver mirrors
data such that the two devices contain identical data and
can be used singly for recovery. With more than two devices,
the RAIT device &quot;stripes&quot; data across all but one
device and writes a parity block to the final device, usable
for data recovery in the event of a device or volume
failure. The RAIT device scales its blocksize as necessary
to match the number of children that will be used to store
data.</p>

<p>When a child device is known to have failed, the RAIT
device should be reconfigured to replace that device with
the text &quot;ERROR&quot;, e.g.,</p>

<p>tapedev
&quot;rait:{tape:/dev/st0,ERROR,tape:/dev/st2}&quot; This
will cause the RAIT device to start up in degraded mode,
reconstructing the data from the missing device.</p>

<p>Like ordinary RAID drivers, the RAIT device driver can
automatically enter degraded mode when one of its child
devices fails. However, the RAIT device cannot automatically
recover from any write error nor write any data in degraded
mode. When reading, certain errors may be fatal (rather than
causing degraded mode). And in any case, labels on all
volumes must initially match (labeled or otherwise). If you
have lost one volume from a set, explicitly start the device
in degraded mode as described above.</p>

<p>Child Device Block Sizes The RAIT device driver requires
that all of its child devices use the same block size. If no
block sizes are specified, the driver selects the block size
closest to 32k that is within the MIN_BLOCK_SIZE -
MAX_BLOCK_SIZE range of all child devices, and calculates
its own blocksize according to the formula rait_blocksize =
child_blocksize * (num_children - 1). If a block size is
specified for the RAIT device, then it calculates its child
block sizes according to the formula child_blocksize =
rait_blocksize / (num_children - 1). Either way, it sets the
BLOCK_SIZE property of each child device accordingly.</p>

<p>S3 Device tapedev
&quot;s3:foocorp-backups/DailySet1-&quot; device_property
&quot;S3_ACCESS_KEY&quot; &quot;MYACCESSKEY&quot;
device_property &quot;S3_SECRET_KEY&quot;
&quot;MYSECRETKEY&quot;</p>

<p>The S3 device driver uploads data to the Amazon S3
&quot;storage cloud&quot;. Its device name is a
slash-sparated combination of bucket name and prefix:
&quot;s3:BUCKET/PREFIX&quot;. Since buckets must be unique
across all Amazon S3 users, and since the number of buckets
allowed to each user is limited, the driver can store
multiple Amanda volumes in a single S3 bucket, distinguished
by prefix. The prefix and slash can be omitted if they are
not needed: &quot;s3:BUCKET&quot;.</p>

<p>The access and secret keys used to authenticate to
Amazon S3 are provided as properties.</p>

<p>The S3 device driver stores each block in a distinct S3
object. Due to high HTTP overhead for each request, use of
larger than normal block sizes (&gt; 1 megabyte) is
reccomended with the S3 device.</p>

<p>You can control where your data is physically stored by
Amazon S3 using a location constraint. Setting this affects
can affect both billing and legal concerns, so you are
encouraged to consult Amazon&acute;s documentation for
details.</p>

<p>To control location constraints, set the
S3_BUCKET_LOCATION property. Currently, there are two valid
settings: &quot;&quot; (any location) and &quot;EU&quot;
(Europe). If the S3_BUCKET_LOCATION is set, Amanda will
check to make sure that the setting agrees with the
constraint currently on the bucket.</p>

<p>Tape Device tapedev &quot;tape:/dev/nst0&quot;</p>

<p>The tape device driver interacts with a tape drive. The
device uses the operating system&acute;s built-in tape
support, which is generally similar to that available via
the command-line utilities dd(1) and mt(1).</p>

<p>The tape device name should specify a path to the
operating system&acute;s device file.</p>

<p>VFS Device tapedev &quot;file:/path/to/vtape&quot;</p>

<p>The VFS device driver stores data on a UNIX filesystem.
Note that although one typically uses the VFS device driver
to store data on hard disks, the driver does not interface
with any hardware on a block level.</p>

<p>The device name specifies a path to a directory which
must exist and contain a &quot;data/&quot; subdirectory.
Each tape file is stored as a distinct file in this
directory, the name of which reflects the Amanda header in
the tape file. Block boundaries are not maintained: the
driver supports reads of arbitrary size, regardless of the
blocksize used to write the data.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES Device drivers use properties as a generic
means to interact with other parts of Amanda. Some
properties are set by the device driver and used by Amanda
to determine how its devices should be used. Other
properties can be set by Amanda or by the user to influence
the driver&acute;s behavior. Properties are set for a
particular device, so that if you have two tape devices,
they will not share property values.</p>

<p>Properties are specified in amanda.conf with the
device-property parameter. The syntax looks like this:</p>

<p>device_property &quot;FROBNICATOR_PATH&quot;
&quot;/var/frobd/state&quot; device_property
&quot;BYTES_PER_FORTNIGHT&quot; &quot;128k&quot;
device_property &quot;USE_QUBITS&quot; &quot;no&quot;</p>

<p>Both the property name and the property value are always
quoted. String values are given as simple strings, like
FROBNICATOR_PATH in the example above. Integer values can be
specified with any of the suffixes given in the &quot;VALUE
SUFFIXES&quot; section of amanda.conf(5), like
BYTES_PER_FORTNIGHT, above. Boolean values can be specified
as any of &quot;true&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;1&quot;,
&quot;0&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, like
USE_QUBITS, above. Some properties have special formats, as
described below.</p>

<p>Some properties are set based on other configuration
values, such as tapetype parameters. These special cases are
detailed under the appropriate property, below.</p>

<p>The order in which device properties are set is as
follows:</p>

<p>1. Tapetype parameters (including length, blocksize, and
readblocksize) are translated into device properties and set
accordingly.</p>

<p>2. Device properties from any device_property
configuration parameters are set, in the order they appear
in the configuration file.</p>

<p>Properties described as read-only are not accessible to
users. They are listed here for completeness.</p>

<p>COMMON PROPERTIES Note that some of these properties are
currently unused, and present only for future expansion. Not
all devices implement all of these properties.</p>

<p>APPENDABLE</p>

<p>(read-only) This boolean property indicates whether this
device supports appending data to volumes.</p>

<p>BLOCK_SIZE</p>

<p>(read-write) This property gives the block size, in
bytes, that will be used to write to the device. The usual
suffixes (&quot;kbytes&quot;, etc.) are allowed. The
tapetype parameter blocksize sets this property.</p>

<p>CANONICAL_NAME</p>

<p>(read-only) This property contains the full canonical
name for this device. This name may not be the same as the
user-supplied name, but is a valid name by which to access
this device.</p>

<p>COMPRESSION</p>

<p>(read-write) This boolean property represents the
compression status of the device, and can be used to enable
and disable such compression. This applies mostly to tape
devices, although many tape devices do not support setting
compression from software.</p>

<p>COMPRESSION_RATE</p>

<p>(read-only) This property gives the compression rate, as
a decimal ratio. It may be a measured value over some
unspecified period or a simple estimate.</p>

<p>CONCURRENCY</p>

<p>(read-only) This property indicates the level of
concurrent access that this device supports.</p>

<p>FREE_SPACE</p>

<p>(read-only) This property gives the amount of free space
available on the current volume, if known. This is often an
estimate; for example, tape devices can only estimate the
amount of tape left on a spool.</p>

<p>MAX_BLOCK_SIZE</p>

<p>(read-only) This property gives the maximum block size
this device can support. See BLOCK SIZES, below.</p>

<p>MEDIUM_ACCESS_TYPE</p>

<p>(read-only) This property gives the type of the media in
the device: read only, WORM (Write Once, Read Many),
read/write, or write only. Write-only devices do not support
recovery, but the data are not necessarily thrown out.</p>

<p>MIN_BLOCK_SIZE</p>

<p>(read-write) This property gives the minimum block size
this device can support. See BLOCK SIZES, below.</p>

<p>MAX_VOLUME_USAGE</p>

<p>(read-write) On devices that support it, this property
will limit the total amount of data written to a volume;
attempts to write beyond this point will cause the device to
simulate &quot;out of space.&quot; Zero means no limit. The
tapetype parameter length sets this property.</p>

<p>PARTIAL_DELETION</p>

<p>(read-only) This property indicates whether the device
supports deletion of specific files. Aside from linear
tapes, most devices can support this feature. It is
currently unused by Amanda.</p>

<p>STREAMING</p>

<p>(read-only) This property gives the streaming
requirement for this device. For example, tape drives often
require a steady supply of data to avoid shoe-shining, while
disk devices have no such requirement.</p>

<p>VERBOSE</p>

<p>(read-write) If this boolean property is set, then the
device will produce verbose debugging output. This property
is not recognized by all devices.</p>

<p>BLOCK SIZES Amanda writes device data in blocks. On most
devices the block boundaries are embedded in the media along
with the data itself, so subsequent reads must use the same
block sizes. On tape devices, the block size is dictated by
the capabilities of the hardware -- buffer sizes, physical
format, and so on.</p>

<p>Amanda has historically supported a single, fixed block
size -- usually 32k. The Device API adds the ability to
specify a block size at runtime, using the BLOCK_SIZE
property. Devices provide MIN_BLOCK_SIZE and MAX_BLOCK_SIZE
as a guide to the range of acceptable block sizes. Note that
this does not imply that all sizes in the range
MIN_BLOCK_SIZE - MAX_BLOCK_SIZE are available -- the device
may require that block sizes are even multiples of some
power of two, for example. Consult the documentation for
your hardware and operating system for more information.</p>

<p>Most devices are flexible enough to read a volume using
a different block size than that with which it was written.
This can be useful when handling old volumes written with a
smaller blocksize, or volumes of unknown blocksize.
Unfortunately, some tape devices do not detect oversized
blocks correctly, and may lose data if the configured block
size is smaller than the volume&acute;s block size. The tape
device driver has a READ_BUFFER_SIZE property which
specifies the minimum buffer size that will be allocated for
reads from tape. If the hardware supports it, setting this
property allows Amanda to correctly read from tapes written
with any blocksize less than or equal to READ_BUFFER
SIZE.</p>

<p>Note The RAIT device does not support flexible block
sizes, as its parity algorithm requires that all child
devices have the same, fixed block size.</p>

<p>DRIVER-SPECIFIC PROPERTIES S3 Device S3_ACCESS_KEY</p>

<p>(read-write) This property gives the Amazon S3 access
key used to access the service.</p>

<p>S3_BUCKET_LOCATION</p>

<p>(read-write) Location constraint for buckets on Amazon
S3. Currently, it can be set to &quot;&quot;, for no
constraint (i.e. store data in the US), or &quot;EU&quot;
(i.e. store data in the EU). See Amazon&acute;s
documentation for details and latest information</p>

<p>S3_SECRET_KEY</p>

<p>(read-write) This property gives the Amazon S3 secret
key used to access the service.</p>

<p>S3_SSL</p>

<p>(read-write) Whether or not to use SSL/TLS to secure
communications with Amazon S3.</p>

<p>S3_USER_TOKEN</p>

<p>(read-write) This property specifies the user token for
Amanda Enterprise Edition customers.</p>

<p>Most Amanda devices work just fine without any
properties, but not the S3 device. A typical S3
configuration will have an access key and secret key
specified:</p>

<p>device_property &quot;S3_ACCESS_KEY&quot;
&quot;27D3B8C6C4E7AA423C2B37C72A0D22C8&quot; device_property
&quot;S3_SECRET_KEY&quot;
&quot;agphc2Q7Zmxragphc2RmO2xragpzZGY7a2xqCgr&quot;</p>

<p>Tape Device Most of these properties are automatically
detected, but can be overridden in the configuration file if
the autodetection fails. Note that tape drives are required
to at least support the MTREW (rewind) operation; all other
operations can be emulated with the MTREW and read data
operations.</p>

<p>BROKEN_GMT_ONLINE</p>

<p>(read-write) Set this boolean property if the
system&acute;s GMT_ONLINE macro gives incorrect results.
This is currently true for the Linux IDE-TAPE driver.</p>

<p>BSF</p>

<p>(read-write) This boolean property specifies whether the
device driver may execute the MTBSF operation (backward seek
file).</p>

<p>BSF_AFTER_EOM</p>

<p>(read-write) This boolean property specifies whether the
device driver should execute an MTBSF (backward seek file)
operation after MTEOM (seek to end of recorded data) in
order to append.</p>

<p>BSR</p>

<p>(read-write) This boolean property specifies whether the
device driver may use the MTBSR operation (backward seek
record).</p>

<p>EOM</p>

<p>(read-write) This boolean property specifies whether the
device driver may use the MTEOM command (seek to end of
recorded data).</p>

<p>FINAL_FILEMARKS</p>

<p>(read-write) This integer property gives the number of
filemarks that should be written at EOD. It is usually 1 or
2.</p>

<p>FSF</p>

<p>(read-write) This boolean property specifies whether the
device driver may use the MTFSF operation (forward seek
file).</p>

<p>FSF_AFTER_FILEMARK</p>

<p>(read-write) This boolean property specifies whether the
device driver needs a FSF to go the next file after the
filemark is read. Default to &quot;TRUE&quot; on Solaris and
&quot;FALSE&quot; on all others machines.</p>

<p>FSR</p>

<p>(read-write) This boolean property specifies whether the
device driver may use the MTFSR operation (forward seek
record).</p>

<p>NONBLOCKING_OPEN</p>

<p>(read-write) Set this boolean property to
&quot;true&quot; if O_NONBLOCK must be used on the open
call. Default to &quot;true&quot; on Linux and
&quot;false&quot; on all others machines. Witout it, Linux
wait for a few seconds if no tape are loaded. Solaris have
strange error it is set to &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>READ_BUFFER_SIZE</p>

<p>(read-write) This property specifies the minimum buffer
size that will be used for reads; this should be large
enough to contain any block that may be read from the
device, and must be larger than BLOCK_SIZE. This property
exists for tape devices which cannot determine the size of
on-tape blocks, or which may discard data which overflows a
small buffer. The tapetype parameter READBLOCKSIZE sets this
property. See BLOCK SIZES, above.</p>
