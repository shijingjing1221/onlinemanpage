<p>NAME slapo-collect - Collective attributes overlay to
slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The collect overlay is used to provide a
relatively coarse implementa- tion of RFC 3671 collective
attributes. In X.500, a collective attribute is &quot;a user
attribute whose values are the same for each mem- ber of an
entry collection&quot;.</p>

<p>Collective attributes are added to entries returned by a
search opera- tion when the entry is within the scope of the
related ancestor. Col- lective attributes can only be
modified when the modification affects the related
ancestor.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION This slapd.conf option applies to the
collect overlay. It should appear after the overlay
directive.</p>

<p>collectinfo &lt;DN&gt; &lt;attrlist&gt; Specify the DN
of the ancestor entry and the set of related col- lective
attributes, where attrlist is a comma-separated list of
attributes. The DN should be within the naming context of
the database.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/openldap/slapd.conf default slapd
configuration file</p>

<p>SEE ALSO slapd.conf(5), slapd-config(5), The
slapo-collect(5) overlay supports dynamic configuration via
back-config.</p>
