<p>NAME gshadow - shadowed group file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION /etc/gshadow contains the shadowed
information for group accounts.</p>

<p>This file must not be readable by regular users if
password security is to be maintained.</p>

<p>Each line of this file contains the following
colon-separated fields:</p>

<p>group name It must be a valid group name, which exist on
the system.</p>

<p>encrypted password Refer to crypt(3) for details on how
this string is interpreted.</p>

<p>If the password field contains some string that is not a
valid result of crypt(3), for instance ! or *, users will
not be able to use a unix password to access the group (but
group members do not need the password).</p>

<p>The password is used when an user who is not a member of
the group wants to gain the permissions of this group (see
newgrp(1)).</p>

<p>This field may be empty, in which case only the group
members can gain the group permissions.</p>

<p>A password field which starts with a exclamation mark
means that the password is locked. The remaining characters
on the line represent the password field before the password
was locked.</p>

<p>This password supersedes any password specified in
/etc/group.</p>

<p>administrators It must be a comma-separated list of user
names.</p>

<p>Administrators can change the password or the members of
the group.</p>

<p>Administrators also have the same permissions as the
members (see below).</p>

<p>members It must be a comma-separated list of user
names.</p>

<p>Members can access the group without being prompted for
a password.</p>

<p>You should use the same list of users as in
/etc/group.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/gshadow Secure group account information.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO gpasswd(5), group(5), grpck(8), grpconv(8),
newgrp(1).</p>
