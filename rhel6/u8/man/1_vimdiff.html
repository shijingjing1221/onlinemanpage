<p>NAME vimdiff - edit two, three or four versions of a
file with Vim and show differences</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vimdiff [options] file1 file2 [file3
[file4]]</p>

<p>gvimdiff</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Vimdiff starts Vim on two (or three or four)
files. Each file gets its own window. The differences
between the files are highlighted. This is a nice way to
inspect changes and to move changes from one version to
another version of the same file.</p>

<p>See vim(1) for details about Vim itself.</p>

<p>When started as gvimdiff the GUI will be started, if
available.</p>

<p>In each window the diff option will be set, which causes
the differ- ences to be highlighted. The wrap and scrollbind
options are set to make the text look good. The foldmethod
option is set to &quot;diff&quot;, which puts ranges of
lines without changes in a fold. foldcolumn is set to two to
make it easy to spot the folds and open or close them.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Vertical splits are used to align the lines, as
if the &quot;-O&quot; argument was used. To use horizontal
splits instead, use the &quot;-o&quot; argument.</p>

<p>For all other arguments see vim(1).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO vim(1)</p>

<p>AUTHOR Most of Vim was made by Bram Moolenaar, with a
lot of help from others. See &quot;:help credits&quot; in
Vim.</p>
