<p>NAME mcs - Multi-Category System</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION MCS (Multiple Category System) allows users
to label files on their system within administrator defined
categories. It then uses SELinux Mandatory Access Control to
protect those files. MCS is a discre- tionary model to allow
users to mark their data with additional tags that further
restrict access. The only mandatory aspect is authorizing
users for categories by defining their clearance in policy.
However, MCS is similar to MLS and exercises the same code
paths and share the same support infrastructure. They just
differ in their specific con- figuration.</p>

<p>The /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/setrans.conf
configuration file trans- lates the labels on disk to human
readable form. Administrators can define any labels they
want in this file. Certain applications like printing and
auditing will use these labels to identify the files. By
setting a category on a file you will prevent other
applications/ser- vices from having access to the files.
Examples of file lables would be PatientRecord,
CompanyConfidential etc.</p>
