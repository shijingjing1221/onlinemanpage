<p>CPROJ(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CPROJ(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME cproj, cprojf, cprojl - complex projection
functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;complex.h&gt;</p>

<p>double complex cproj(double complex z); float complex
cprojf(float complex z); long double complex cprojl(long
double complex z);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall compute a projection
of z onto the Riemann sphere: z projects to z, except that
all complex infinities (even those with one infinite part
and one NaN part) project to positive infinity on the real
axis. If z has an infinite part, then cproj( z) shall be
equivalent to:</p>

<p>INFINITY + I * copysign(0.0, cimag(z))</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE These functions shall return the value of
the projection onto the Rie- mann sphere.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Two topologies are commonly used in complex
mathematics: the complex plane with its continuum of
infinities, and the Riemann sphere with its single infinity.
The complex plane is better suited for transcendental
functions, the Riemann sphere for algebraic functions. The
complex types with their multiplicity of infinities provide
a useful (though imperfect) model for the complex plane. The
cproj() function helps model the Riemann sphere by mapping
all infinities to one, and should be used just before any
operation, especially comparisons, that might give spurious
results for any of the other infinities. Note that a com-
plex value with one infinite part and one NaN part is
regarded as an infinity, not a NaN, because if one part is
infinite, the complex value is infinite independent of the
value of the other part. For the same reason, cabs() returns
an infinity if its argument has an infinite part and a NaN
part.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
