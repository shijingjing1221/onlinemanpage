<p>NAME xinetd - the extended Internet services daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xinetd [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xinetd performs the same function as inetd:
it starts programs that provide Internet services. Instead
of having such servers started at system initialization
time, and be dormant until a connection request arrives,
xinetd is the only daemon process started and it listens on
all service ports for the services listed in its
configuration file. When a request comes in, xinetd starts
the appropriate server. Because of the way it operates,
xinetd (as well as inetd) is also referred to as a
super-server.</p>

<p>The services listed in xinetds configuration file can be
separated into two groups. Services in the first group are
called multi-threaded and they require the forking of a new
server process for each new con- nection request. The new
server then handles that connection. For such services,
xinetd keeps listening for new requests so that it can spawn
new servers. On the other hand, the second group includes
ser- vices for which the service daemon is responsible for
handling all new connection requests. Such services are
called single-threaded and xinetd will stop handling new
requests for them until the server dies. Services in this
group are usually datagram-based.</p>

<p>So far, the only reason for the existence of a
super-server was to con- serve system resources by avoiding
to fork a lot of processes which might be dormant for most
of their lifetime. While fulfilling this function, xinetd
takes advantage of the idea of a super-server to pro- vide
features such as access control and logging. Furthermore,
xinetd is not limited to services listed in /etc/services.
Therefore, anybody can use xinetd to start special-purpose
servers.</p>

<p>BEWARE of xinetd reload termination handling. For
services with type = INTERNAL, SIGTERM signal will be sent.
For services without type = INTERNAL, SIGKILL signall will
be sent. Take this into an account when dealing with proper
handling of the SIGTERM and SIGKILL. It is impor- tant to be
aware of this as your xinetd service could be killed on a
xinetd reload.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Enables debug mode. This produces a lot of
debugging output, and it makes it possible to use a debugger
on xinetd.</p>

<p>-syslog syslog_facility This option enables syslog
logging of xinetd-produced messages using the specified
syslog facility. The following facility names are supported:
daemon, auth, user, local[0-7] (check sys- log.conf(5) for
their meanings). This option is ineffective in debug mode
since all relevant messages are sent to the terminal.</p>

<p>-filelog logfile xinetd-produced messages will be placed
in the specified file. Messages are always appended to the
file. If the file does not exist, it will be created. This
option is ineffective in debug mode since all relevant
messages are sent to the terminal.</p>

<p>-f config_file Determines the file that xinetd uses for
configuration. The default is /etc/xinetd.conf.</p>

<p>-pidfile pid_file The process ID is written to the file.
This option is ineffec- tive in debug mode.</p>

<p>-dontfork Tells xinetd to stay in the foreground rather
than detaching itself, to support being run from init or
daemontools. This option automatically sets -stayalive (see
below).</p>

<p>-stayalive Tells xinetd to stay running even if no
services are specified.</p>

<p>-limit proc_limit This option places a limit on the
number of concurrently running processes that can be started
by xinetd. Its purpose is to pre- vent process table
overflows.</p>

<p>-logprocs limit This option places a limit on the number
of concurrently running servers for remote userid
acquisition.</p>

<p>-version This option causes xinetd to print out its
version information.</p>

<p>-inetd_compat This option causes xinetd to read
/etc/inetd.conf in addition to the standard xinetd config
files. /etc/inetd.conf is read after the standard xinetd
config files.</p>

<p>-cc interval This option instructs xinetd to perform
periodic consistency checks on its internal state every
interval seconds.</p>

<p>The syslog and filelog options are mutually exclusive.
If none is specified, the default is syslog using the daemon
facility. You should not confuse xinetd messages with
messages related to service logging. The latter are logged
only if this is specified via the configuration file.</p>

<p>CONTROLLING XINETD xinetd performs certain actions when
it receives certain signals. The actions associated with the
specific signals can be redefined by edit- ing config.h and
recompiling.</p>

<p>SIGHUP causes a hard reconfiguration, which means that
xinetd re-reads the configuration file and terminates the
servers for services that are no longer available. Access
control is performed again on running servers by checking
the remote location, access times and server instances. If
the number of server instances is lowered, some arbitrarily
picked servers will be killed to sat- isfy the limit; this
will happen after any servers are terminated because of
failing the remote location or access time checks. Also, if
the INTERCEPT flag was clear and is set, any running servers
for that service will be terminated; the purpose of this is
to ensure that after a hard reconfiguration there will be no
run- ning servers that can accept packets from addresses
that do not meet the access control criteria.</p>

<p>SIGQUIT causes program termination.</p>

<p>SIGTERM terminates all running servers before
terminating xinetd.</p>

<p>SIGUSR1 causes an internal state dump (the default dump
file is /var/run/xinetd.dump; to change the filename, edit
con- fig.h and recompile).</p>

<p>SIGIOT causes an internal consistency check to verify
that the data structures used by the program have not been
cor- rupted. When the check is completed xinetd will gener-
ate a message that says if the check was successful or
not.</p>

<p>On reconfiguration the log files are closed and
reopened. This allows removal of old log files.</p>
