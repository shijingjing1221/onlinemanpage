<p>Z8530_RX(9) Internal Functions Z8530_RX(9)</p>

<p>NAME z8530_rx - Handle a PIO receive event</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void z8530_rx(struct z8530_channel * c);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS c Z8530 channel to process</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Receive handler for receiving in PIO mode.
This is much like the async one but not quite the same or as
complex</p>

<p>NOTE Its intended that this handler can easily be
separated from the main code to run realtime. That&acute;ll
be needed for some machines (eg to ever clock 64kbits on a
sparc ;)).</p>

<p>The RT_LOCK macros don&acute;t do anything now. Keep the
code covered by them as short as possible in all
circumstances - clocks cost baud. The interrupt handler is
assumed to be atomic w.r.t. to other code - this is true in
the RT case too.</p>

<p>We only cover the sync cases for this. If you want 2Mbit
async do it yourself but consider medical assistance first.
This non DMA synchronous mode is portable code. The DMA mode
assumes PCI like ISA DMA</p>

<p>Called with the device lock held</p>
