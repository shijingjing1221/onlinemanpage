<p>MYISAM_FTDUMP(1) MySQL Database System
MYISAM_FTDUMP(1)</p>

<p>NAME myisam_ftdump - display full-text index
information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS myisam_ftdump [options] tbl_name index_num</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION myisam_ftdump displays information about
FULLTEXT indexes in MyISAM tables. It reads the MyISAM index
file directly, so it must be run on the server host where
the table is located. Before using myisam_ftdump, be sure to
issue a FLUSH TABLES statement first if the server is
running.</p>

<p>myisam_ftdump scans and dumps the entire index, which is
not particularly fast. On the other hand, the distribution
of words changes infrequently, so it need not be run
often.</p>

<p>Invoke myisam_ftdump like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; myisam_ftdump [options] tbl_name index_num</p>

<p>The tbl_name argument should be the name of a MyISAM
table. You can also specify a table by naming its index file
(the file with the .MYI suffix). If you do not invoke
myisam_ftdump in the directory where the table files are
located, the table or index file name must be preceded by
the path name to the table&rsquo;s database directory. Index
numbers begin with 0.</p>

<p>Example: Suppose that the test database contains a table
named mytexttable that has the following definition:</p>

<p>CREATE TABLE mytexttable ( id INT NOT NULL, txt TEXT NOT
NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id), FULLTEXT (txt) ) ENGINE=MyISAM;</p>

<p>The index on id is index 0 and the FULLTEXT index on txt
is index 1. If your working directory is the test database
directory, invoke myisam_ftdump as follows:</p>

<p>shell&gt; myisam_ftdump mytexttable 1</p>

<p>If the path name to the test database directory is
/usr/local/mysql/data/test, you can also specify the table
name argument using that path name. This is useful if you do
not invoke myisam_ftdump in the database directory:</p>

<p>shell&gt; myisam_ftdump
/usr/local/mysql/data/test/mytexttable 1</p>

<p>You can use myisam_ftdump to generate a list of index
entries in order of frequency of occurrence like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; myisam_ftdump -c mytexttable 1 | sort -r</p>

<p>myisam_ftdump supports the following options:</p>

<p>&middot; --help, -h -?</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --count, -c</p>

<p>Calculate per-word statistics (counts and global
weights).</p>

<p>&middot; --dump, -d</p>

<p>Dump the index, including data offsets and word
weights.</p>

<p>&middot; --length, -l</p>

<p>Report the length distribution.</p>

<p>&middot; --stats, -s</p>

<p>Report global index statistics. This is the default
operation if no other operation is specified.</p>

<p>&middot; --verbose, -v</p>

<p>Verbose mode. Print more output about what the program
does.</p>
