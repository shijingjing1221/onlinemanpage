<p>TABS(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TABS(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tabs - set terminal tabs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tabs [ -n| -a| -a2| -c| -c2| -c3| -f| -p| -s|
-u][+m[n]] [-T type]</p>

<p>tabs [-T type][ +[n]] n1[,n2,...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tabs utility shall display a series of
characters that first clears the hardware terminal tab
settings and then initializes the tab stops at the specified
positions and optionally adjusts the margin.</p>

<p>The phrase &quot;tab-stop position N&quot; shall be
taken to mean that, from the start of a line of output,
tabbing to position N shall cause the next character output
to be in the ( N+1)th column position on that line. The
maximum number of tab stops allowed is
terminal-dependent.</p>

<p>It need not be possible to implement tabs on certain
terminals. If the terminal type obtained from the TERM
environment variable or -T option represents such a
terminal, an appropriate diagnostic message shall be written
to standard error and tabs shall exit with a status greater
than zero.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The tabs utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines, except for various extensions:
the options -a2, -c2, and -c3 are multi-charac- ter.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-n Specify repetitive tab stops separated by a uniform
number of column positions, n, where n is a single-digit
decimal number. The default usage of tabs with no arguments
shall be equivalent to tabs-8. When -0 is used, the tab
stops shall be cleared and no new ones set.</p>

<p>-a 1,10,16,36,72 Assembler, applicable to some
mainframes.</p>

<p>-a2 1,10,16,40,72 Assembler, applicable to some
mainframes.</p>

<p>-c 1,8,12,16,20,55 COBOL, normal format.</p>

<p>-c2 1,6,10,14,49 COBOL, compact format (columns 1 to 6
omitted).</p>

<p>-c3 1,6,10,14,18,22,26,30,34,38,42,46,50,54,58,62,67
COBOL compact format (columns 1 to 6 omitted), with more
tabs than -c2.</p>

<p>-f 1,7,11,15,19,23 FORTRAN</p>

<p>-p 1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,41,45,49,53,57,61 PL/1</p>

<p>-s 1,10,55 SNOBOL</p>

<p>-u 1,12,20,44 Assembler, applicable to some
mainframes.</p>

<p>-T type Indicate the type of terminal. If this option is
not supplied and the TERM variable is unset or null, an
unspecified default terminal type shall be used. The setting
of type shall take precedence over the value in TERM.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>n1[,n2,...] A single command line argument that consists
of tab-stop values separated using either commas or
&lt;blank&gt;s. The application shall ensure that the
tab-stop values are positive decimal integers in strictly
ascending order. If any number (except the first one) is
preceded by a plus sign, it is taken as an increment to be
added to the previous value. For example, the tab lists
1,10,20,30 and 1,10,+10,+10 are considered to be
identical.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of tabs:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>TERM Determine the terminal type. If this variable is
unset or null, and if the -T option is not specified, an
unspecified default terminal type shall be used.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If standard output is a terminal, the appropriate
sequence to clear and set the tab stops may be written to
standard output in an unspecified format. If standard output
is not a terminal, undefined results occur.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE This utility makes use of the
terminals hardware tabs and the stty tabs option.</p>

<p>This utility is not recommended for application use.</p>

<p>Some integrated display units might not have escape
sequences to set tab stops, but may be set by internal
system calls. On these terminals, tabs works if standard
output is directed to the terminal; if output is directed to
another file, however, tabs fails.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Consideration was given to having the tput
utility handle all of the functions described in tabs.
However, the separate tabs utility was retained because it
seems more intuitive to use a command named tabs than tput
with a new option. The tput utility does not support setting
or clearing tabs, and no known historical version of tabs
supports the capability of setting arbitrary tab stops.</p>

<p>The System V tabs interface is very complex; the version
in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 has a reduced feature
list, but many of the features omitted were restored as XSI
extensions even though the sup- ported languages and coding
styles are primarily historical.</p>

<p>There was considerable sentiment for specifying only a
means of reset- ting the tabs back to a known
state-presumably the &quot;standard&quot; of tabs every
eight positions. The following features were omitted:</p>

<p>* Setting tab stops via the first line in a file, using
-- file. Since even the SVID has no complete explanation of
this feature, it is doubtful that it is in widespread
use.</p>

<p>In an early proposal, a -t tablist option was added for
consistency with expand; this was later removed when
inconsistencies with the his- torical list of tabs were
identified.</p>

<p>Consideration was given to adding a -p option that would
output the current tab settings so that they could be saved
and then later restored. This was not accepted because
querying the tab stops of the terminal is not a capability
in historical terminfo or termcap facili- ties and might not
be supported on a wide range of terminals.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
