<p>PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSTACKADDR(3Linux Programmer s
ManuPTHREAD_ATTR_SETSTACKADDR(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_attr_setstackaddr,
pthread_attr_getstackaddr - set/get stack address attribute
in thread attributes object</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_attr_setstackaddr(pthread_attr_t *attr, void
*stackaddr); int pthread_attr_getstackaddr(pthread_attr_t
*attr, void **stackaddr);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions are obsolete: do not use
them. Use pthread_attr_set- stack(3) and
pthread_attr_getstack(3) instead.</p>

<p>The pthread_attr_setstackaddr() function sets the stack
address attribute of the thread attributes object referred
to by attr to the value specified in stackaddr. This
attribute specifies the location of the stack that should be
used by a thread that is created using the thread attributes
object attr.</p>

<p>stackaddr should point to a buffer of at least
PTHREAD_STACK_MIN bytes that was allocated by the caller.
The pages of the allocated buffer should be both readable
and writable.</p>

<p>The pthread_attr_getstackaddr() function returns the
stack address attribute of the thread attributes object
referred to by attr in the buffer pointed to by
stackaddr.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these functions return 0; on
error, they return a non-zero error number.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined (but applications should
nevertheless handle a possible error return).</p>

<p>VERSIONS These functions are provided by glibc since
version 2.1.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001 specifies these functions but
marks them as obsolete. POSIX.1-2008 removes the
specification of these functions.</p>

<p>NOTES Do not use these functions! They cannot be
portably used, since they provide no way of specifying the
direction of growth or the range of the stack. For example,
on architectures with a stack that grows down- wards,
stackaddr specifies the next address past the highest
address of the allocated stack area. However, on
architectures with a stack that grows upwards, stackaddr
specifies the lowest address in the allocated stack area. By
contrast, the stackaddr used by pthread_attr_set- stack(3)
and pthread_attr_getstack(3), is always a pointer to the
low- est address in the allocated stack area (and the
stacksize argument specifies the range of the stack).</p>
