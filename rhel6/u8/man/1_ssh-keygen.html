<p>DESCRIPTION ssh-keygen generates, manages and converts
authentication keys for ssh(1). ssh-keygen can create RSA
keys for use by SSH protocol version 1 and DSA, ECDSA or RSA
keys for use by SSH protocol version 2. The type of key to
be generated is specified with the -t option. If invoked
with- out any arguments, ssh-keygen will generate an RSA key
for use in SSH protocol 2 connections.</p>

<p>ssh-keygen is also used to generate groups for use in
Diffie-Hellman group exchange (DH-GEX). See the MODULI
GENERATION section for details.</p>

<p>Normally each user wishing to use SSH with public key
authentication runs this once to create the authentication
key in ~/.ssh/identity, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa or
~/.ssh/id_rsa. Additionally, the sys- tem administrator may
use this to generate host keys, as seen in /etc/rc.</p>

<p>Normally this program generates the key and asks for a
file in which to store the private key. The public key is
stored in a file with the same name but .pub appended. The
program also asks for a passphrase. The passphrase may be
empty to indicate no passphrase (host keys must have an
empty passphrase), or it may be a string of arbitrary
length. A passphrase is similar to a password, except it can
be a phrase with a series of words, punctuation, numbers,
whitespace, or any string of char- acters you want. Good
passphrases are 10-30 characters long, are not simple
sentences or otherwise easily guessable (English prose has
only 1-2 bits of entropy per character, and provides very
bad passphrases), and contain a mix of upper and lowercase
letters, numbers, and non- alphanumeric characters. The
passphrase can be changed later by using the -p option.</p>

<p>There is no way to recover a lost passphrase. If the
passphrase is lost or forgotten, a new key must be generated
and copied to the corresponding public key to other
machines.</p>

<p>For RSA1 keys, there is also a comment field in the key
file that is only for convenience to the user to help
identify the key. The comment can tell what the key is for,
or whatever is useful. The comment is initial- ized to
user@host when the key is created, but can be changed using
the -c option.</p>

<p>After a key is generated, instructions below detail
where the keys should be placed to be activated.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-a trials Specifies the number of primality tests to
perform when screening DH-GEX candidates using the -T
command.</p>

<p>-B Show the bubblebabble digest of specified private or
public key file.</p>

<p>-b bits Specifies the number of bits in the key to
create. For RSA keys, the minimum size is 768 bits and the
default is 2048 bits. Gen- erally, 2048 bits is considered
sufficient. DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as specified
by FIPS 186-2.</p>

<p>-C comment Provides a new comment.</p>

<p>-c Requests changing the comment in the private and
public key files. This operation is only supported for RSA1
keys. The pro- gram will prompt for the file containing the
private keys, for the passphrase if the key has one, and for
the new comment.</p>

<p>-D pkcs11 Download the RSA public keys stored in the
pkcs11 provider.</p>

<p>-e This option will read a private or public OpenSSH key
file and print the key in RFC 4716 SSH Public Key File
Format to stdout. This option allows exporting keys for use
by several commercial SSH implementations.</p>

<p>-F hostname Search for the specified hostname in a
known_hosts file, listing any occurrences found. This option
is useful to find hashed host names or addresses and may
also be used in conjunction with the -H option to print
found keys in a hashed format.</p>

<p>-f filename Specifies the filename of the key file.</p>

<p>-G output_file Generate candidate primes for DH-GEX.
These primes must be screened for safety (using the -T
option) before use.</p>

<p>-g Use generic DNS format when printing fingerprint
resource records using the -r command.</p>

<p>-H Hash a known_hosts file. This replaces all hostnames
and addresses with hashed representations within the
specified file; the original content is moved to a file with
a .old suffix. These hashes may be used normally by ssh and
sshd, but they do not reveal identifying information should
the file s contents be disclosed. This option will not
modify existing hashed hostnames and is therefore safe to
use on files that mix hashed and non- hashed names.</p>

<p>-h When signing a key, create a host certificate instead
of a user certificate. Please see the CERTIFICATES section
for details.</p>

<p>-I Specify the key identity when signing a public key.
Please see the CERTIFICATES section for details.</p>

<p>-i This option will read an unencrypted private (or
public) key file in SSH2-compatible format and print an
OpenSSH compatible private (or public) key to stdout.
ssh-keygen also reads the RFC 4716 SSH Public Key File
Format. This option allows importing keys from several
commercial SSH implementations.</p>

<p>-L Prints the contents of a certificate.</p>

<p>-l Show fingerprint of specified public key file.
Private RSA1 keys are also supported. For RSA and DSA keys
ssh-keygen tries to find the matching public key file and
prints its fingerprint. If combined with -v, an ASCII art
representation of the key is sup- plied with the
fingerprint.</p>

<p>-M memory Specify the amount of memory to use (in
megabytes) when generat- ing candidate moduli for
DH-GEX.</p>

<p>-n Extract the public key from smartcard.</p>

<p>-N new_passphrase Provides the new passphrase.</p>

<p>-Z principals Specify one or more principals (user or
host names) to be included in a certificate when signing a
key. Multiple princi- pals may be specified, separated by
commas. Please see the CERTIFICATES section for details.</p>

<p>-O option Specify a certificate option when signing a
key. This option may be specified multiple times. Please see
the CERTIFICATES section for details. The options that are
valid for user certificates are:</p>

<p>no-x11-forwarding Disable X11 forwarding. (permitted by
default)</p>

<p>no-agent-forwarding Disable ssh-agent(1) forwarding.
(permitted by default)</p>

<p>no-port-forwarding Disable port forwarding. (permitted
by default)</p>

<p>no-pty Disable PTY allocation. (permitted by
default)</p>

<p>no-user-rc Disable execution of ~/.ssh/rc by sshd(8).
(permitted by default)</p>

<p>clear Clear all enabled permissions. This is useful for
clear- ing the default set of permissions so permissions may
be added individually.</p>

<p>permit-x11-forwarding Allows X11 forwarding.</p>

<p>permit-agent-forwarding Allows ssh-agent(1)
forwarding.</p>

<p>permit-port-forwarding Allows port forwarding.</p>

<p>permit-pty Allows PTY allocation.</p>

<p>permit-user-rc Allows execution of ~/.ssh/rc by
sshd(8).</p>

<p>force-command=command Forces the execution of command
instead of any shell or command specified by the user when
the certificate is used for authentication.</p>

<p>source-address=address_list Restrict the source
addresses from which the certificate is considered valid
from. The address_list is a comma- separated list of one or
more address/netmask pairs in CIDR format.</p>

<p>At present, no options are valid for host keys.</p>

<p>-P passphrase Provides the (old) passphrase.</p>

<p>-p Requests changing the passphrase of a private key
file instead of creating a new private key. The program will
prompt for the file containing the private key, for the old
passphrase, and twice for the new passphrase.</p>

<p>-q Silence ssh-keygen. Used by /etc/rc when creating a
new key.</p>

<p>-R hostname Removes all keys belonging to hostname from
a known_hosts file. This option is useful to delete hashed
hosts (see the -H option above).</p>

<p>-r hostname Print the SSHFP fingerprint resource record
named hostname for the specified public key file.</p>

<p>-S start Specify start point (in hex) when generating
candidate moduli for DH-GEX.</p>

<p>-s ca_key Certify (sign) a public key using the
specified CA key. Please see the CERTIFICATES section for
details.</p>

<p>-T output_file Test DH group exchange candidate primes
(generated using the -G option) for safety.</p>

<p>-t type Specifies the type of key to create. The
possible values are rsa1 for protocol version 1 and dsa,
ecdsa or rsa for protocol version 2.</p>

<p>-V validity_interval Specify a validity interval when
signing a certificate. A valid- ity interval may consist of
a single time, indicating that the certificate is valid
beginning now and expiring at that time, or may consist of
two times separated by a colon to indicate an explicit time
interval. The start time may be specified as a date in
YYYYMMDD format, a time in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format or a
relative time (to the current time) consisting of a minus
sign followed by a relative time in the format described in
the TIME FORMATS section of ssh_config(5). The end time may
be specified as a YYYYMMDD date, a YYYYMMDDHHMMSS time or a
relative time starting with a plus character.</p>

<p>For example: +52w1d (valid from now to 52 weeks and one
day from now), -4w:+4w (valid from four weeks ago to four
weeks from now), 20100101123000:20110101123000 (valid from
12:30 PM, January 1st, 2010 to 12:30 PM, January 1st, 2011),
-1d:20110101 (valid from yesterday to midnight, January 1st,
2011).</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode. Causes ssh-keygen to print debugging
messages about its progress. This is helpful for debugging
moduli genera- tion. Multiple -v options increase the
verbosity. The maximum is 3.</p>

<p>-W generator Specify desired generator when testing
candidate moduli for DH- GEX.</p>

<p>-y This option will read a private OpenSSH format file
and print an OpenSSH public key to stdout.</p>

<p>-z serial_number Specifies a serial number to be
embedded in the certificate to distinguish this certificate
from others from the same CA. The default serial number is
zero.</p>

<p>MODULI GENERATION ssh-keygen may be used to generate
groups for the Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange (DH-GEX)
protocol. Generating these groups is a two-step pro- cess:
first, candidate primes are generated using a fast, but
memory intensive process. These candidate primes are then
tested for suitabil- ity (a CPU-intensive process).</p>

<p>Generation of primes is performed using the -G option.
The desired length of the primes may be specified by the -b
option. For example:</p>

<p># ssh-keygen -G moduli-2048.candidates -b 2048</p>

<p>By default, the search for primes begins at a random
point in the desired length range. This may be overridden
using the -S option, which speci- fies a different start
point (in hex).</p>

<p>Once a set of candidates have been generated, they must
be tested for suitability. This may be performed using the
-T option. In this mode ssh-keygen will read candidates from
standard input (or a file specified using the -f option).
For example:</p>

<p># ssh-keygen -T moduli-2048 -f
moduli-2048.candidates</p>

<p>By default, each candidate will be subjected to 100
primality tests. This may be overridden using the -a option.
The DH generator value will be chosen automatically for the
prime under consideration. If a specific generator is
desired, it may be requested using the -W option. Valid
generator values are 2, 3, and 5.</p>

<p>Screened DH groups may be installed in /etc/ssh/moduli.
It is important that this file contains moduli of a range of
bit lengths and that both ends of a connection share common
moduli.</p>

<p>CERTIFICATES ssh-keygen supports signing of keys to
produce certificates that may be used for user or host
authentication. Certificates consist of a public key, some
identity information, zero or more principal (user or host)
names and a set of options that are signed by a
Certification Authority (CA) key. Clients or servers may
then trust only the CA key and verify its signature on a
certificate rather than trusting many user/host keys. Note
that OpenSSH certificates are a different, and much simpler,
format to the X.509 certificates used in ssl(8).</p>

<p>ssh-keygen supports two types of certificates: user and
host. User cer- tificates authenticate users to servers,
whereas host certificates authenticate server hosts to
users. To generate a user certificate:</p>

<p>$ ssh-keygen -s /path/to/ca_key -I key_id
/path/to/user_key.pub</p>

<p>The resultant certificate will be placed in
/path/to/user_key-cert.pub. A host certificate requires the
-h option:</p>

<p>$ ssh-keygen -s /path/to/ca_key -I key_id -h
/path/to/host_key.pub</p>

<p>The host certificate will be output to
/path/to/host_key-cert.pub. In both cases, key_id is a
&quot;key identifier&quot; that is logged by the server when
the certificate is used for authentication.</p>

<p>Certificates may be limited to be valid for a set of
principal (user/host) names. By default, generated
certificates are valid for all users or hosts. To generate a
certificate for a specified set of princi- pals:</p>

<p>$ ssh-keygen -s ca_key -I key_id -Z user1,user2
user_key.pub $ ssh-keygen -s ca_key -I key_id -h -Z
host.domain user_key.pub</p>

<p>Additional limitations on the validity and use of user
certificates may be specified through certificate options. A
certificate option may dis- able features of the SSH
session, may be valid only when presented from particular
source addresses or may force the use of a specific command.
For a list of valid certificate options, see the
documentation for the -O option above.</p>

<p>Finally, certificates may be defined with a validity
lifetime. The -V option allows specification of certificate
start and end times. A cer- tificate that is presented at a
time outside this range will not be con- sidered valid. By
default, certificates have a maximum validity inter-
val.</p>

<p>For certificates to be used for user or host
authentication, the CA pub- lic key must be trusted by
sshd(8) or ssh(1). Please refer to those man- ual pages for
details.</p>

<p>FILES ~/.ssh/identity Contains the protocol version 1
RSA authentication identity of the user. This file should
not be readable by anyone but the user. It is possible to
specify a passphrase when generating the key; that
passphrase will be used to encrypt the private part of this
file using 3DES. This file is not automatically accessed by
ssh-keygen but it is offered as the default file for the
private key. ssh(1) will read this file when a login attempt
is made. ~/.ssh/identity.pub Contains the protocol version 1
RSA public key for authentica- tion. The contents of this
file should be added to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on all
machines where the user wishes to log in using RSA
authentication. There is no need to keep the contents of
this file secret.</p>

<p>~/.ssh/id_dsa ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa Contains the
protocol version 2 DSA, ECDSA or RSA authentication identity
of the user. This file should not be readable by anyone but
the user. It is possible to specify a passphrase when gener-
ating the key; that passphrase will be used to encrypt the
pri- vate part of this file using 3DES. This file is not
automati- cally accessed by ssh-keygen but it is offered as
the default file for the private key. ssh(1) will read this
file when a login attempt is made.</p>

<p>~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Contains the protocol version 2 DSA, ECDSA or RSA public key
for authentication. The contents of this file should be
added to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on all machines where the
user wishes to log in using public key authentication. There
is no need to keep the contents of this file secret.</p>

<p>/etc/ssh/moduli Contains Diffie-Hellman groups used for
DH-GEX. The file format is described in moduli(5).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG The reseeding of the
OpenSSL random generator is usually done from /dev/urandom.
If the SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG environment vari- able is set to
value other than 0 the OpenSSL random generator is reseeded
from /dev/random. The number of bytes read is defined by the
SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG value. Minimum is 14 bytes. This set-
ting is not recommended on the computers without the
hardware random generator because insufficient entropy
causes the connec- tion to be blocked until enough entropy
is available.</p>
