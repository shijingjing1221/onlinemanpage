<p>UDISKS(7) udisks UDISKS(7)</p>

<p>NAME udisks - Storage Management</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION udisks provides an interface to enumerate
storage devices and perform operations on them. Any
application can access the org.freedesktop.UDisks service on
the system message bus. Some operations (such as formatting
disks etc.) is restricted using polkit.</p>

<p>DEVICE INFORMATION On Linux, udisks relies on recent
versions of udev(7) and the kernel. Influential device
properties in the udev database include:</p>

<p>UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE If set to 1 this is a hint to
presentation level software that the device should not be
shown to the user.</p>

<p>UDISKS_PRESENTATION_NOPOLICY If set to 1 this is a hint
to presentation level software that the device should not be
automounted or autoassembled (for e.g. components of a
multi-disk device).</p>

<p>UDISKS_DISABLE_POLLING If set to 1 this will disable the
polling of drives for media changes, for devices which do
not send out media notifications by themselves (this mostly
affects CD drives). Some CD drives cause bad effects such as
very high CPU usage when being polled.</p>

<p>UDISKS_PRESENTATION_NAME The name to user for the device
when presenting it to the user.</p>

<p>UDISKS_PRESENTATION_ICON_NAME The icon to use when
presenting the device to the user. If set, the name must
follow the freedesktop.org icon theme specification.</p>

<p>UDISKS_MOUNT_OPTIONS Additional mount options to be
appended to the existing mount options. Format is a comma
separated list of options to pass to mount.</p>

<p>UDISKS_MOUNT_OPTIONS_ALLOW If set, this restricts the
options allowed in mount. Format is a comma separated list
of possible options allowed to be passed to mount (e.g.
&quot;exec,noexec,nodev,nosuid,atime,noatime,nodiratime,ro,rw,sync,dirsync,uid=,gid=&quot;)</p>

<p>The ID_DRIVE_* properties are used to describe what kind
of physical media can be used in a device. These are
typically set on the main block device (e.g. /dev/sdb) and
more than one these properties can be set if the device
supports multiple kinds of media.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_EJECTABLE Whether the media in the drive is
physically ejectable. Only set this to 1 (or 0) if the drive
truly uses (or doesn&acute;t) ejectable media. In
particular, it is not necessary to set this for e.g. iPod or
Kindle devices where it is necessary to send a command via
eject(1) since the desktop user session will offer this
option for removable devices regardless of whether they are
ejectable. If this property is not set, a heuristic will be
used to determine if the media is ejectable (drives using
optical, Zip or Jaz media are considered ejectable).</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_DETACHABLE Whether the device is detachable. It
is only meaningful to set this to 0 (to avoid marking a
device as detachable) since the code for detaching the
device is part of udisks itself. If this property is not
set, a heuristic will be used to determine if the drive is
detachable (currently only devices connected through USB are
detachable).</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_CAN_SPINDOWN Whether the device can spin down.
It is only meaningful to set this to 0 (to avoid marking a
device as being capable of spinning down) since the code for
spinning down the device is part of udisks itself. If this
property is not set, a heuristic will be used to determine
if the drive can spin down (currently only ATA devices,
including those USB devices with a SAT layer) can be spun
down).</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_FLASH The device is compatible with flash.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_FLASH_CF The device is compatible with Compact
Flash.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_FLASH_MS The device is compatible with Memory
Stick.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_FLASH_SM The device is compatible with
SmartMedia.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_FLASH_SD The device is compatible with
SecureDigital.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_FLASH_SDHC The device is compatible with
High-Capicity SecureDigital.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_FLASH_MMC The device is compatible with
MultiMediaCard.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_FLOPPY The device is compatible with floppy
disk.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_FLOPPY_ZIP The device is compatible with
Zip.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_FLOPPY_JAZ The device is compatible with
Jaz.</p>

<p>The ID_DRIVE_MEDIA_* properties describe the current
media in a device. As with the ID_DRIVE_* properties, these
properties are typically set on the main block device (e.g.
/dev/sdb). Typically only one of these properties are
set.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_MEDIA_FLASH The physical media currently
inserted into the device is flash.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_MEDIA_FLASH_CF The physical media currently
inserted into the device is Compact Flash.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_MEDIA_FLASH_MS The physical media currently
inserted into the device is Memory Stick.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_MEDIA_FLASH_SM The physical media currently
inserted into the device is SmartMedia.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_MEDIA_FLASH_SD The physical media currently
inserted into the device is SecureDigital.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_MEDIA_FLASH_SDHC The physical media currently
inserted into the device is High-Capicity SecureDigital.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_MEDIA_FLASH_MMC The physical media currently
inserted into the device is MultiMediaCard.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_MEDIA_FLOPPY The physical media currently
inserted into the device is floppy disk.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_MEDIA_FLOPPY_ZIP The physical media currently
inserted into the device is Zip.</p>

<p>ID_DRIVE_MEDIA_FLOPPY_JAZ The physical media currently
inserted into the device is Jaz.</p>
