<p>NAME uselib - load shared library</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int uselib(const char *library);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The system call uselib() serves to load a
shared library to be used by the calling process. It is
given a pathname. The address where to load is found in the
library itself. The library can have any recog- nized binary
format.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS In addition to all of the error codes returned by
open(2) and mmap(2), the following may also be returned:</p>

<p>EACCES The library specified by library does not have
read or execute permission, or the caller does not have
search permission for one of the directories in the path
prefix. (See also path_reso- lution(7).)</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>ENOEXEC The file specified by library is not an
executable of known type, e.g., does not have the correct
magic numbers.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO uselib() is Linux-specific, and should not
be used in programs intended to be portable.</p>

<p>NOTES uselib() was used by early libc startup code to
load the shared libraries with names found in an array of
names in the binary.</p>

<p>Since libc 4.3.2, startup code tries to prefix these
names with &quot;/usr/lib&quot;, &quot;/lib&quot; and
&quot;&quot; before giving up. In libc 4.3.4 and later these
names are looked for in the directories found in
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and if not found there, prefixes
&quot;/usr/lib&quot;, &quot;/lib&quot; and &quot;/&quot; are
tried.</p>

<p>From libc 4.4.4 on only the library
&quot;/lib/ld.so&quot; is loaded, so that this dynamic
library can load the remaining libraries needed (again using
this call). This is also the state of affairs in libc5.</p>

<p>glibc2 does not use this call.</p>
