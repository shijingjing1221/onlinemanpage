<p>NAME SDL_SetAlpha - Adjust the alpha properties of a
surface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;</p>

<p>int SDL_SetAlpha(SDL_Surface *surface, Uint32 flag,
Uint8 alpha);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Note:</p>

<p>This function and the semantics of SDL alpha blending
have changed since version 1.1.4. Up until version 1.1.5, an
alpha value of 0 was considered opaque and a value of 255
was consid- ered transparent. This has now been inverted: 0
(SDL_ALPHA_TRANSPARENT) is now considered transparent and
255 (SDL_ALPHA_OPAQUE) is now considered opaque.</p>

<p>SDL_SetAlpha is used for setting the per-surface alpha
value and/or enabling and disabling alpha blending.</p>

<p>Thesurface parameter specifies which surface whose alpha
attributes you wish to adjust. flags is used to specify
whether alpha blending should be used (SDL_SRCALPHA) and
whether the surface should use RLE accelera- tion for
blitting (SDL_RLEACCEL). flags can be an OR d combination of
these two options, one of these options or 0. If
SDL_SRCALPHA is not passed as a flag then all alpha
information is ignored when blitting the surface. The alpha
parameter is the per-surface alpha value; a sur- face need
not have an alpha channel to use per-surface alpha and blit-
ting can still be accelerated with SDL_RLEACCEL.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>The per-surface alpha value of 128 is considered a
special case and is optimised, so its much faster than other
per-surface values.</p>

<p>Alpha effects surface blitting in the following
ways:</p>

<p>RGBA-&gt;RGB with SDL_SRCALPHA The source is
alpha-blended with the destination, using the alpha channel.
SDL_SRCCOLORKEY and the per-surface alpha are ignored.</p>

<p>RGBA-&gt;RGB without SDL_SRCALPHA The RGB data is copied
from the source. The source alpha channel and the
per-surface alpha value are ignored.</p>

<p>RGB-&gt;RGBA with SDL_SRCALPHA The source is
alpha-blended with the destination using the per-surface
alpha value. If SDL_SRCCOL- ORKEY is set, only the pixels
not matching the col- orkey value are copied. The alpha
channel of the copied pixels is set to opaque.</p>

<p>RGB-&gt;RGBA without SDL_SRCALPHA The RGB data is copied
from the source and the alpha value of the copied pixels is
set to opaque. If SDL_SRCCOLORKEY is set, only the pixels
not matching the colorkey value are copied.</p>

<p>RGBA-&gt;RGBA with SDL_SRCALPHA The source is
alpha-blended with the destination using the source alpha
channel. The alpha channel in the destination surface is
left untouched. SDL_SRCCOLORKEY is ignored.</p>

<p>RGBA-&gt;RGBA without SDL_SRCALPHA The RGBA data is
copied to the destination surface. If SDL_SRCCOLORKEY is
set, only the pixels not matching the colorkey value are
copied.</p>

<p>RGB-&gt;RGB with SDL_SRCALPHA The source is
alpha-blended with the destination using the per-surface
alpha value. If SDL_SRCCOL- ORKEY is set, only the pixels
not matching the col- orkey value are copied.</p>

<p>RGB-&gt;RGB without SDL_SRCALPHA The RGB data is copied
from the source. If SDL_SRC- COLORKEY is set, only the
pixels not matching the colorkey value are copied.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>Note that RGBA-&gt;RGBA blits (with SDL_SRCALPHA set)
keep the alpha of the destination surface. This means that
you cannot compose two arbitrary RGBA surfaces this way and
get the result you would expect from &quot;overlaying&quot;
them; the destination alpha will work as a mask.</p>

<p>Also note that per-pixel and per-surface alpha cannot be
com- bined; the per-pixel alpha is always used if
available</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE This function returns 0, or -1 if there was
an error.</p>
