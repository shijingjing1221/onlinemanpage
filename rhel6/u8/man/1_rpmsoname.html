<p>RPMSONAME(1) RPMSONAME(1)</p>

<p>NAME rpmsoname - list files that provide sonames in RPM
package(s)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rpmsoname [-h] [options] [FILE...] [DIR...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rpmsoname produces two-column output
(typically one line per each soname). Column one contains
file path; column two contains corresponding soname. When
processing a directory, an additional column is prepended to
the output, which is typically RPM file basename.</p>

<p>Note that the name rpmsoname is probably a misnomer: the
script does not deal with ELF &quot;DT_SONAME&quot; entries.
What it does is try to map soname-like entries from RPM
&quot;PROVIDES&quot; list to regular files within the very
same RPM package (using &quot;BASENAMES&quot;,
&quot;FILENAMES&quot;, and &quot;FILELINKTOS&quot; lists
from RPM header).</p>

<p>OPTIONS Options and arguments manage a set of RPM
packages to be processed; they are those of rpmargs(1).</p>
