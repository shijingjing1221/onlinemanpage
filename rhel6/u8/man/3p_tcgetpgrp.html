<p>TCGETPGRP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
TCGETPGRP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tcgetpgrp - get the foreground process group ID</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>pid_t tcgetpgrp(int fildes);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tcgetpgrp() function shall return the
value of the process group ID of the foreground process
group associated with the terminal.</p>

<p>If there is no foreground process group, tcgetpgrp()
shall return a value greater than 1 that does not match the
process group ID of any existing process group.</p>

<p>The tcgetpgrp() function is allowed from a process that
is a member of a background process group; however, the
information may be subse- quently changed by a process that
is a member of a foreground process group.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, tcgetpgrp()
shall return the value of the process group ID of the
foreground process associated with the termi- nal.
Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to indicate
the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The tcgetpgrp() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTTY The calling process does not have a controlling
terminal, or the file is not the controlling terminal.</p>
