<p>SCHED_SETPARAM(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SCHED_SETPARAM(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sched_setparam - set scheduling parameters
(REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sched.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sched_setparam(pid_t pid, const struct sched_param
*param);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sched_setparam() function shall set the
scheduling parameters of the process specified by pid to the
values specified by the sched_param structure pointed to by
param. The value of the sched_priority member in the
sched_param structure shall be any integer within the
inclusive priority range for the current scheduling policy
of the process speci- fied by pid. Higher numerical values
for the priority represent higher priorities. If the value
of pid is negative, the behavior of the sched_setparam()
function is unspecified.</p>

<p>If a process specified by pid exists, and if the calling
process has permission, the scheduling parameters shall be
set for the process whose process ID is equal to pid.</p>

<p>If pid is zero, the scheduling parameters shall be set
for the calling process.</p>

<p>The conditions under which one process has permission to
change the scheduling parameters of another process are
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>Implementations may require the requesting process to
have the appro- priate privilege to set its own scheduling
parameters or those of another process.</p>

<p>The target process, whether it is running or not
running, shall be moved to the tail of the thread list for
its priority.</p>

<p>If the priority of the process specified by the pid
argument is set higher than that of the lowest priority
running process and if the specified process is ready to
run, the process specified by the pid argument shall preempt
a lowest priority running process. Similarly, if the process
calling sched_setparam() sets its own priority lower than
that of one or more other non-empty process lists, then the
process that is the head of the highest priority list shall
also preempt the calling process. Thus, in either case, the
originating process might not receive notification of the
completion of the requested priority change until the higher
priority process has executed.</p>

<p>If the scheduling policy of the target process is
SCHED_SPORADIC, the value specified by the
sched_ss_low_priority member of the param argu- ment shall
be any integer within the inclusive priority range for the
sporadic server policy. The sched_ss_repl_period and
sched_ss_init_bud- get members of the param argument shall
represent the time parameters to be used by the sporadic
server scheduling policy for the target pro- cess. The
sched_ss_max_repl member of the param argument shall repre-
sent the maximum number of replenishments that are allowed
to be pend- ing simultaneously for the process scheduled
under this scheduling policy.</p>

<p>The specified sched_ss_repl_period shall be greater than
or equal to the specified sched_ss_init_budget for the
function to succeed; if it is not, then the function shall
fail.</p>

<p>The value of sched_ss_max_repl shall be within the
inclusive range [1, {SS_REPL_MAX}] for the function to
succeed; if not, the function shall fail.</p>

<p>If the scheduling policy of the target process is either
SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR, the sched_ss_low_priority,
sched_ss_repl_period, and sched_ss_init_budget members of
the param argument shall have no effect on the scheduling
behavior. If the scheduling policy of this process is not
SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, or SCHED_SPORADIC, the effects of
these mem- bers are implementation-defined; this case
includes the SCHED_OTHER policy.</p>

<p>If the current scheduling policy for the process
specified by pid is not SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, or
SCHED_SPORADIC, the result is implementa- tion-defined; this
case includes the SCHED_OTHER policy.</p>

<p>The effect of this function on individual threads is
dependent on the scheduling contention scope of the
threads:</p>

<p>* For threads with system scheduling contention scope,
these functions shall have no effect on their
scheduling.</p>

<p>* For threads with process scheduling contention scope,
the threads scheduling parameters shall not be affected.
However, the scheduling of these threads with respect to
threads in other processes may be dependent on the
scheduling parameters of their process, which are governed
using these functions.</p>

<p>If an implementation supports a two-level scheduling
model in which library threads are multiplexed on top of
several kernel-scheduled entities, then the underlying
kernel-scheduled entities for the system contention scope
threads shall not be affected by these functions.</p>

<p>The underlying kernel-scheduled entities for the process
contention scope threads shall have their scheduling
parameters changed to the value specified in param.
Kernel-scheduled entities for use by process contention
scope threads that are created after this call completes
shall inherit their scheduling policy and associated
scheduling parame- ters from the process.</p>

<p>This function is not atomic with respect to other
threads in the pro- cess. Threads may continue to execute
while this function call is in the process of changing the
scheduling policy for the underlying ker- nel-scheduled
entities used by the process contention scope threads.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the sched_setparam()
function shall return zero.</p>

<p>If the call to sched_setparam() is unsuccessful, the
priority shall remain unchanged, and the function shall
return a value of -1 and set errno to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sched_setparam() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL One or more of the requested scheduling
parameters is outside the range defined for the scheduling
policy of the specified pid.</p>

<p>EPERM The requesting process does not have permission to
set the scheduling parameters for the specified process, or
does not have the appropriate privilege to invoke
sched_setparam().</p>

<p>ESRCH No process can be found corresponding to that
specified by pid.</p>
