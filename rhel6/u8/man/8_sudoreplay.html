<p>SUDOREPLAY(8) BSD System Manager s Manual
SUDOREPLAY(8)</p>

<p>NAME sudoreplay - replay sudo session logs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sudoreplay [-h] [-d directory] [-f filter] [-m
max_wait] [-s speed_factor] ID</p>

<p>sudoreplay [-h] [-d directory] -l [search
expression]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sudoreplay plays back or lists the output
logs created by sudo. When replaying, sudoreplay can play
the session back in real-time, or the playback speed may be
adjusted (faster or slower) based on the command line
options.</p>

<p>The ID should either be a six character sequence of
digits and upper case letters, e.g. 0100A5, or a pattern
matching the iolog_file option in the sudoers file. When a
command is run via sudo with log_output enabled in the
sudoers file, a TSID=ID string is logged via syslog or to
the sudo log file. The ID may also be determined using
sudoreplays list mode.</p>

<p>In list mode, sudoreplay can be used to find the ID of a
session based on a number of criteria such as the user, tty
or command run.</p>

<p>In replay mode, if the standard output has not been
redirected, sudoreplay will act on the following keys:</p>

<p>(space) Pause output; press any key to resume.</p>

<p>&lt; Reduce the playback speed by one half.</p>

<p>&gt; Double the playback speed.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-d directory Use directory to for the session logs
instead of the default, /var/log/sudo-io.</p>

<p>-f filter By default, sudoreplay will play back the
commands stan- dard output, standard error and tty output.
The -f option can be used to select which of these to
output. The filter argument is a comma-separated list,
consisting of one or more of following: stdout, stderr, and
ttyout.</p>

<p>-h The -h (help) option causes sudoreplay to print a
short help message to the standard output and exit.</p>

<p>-l [search expression] Enable list mode. In this mode,
sudoreplay will list available sessions in a format similar
to the sudo log file format, sorted by file name (or
sequence number). If a search expression is specified, it
will be used to restrict the IDs that are displayed. An
expression is composed of the following predicates:</p>

<p>command pattern Evaluates to true if the command run
matches pattern. On systems with POSIX regular expression
support, the pattern may be an extended regular expression.
On systems without POSIX regular expression support, a
simple substring match is performed instead.</p>

<p>cwd directory Evaluates to true if the command was run
with the specified current working directory.</p>

<p>fromdate date Evaluates to true if the command was run
on or after date. See Date and time format for a description
of supported date and time formats.</p>

<p>group runas_group Evaluates to true if the command was
run with the specified runas_group. Note that unless a
runas_group was explicitly specified when sudo was run this
field will be empty in the log.</p>

<p>runas runas_user Evaluates to true if the command was
run as the specified runas_user. Note that sudo runs
commands as user root by default.</p>

<p>todate date Evaluates to true if the command was run on
or prior to date. See Date and time format for a description
of supported date and time formats.</p>

<p>tty tty name Evaluates to true if the command was run on
the specified terminal device. The tty name should be
specified without the /dev/ prefix, e.g. tty01 instead of
/dev/tty01.</p>

<p>user user name Evaluates to true if the ID matches a
command run by user name.</p>

<p>Predicates may be abbreviated to the shortest unique
string (currently all predicates may be shortened to a
single character).</p>

<p>Predicates may be combined using and, or and ! operators
as well as ( and ) grouping (note that parentheses must
generally be escaped from the shell). The and operator is
optional, adjacent predicates have an implied and unless
separated by an or.</p>

<p>-m max_wait Specify an upper bound on how long to wait
between key presses or output data. By default, sudoreplay
will accu- rately reproduce the delays between key presses
or program output. However, this can be tedious when the
session includes long pauses. When the -m option is
specified, sudoreplay will limit these pauses to at most
max_wait sec- onds. The value may be specified as a floating
point num- ber, e.g. 2.5.</p>

<p>-s speed_factor This option causes sudoreplay to adjust
the number of sec- onds it will wait between key presses or
program output. This can be used to slow down or speed up
the display. For example, a speed_factor of 2 would make the
output twice as fast whereas a speed_factor of .5 would make
the output twice as slow.</p>

<p>-V The -V (version) option causes sudoreplay to print
its ver- sion number and exit.</p>

<p>Date and time format The time and date may be specified
multiple ways, common formats include:</p>

<p>HH:MM:SS am MM/DD/CCYY timezone 24 hour time may be used
in place of am/pm.</p>

<p>HH:MM:SS am Month, Day Year timezone 24 hour time may be
used in place of am/pm, and month and day names may be
abbreviated. Note that month and day of the week names must
be specified in English.</p>

<p>CCYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS ISO time format</p>

<p>DD Month CCYY HH:MM:SS The month name may be
abbreviated.</p>

<p>Either time or date may be omitted, the am/pm and
timezone are optional. If no date is specified, the current
day is assumed; if no time is speci- fied, the first second
of the specified date is used. The less signifi- cant parts
of both time and date may also be omitted, in which case
zero is assumed.</p>

<p>The following are all valid time and date
specifications:</p>

<p>now The current time and date.</p>

<p>tomorrow Exactly one day from now.</p>

<p>yesterday 24 hours ago.</p>

<p>2 hours ago 2 hours ago.</p>

<p>next Friday The first second of the next Friday.</p>

<p>this week The current time but the first day of the
coming week.</p>

<p>a fortnight ago The current time but 14 days ago.</p>

<p>10:01 am 9/17/2009 10:01 am, September 17, 2009.</p>

<p>10:01 am 10:01 am on the current day.</p>

<p>10 10:00 am on the current day.</p>

<p>9/17/2009 00:00 am, September 17, 2009.</p>

<p>10:01 am Sep 17, 2009 10:01 am, September 17, 2009.</p>

<p>FILES /var/log/sudo-io The default I/O log
directory.</p>

info.</p>

<p>Note that the stdin, stdout and stderr files will be
empty unless sudo was used as part of a pipeline for a
particular command.</p>
