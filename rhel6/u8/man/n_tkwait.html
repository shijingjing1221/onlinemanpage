<p>tkwait(n) Tk Built-In Commands tkwait(n)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME tkwait - Wait for variable to change or window to
be destroyed</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tkwait variable name</p>

<p>tkwait visibility name</p>

<p>tkwait window name
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tkwait command waits for one of several
things to happen, then it returns without taking any other
actions. The return value is always an empty string. If the
first argument is variable (or any abbrevia- tion of it)
then the second argument is the name of a global variable
and the command waits for that variable to be modified. If
the first argument is visibility (or any abbreviation of it)
then the second argument is the name of a window and the
tkwait command waits for a change in its visibility state
(as indicated by the arrival of a Visi- bilityNotify event).
This form is typically used to wait for a newly- created
window to appear on the screen before taking some action. If
the first argument is window (or any abbreviation of it)
then the sec- ond argument is the name of a window and the
tkwait command waits for that window to be destroyed. This
form is typically used to wait for a user to finish
interacting with a dialog box before using the result of
that interaction.</p>

<p>While the tkwait command is waiting it processes events
in the normal fashion, so the application will continue to
respond to user interac- tions. If an event handler invokes
tkwait again, the nested call to tkwait must complete before
the outer call can complete.</p>
