<p>STDARG(3) Linux Programmer s Manual STDARG(3)</p>

<p>NAME stdarg, va_start, va_arg, va_end, va_copy -
variable argument lists</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;</p>

<p>void va_start(va_list ap, last); type va_arg(va_list ap,
type); void va_end(va_list ap); void va_copy(va_list dest,
va_list src);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A function may be called with a varying
number of arguments of varying types. The include file
&lt;stdarg.h&gt; declares a type va_list and defines three
macros for stepping through a list of arguments whose number
and types are not known to the called function.</p>

<p>The called function must declare an object of type
va_list which is used by the macros va_start(), va_arg(),
and va_end().</p>

<p>va_start() The va_start() macro initializes ap for
subsequent use by va_arg() and va_end(), and must be called
first.</p>

<p>The argument last is the name of the last argument
before the variable argument list, that is, the last
argument of which the calling function knows the type.</p>

<p>Because the address of this argument may be used in the
va_start() macro, it should not be declared as a register
variable, or as a func- tion or an array type.</p>

<p>va_arg() The va_arg() macro expands to an expression
that has the type and value of the next argument in the
call. The argument ap is the va_list ap initialized by
va_start(). Each call to va_arg() modifies ap so that the
next call returns the next argument. The argument type is a
type name specified so that the type of a pointer to an
object that has the specified type can be obtained simply by
adding a * to type.</p>

<p>The first use of the va_arg() macro after that of the
va_start() macro returns the argument after last. Successive
invocations return the values of the remaining
arguments.</p>

<p>If there is no next argument, or if type is not
compatible with the type of the actual next argument (as
promoted according to the default argument promotions),
random errors will occur.</p>

<p>If ap is passed to a function that uses va_arg(ap,type)
then the value of ap is undefined after the return of that
function.</p>

<p>va_end() Each invocation of va_start() must be matched
by a corresponding invo- cation of va_end() in the same
function. After the call va_end(ap) the variable ap is
undefined. Multiple traversals of the list, each brack- eted
by va_start() and va_end() are possible. va_end() may be a
macro or a function.</p>

<p>va_copy() An obvious implementation would have a va_list
be a pointer to the stack frame of the variadic function. In
such a setup (by far the most common) there seems nothing
against an assignment</p>

<p>va_list aq = ap;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are also systems that make it an
array of pointers (of length 1), and there one needs</p>

<p>va_list aq; *aq = *ap;</p>

<p>Finally, on systems where arguments are passed in
registers, it may be necessary for va_start() to allocate
memory, store the arguments there, and also an indication of
which argument is next, so that va_arg() can step through
the list. Now va_end() can free the allocated memory again.
To accommodate this situation, C99 adds a macro va_copy(),
so that the above assignment can be replaced by</p>

<p>va_list aq; va_copy(aq, ap); ... va_end(aq);</p>

<p>Each invocation of va_copy() must be matched by a
corresponding invoca- tion of va_end() in the same function.
Some systems that do not supply va_copy() have __va_copy
instead, since that was the name used in the draft
proposal.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The va_start(), va_arg(), and va_end()
macros conform to C89. C99 defines the va_copy() macro.</p>

<p>NOTES These macros are not compatible with the historic
macros they replace. A backward compatible version can be
found in the include file &lt;varargs.h&gt;.</p>

<p>The historic setup is:</p>

<p>#include &lt;varargs.h&gt;</p>

<p>void foo(va_alist) va_dcl { va_list ap;</p>

<p>va_start(ap); while (...) { ... x = va_arg(ap, type);
... } va_end(ap); }</p>

<p>On some systems, va_end contains a closing
&rsquo;}&rsquo; matching a &rsquo;{&rsquo; in va_start, so
that both macros must occur in the same function, and in a
way that allows this.</p>

<p>BUGS Unlike the varargs macros, the stdarg macros do not
permit programmers to code a function with no fixed
arguments. This problem generates work mainly when
converting varargs code to stdarg code, but it also creates
difficulties for variadic functions that wish to pass all of
their arguments on to a function that takes a va_list
argument, such as vfprintf(3).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The function foo takes a string of format
characters and prints out the argument associated with each
format character based on the type.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;</p>

<p>void foo(char *fmt, ...) { va_list ap; int d; char c,
*s;</p>

<p>va_start(ap, fmt); while (*fmt) switch (*fmt++) { case
&rsquo;s&rsquo;: /* string */ s = va_arg(ap, char *);
printf(&quot;string %s0, s); break; case &rsquo;d&rsquo;: /*
int */ d = va_arg(ap, int); printf(&quot;int %d0, d); break;
case &rsquo;c&rsquo;: /* char */ /* need a cast here since
va_arg only takes fully promoted types */ c = (char)
va_arg(ap, int); printf(&quot;char %c0, c); break; }
va_end(ap); }</p>
