<p>PTHREAD_COND_BROADCAST(3P) POSIX Programmer s
ManualPTHREAD_COND_BROADCAST(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_cond_broadcast, pthread_cond_signal -
broadcast or signal a condition</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_cond_broadcast(pthread_cond_t *cond); int
pthread_cond_signal(pthread_cond_t *cond);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall unblock threads
blocked on a condition variable.</p>

<p>The pthread_cond_broadcast() function shall unblock all
threads cur- rently blocked on the specified condition
variable cond.</p>

<p>The pthread_cond_signal() function shall unblock at
least one of the threads that are blocked on the specified
condition variable cond (if any threads are blocked on
cond).</p>

<p>If more than one thread is blocked on a condition
variable, the scheduling policy shall determine the order in
which threads are unblocked. When each thread unblocked as a
result of a pthread_cond_broadcast() or
pthread_cond_signal() returns from its call to
pthread_cond_wait() or pthread_cond_timedwait(), the thread
shall own the mutex with which it called pthread_cond_wait()
or pthread_cond_timedwait(). The thread(s) that are
unblocked shall con- tend for the mutex according to the
scheduling policy (if applicable), and as if each had called
pthread_mutex_lock().</p>

<p>The pthread_cond_broadcast() or pthread_cond_signal()
functions may be called by a thread whether or not it
currently owns the mutex that threads calling
pthread_cond_wait() or pthread_cond_timedwait() have
associated with the condition variable during their waits;
however, if predictable scheduling behavior is required,
then that mutex shall be locked by the thread calling
pthread_cond_broadcast() or pthread_cond_signal().</p>

<p>The pthread_cond_broadcast() and pthread_cond_signal()
functions shall have no effect if there are no threads
currently blocked on cond.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the pthread_cond_broadcast()
and pthread_cond_signal() functions shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_cond_broadcast() and
pthread_cond_signal() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value cond does not refer to an initialized
condition vari- able.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The pthread_cond_broadcast() function
is used whenever the shared-vari- able state has been
changed in a way that more than one thread can pro- ceed
with its task. Consider a single producer/multiple consumer
prob- lem, where the producer can insert multiple items on a
list that is accessed one item at a time by the consumers.
By calling the pthread_cond_broadcast() function, the
producer would notify all con- sumers that might be waiting,
and thereby the application would receive more throughput on
a multi-processor. In addition, pthread_cond_broad- cast()
makes it easier to implement a read-write lock. The
pthread_cond_broadcast() function is needed in order to wake
up all waiting readers when a writer releases its lock.
Finally, the two- phase commit algorithm can use this
broadcast function to notify all clients of an impending
transaction commit.</p>

<p>It is not safe to use the pthread_cond_signal() function
in a signal handler that is invoked asynchronously. Even if
it were safe, there would still be a race between the test
of the Boolean pthread_cond_wait() that could not be
efficiently eliminated.</p>

<p>Mutexes and condition variables are thus not suitable
for releasing a waiting thread by signaling from code
running in a signal handler.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Multiple Awakenings by Condition Signal On a
multi-processor, it may be impossible for an implementation
of pthread_cond_signal() to avoid the unblocking of more
than one thread blocked on a condition variable. For
example, consider the following partial implementation of
pthread_cond_wait() and pthread_cond_sig- nal(), executed by
two threads in the order given. One thread is trying to wait
on the condition variable, another is concurrently executing
pthread_cond_signal(), while a third thread is already
waiting.</p>

<p>pthread_cond_wait(mutex, cond): value = cond-&gt;value;
/* 1 */ pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex); /* 2 */
pthread_mutex_lock(cond-&gt;mutex); /* 10 */ if (value ==
cond-&gt;value) { /* 11 */ me-&gt;next_cond =
cond-&gt;waiter; cond-&gt;waiter = me;
pthread_mutex_unlock(cond-&gt;mutex); unable_to_run(me); }
else pthread_mutex_unlock(cond-&gt;mutex); /* 12 */
pthread_mutex_lock(mutex); /* 13 */</p>

<p>pthread_cond_signal(cond):
pthread_mutex_lock(cond-&gt;mutex); /* 3 */
cond-&gt;value++; /* 4 */ if (cond-&gt;waiter) { /* 5 */
sleeper = cond-&gt;waiter; /* 6 */ cond-&gt;waiter =
sleeper-&gt;next_cond; /* 7 */ able_to_run(sleeper); /* 8 */
} pthread_mutex_unlock(cond-&gt;mutex); /* 9 */</p>

<p>The effect is that more than one thread can return from
its call to pthread_cond_wait() or pthread_cond_timedwait()
as a result of one call to pthread_cond_signal(). This
effect is called &quot;spurious wakeup&quot;. Note that the
situation is self-correcting in that the number of threads
that are so awakened is finite; for example, the next thread
to call pthread_cond_wait() after the sequence of events
above blocks.</p>

<p>While this problem could be resolved, the loss of
efficiency for a fringe condition that occurs only rarely is
unacceptable, especially given that one has to check the
predicate associated with a condition variable anyway.
Correcting this problem would unnecessarily reduce the
degree of concurrency in this basic building block for all
higher-level synchronization operations.</p>

<p>An added benefit of allowing spurious wakeups is that
applications are forced to code a predicate-testing-loop
around the condition wait. This also makes the application
tolerate superfluous condition broadcasts or signals on the
same condition variable that may be coded in some other part
of the application. The resulting applications are thus more
robust. Therefore, IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 explicitly documents
that spu- rious wakeups may occur.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
