<p>NAME rrdthreads - Provisions for linking the RRD library
to use in multi-threaded programs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Using librrd in multi-threaded programs
requires some extra precautions, as the RRD library in its
original form was not thread- safe at all. This document
describes requirements and pitfalls on the way to use the
multi-threaded version of librrd in your own programs. It
also gives hints for future RRD development to keep the
library thread-safe.</p>

<p>Currently only some RRD operations are implemented in a
thread-safe way. They all end in the usual
&quot;&quot;_r&quot;&quot; suffix.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In order to use librrd in multi-threaded
programs you must:</p>

<p>&middot; Link with librrd_th instead of librrd (use
&quot;-lrrd_th&quot; when linking)</p>

<p>&middot; Use the &quot;&quot;_r&quot;&quot; functions
instead of the normal API-functions</p>

<p>&middot; Do not use any at-style time specifications.
Parsing of such time specifications is terribly
non-thread-safe.</p>

<p>&middot; Never use non *&quot;_r&quot; functions unless
it is explicitly documented that the function is
tread-safe.</p>

<p>&middot; Every thread SHOULD call
&quot;rrd_get_context()&quot; before its first call to any
&quot;librrd_th&quot; function in order to set up thread
specific data. This is not strictly required, but it is the
only way to test if memory allocation can be done by this
function. Otherwise the program may die with a SIGSEGV in a
low-memory situation.</p>

<p>&middot; Always call &quot;rrd_error_clear()&quot;
before any call to the library. Otherwise the call might
fail due to some earlier error.</p>

<p>NOTES FOR RRD CONTRIBUTORS Some precautions must be
followed when developing RRD from now on:</p>

<p>&middot; Only use thread-safe functions in library code.
Many often used libc functions aren t thread-safe. Take care
in the following situations or when using the following
library functions:</p>

<p>&middot; Direct calls to &quot;strerror()&quot; must be
avoided: use &quot;rrd_strerror()&quot; instead, it provides
a per-thread error message.</p>

<p>&middot; The &quot;getpw*&quot;, &quot;getgr*&quot;,
&quot;gethost*&quot; function families (and some more
&quot;get*&quot; functions) are not thread-safe: use the
*&quot;_r&quot; variants</p>

<p>&middot; Time functions: &quot;asctime&quot;,
&quot;ctime&quot;, &quot;gmtime&quot;,
&quot;localtime&quot;: use *&quot;_r&quot; variants</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;strtok&quot;: use
&quot;strtok_r&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;tmpnam&quot;: use
&quot;tmpnam_r&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; Many others (lookup documentation)</p>

<p>&middot; A header file named rrd_is_thread_safe.h is
provided that works with the GNU C-preprocessor to
&quot;poison&quot; some of the most common non-thread-safe
functions using the &quot;#pragma GCC poison&quot;
directive. Just include this header in source files you want
to keep thread- safe.</p>

<p>&middot; Do not introduce global variables!</p>

<p>If you really, really have to use a global variable you
may add a new field to the &quot;rrd_context&quot; structure
and modify rrd_error.c, rrd_thread_safe.c and
rrd_non_thread_safe.c</p>

<p>&middot; Do not use &quot;getopt&quot; or
&quot;getopt_long&quot; in *&quot;_r&quot; (neither directly
nor indirectly).</p>

<p>&quot;getopt&quot; uses global variables and behaves
badly in a multi- threaded application when called
concurrently. Instead provide a *_r function taking all
options as function parameters. You may provide argc and
**argv arguments for variable length argument lists. See
&quot;rrd_update_r&quot; as an example.</p>

<p>&middot; Do not use the &quot;rrd_parsetime&quot;
function!</p>

<p>It uses lots of global variables. You may use it in
functions not designed to be thread-safe, like in functions
wrapping the &quot;_r&quot; version of some operation (e.g.,
&quot;rrd_create&quot;, but not in
&quot;rrd_create_r&quot;)</p>

<p>CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED THREAD SAFE FUNCTIONS Currently
there exist thread-safe variants of &quot;rrd_update&quot;,
&quot;rrd_create&quot;, &quot;rrd_dump&quot;,
&quot;rrd_info&quot;, &quot;rrd_last&quot;, and
&quot;rrd_fetch&quot;.</p>
