<p>sane-agfafocus(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-agfafocus(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-agfafocus - SANE backend for AGFA Focus
flatbed scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-agfafocus library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
AGFA Focus flatbed scanners. At present, the following
scanners are supported from this backend:</p>

<p>AGFA Focus GS Scanner (6 bit gray scale) (untested) AGFA
Focus Lineart Scanner (lineart) (untested) AGFA Focus II (8
bit gray scale) (untested) AGFA Focus Color (24 bit color
3-pass) AGFA Focus Color Plus (24 bit color 3-pass)</p>

<p>Siemens S9036 (8 bit gray scale) (untested)</p>

<p>The driver supports line art, 6bpp and 8bpp gray, 18bpp
and 24bpp color scans.</p>

<p>If you own a scanner other than the ones listed above
that works with this backend, please let us know by sending
the scanners model name, SCSI id, and firmware revision to
sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org. Have a look at
http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html concern- ing
subscription to sane-devel.</p>

<p>All of these scanners are pre-SCSI-2, and do not even
report properly to SCSI Inquiry. This is typically evident
in SCSI bus scans, where the scanner will come up with only
garbage as vendor and models strings.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is either the path-name for the special
device that cor- responds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI
scanners, the special device name must be a generic SCSI
device or a symlink to such a device. Under Linux, such a
device name could be /dev/sga or /dev/sge, for example. See
sane-scsi(5) for details.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the agfafocus.conf file is
a list of device names that correspond to AGFA Focus
scanners. Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark
(#) are ignored. A sample configuration file is shown
below:</p>

<p>/dev/scanner # this is a comment /dev/sge</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/agfafocus.conf The backend
configuration file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR
below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib/libsane-agfafocus.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib/libsane-agfafocus.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFOCUS If the library was compiled with
debug support enabled, this environment variable controls
the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128
requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity. SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFOCUS values:</p>

<p>Number Remark</p>

<p>0 print important errors (printed each time) 1 print
errors 2 print sense 3 print warnings 4 print
scanner-inquiry 5 print informations 6 print less important
informations 7 print called procedures 8 print
reader_process messages 10 print called sane-init-routines
11 print called sane-procedures 12 print sane infos 13 print
sane option-control messages</p>

<p>MISSING FUNCTIONALITY Uploading of dither matrices and
tonecurves has been implemented, but so far has not proven
to be useful for anything. For this reason these options
have been disabled.</p>

<p>BUGS The scanners that do not support disconnect have
problems with SCSI timeouts if the SCSI bus gets loaded, eg.
if you do a kernel build at the same time as scanning. To
see if your scanner supports disconnect, run
&quot;SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFOCUS=128 scanimage -L&quot; in sh and
look for the &quot;disconnect:&quot; line)</p>

<p>DEBUG If you have problems with SANE not detecting your
scanner, make sure the Artec backend is disabled. Somehow,
this backend causes at least my scanner not to respond
correctly to SCSI inquiry commands.</p>

<p>If you encounter a bug please set the environment
variable SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFOCUS to 128 and try to regenerate
the problem. Then send me a report with the log
attached.</p>

<p>If you encounter a SCSI bus error or trimmed and/or
displaced images please also set the environment variable
SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI to 128 before sending me the
report.</p>

<p>TODO More scanners?</p>

<p>The AGFA ACS and ARCUS scanners are similar to the FOCUS
scan- ners. The driver could probably be extended to support
these scanners without too many changes. I do not have
access to such scanners, and cannot add support for it.
However, if you are in possession of such a scanner, I could
be helpful in adding sup- port for these scanners.</p>

<p>The AGFA HORIZON scanners are SCSI-2 scanners, and it
would probably be easier to support these scanners in a
SCSI-2 compli- ant backend.</p>
