<p>NAME pbmtog3 - convert a PBM image into a Group 3 MH fax
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmtog3 [-reversebits] [-nofixedwidth]
[pbmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pbmtog3 reads a PBM image as input and produces a Group
3 MH fax file as output.</p>

<p>You can also generate a TIFF file that uses the same
encoding inside, with pamtotiff.</p>

<p>There is no program in Netpbm that generates other fax
formats, such as MR and MMR, but pamtotiff can generate TIFF
files that use those encod- ings.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -reversebits This option causes the output to
have the bits in every byte reversed so the least signficant
bit becomes the most signficant bit. Apparently, there is
some ambiguity in transmission proto- cols so that the bits
get reversed on transmission, and this compensates for that.
If you get a whole bunch of &quot;bad code word&quot;
messages when you try to read the G3 file (e.g. with
g3topbm, try using this option. Note that the output is not
G3 when you use this option.</p>

<p>-nofixedwidth Most fax machines expect the image to be
1728 columns wide, so pbmtog3 cuts the output to this width
by default. If you want to keep the width of the original
image, use this option.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.6 (July 2002). Before
that, pbmtog3 always kept the width of the original
image.</p>
