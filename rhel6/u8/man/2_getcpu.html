<p>GETCPU(2) Linux Programmer s Manual GETCPU(2)</p>

<p>NAME getcpu - determine CPU and NUMA node on which the
calling thread is running</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;linux/getcpu.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getcpu(unsigned *cpu, unsigned *node, struct
getcpu_cache *tcache);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getcpu() system call identifies the
processor and node on which the calling thread or process is
currently running and writes them into the integers pointed
to by the cpu and node arguments. The processor is a unique
small integer identifying a CPU. The node is a unique small
identifier identifying a NUMA node. When either cpu or node
is NULL nothing is written to the respective pointer.</p>

<p>The third argument to this system call is nowadays
unused.</p>

<p>The information placed in cpu is only guaranteed to be
current at the time of the call: unless the CPU affinity has
been fixed using sched_setaffinity(2), the kernel might
change the CPU at any time. (Normally this does not happen
because the scheduler tries to minimize movements between
CPUs to keep caches hot, but it is possible.) The caller
must be prepared to handle the situation when cpu and node
are no longer the current CPU and node.</p>

<p>VERSIONS getcpu() was added in kernel 2.6.19 for x86_64
and i386.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO getcpu() is Linux specific.</p>

<p>NOTES Linux makes a best effort to make this call as
fast possible. The intention of getcpu() is to allow
programs to make optimizations with per-CPU data or for NUMA
optimization.</p>

<p>Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call;
call it using syscall(2); or use sched_getcpu(3)
instead.</p>

<p>The tcache argument is unused since Linux 2.6.24. In
earlier kernels, if this argument was non-NULL, then it
specified a pointer to a caller- allocated buffer in
thread-local storage that was used to provide a caching
mechanism for getcpu(). Use of the cache could speed
getcpu() calls, at the cost that there was a very small
chance that the returned information would be out of date.
The caching mechanism was considered to cause problems when
migrating threads between CPUs, and so the argu- ment is now
ignored.</p>
