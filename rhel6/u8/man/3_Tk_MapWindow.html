<p>Tk_MapWindow(3) Tk Library Procedures
Tk_MapWindow(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_MapWindow, Tk_UnmapWindow - map or unmap a
window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_Window Tk_MapWindow(tkwin)</p>

<p>Tk_UnmapWindow(tkwin)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_Window tkwin (in) Token for window.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures may be used to map and
unmap windows managed by Tk. Tk_MapWindow maps the window
given by tkwin, and also creates an X win- dow corresponding
to tkwin if it does not already exist. See the
Tk_CreateWindow manual entry for information on deferred
window cre- ation. Tk_UnmapWindow unmaps tkwin s window from
the screen.</p>

<p>If tkwin is a child window (i.e. Tk_CreateWindow was
used to create a child window), then event handlers
interested in map and unmap events are invoked immediately.
If tkwin is not an internal window, then the event handlers
will be invoked later, after X has seen the request and
returned an event for it.</p>

<p>These procedures should be used in place of the X
procedures XMapWindow and XUnmapWindow, since they update
Tks local data structure for tkwin. Applications using Tk
should not invoke XMapWindow and XUnmap- Window
directly.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS map, unmap, window</p>
