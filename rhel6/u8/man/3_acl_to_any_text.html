<p>ACL_TO_ANY_TEXT(3) BSD Library Functions Manual
ACL_TO_ANY_TEXT(3)</p>

<p>NAME acl_to_any_text - convert an ACL to text</p>

<p>LIBRARY Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl,
-lacl).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;acl/libacl.h&gt;</p>

<p>char * acl_to_any_text(acl_t acl, const char *prefix,
char separator, int options);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The acl_to_any_text() function translates
the ACL pointed to by the argu- ment acl into a NULL
terminated character string. This character string is
composed of the ACL entries contained in acl, in the entry
text format described on acl(5). Entries are separated from
each other by the separator character. If the argument
prefix is not (const char *)NULL, each entry is prefixed by
this character string.</p>

<p>If the argument options is 0, ACL entries are converted
using the entry tag type keywords user, group, mask, and
other. User IDs and group IDs of ACL entries that contain
such qualifiers are converted to their corre- sponding
names; if an identifier has no corresponding name, a decimal
number string is produced. The ACL text representation
contains no addi- tional comments. A bitwise combinations of
the following options can be used to modify the result:</p>

<p>TEXT_ABBREVIATE Instead of the full tag type keywords,
single letter abbre- viations are used. The abbreviation for
user is u, the abbreviation for group is g, the abbreviation
for mask is m, and the abbreviation for other is o.</p>

<p>TEXT_NUMERIC_IDS User IDs and group IDs are included as
decimal numbers instead of names.</p>

<p>TEXT_SOME_EFFECTIVE A comment containing the effective
permissions of the ACL entry is included after ACL entries
that contain permis- sions which are ineffective because
they are masked by an ACL_MASK entry. The ACL entry and the
comment are separated by a tab character.</p>

<p>TEXT_ALL_EFFECTIVE A comment containing the effective
permissions of the ACL entry is included after all ACL
entries that are affected by an ACL_MASK entry. The comment
is included even if the permissions contained in the ACL
entry equal the effective permissions. The ACL entry and the
comment are separated by a tab character.</p>

<p>TEXT_SMART_INDENT This option is used in combination
with the TEXT_SOME_EFFECTIVE or TEXT_ALL_EFFECTIVE option.
The num- ber of tab characters inserted between the ACL
entry and the comment is increased so that the comment is
aligned to the fourth tab stop position. A tab width of 8
characters is assumed.</p>

<p>The ACL referred to by acl is not changed.</p>

<p>This function allocates any memory necessary to contain
the string and returns a pointer to the string. The caller
should free any releasable memory, when the new string is no
longer required, by calling acl_free() with the (void*)char
returned by acl_to_any_text() as an argument.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, this function returns a pointer
to the text representation of the ACL. On error, a value of
(char *)NULL is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS If any of the following conditions occur, the
acl_to_any_text() function returns a value of (char *)NULL
and sets errno to the corresponding value:</p>

<p>[EINVAL] The argument acl is not a valid pointer to an
ACL.</p>

<p>The ACL referenced by acl contains one or more improp-
erly formed ACL entries, or for some other reason can- not
be translated into the text form of an ACL.</p>

<p>[ENOMEM] The character string to be returned requires
more mem- ory than is allowed by the hardware or
system-imposed memory management constraints.</p>

<p>STANDARDS This is a non-portable, Linux specific
extension to the ACL manipulation functions defined in IEEE
Std 1003.1e draft 17 ( POSIX.1e , abandoned).</p>
