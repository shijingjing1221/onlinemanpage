<p>NAME pjtoppm - convert an HP PaintJet file to a PPM
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pjtoppm</p>

<p>[paintjet]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pjtoppm reads an HP PaintJet file as input and converts
it into a PPM image. This was a quick hack to save some
trees, and it only handles a small subset of the paintjet
commands. In particular, it will only handle enough commands
to convert most raster image files.</p>
