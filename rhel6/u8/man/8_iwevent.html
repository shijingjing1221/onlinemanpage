<p>NAME iwevent - Display Wireless Events generated by
drivers and setting changes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS iwevent</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION iwevent displays Wireless Events received
through the RTNetlink socket. Each line displays the
specific Wireless Event which describes what has happened on
the specified wireless interface. This command doesnt take
any arguments.</p>

<p>DISPLAY There are two classes of Wireless Events.</p>

<p>The first class is events related to a change of
wireless settings on the interface (typically done through
iwconfig or a script calling iwconfig). Only settings that
could result in a disruption of connec- tivity are reported.
The events currently reported are changing one of the
following setting : Network ID ESSID Frequency Mode
Encryption All those events will be generated on all
wireless interfaces by the kernel wireless subsystem (but
only if the driver has been converted to the new driver
API).</p>

<p>The second class of events are events generated by the
hardware, when something happens or a task has been
finished. Those events include :</p>

<p>New Access Point/Cell address The interface has joined a
new Access Point or Ad-Hoc Cell, or lost its association
with it. This is the same address that is reported by
iwconfig.</p>

<p>Scan request completed A scanning request has been
completed, results of the scan are available (see
iwlist).</p>

<p>Tx packet dropped A packet directed at this address has
been dropped because the interface believes this node doesn
t answer anymore (usually maximum of MAC level retry
exceeded). This is usually an early indication that the node
may have left the cell or gone out of range, but it may be
due to fading or excessive contention.</p>

<p>Custom driver event Event specific to the driver. Please
check the driver documenta- tion.</p>

<p>Registered node The interface has successfully
registered a new wireless client/peer. Will be generated
mostly when the interface acts as an Access Point (mode
Master).</p>

<p>Expired node The registration of the client/peer on this
interface has expired. Will be generated mostly when the
interface acts as an Access Point (mode Master).</p>

<p>Spy threshold crossed The signal strength for one of the
addresses in the spy list went under the low threshold or
went above the high threshold.</p>

<p>Most wireless drivers generate only a subset of those
events, not all of them, the exact list depends on the
specific hardware/driver combi- nation. Please refer to
driver documentation for details on when they are generated,
and use iwlist(8) to check what the driver supports.</p>
