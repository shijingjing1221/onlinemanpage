<p>while(n) Tcl Built-In Commands while(n)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME while - Execute script repeatedly as long as a
condition is met</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS while test body
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The while command evaluates test as an
expression (in the same way that expr evaluates its
argument). The value of the expression must a proper boolean
value; if it is a true value then body is executed by
passing it to the Tcl interpreter. Once body has been
executed then test is evaluated again, and the process
repeats until eventually test evaluates to a false boolean
value. Continue commands may be executed inside body to
terminate the current iteration of the loop, and break
commands may be executed inside body to cause immediate
termination of the while command. The while command always
returns an empty string.</p>

<p>Note: test should almost always be enclosed in braces.
If not, vari- able substitutions will be made before the
while command starts execut- ing, which means that variable
changes made by the loop body will not be considered in the
expression. This is likely to result in an infi- nite loop.
If test is enclosed in braces, variable substitutions are
delayed until the expression is evaluated (before each loop
iteration), so changes in the variables will be visible. For
an example, try the following script with and without the
braces around $x&lt;10: set x 0 while {$x&lt;10} { puts
&quot;x is $x&quot; incr x }</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Read lines from a channel until we get to the
end of the stream, and print them out with a line-number
prepended: set lineCount 0 while {[gets $chan line] &gt;= 0}
{ puts &quot;[incr lineCount]: $line&quot; }</p>
