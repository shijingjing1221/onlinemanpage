<p>NAME mblen - determine number of bytes in next multibyte
character</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mblen(const char *s, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If s is not a NULL pointer, the mblen()
function inspects at most n bytes of the multibyte string
starting at s and extracts the next com- plete multibyte
character. It uses a static anonymous shift state only known
to the mblen() function. If the multibyte character is not
the null wide character, it returns the number of bytes that
were consumed from s. If the multibyte character is the null
wide character, it returns 0.</p>

<p>If the n bytes starting at s do not contain a complete
multibyte char- acter, mblen() returns -1. This can happen
even if n is greater than or equal to MB_CUR_MAX, if the
multibyte string contains redundant shift sequences.</p>

<p>If the multibyte string starting at s contains an
invalid multibyte sequence before the next complete
character, mblen() also returns -1.</p>

<p>If s is a NULL pointer, the mblen() function resets the
shift state, only known to this function, to the initial
state, and returns non-zero if the encoding has nontrivial
shift state, or zero if the encoding is stateless.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The mblen() function returns the number of
bytes parsed from the multi- byte sequence starting at s, if
a non-null wide character was recog- nized. It returns 0, if
a null wide character was recognized. It returns -1, if an
invalid multibyte sequence was encountered or if it couldnt
parse a complete multibyte character.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of mblen() depends on the LC_CTYPE
category of the current locale.</p>

<p>The function mbrlen(3) provides a better interface to
the same func- tionality.</p>
