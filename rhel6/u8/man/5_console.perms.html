<p>console.perms(5) System Administrator s Manual
console.perms(5)</p>

<p>NAME console.perms - permissions control file for users
at the system con- sole</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION /etc/security/console.perms and .perms files
in the /etc/security/con- sole.perms.d directory determine
the permissions that will be given to priviledged users of
the console at login time, and the permissions to which to
revert when the users log out. They are read by the pam_con-
sole_apply helper executable.</p>

<p>The format is:</p>

<p>&lt;class&gt;=space-separated list of words</p>

<p>login-regexp|&lt;login-class&gt; perm
dev-glob|&lt;dev-class&gt; revert-mode
revert-owner[.revert-group]</p>

<p>The revert-mode, revert-owner, and revert-group fields
are optional, and default to 0600, root, and root,
respectively.</p>

<p>The words in a class definition are evaluated as globs
if they refer to files, but as regular expressions if they
apply to a console defini- tion. Do not mix them.</p>

<p>Any line can be broken and continued on the next line by
using a character as the last character on the line.</p>

<p>The login-class class and the login-regexp word are
evaluated as regu- lar expressions. The dev-class and the
dev-glob word are evaluated as shell-style globs. If a name
given corresponds to a directory, and if it is a mount point
listed in /etc/fstab, the device node associated with the
filesystem mounted at that point will be substituted in its
place.</p>

<p>Classes are denoted by being contained in &lt; angle
bracket &gt; characters; a lack of &lt; angle brackets &gt;
indicates that the string is to be taken literally as a
login-regexp or a dev-glob, depending on its input posi-
tion.</p>
