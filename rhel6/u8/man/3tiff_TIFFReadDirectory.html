<p>NAME TIFFReadDirectory - get the contents of the next
directory in an open TIFF file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int TIFFReadDirectory(TIFF *tif)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Read the next directory in the specified
file and make it the current directory. Applications only
need to call TIFFReadDirectory to read multiple subfiles in
a single TIFF file the first directory in a file is
automatically read when TIFFOpen is called.</p>

<p>NOTES If the library is compiled with STRIPCHOP_SUPPORT
enabled, then images that have a single uncompressed strip
or tile of data are automatically treated as if they were
made up of multiple strips or tiles of approxi- mately 8
kilobytes each. This operation is done only in-memory; it
does not alter the contents of the file. However, the
construction of the chopped strips is visible to the
application through the number of strips [tiles] returned by
TIFFNumberOfStrips [TIFFNumberOfTiles].</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES If the next directory was successfully
read, 1 is returned. Otherwise, 0 is returned if an error
was encountered, or if there are no more directories to be
read.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error messages are directed to the
TIFFError(3TIFF) routine. All warning messages are directed
to the TIFFWarning(3TIFF) routine.</p>

<p>Seek error accessing TIFF directory. An error occurred
while position- ing to the location of the directory.</p>

<p>Wrong data type %d for field &quot;%s&quot;. The tag
entry in the directory had an incorrect data type. For
example, an ImageDescription tag with a SHORT data type.</p>

<p>TIFF directory is missing required &quot;%s&quot; field.
The specified tag is required to be present by the TIFF 5.0
specification, but is missing. The directory is (usually)
unusable.</p>

<p>%s: Rational with zero denominator. A directory tag has
a RATIONAL value whose denominator is zero.</p>

<p>Incorrect count %d for field &quot;%s&quot; (%lu,
expecting %lu); tag ignored. The specified tags count field
is bad. For example, a count other than 1 for a SubFileType
tag.</p>

<p>Cannot handle different per-sample values for field
&quot;%s&quot;. The tag has SamplesPerPixel values and they
are not all the same; e.g. BitsPerSam- ple. The library is
unable to handle images of this sort.</p>

<p>Count mismatch for field &quot;%s&quot;; expecting %d,
got %d. The count field in a tag does not agree with the
number expected by the library. This should never happen, so
if it does, the library refuses to read the directory.</p>

<p>Invalid TIFF directory; tags are not sorted in ascending
order. The directory tags are not properly sorted as
specified in the TIFF 5.0 specification. This error is not
fatal.</p>

<p>Ignoring unknown field with tag %d (0x%x). An unknown
tag was encoun- tered in the directory; the library ignores
all such tags.</p>

<p>TIFF directory is missing requred
&quot;ImageLength&quot; field. The image vio- lates the
specification by not having a necessary field. There is no
way for the library to recover from this error.</p>

<p>TIFF directory is missing requred
&quot;PlanarConfig&quot; field. The image vio- lates the
specification by not having a necessary field. There is no
way for the library to recover from this error.</p>

<p>TIFF directory is missing requred
&quot;StripOffsets&quot; field. The image has multiple
strips, but is missing the tag that specifies the file
offset to each strip of data. There is no way for the
library to recover from this error.</p>

<p>TIFF directory is missing requred
&quot;TileOffsets&quot; field. The image has multiple tiles,
but is missing the tag that specifies the file offset to
each tile of data. There is no way for the library to
recover from this error.</p>

<p>TIFF directory is missing required
&quot;StripByteCounts&quot; field. The image has multiple
strips, but is missing the tag that specifies the size of
each strip of data. There is no way for the library to
recover from this error.</p>

<p>TIFF directory is missing required
&quot;StripByteCounts&quot; field, calculating from
imagelength. The image violates the specification by not
having a necessary field. However, when the image is
comprised of only one strip or tile, the library will
estimate the missing value based on the file size.</p>

<p>Bogus &quot;StripByteCounts&quot; field, ignoring and
calculating from image- length. Certain vendors violate the
specification by writing zero for the StripByteCounts tag
when they want to leave the value unspecified. If the image
has a single strip, the library will estimate the missing
value based on the file size.</p>
