<p>NAME sh - shell, the standard command language
interpreter</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sh [-abCefhimnuvx][-o option][+abCefhimnuvx][+o
option] [command_file [argument...]]</p>

<p>sh -c[-abCefhimnuvx][-o option][+abCefhimnuvx][+o
option]command_string [command_name [argument...]]</p>

<p>sh -s[-abCefhimnuvx][-o option][+abCefhimnuvx][+o
option][argument]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sh utility is a command language
interpreter that shall execute commands read from a command
line string, the standard input, or a specified file. The
application shall ensure that the commands to be executed
are expressed in the language described in Shell Command
Lan- guage .</p>

<p>Pathname expansion shall not fail due to the size of a
file.</p>

<p>Shell input and output redirections have an
implementation-defined off- set maximum that is established
in the open file description.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The sh utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines, with an extension for support of
a leading plus sign (+) as noted below.</p>

<p>The -a, -b, -C, -e, -f, -m, -n, -o option, -u, -v, and
-x options are described as part of the set utility in
Special Built-In Utilities . The option letters derived from
the set special built-in shall also be accepted with a
leading plus sign ( + ) instead of a leading hyphen (meaning
the reverse case of the option as described in this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001).</p>

<p>The following additional options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-c Read commands from the command_string operand. Set
the value of special parameter 0 (see Special Parameters )
from the value of the command_name operand and the
positional parameters ($1, $2, and so on) in sequence from
the remaining argument operands. No commands shall be read
from the standard input.</p>

<p>-i Specify that the shell is interactive; see below. An
implementa- tion may treat specifying the -i option as an
error if the real user ID of the calling process does not
equal the effective user ID or if the real group ID does not
equal the effective group ID.</p>

<p>-s Read commands from the standard input.</p>

<p>If there are no operands and the -c option is not
specified, the -s option shall be assumed.</p>

<p>If the -i option is present, or if there are no operands
and the shells standard input and standard error are
attached to a terminal, the shell is considered to be
interactive.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>- A single hyphen shall be treated as the first operand
and then ignored. If both - and &quot;--&quot; are given as
arguments, or if other operands precede the single hyphen,
the results are unde- fined.</p>

<p>argument The positional parameters ($1, $2, and so on)
shall be set to arguments, if any.</p>

<p>command_file The pathname of a file containing commands.
If the pathname con- tains one or more slash characters, the
implementation attempts to read that file; the file need not
be executable. If the path- name does not contain a slash
character:</p>

<p>* The implementation shall attempt to read that file
from the current working directory; the file need not be
executable.</p>

<p>* If the file is not in the current working directory,
the implementation may perform a search for an executable
file using the value of PATH, as described in Command Search
and Execution .</p>

<p>Special parameter 0 (see Special Parameters ) shall be
set to the value of command_file. If sh is called using a
synopsis form that omits com- mand_file, special parameter 0
shall be set to the value of the first argument passed to sh
from its parent (for example, argv[0] for a C program),
which is normally a pathname used to execute the sh
utility.</p>

<p>command_name</p>

<p>A string assigned to special parameter 0 when executing
the com- mands in command_string. If command_name is not
specified, spe- cial parameter 0 shall be set to the value
of the first argument passed to sh from its parent (for
example, argv[0] for a C pro- gram), which is normally a
pathname used to execute the sh util- ity.</p>

<p>command_string</p>

<p>A string that shall be interpreted by the shell as one
or more commands, as if the string were the argument to the
system() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. If the command_string operand is an
empty string, sh shall exit with a zero exit status.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if one of
the following is true:</p>

<p>* The -s option is specified.</p>

<p>* The -c option is not specified and no operands are
specified.</p>

<p>* The script executes one or more commands that require
input from standard input (such as a read command that does
not redirect its input).</p>

<p>See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>When the shell is using standard input and it invokes a
command that also uses standard input, the shell shall
ensure that the standard input file pointer points directly
after the command it has read when the command begins
execution. It shall not read ahead in such a manner that any
characters intended to be read by the invoked command are
con- sumed by the shell (whether interpreted by the shell or
not) or that characters that are not read by the invoked
command are not seen by the shell. When the command
expecting to read standard input is started asynchronously
by an interactive shell, it is unspecified whether char-
acters are read by the command or interpreted by the
shell.</p>

<p>If the standard input to sh is a FIFO or terminal device
and is set to non-blocking reads, then sh shall enable
blocking reads on standard input. This shall remain in
effect when the command completes.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input file shall be a text file, except
that line lengths shall be unlimited. If the input file is
empty or consists solely of blank lines or comments, or
both, sh shall exit with a zero exit status.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of sh:</p>

<p>ENV This variable, when and only when an interactive
shell is invoked, shall be subjected to parameter expansion
(see Parame- ter Expansion ) by the shell, and the resulting
value shall be used as a pathname of a file containing shell
commands to exe- cute in the current environment. The file
need not be exe- cutable. If the expanded value of ENV is
not an absolute path- name, the results are unspecified. ENV
shall be ignored if the real and effective user IDs or real
and effective group IDs of the process are different.</p>

<p>FCEDIT This variable, when expanded by the shell, shall
determine the default value for the -e editor options editor
option-argument. If FCEDIT is null or unset, ed shall be
used as the editor. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
specifies the effects of this variable only for systems
supporting the User Portability Utili- ties option.</p>

<p>HISTFILE Determine a pathname naming a command history
file. If the HIST- FILE variable is not set, the shell may
attempt to access or create a file .sh_history in the
directory referred to by the HOME environment variable. If
the shell cannot obtain both read and write access to, or
create, the history file, it shall use an unspecified
mechanism that allows the history to operate properly.
(References to history &quot;file&quot; in this section
shall be understood to mean this unspecified mechanism in
such cases.) An implementation may choose to access this
variable only when ini- tializing the history file; this
initialization shall occur when fc or sh first attempt to
retrieve entries from, or add entries to, the file, as the
result of commands issued by the user, the file named by the
ENV variable, or implementation-defined system start-up
files. Implementations may choose to disable the his- tory
list mechanism for users with appropriate privileges who do
not set HISTFILE ; the specific circumstances under which
this occurs are implementation-defined. If more than one
instance of the shell is using the same history file, it is
unspecified how updates to the history file from those
shells interact. As entries are deleted from the history
file, they shall be deleted oldest first. It is unspecified
when history file entries are physically removed from the
history file. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 specifies
the effects of this variable only for systems supporting the
User Portability Utilities option.</p>

<p>HISTSIZE Determine a decimal number representing the
limit to the number of previous commands that are
accessible. If this variable is unset, an unspecified
default greater than or equal to 128 shall be used. The
maximum number of commands in the history list is
unspecified, but shall be at least 128. An implementation
may choose to access this variable only when initializing
the his- tory file, as described under HISTFILE. Therefore,
it is unspecified whether changes made to HISTSIZE after the
history file has been initialized are effective.</p>

<p>HOME Determine the pathname of the user s home
directory. The con- tents of HOME are used in tilde
expansion as described in Tilde Expansion . This volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 specifies the effects of this variable
only for systems supporting the User Portability Utilities
option.</p>

<p>IFS (Input Field Separators.) A string treated as a list
of charac- ters that shall be used for field splitting and
to split lines into words with the read command. See Field
Splitting . If IFS is not set, the shell shall behave as if
the value of IFS were &lt;space&gt;, &lt;tab&gt;, and
&lt;newline&gt;. Implementations may ignore the value of IFS
in the environment at the time sh is invoked, treating IFS
as if it were not set.</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the behavior of range expressions, equivalence
classes, and multi-character collating elements within
pattern matching.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files), which characters are defined as letters
(character class alpha), and the behavior of character
classes within pattern matching.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>MAIL Determine a pathname of the users mailbox file for
purposes of incoming mail notification. If this variable is
set, the shell shall inform the user if the file named by
the variable is cre- ated or if its modification time has
changed. Informing the user shall be accomplished by writing
a string of unspecified format to standard error prior to
the writing of the next primary prompt string. Such check
shall be performed only after the com- pletion of the
interval defined by the MAILCHECK variable after the last
such check. The user shall be informed only if MAIL is set
and MAILPATH is not set. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
specifies the effects of this variable only for systems
support- ing the User Portability Utilities option.</p>

<p>MAILCHECK</p>

<p>Establish a decimal integer value that specifies how
often (in seconds) the shell shall check for the arrival of
mail in the files specified by the MAILPATH or MAIL
variables. The default value shall be 600 seconds. If set to
zero, the shell shall check before issuing each primary
prompt. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 specifies the
effects of this variable only for systems supporting the
User Portability Utilities option.</p>

<p>MAILPATH Provide a list of pathnames and optional
messages separated by colons. If this variable is set, the
shell shall inform the user if any of the files named by the
variable are created or if any of their modification times
change. (See the preceding entry for MAIL for descriptions
of mail arrival and user informing.) Each pathname can be
followed by%and a string that shall be subjected to
parameter expansion and written to standard error when the
modification time changes. If a% character in the pathname
is preceded by a backslash, it shall be treated as a
literal%in the pathname. The default message is
unspecified.</p>

<p>The MAILPATH environment variable takes precedence over
the MAIL vari- able. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
specifies the effects of this variable only for systems
supporting the User Portability Utilities option.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>PATH Establish a string formatted as described in the
Base Defini- tions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter
8, Environment Variables, used to effect command
interpretation; see Command Search and Execution .</p>

<p>PWD This variable shall represent an absolute pathname
of the cur- rent working directory. Assignments to this
variable may be ignored unless the value is an absolute
pathname of the current working directory and there are no
filename components of dot or dot-dot.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT See the STDERR section.</p>

<p>STDERR Except as otherwise stated (by the descriptions
of any invoked utili- ties or in interactive mode), standard
error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION See Shell Command Language . The
following additional capabilities are supported on systems
supporting the User Portability Utilities option.</p>

<p>Command History List When the sh utility is being used
interactively, it shall maintain a list of commands
previously entered from the terminal in the file named by
the HISTFILE environment variable. The type, size, and
internal format of this file are unspecified. Multiple sh
processes can share access to the file for a user, if file
access permissions allow this; see the description of the
HISTFILE environment variable.</p>

<p>Command Line Editing When sh is being used interactively
from a terminal, the current com- mand and the command
history (see fc ) can be edited using vi-mode com- mand line
editing. This mode uses commands, described below, similar
to a subset of those described in the vi utility.
Implementations may offer other command line editing modes
corresponding to other editing utilities.</p>

<p>The command set -o vi shall enable vi-mode editing and
place sh into vi insert mode (see Command Line Editing
(vi-mode) ). This command also shall disable any other
editing mode that the implementation may pro- vide. The
command set +o vi disables vi-mode editing.</p>

<p>Certain block-mode terminals may be unable to support
shell command line editing. If a terminal is unable to
provide either edit mode, it need not be possible to set -o
vi when using the shell on this termi- nal.</p>

<p>In the following sections, the characters erase,
interrupt, kill, and end-of-file are those set by the stty
utility.</p>

<p>Command Line Editing (vi-mode) In vi editing mode, there
shall be a distinguished line, the edit line. All the
editing operations which modify a line affect the edit line.
The edit line is always the newest line in the command
history buffer.</p>

<p>With vi-mode enabled, sh can be switched between insert
mode and com- mand mode.</p>

<p>When in insert mode, an entered character shall be
inserted into the command line, except as noted in vi Line
Editing Insert Mode . Upon entering sh and after termination
of the previous command, sh shall be in insert mode.</p>

<p>Typing an escape character shall switch sh into command
mode (see vi Line Editing Command Mode ). In command mode,
an entered character shall either invoke a defined
operation, be used as part of a multi- character operation,
or be treated as an error. A character that is not
recognized as part of an editing command shall terminate any
specific editing command and shall alert the terminal.
Typing the interrupt character in command mode shall cause
sh to terminate command line editing on the current command
line, reissue the prompt on the next line of the terminal,
and reset the command history (see fc ) so that the most
recently executed command is the previous command (that is,
the command that was being edited when it was interrupted is
not reen- tered into the history).</p>

<p>In the following sections, the phrase &quot;move the
cursor to the beginning of the word&quot; shall mean
&quot;move the cursor to the first character of the current
word&quot; and the phrase &quot;move the cursor to the end
of the word&quot; shall mean &quot;move the cursor to the
last character of the current word&quot;. The phrase
&quot;beginning of the command line&quot; indicates the
point between the end of the prompt string issued by the
shell (or the beginning of the terminal line, if there is no
prompt string) and the first charac- ter of the command
text.</p>

<p>vi Line Editing Insert Mode While in insert mode, any
character typed shall be inserted in the cur- rent command
line, unless it is from the following set.</p>

<p>&lt;newline&gt; Execute the current command line. If the
current command line is not empty, this line shall be
entered into the command history (see fc ).</p>

<p>erase Delete the character previous to the current
cursor position and move the current cursor position back
one character. In insert mode, characters shall be erased
from both the screen and the buffer when backspacing.</p>

<p>interrupt Terminate command line editing with the same
effects as described for interrupting command mode; see
Command Line Edit- ing (vi-mode) .</p>

<p>kill Clear all the characters from the input line.</p>

<p>&lt;control&gt;-V Insert the next character input, even
if the character is other- wise a special insert mode
character.</p>

<p>&lt;control&gt;-W Delete the characters from the one
preceding the cursor to the preceding word boundary. The
word boundary in this case is the closer to the cursor of
either the beginning of the line or a character that is in
neither the blank nor punct character clas- sification of
the current locale.</p>

<p>end-of-file Interpreted as the end of input in sh. This
interpretation shall occur only at the beginning of an input
line. If end-of-file is entered other than at the beginning
of the line, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>&lt;ESC&gt; Place sh into command mode.</p>

<p>vi Line Editing Command Mode In command mode for the
command line editing feature, decimal digits not beginning
with 0 that precede a command letter shall be remembered.
Some commands use these decimal digits as a count number
that affects the operation.</p>

<p>The term motion command represents one of the
commands:</p>

<p>&lt;space&gt; 0 b F l W ^ $ ; E f T w | , B e h t</p>

<p>If the current line is not the edit line, any command
that modifies the current line shall cause the content of
the current line to replace the content of the edit line,
and the current line shall become the edit line. This
replacement cannot be undone (see the u and U commands
below). The modification requested shall then be performed
to the edit line. When the current line is the edit line,
the modification shall be done directly to the edit
line.</p>

<p>Any command that is preceded by count shall take a count
(the numeric value of any preceding decimal digits). Unless
otherwise noted, this count shall cause the specified
operation to repeat by the number of times specified by the
count. Also unless otherwise noted, a count that is out of
range is considered an error condition and shall alert the
terminal, but neither the cursor position, nor the command
line, shall change.</p>

<p>The terms word and bigword are used as defined in the vi
description. The term save buffer corresponds to the term
unnamed buffer in vi.</p>

<p>The following commands shall be recognized in command
mode:</p>

<p>&lt;newline&gt; Execute the current command line. If the
current command line is not empty, this line shall be
entered into the command history (see fc ).</p>

<p>&lt;control&gt;-L Redraw the current command line.
Position the cursor at the same location on the redrawn
line.</p>

<p># Insert the character # at the beginning of the current
command line and treat the resulting edit line as a comment.
This line shall be entered into the command history; see fc
.</p>

<p>= Display the possible shell word expansions (see Word
Expansions ) of the bigword at the current command line
position.</p>

<p>Note: This does not modify the content of the current
line, and there- fore does not cause the current line to
become the edit line.</p>

<p>These expansions shall be displayed on subsequent
terminal lines. If the bigword contains none of the
characters,, or, an aster- isk (*) shall be implicitly
assumed at the end. If any directories are matched, these
expansions shall have a / character appended. After the
expansion, the line shall be redrawn, the cursor
repositioned at the current cursor position, and sh shall be
placed in command mode.</p>

<p>Perform pathname expansion (see Pathname Expansion ) on
the cur- rent bigword, up to the largest set of characters
that can be matched uniquely. If the bigword contains none
of the charac- ters,, or, an asterisk (*) shall be
implicitly assumed at the end. This maximal expansion then
shall replace the original bigword in the command line, and
the cursor shall be placed after this expansion. If the
resulting bigword com- pletely and uniquely matches a
directory, a / character shall be inserted directly after
the bigword. If some other file is completely matched, a
single &lt;space&gt; shall be inserted after the bigword.
After this operation, sh shall be placed in insert mode.</p>

<p>* Perform pathname expansion on the current bigword and
insert all expansions into the command to replace the
current bigword, with each expansion separated by a single
&lt;space&gt;. If at the end of the line, the current cursor
position shall be moved to the first column position
following the expansions and sh shall be placed in insert
mode. Otherwise, the current cursor position shall be the
last column position of the first character after the
expansions and sh shall be placed in insert mode. If the
current bigword contains none of the characters , * , or [,
before the operation, an asterisk shall be implicitly
assumed at the end.</p>

<p>@letter Insert the value of the alias named _letter. The
symbol letter represents a single alphabetic character from
the portable char- acter set; implementations may support
additional characters as an extension. If the alias _letter
contains other editing com- mands, these commands shall be
performed as part of the inser- tion. If no alias _letter is
enabled, this command shall have no effect.</p>

<p>[count]~ Convert, if the current character is a
lowercase letter, to the equivalent uppercase letter and
vice versa, as prescribed by the current locale. The current
cursor position then shall be advanced by one character. If
the cursor was positioned on the last character of the line,
the case conversion shall occur, but the cursor shall not
advance. If the~command is preceded by a count, that number
of characters shall be converted, and the cursor shall be
advanced to the character position after the last character
converted. If the count is larger than the number of
characters after the cursor, this shall not be considered an
error; the cursor shall advance to the last character on the
line.</p>

<p>[count]. Repeat the most recent non-motion command, even
if it was exe- cuted on an earlier command line. If the
previous command was preceded by a count, and no count is
given on the. command, the count from the previous command
shall be included as part of the repeated command. If
the.command is preceded by a count, this shall override any
count argument to the previous command. The count specified
in the.command shall become the count for
subsequent.commands issued without a count.</p>

<p>[number]v Invoke the vi editor to edit the current
command line in a tem- porary file. When the editor exits,
the commands in the tempo- rary file shall be executed and
placed in the command history. If a number is included, it
specifies the command number in the command history to be
edited, rather than the current command line.</p>

<p>[count]l (ell)</p>

<p>[count]&lt;space&gt;</p>

<p>Move the current cursor position to the next character
position. If the cursor was positioned on the last character
of the line, the terminal shall be alerted and the cursor
shall not be advanced. If the count is larger than the
number of characters after the cursor, this shall not be
considered an error; the cursor shall advance to the last
character on the line.</p>

<p>[count]h Move the current cursor position to the countth
(default 1) pre- vious character position. If the cursor was
positioned on the first character of the line, the terminal
shall be alerted and the cursor shall not be moved. If the
count is larger than the number of characters before the
cursor, this shall not be con- sidered an error; the cursor
shall move to the first character on the line.</p>

<p>[count]w Move to the start of the next word. If the
cursor was positioned on the last character of the line, the
terminal shall be alerted and the cursor shall not be
advanced. If the count is larger than the number of words
after the cursor, this shall not be considered an error; the
cursor shall advance to the last char- acter on the
line.</p>

<p>[count]W Move to the start of the next bigword. If the
cursor was posi- tioned on the last character of the line,
the terminal shall be alerted and the cursor shall not be
advanced. If the count is larger than the number of bigwords
after the cursor, this shall not be considered an error; the
cursor shall advance to the last character on the line.</p>

<p>[count]e Move to the end of the current word. If at the
end of a word, move to the end of the next word. If the
cursor was positioned on the last character of the line, the
terminal shall be alerted and the cursor shall not be
advanced. If the count is larger than the number of words
after the cursor, this shall not be considered an error; the
cursor shall advance to the last char- acter on the
line.</p>

<p>[count]E Move to the end of the current bigword. If at
the end of a big- word, move to the end of the next bigword.
If the cursor was positioned on the last character of the
line, the terminal shall be alerted and the cursor shall not
be advanced. If the count is larger than the number of
bigwords after the cursor, this shall not be considered an
error; the cursor shall advance to the last character on the
line.</p>

<p>[count]b Move to the beginning of the current word. If
at the beginning of a word, move to the beginning of the
previous word. If the cursor was positioned on the first
character of the line, the terminal shall be alerted and the
cursor shall not be moved. If the count is larger than the
number of words preceding the cur- sor, this shall not be
considered an error; the cursor shall return to the first
character on the line.</p>

<p>[count]B Move to the beginning of the current bigword.
If at the begin- ning of a bigword, move to the beginning of
the previous big- word. If the cursor was positioned on the
first character of the line, the terminal shall be alerted
and the cursor shall not be moved. If the count is larger
than the number of bigwords preceding the cursor, this shall
not be considered an error; the cursor shall return to the
first character on the line.</p>

<p>^ Move the current cursor position to the first
character on the input line that is not a &lt;blank&gt;.</p>

<p>$ Move to the last character position on the current
command line.</p>

<p>0 (Zero.) Move to the first character position on the
current com- mand line.</p>

<p>[count]| Move to the countth character position on the
current command line. If no number is specified, move to the
first position. The first character position shall be
numbered 1. If the count is larger than the number of
characters on the line, this shall not be considered an
error; the cursor shall be placed on the last character on
the line.</p>

<p>[count]fc Move to the first occurrence of the character
c that occurs after the current cursor position. If the
cursor was positioned on the last character of the line, the
terminal shall be alerted and the cursor shall not be
advanced. If the charactercdoes not occur in the line after
the current cursor position, the terminal shall be alerted
and the cursor shall not be moved.</p>

<p>[count]Fc Move to the first occurrence of the character
c that occurs before the current cursor position. If the
cursor was positioned on the first character of the line,
the terminal shall be alerted and the cursor shall not be
moved. If the character c does not occur in the line before
the current cursor position, the terminal shall be alerted
and the cursor shall not be moved.</p>

<p>[count]tc Move to the character before the first
occurrence of the charac- ter cthat occurs after the current
cursor position. If the cursor was positioned on the last
character of the line, the terminal shall be alerted and the
cursor shall not be advanced. If the charactercdoes not
occur in the line after the cur- rent cursor position, the
terminal shall be alerted and the cur- sor shall not be
moved.</p>

<p>[count]Tc Move to the character after the first
occurrence of the charac- tercthat occurs before the current
cursor position. If the cursor was positioned on the first
character of the line, the terminal shall be alerted and the
cursor shall not be moved. If the charactercdoes not occur
in the line before the current cursor position, the terminal
shall be alerted and the cursor shall not be moved.</p>

<p>[count]; Repeat the most recent f, F, t, or T command.
Any number argu- ment on that previous command shall be
ignored. Errors are those described for the repeated
command.</p>

<p>[count], Repeat the most recent f, F, t, or T command.
Any number argu- ment on that previous command shall be
ignored. However, reverse the direction of that command.</p>

<p>a Enter insert mode after the current cursor position.
Characters that are entered shall be inserted before the
next character.</p>

<p>A Enter insert mode after the end of the current command
line.</p>

<p>i Enter insert mode at the current cursor position.
Characters that are entered shall be inserted before the
current character.</p>

<p>I Enter insert mode at the beginning of the current
command line.</p>

<p>R Enter insert mode, replacing characters from the
command line beginning at the current cursor position.</p>

<p>[count]cmotion</p>

<p>Delete the characters between the current cursor
position and the cursor position that would result from the
specified motion command. Then enter insert mode before the
first character fol- lowing any deleted characters. If count
is specified, it shall be applied to the motion command. A
count shall be ignored for the following motion
commands:</p>

<p>0 ^ $ c</p>

<p>If the motion command is the characterc , the current
command line shall be cleared and insert mode shall be
entered. If the motion com- mand would move the current
cursor position toward the beginning of the command line,
the character under the current cursor position shall not be
deleted. If the motion command would move the current cursor
posi- tion toward the end of the command line, the character
under the cur- rent cursor position shall be deleted. If the
count is larger than the number of characters between the
current cursor position and the end of the command line
toward which the motion command would move the cursor, this
shall not be considered an error; all of the remaining
characters in the aforementioned range shall be deleted and
insert mode shall be entered. If the motion command is
invalid, the terminal shall be alerted, the cursor shall not
be moved, and no text shall be deleted.</p>

<p>C Delete from the current character to the end of the
line and enter insert mode at the new end-of-line.</p>

<p>S Clear the entire edit line and enter insert mode.</p>

<p>[count]rc Replace the current character with the
characterc . With a number count, replace the current and
the following count-1 characters. After this command, the
current cursor position shall be on the last character that
was changed. If the count is larger than the number of
characters after the cursor, this shall not be considered an
error; all of the remaining charac- ters shall be
changed.</p>

<p>[count]_ Append a &lt;space&gt; after the current
character position and then append the last bigword in the
previous input line after the &lt;space&gt;. Then enter
insert mode after the last character just appended. With a
number count, append the countth bigword in the previous
line.</p>

<p>[count]x Delete the character at the current cursor
position and place the deleted characters in the save
buffer. If the cursor was positioned on the last character
of the line, the character shall be deleted and the cursor
position shall be moved to the previous character (the new
last character). If the count is larger than the number of
characters after the cursor, this shall not be considered an
error; all the characters from the cursor to the end of the
line shall be deleted.</p>

<p>[count]X Delete the character before the current cursor
position and place the deleted characters in the save
buffer. The character under the current cursor position
shall not change. If the cur- sor was positioned on the
first character of the line, the ter- minal shall be
alerted, and the X command shall have no effect. If the line
contained a single character, the X command shall have no
effect. If the line contained no characters, the termi- nal
shall be alerted and the cursor shall not be moved. If the
count is larger than the number of characters before the
cursor, this shall not be considered an error; all the
characters from before the cursor to the beginning of the
line shall be deleted.</p>

<p>[count]dmotion</p>

<p>Delete the characters between the current cursor
position and the character position that would result from
the motion com- mand. A number count repeats the motion
command count times. If the motion command would move toward
the beginning of the com- mand line, the character under the
current cursor position shall not be deleted. If the motion
command is d, the entire current command line shall be
cleared. If the count is larger than the number of
characters between the current cursor position and the end
of the command line toward which the motion command would
move the cursor, this shall not be considered an error; all
of the remaining characters in the aforementioned range
shall be deleted. The deleted characters shall be placed in
the save buffer.</p>

<p>D Delete all characters from the current cursor position
to the end of the line. The deleted characters shall be
placed in the save buffer.</p>

<p>[count]ymotion</p>

<p>Yank (that is, copy) the characters from the current
cursor position to the position resulting from the motion
command into the save buffer. A number count shall be
applied to the motion command. If the motion command would
move toward the beginning of the command line, the character
under the current cursor position shall not be included in
the set of yanked characters. If the motion command is y,
the entire current command line shall be yanked into the
save buffer. The current cursor position shall be unchanged.
If the count is larger than the number of characters between
the current cursor position and the end of the command line
toward which the motion command would move the cursor, this
shall not be considered an error; all of the remaining
characters in the aforementioned range shall be yanked.</p>

<p>Y Yank the characters from the current cursor position
to the end of the line into the save buffer. The current
character position shall be unchanged.</p>

<p>[count]p Put a copy of the current contents of the save
buffer after the current cursor position. The current cursor
position shall be advanced to the last character put from
the save buffer. A count shall indicate how many copies of
the save buffer shall be put.</p>

<p>[count]P Put a copy of the current contents of the save
buffer before the current cursor position. The current
cursor position shall be moved to the last character put
from the save buffer. A count shall indicate how many copies
of the save buffer shall be put.</p>

<p>u Undo the last command that changed the edit line. This
operation shall not undo the copy of any command line to the
edit line.</p>

<p>U Undo all changes made to the edit line. This operation
shall not undo the copy of any command line to the edit
line.</p>

<p>[count]k</p>

<p>[count]- Set the current command line to be the countth
previous command line in the shell command history. If count
is not specified, it shall default to 1. The cursor shall be
positioned on the first character of the new command. If a k
or - command would retreat past the maximum number of
commands in effect for this shell (affected by the HISTSIZE
environment variable), the terminal shall be alerted, and
the command shall have no effect.</p>

<p>[count]j</p>

<p>[count]+ Set the current command line to be the countth
next command line in the shell command history. If count is
not specified, it shall default to 1. The cursor shall be
positioned on the first character of the new command. If a j
or + command advances past the edit line, the current
command line shall be restored to the edit line and the
terminal shall be alerted.</p>

<p>[number]G Set the current command line to be the oldest
command line stored in the shell command history. With a
number number, set the current command line to be the
command line number in the history. If command line number
does not exist, the terminal shall be alerted and the
command line shall not be changed.</p>

<p>/pattern&lt;newline&gt;</p>

<p>Move backwards through the command history, searching
for the specified pattern, beginning with the previous
command line. Patterns use the pattern matching notation
described in Pattern Matching Notation, except that
the^character shall have spe- cial meaning when it appears
as the first character of pattern. In this case, the^is
discarded and the characters after the ^shall be matched
only at the beginning of a line. Commands in the command
history shall be treated as strings, not as file- names. If
the pattern is not found, the current command line shall be
unchanged and the terminal is alerted. If it is found in a
previous line, the current command line shall be set to that
line and the cursor shall be set to the first character of
the new command line.</p>

<p>If pattern is empty, the last non-empty pattern provided
to / or ? shall be used. If there is no previous non-empty
pattern, the terminal shall be alerted and the current
command line shall remain unchanged.</p>

<p>?pattern&lt;newline&gt;</p>

<p>Move forwards through the command history, searching for
the specified pattern, beginning with the next command line.
Pat- terns use the pattern matching notation described in
Pattern Matching Notation, except that the^character shall
have spe- cial meaning when it appears as the first
character of pattern. In this case, the^is discarded and the
characters after the ^shall be matched only at the beginning
of a line. Commands in the command history shall be treated
as strings, not as file- names. If the pattern is not found,
the current command line shall be unchanged and the terminal
alerted. If it is found in a following line, the current
command line shall be set to that line and the cursor shall
be set to the fist character of the new command line.</p>

<p>If pattern is empty, the last non-empty pattern provided
to / or ? shall be used. If there is no previous non-empty
pattern, the terminal shall be alerted and the current
command line shall remain unchanged.</p>

<p>n Repeat the most recent / or ? command. If there is no
previous / or ?, the terminal shall be alerted and the
current command line shall remain unchanged.</p>

<p>N Repeat the most recent / or ? command, reversing the
direction of the search. If there is no previous / or ?, the
terminal shall be alerted and the current command line shall
remain unchanged.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 The script to be executed consisted solely of zero or
more blank lines or comments, or both.</p>

<p>1-125 A non-interactive shell detected a syntax,
redirection, or vari- able assignment error.</p>

<p>127 A specified command_file could not be found by a
non-interactive shell.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the shell shall return the exit status of the
last command it invoked or attempted to invoke (see also the
exit utility in Special Built-In Utilities ).</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS See Consequences of Shell Errors
.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Standard input and standard error are
the files that determine whether a shell is interactive when
-i is not specified. For example:</p>

<p>sh &gt; file</p>

<p>and:</p>

<p>sh 2&gt; file</p>

<p>create interactive and non-interactive shells,
respectively. Although both accept terminal input, the
results of error conditions are differ- ent, as described in
Consequences of Shell Errors ; in the second exam- ple a
redirection error encountered by a special built-in utility
aborts the shell.</p>

<p>A conforming application must protect its first operand,
if it starts with a plus sign, by preceding it with the
&quot;--&quot; argument that denotes the end of the
options.</p>

<p>Applications should note that the standard PATH to the
shell cannot be assumed to be either /bin/sh or /usr/bin/sh,
and should be determined by interrogation of the PATH
returned by getconf PATH, ensuring that the returned
pathname is an absolute pathname and not a shell
built-in.</p>

<p>For example, to determine the location of the standard
sh utility:</p>

<p>command -v sh</p>

<p>On some implementations this might return:</p>

<p>/usr/xpg4/bin/sh</p>

<p>Furthermore, on systems that support executable scripts
(the &quot;#!&quot; con- struct), it is recommended that
applications using executable scripts install them using
getconf -v to determine the shell pathname and update the
&quot;#!&quot; script appropriately as it is being installed
(for example, with sed). For example:</p>

<p># # Installation time script to install correct POSIX
shell pathname # # Get list of paths to check # Sifs=$IFS
IFS=: set $(getconf PATH) IFS=$Sifs # # Check each path
forsh # for i in $@ do if [ -f ${i}/sh ]; then
Pshell=${i}/sh fi done # # This is the list of scripts to
update. They should be of the # form ${name}.source and will
be transformed to ${name. # Each script should begin: # #
!INSTALLSHELLPATH -p # scripts=&quot;a b c&quot; # #
Transform each script # for i in ${scripts} do sed -e
&quot;s|INSTALLSHELLPATH|${Pshell}|&quot; &lt; ${i}.source
&gt; ${i} done</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. Execute a shell command from a string:</p>

<p>sh -c &quot;cat myfile&quot;</p>

<p>2. Execute a shell script from a file in the current
directory:</p>

<p>sh my_shell_cmds</p>

<p>RATIONALE The sh utility and the set special built-in
utility share a common set of options.</p>

<p>The KornShell ignores the contents of IFS upon entry to
the script. A conforming application cannot rely on
importing IFS. One justification for this, beyond security
considerations, is to assist possible future shell
compilers. Allowing IFS to be imported from the environment
pre- vents many optimizations that might otherwise be
performed via dataflow analysis of the script itself.</p>

<p>The text in the STDIN section about non-blocking reads
concerns an instance of sh that has been invoked, probably
by a C-language program, with standard input that has been
opened using the O_NONBLOCK flag; see open() in the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. If the shell did
not reset this flag, it would immediately terminate because
no input data would be available yet and that would be
considered the same as end-of-file.</p>

<p>The options associated with a restricted shell (command
name rsh and the -r option) were excluded because the
standard developers considered that the implied level of
security could not be achieved and they did not want to
raise false expectations.</p>

<p>On systems that support set-user-ID scripts, a
historical trapdoor has been to link a script to the name
-i. When it is called by a sequence such as:</p>

<p>sh -</p>

<p>or by:</p>

<p>#! usr/bin/sh -</p>

<p>the historical systems have assumed that no option
letters follow. Thus, this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
allows the single hyphen to mark the end of the options, in
addition to the use of the regular &quot;--&quot; argument,
because it was considered that the older practice was so
per- vasive. An alternative approach is taken by the
KornShell, where real and effective user/group IDs must
match for an interactive shell; this behavior is
specifically allowed by this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>Note: There are other problems with set-user-ID scripts
that the two approaches described here do not resolve.</p>

<p>The initialization process for the history file can be
dependent on the system start-up files, in that they may
contain commands that effec- tively preempt the user s
settings of HISTFILE and HISTSIZE. For exam- ple, function
definition commands are recorded in the history file, unless
the set -o nolog option is set. If the system administrator
includes function definitions in some system start-up file
called before the ENV file, the history file is initialized
before the user gets a chance to influence its
characteristics. In some historical shells, the history file
is initialized just after the ENV file has been processed.
Therefore, it is implementation-defined whether changes made
to HISTFILE after the history file has been initialized are
effective.</p>

<p>The default messages for the various MAIL -related
messages are unspec- ified because they vary across
implementations. Typical messages are:</p>

<p>&quot;you have main&quot;</p>

<p>or:</p>

<p>&quot;you have new main&quot;</p>

<p>It is important that the descriptions of command line
editing refer to the same shell as that in IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 so that interactive users can also be
application programmers without having to deal with
programmatic differences in their two environments. It is
also essen- tial that the utility name sh be specified
because this explicit util- ity name is too firmly rooted in
historical practice of application programs for it to
change.</p>

<p>Consideration was given to mandating a diagnostic
message when attempt- ing to set vi-mode on terminals that
do not support command line edit- ing. However, it is not
historical practice for the shell to be cog- nizant of all
terminal types and thus be able to detect inappropriate
terminals in all cases. Implementations are encouraged to
supply diag- nostics in this case whenever possible, rather
than leaving the user in a state where editing commands work
incorrectly.</p>

<p>In early proposals, the KornShell-derived emacs mode of
command line editing was included, even though the emacs
editor itself was not. The community of emacs proponents was
adamant that the full emacs editor not be standardized
because they were concerned that an attempt to standardize
this very powerful environment would encourage vendors to
ship strictly conforming versions lacking the extensibility
required by the community. The author of the original emacs
program also expressed his desire to omit the program.
Furthermore, there were a number of historical systems that
did not include emacs, or included it without supporting it,
but there were very few that did not include and support vi.
The shell emacs command line editing mode was finally
omitted because it became apparent that the KornShell
version and the editor being distributed with the GNU system
had diverged in some respects. The author of emacs requested
that the POSIX emacs mode either be deleted or have a
significant number of unspecified conditions. Although the
KornShell author agreed to consider changes to bring the
shell into alignment, the standard developers decided to
defer specifi- cation at that time. At the time, it was
assumed that convergence on an acceptable definition would
occur for a subsequent draft, but that has not happened, and
there appears to be no impetus to do so. In any case,
implementations are free to offer additional command line
editing modes based on the exact models of editors their
users are most comfortable with.</p>

<p>Early proposals had the following list entry in vi Line
Editing Insert Mode :</p>

<p>If followed by the erase or kill character, that
character shall be inserted into the input line. Otherwise,
the backslash itself shall be inserted into the input
line.</p>

<p>However, this is not actually a feature of sh command
line editing insert mode, but one of some historical
terminal line drivers. Some conforming implementations
continue to do this when the stty iexten flag is set.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
