<p>MKFONTDIR(1) MKFONTDIR(1)</p>

<p>NAME mkfontdir - create an index of X font files in a
directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mkfontdir [-n] [-x suffix] [-r] [-p prefix] [-e
encoding-directory- name] ... [--] [directory-name ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For each directory argument, mkfontdir reads
all of the font files in the directory searching for
properties named &quot;FONT&quot;, or (failing that) the
name of the file stripped of its suffix. These are converted
to lower case and used as font names, and, along with the
name of the font file, are written out to the file
&quot;fonts.dir&quot; in the directory. The X server and
font server use &quot;fonts.dir&quot; to find font
files.</p>

<p>The kinds of font files read by mkfontdir depend on
configuration parameters, but typically include PCF (suffix
&quot;.pcf&quot;), SNF (suffix &quot;.snf&quot;) and BDF
(suffix &quot;.bdf&quot;). If a font exists in multiple
formats, mkfontdir will first choose PCF, then SNF and
finally BDF.</p>

<p>The first line of fonts.dir gives the number of fonts in
the file. The remaining lines list the fonts themselves, one
per line, in two fields. First is the name of the font file,
followed by a space and the name of the font.</p>

<p>SCALABLE FONTS Because scalable font files do not
usually include the X font name, the file
&quot;fonts.scale&quot; can be used to name the scalable
fonts in the direc- tory. The fonts listed in it are copied
to fonts.dir by mkfontdir. &quot;fonts.scale&quot; has the
same format as the &quot;fonts.dir&quot; file, and can be
created with the mkfontscale(1) program.</p>

<p>FONT NAME ALIASES The file &quot;fonts.alias&quot;,
which can be put in any directory of the font- path, is used
to map new names to existing fonts, and should be edited by
hand. The format is two white-space separated columns, the
first containing aliases and the second containing font-name
patterns. Lines beginning with &quot;!&quot; are comment
lines and are ignored.</p>

<p>If neither the alias nor the value specifies the size
fields of the font name, this is a scalable alias. A font
name of any size that matches this alias will be mapped to
the same size of the font that the alias resolves to.</p>

<p>When a font alias is used, the name it references is
searched for in the normal manner, looking through each font
directory in turn. This means that the aliases need not
mention fonts in the same directory as the alias file.</p>

<p>To embed white space in either name, simply enclose it
in double-quote marks; to embed double-quote marks (or any
other character), precede them with back-slash:</p>

<p>&quot;magic-alias with spaces&quot; &quot; regular-alias
fixed</p>

<p>If the string &quot;FILE_NAMES_ALIASES&quot; stands
alone on a line, each file- name in the directory (stripped
of its suffix) will be used as an alias for that font.</p>

<p>ENCODING FILES The option -e can be used to specify a
directory with encoding files. Every such directory is
scanned for encoding files, the list of which is then
written to an &quot;encodings.dir&quot; file in every font
directory. The &quot;encodings.dir&quot; file is used by the
server to find encoding infor- mation.</p>

<p>The &quot;encodings.dir&quot; file has the same format
as &quot;fonts.dir&quot;. It maps encoding names (strings of
the form CHARSET_REGISTRY-CHARSET_ENCODING ) to encoding
file names.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>-e Specify a directory containing encoding files. The -e
option may be specified multiple times, and all the
specified directo- ries will be read. The order of the
entries is significant, as encodings found in earlier
directories override those in later ones; encoding files in
the same directory are discriminated by preferring
compressed versions.</p>

<p>-n do not scan for fonts, do not write font directory
files. This option is useful when generating encoding
directories only.</p>

<p>-p Specify a prefix that is prepended to the encoding
file path names when they are written to the
&quot;encodings.dir&quot; file. The prefix is prepended
as-is. If a / is required between the prefix and the path
names, it must be supplied explicitly as part of the
prefix.</p>

<p>-r Keep non-absolute encoding directories in their
relative form when writing the &quot;encodings.dir&quot;
file. The default is to con- vert relative encoding
directories to absolute directories by prepending the
current directory. The positioning of this options is
significant, as this option only applies to subse- quent -e
options.</p>

<p>-x suffix Ignore fonts files of type suffix.</p>

<p>-- End options.</p>

<p>FILES fonts.dir List of fonts in the directory and the
files they are stored in. Created by mkfontdir. Read by the
X server and font server each time the font path is set (see
xset(1)).</p>

<p>fonts.scale List of scalable fonts in the directory.
Contents are copied to fonts.dir by mkfontdir. Can be
created with mkfontscale(1).</p>

<p>fonts.alias List of font name aliases. Read by the X
server and font server each time the font path is set (see
xset(1)).</p>

<p>encodings.dir List of known encodings and the files they
are stored in. Created by mkfontdir. Read by the X server
and font server each time a font with an unknown charset is
opened.</p>
