<p>TOLOWER(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TOLOWER(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tolower - transliterate uppercase characters to
lowercase</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ctype.h&gt;</p>

<p>int tolower(int c);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tolower() function has as a domain a
type int, the value of which is representable as an unsigned
char or the value of EOF. If the argu- ment has any other
value, the behavior is undefined. If the argument of
tolower() represents an uppercase letter, and there exists a
corre- sponding lowercase letter (as defined by character
type information in the program locale category LC_CTYPE ),
the result shall be the corre- sponding lowercase letter.
All other arguments in the domain are returned
unchanged.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, tolower() shall
return the lowercase letter corresponding to the argument
passed; otherwise, it shall return the argument
unchanged.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>
