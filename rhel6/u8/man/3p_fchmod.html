<p>FCHMOD(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FCHMOD(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fchmod - change mode of a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fchmod(int fildes, mode_t mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fchmod() function shall be equivalent to
chmod() except that the file whose permissions are changed
is specified by the file descriptor fildes.</p>

<p>If fildes references a shared memory object, the
fchmod() function need only affect the S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR,
S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH file permission
bits.</p>

<p>If fildes references a typed memory object, the behavior
of fchmod() is unspecified.</p>

<p>If fildes refers to a socket, the behavior of fchmod()
is unspecified.</p>

<p>If fildes refers to a STREAM (which is fattach()-ed into
the file sys- tem name space) the call returns successfully,
doing nothing.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, fchmod() shall
return 0. Otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fchmod() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not an open file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EPERM The effective user ID does not match the owner of
the file and the process does not have appropriate
privilege.</p>

<p>EROFS The file referred to by fildes resides on a
read-only file sys- tem.</p>

<p>The fchmod() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINTR The fchmod() function was interrupted by a
signal.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the mode argument is invalid.</p>

<p>EINVAL The fildes argument refers to a pipe and the
implementation dis- allows execution of fchmod() on a
pipe.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Changing the Current Permissions for a File The
following example shows how to change the permissions for a
file named /home/cnd/mod1 so that the owner and group have
read/write/execute permissions, but the world only has
read/write per- missions.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt; #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</p>

<p>mode_t mode; int fildes; ... fildes =
open(&quot;/home/cnd/mod1&quot;, O_RDWR); fchmod(fildes,
S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IROTH | S_IWOTH);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
