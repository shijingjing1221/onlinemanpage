<p>Name mclasserase - erase memory cards</p>

<p>Note of warning This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation, and may not be
entirely accurate or complete. See the end of this man page
for details.</p>

<p>Description The mclasserase command is used to wipe
memory cards by overwriting it three times: first with 0xff,
then with 0x00, then with 0xff again. The command uses the
following syntax:</p>

<p>mclasserase [-d] msdosdrive</p>

<p>Dos drive is optional, if none is specified, use A:. If
more than one drive are specified, all but the last are
ignored.</p>

<p>Mclasserase accepts the following command line
options:</p>

<p>d Stop after each erase cycle, for testing purposes</p>

<p>p Not yet implemented</p>

<p>Mclasserase returns 0 on success or -1 on failure.</p>

<p>Viewing the texi doc This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation. However, this
process is only approximative, and some items, such as
crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate
represen- tation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all
information has been translated into the manpage version.
Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.
See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the
texinfo doc.</p>

<p>* To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run
the fol- lowing commands:</p>

<p>./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi</p>

<p>* To generate a html copy, run:</p>

<p>./configure; make html</p>

<p>A premade html can be found at http://www.gnu.org/soft-
ware/mtools/manual/mtools.html</p>

<p>* To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs info
mode), run:</p>

<p>./configure; make info</p>

<p>The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as
html. Indeed, in the info version certain examples are
difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in
info.</p>
