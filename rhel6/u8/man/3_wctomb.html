<p>WCTOMB(3) Linux Programmer s Manual WCTOMB(3)</p>

<p>NAME wctomb - convert a wide character to a multibyte
sequence</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int wctomb(char *s, wchar_t wc);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If s is not NULL, the wctomb() function
converts the wide character wc to its multibyte
representation and stores it at the beginning of the
character array pointed to by s. It updates the shift state,
which is stored in a static anonymous variable only known to
the wctomb func- tion, and returns the length of said
multibyte representation, that is, the number of bytes
written at s.</p>

<p>The programmer must ensure that there is room for at
least MB_CUR_MAX bytes at s.</p>

<p>If s is NULL, the wctomb() function resets the shift
state, only known to this function, to the initial state,
and returns non-zero if the encoding has nontrivial shift
state, or zero if the encoding is state- less.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If s is not NULL, the wctomb() function
returns the number of bytes that have been written to the
byte array at s. If wc can not be repre- sented as a
multibyte sequence (according to the current locale), -1 is
returned.</p>

<p>If s is NULL, the wctomb() function returns non-zero if
the encoding has nontrivial shift state, or zero if the
encoding is stateless.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of wctomb() depends on the LC_CTYPE
category of the cur- rent locale.</p>

<p>This function is not multithread safe. The function
wcrtomb(3) pro- vides a better interface to the same
functionality.</p>
