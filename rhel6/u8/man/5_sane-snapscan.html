<p>sane-snapscan(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-snapscan(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-snapscan - SANE backend for AGFA SnapScan
flatbed scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-snapscan library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
AGFA SnapScan flatbed scanners. At present, the following
scanners are supported from this backend: AGFA SnapScan 300,
310, 600, and 1236s, 1236u, 1212u, e20, e25, e40, e50, e60,
Vuego 310s, Acer 300f, 310s, 610s, 610plus, Prisa 620s,
Prisa 620u, Prisa 620ut, Prisa 640u, Prisa 640bu, Prisa
1240, Prisa 3300, Prisa 4300, Prisa 5300 and Guillemot Maxi
Scan A4 Deluxe (SCSI) (with varying success).</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is the path-name for the special device
that corresponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI scanners, the
special device name must be a generic SCSI device or a
symlink to such a device. Under Linux, such a device name
could be /dev/sga or /dev/sge, for example. See sane-scsi(5)
for details.</p>

<p>For USB scanners the devicename must contain the keyword
&quot;usb&quot;, as in /dev/usbscanner or /dev/usb/scanner0.
For scanners that need a firmware upload before scanning add
a line starting with &quot;firmware&quot; followed by the
fully qualified path to your firmware file, e.g.</p>

<p>firmware /usr/share/sane/snapscan/firmware.bin</p>

<p>For further details read
http://snapscan.sourceforge.net.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the snapscan.conf file is
a list of device names that correspond to SnapScan scanners.
Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored. See sane-scsi(5) on details of what consti- tutes a
valid device name.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/snapscan.conf The backend
configuration file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR
below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-snapscan.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-snapscan.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_SNAPSCAN If the library was compiled with
debug support enabled, this environment variable controls
the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 255
requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>BUGS Man page doesnt provide much information yet.</p>
