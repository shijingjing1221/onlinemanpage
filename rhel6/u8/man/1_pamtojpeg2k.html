<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamtojpeg2k converts the named PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM
file, or Standard Input if no file is named, to a JPEG-2000
code stream (JPC) file on Standard Output.</p>

<p>The JPEG-2000 specification specifies two different
formats: JP2 and JPEG-2000 code stream (JPC). JP2 represents
a visual image quite specifically, whereas JPC is a more or
less arbitrary array of codes. pamtojpeg2k cant produce a
JP2, but the JPC image that pamtojpeg2k produces is very
similar to a JP2 if the input is a PBM, PGM, or PPM image or
equivalent PAM image. One difference is that that RGB inten-
sity values in a JP2 are SRGB values, while pamtojpeg2k
produces ITU-R Recommedation BT.709 values. Those are very
similar, but not identi- cal. Another difference is that a
JP2 can contain extra information about an image that JPC
cannot.</p>

<p>When the input is a PAM image other than a PBM, PGM, or
PPM equivalent, the JPC raster produced contains whatever
the PAM raster does. It can have any number of planes with
any meanings; the planes are in the same order in the JPC
output as in the PAM input.</p>

<p>A JPC image has a &quot;precision,&quot; which is the
number of bits used for each code (in Netpbm lingo,
&quot;sample&quot;). Actually, it has a separate precision
for each component. pamtojpeg2k uses for the precision of
every component the least number of bits that can represent
the maxval of the input image. A JPC image does not have an
independent concept of maxval; the maxval of a JPC sample is
the maximum value that the number of bits specified by the
precision can represent in pure binary code. E.g. if the
precision is 4, the maxval is 15. pamtojpeg2k does of course
scale the sample values from the input maxval to the output
maxval. Example: The input maxval is 99. This means JPC
precision is 7 bits and the JPC maxval is 127. A sample
value of 33 in the input becomes a sample value of 43 in the
output.</p>

<p>pamtojpeg2k generates the JPC output with the Jasper
JPEG-2000 library . See documentation of the library for
details on what pamtojpeg2k produces. Note that the Jasper
library contains facilities for reading PNM images, but
pamtojpeg2k does not use those. It uses the Netpbm library
instead. Note that the makers of the Jasper library write it
&quot;JasPer,&quot; but Netpbm documentation follows
standard American English typography rules, which don t
allow that kind of capitalization.</p>

<p>Use jpeg2ktopam to convert in the other direction.</p>

<p>The program jasper, which is packaged with the Jasper
JPEG-2000 library, also converts between JPEG-2000 and PNM
formats. Because its packaged with the library, it may
exploit it better, especially recently added features.
However, since it does not use the Netpbm library to read
and write the Netpbm formats, it doesnt do as good a job on
that side.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Most of the options are identical in name and
function to options that the Jasper library JPC encoder
subroutine takes. See Jasper documenta- tion for details.
Here, we document only options that are not direct analogs
of Jasper options.</p>

<p>-compression=ratio ratio is a floating point number that
specifies the compression ratio. pamtojpeg2k will adjust
quality as necessary to ensure that you get this compression
ratio. E.g. 4 means the output will be about one fourth the
size in bytes of the input file.</p>

<p>The compression ratio must be at least 1. The default is
1, which means the output has all the quality of the input
-- the conversion is lossless.</p>

<p>Note that though Jasper library takes a compression
factor, this option specifies a compression ratio. The
compression factor is the multiplicative inverse of (1
divided by) the compression ratio.</p>

<p>-verbose This option causes pamtojpeg2k to issue
informational messages about the conversion process.</p>

<p>-debuglevel=number This option controls debug messages
from the Jasper library. pamtojpeg2k passes number as the
debug level to the Jasper JPC encoder.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This example compresses losslessly.</p>

<p>pamtojpeg2k myimg.ppm &gt;myimg.jpc</p>

<p>jpeg2ktopam will recreate myimg.ppm exactly.</p>

<p>This example compresses the file to one tenth its
original size, throw- ing away information as necessary.</p>

<p>pamtojpeg2k -compression=10 myimg.pgm &gt;myimg.jpc</p>

<p>ABOUT JPEG-2000 JPEG-2000 is a format that compresses a
visual image (or a similar set of data) into a minimal
number of bytes for storage or transmission. In that, its
goal is similar to JPEG. It has two main differences from
JPEG.</p>

<p>One difference is that it does a much better job on most
images of throwing out information in order to achieve a
smaller output. That means when you reconstruct the image
from the resulting compressed file, it looks a lot closer to
the image you started with with JPEG-2000 than with JPEG,
for the same compressed file size. Or, looked at another
way, with JPEG-2000 you get a much smaller file than with
JPEG for the same image quality.</p>

<p>The second difference is that with JPEG-2000, you decide
how much com- pression you want and the compressor adjusts
the quality to meet your requirement, whereas with JPEG, you
decide how much quality you want and the compressor adjusts
the size of the output to meet your require- ment. I.e. with
JPEG-2000, the quality of the result depends on the
compressibility of the input, but with JPEG, the size of the
result depends on the compressibility of the input.</p>

<p>With JPEG-2000, you can specify lossless compression,
thus making it compete with GIF and PNG. With standard JPEG,
you always lose some- thing. (There are rumored to be
variations of JPEG around that are lossless, though).</p>

<p>JPEG is much older than JPEG-2000 and far more popular.
JPEG is one of the half dozen most popular graphics formats
and virtually all graphics facilities understand it.
JPEG-2000 is virtually unknown.</p>

<p>There is no compatibility between JPEG and JPEG-2000.
Programs that read JPEG do not automatically read JPEG-2000
and vice versa.</p>
