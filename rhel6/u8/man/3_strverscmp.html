<p>NAME strverscmp - compare two version strings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>int strverscmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Often one has files jan1, jan2, ..., jan9,
jan10, ... and it feels wrong when ls(1) orders them jan1,
jan10, ..., jan2, ..., jan9. In order to rectify this, GNU
introduced the -v option to ls(1), which is implemented
using versionsort(3), which again uses strverscmp().</p>

<p>Thus, the task of strverscmp() is to compare two strings
and find the &quot;right&quot; order, while strcmp(3) only
finds the lexicographic order. This function does not use
the locale category LC_COLLATE, so is meant mostly for
situations where the strings are expected to be in
ASCII.</p>

<p>What this function does is the following. If both
strings are equal, return 0. Otherwise find the position
between two bytes with the prop- erty that before it both
strings are equal, while directly after it there is a
difference. Find the largest consecutive digit strings con-
taining (or starting at, or ending at) this position. If one
or both of these is empty, then return what strcmp(3) would
have returned (numerical ordering of byte values).
Otherwise, compare both digit strings numerically, where
digit strings with one or more leading zeros are interpreted
as if they have a decimal point in front (so that in
particular digit strings with more leading zeros come before
digit strings with fewer leading zeros). Thus, the ordering
is 000, 00, 01, 010, 09, 0, 1, 9, 10.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The strverscmp() function returns an
integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if s1 is
found, respectively, to be earlier than, equal to, or later
than s2.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function is a GNU extension.</p>
