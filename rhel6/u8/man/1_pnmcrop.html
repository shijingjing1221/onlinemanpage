<p>NAME pnmcrop - crop a PNM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmcrop</p>

<p>[-white|-black|-sides]</p>

<p>[-left]</p>

<p>[-right]</p>

<p>[-top]</p>

<p>[-bottom]</p>

<p>[-margin=pixels]</p>

<p>[-borderfile=filename]</p>

<p>[pnmfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmcrop reads a PBM, PGM, or PPM image as input, removes
borders that are the background color, and produces the same
type of image as out- put.</p>

<p>If you don t specify otherwise, pnmcrop assumes the
background color is whatever color the top left and right
corners of the image are and if they are different colors,
something midway between them. You can specify that the
background is white or black with the -white and -black
options or make pnmcrop base its guess on all four corners
instead of just two with -sides.</p>

<p>By default, pnmcrop chops off any stripe of background
color it finds, on all four sides. You can tell pnmcrop to
remove only specific bor- ders with the -left, -right, -top,
and -bottom options.</p>

<p>If you want to leave some border, use the -margin
option. It will not only spare some of the border from
cropping, but will fill in (with what pnmcrop considers the
background color) if necessary to get up to that size.</p>

<p>If the input is a multi-image stream, pnmcrop processes
each one inde- pendently and produces a multi-image stream
as output. It chooses where to crop independently for each
image. So if you start with a stream of images of the same
dimensions, you may end up with images of differing
dimensions. Before Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006), pnmcrop
ignored all input images but the first.</p>

<p>If you want to chop a specific amount off the side of an
image, use pamcut.</p>

<p>If you want to add different borders after removing the
existing ones, use pnmcat or pamcomp.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -white Take white to be the background color.
pnmcrop removes borders which are white.</p>

<p>-black Take black to be the background color. pnmcrop
removes borders which are black.</p>

<p>-sides Determine the background color from the colors of
the four cor- ners of the input image. pnmcrop removes
borders which are of the background color.</p>

<p>If at least three of the four corners are the same
color, pnm- crop takes that as the background color. If not,
pnmcrop looks for two corners of the same color in the
following order, taking the first found as the background
color: top, left, right, bot- tom. If all four corners are
different colors, pnmcrop assumes an average of the four
colors as the background color.</p>

<p>The -sides option slows pnmcrop down, as it reads the
entire image to determine the background color in addition
to the up to three times that it would read it without
-sides.</p>

<p>-left Remove any left border.</p>

<p>-right Remove any right border.</p>

<p>-top Remove any top border.</p>

<p>-bottom Remove any bottom border.</p>

<p>-margin=pixels Leave pixels pixels of border. Expand the
border to this size if necessary.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.29 (August 2005).</p>

<p>-borderfile=filename Use the image in the file named
filename instead of the input image to determine where the
borders of the input image are and the background color.</p>

<p>Without this option, pnmcrop examines the input image
and fig- ures out what part of the image is border and what
part is fore- ground (not border), as well as the background
color. With this option, pnmcrop finds the borders in one
image, then uses the those four border sizes (left, right,
top, bottom) in cropping a different image. Furthermore, if
you use -margin to add bor- ders, the color of those borders
is the background color pnmcrop detects in the border
file.</p>

<p>The point of this is that you may want to help pnmcrop
to come to a different conclusion as to where the borders
are and what the background color is by preprocessing the
input image. For example, consider an image that has
speckles of noise in its borders. pnmcrop isn t smart enough
to recognize these as noise; it sees them as foreground
image. So pnmcrop considers most of your borders to be
foreground and does not crop them off as you want. To fix
this, run the image through a despeckler such as pbmclean
and tell pnmcrop to use the despeckled version of the image
as the -borderfile image, but the original speckled version
as the input image. That way, you crop the borders, but
retain the true foreground image, speckles and all.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.29 (August 2005).</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.46 (March 2009), the original image and
not the border file determines the background color. pnmcrop
fails if there is no apparent background color in the
original image (i.e. the corners of the image dont have a
common color).</p>

<p>-verbose Print on Standard Error information about the
processing, including exactly how much is being cropped off
of which sides.</p>
