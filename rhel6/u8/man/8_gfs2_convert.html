<p>NAME gfs2_convert - Convert a GFS1 filesystem to
GFS2</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gfs2_convert [OPTION]... DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gfs2_convert is used to convert a filesystem
from GFS1 to GFS2. It is required that the GFS1 filesystem
be checked and fixed for errors using fsck.gfs2 and that the
filesystem be backed up before attempting to convert it. The
convert process is irreversible and any error encoun- tered
during the conversion can result in the abrupt termination
of the program and consequently an unusable filesystem. See
NOTES section below for more information.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Help.</p>

<p>This prints out the proper command line usage
syntax.</p>

<p>-q Quiet. Print less information while running.</p>

<p>-n No to all questions.</p>

<p>-V Print program Version information only.</p>

<p>Print out the current version name.</p>

<p>-v Verbose operation.</p>

<p>Print more information while running.</p>

<p>-y Yes to all questions.</p>

<p>By specifying this option, gfs2_convert will not prompt
before making changes.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE gfs2_convert /dev/vg0/lvol0 This will convert
the Global File System on the block device
&quot;/dev/vg0/lvol0&quot; to gfs2 format.</p>

<p>NOTES If gfs2_convert is interrupted for some reason
other than a conversion failure, DO NOT run gfs2_fsck on
this partially converted filesystem. When this occurs,
reissue the gfs2_convert command on the partially converted
filesystem to complete the conversion process.</p>

<p>The GFS2 filesystem does not support Context-Dependent
Path Names (CDPNs). gfs2_convert identifies such CDPNs and
replaces them with empty directories with the same name. The
administrator can use bind mounts on these directories to
get the same effect as CDPNs.</p>

<p>When converting full or nearly full filesystems, it is
possible that there wont be enough space available to fit
all the GFS2 filesystem data structures. In such cases, the
size of all the journals is reduced uniformly such that
everything fits in the available space.</p>
