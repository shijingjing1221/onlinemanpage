<p>sane-coolscan(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-coolscan(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-coolscan - SANE backend for Nikon
film-scanners</p>

<p>ABOUT THIS FILE This file is a short description of the
coolscan-backend for sane!</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-coolscan library implements a SANE
backend that provides the interface to the following Nikon
Coolscan Film scanners: Nikon LS20, LS30, LS1000,
LS2000.</p>

<p>Even though the backend has worked for a number of
people, there are still some problems, especially in
combination with some SCSI card/drivers (AHA-1505/aha152x.o)
and the autofocus command. You should consider this
backendalphaand be careful when using it the first time.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The configuration file for this backend
resides in /etc/sane.d/coolscan.conf.</p>

<p>Its contents is a list of device names that correspond
to Nikon Coolscan scanners. Empty lines and lines starting
with a hash mark (#) are ignored. A sample configuration
file is shown below:</p>

<p>#scsi Vendor Model Type scsi Nikon * Scanner
/dev/scanner</p>

<p>The special device name must be a generic SCSI device or
a symlink to such a device. To find out to which device your
scanner is assigned and how you have to set the permissions
of that device, have a look at sane-scsi.</p>

<p>SCSI ADAPTER TIPS Some SCSI-adapters and low-level SCSI
drivers do not work correctly with this backend and the
Coolscan scanners. These systems hang when the autofocus
command is send to the Scanner. To see a list of which
card/driver combinations work or dont work have a look at:
http://andreas.rick.free.fr/sane/autofocus.html.</p>

<p>FILES The backend configuration file:
/etc/sane.d/coolscan.conf</p>

<p>The static library implementing this backend:
/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-coolscan.a</p>

<p>The shared library implementing this backend:
/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-coolscan.so (present on systems that
support dynamic loading)</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN If the library was
compiled with debug support enabled, this environment
variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
Smaller levels reduce verbosity: SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN
values</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>on bash: export SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN=8</p>

<p>on csh: setenv SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN 8</p>

<p>BUGS The autofocus command does not work with some SCSI
card/driver combina- tions</p>

<p>The gamma table is not implemented for the LS1000
yet.</p>

<p>The dust-removal is not working yet</p>

<p>THANKS TO Didier Carlier - For writing the original
Coolscan backend (without it I would not have started
this)</p>

<p>Oliver Rauch - For adapting xsane so quickly to the
infrared stuff.</p>
