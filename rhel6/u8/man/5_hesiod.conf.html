<p>NAME hesiod.conf - Configuration file for the Hesiod
library</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file hesiod.conf determines the behavior
of the Hesiod library. Blank lines and lines beginning with
a # character are ignored. All other lines should be of the
form variable = value, where the value should be a single
word. Possible variables and values are:</p>

<p>lhs Specifies the domain prefix used for Hesiod queries.
In almost all cases, you should specify lhs=.ns. The default
value if you do not specify an lhs value is no domain
prefix, which is not compatible with most Hesiod
domains.</p>

<p>rhs Specifies the default Hesiod domain; this value may
be overrid- den by the HES_DOMAIN environment variable. You
must specify an rhs line for the Hesiod library to work
properly.</p>

<p>classes Specifies which DNS classes Hesiod should do
lookups in. Possi- ble values are IN (the preferred class)
and HS (the deprecated class, still used by some sites). You
may specify both classes separated by a comma to try one
class first and then the other if no entry is available in
the first class. The default value of the classes variable
is IN,HS.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO hesiod(3)</p>

<p>BUGS There default value for lhs should probably be more
reasonable.</p>
