<p>NAME h2xs - convert .h C header files to Perl
extensions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS h2xs [OPTIONS ...] [headerfile ...
[extra_libraries]]</p>

<p>h2xs -h|-?|--help</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION h2xs builds a Perl extension from C header
files. The extension will include functions which can be
used to retrieve the value of any #define statement which
was in the C header files.</p>

<p>The module_name will be used for the name of the
extension. If module_name is not supplied then the name of
the first header file will be used, with the first character
capitalized.</p>

<p>If the extension might need extra libraries, they should
be included here. The extension Makefile.PL will take care
of checking whether the libraries actually exist and how
they should be loaded. The extra libraries should be
specified in the form -lm -lposix, etc, just as on the cc
command line. By default, the Makefile.PL will search
through the library path determined by Configure. That path
can be augmented by including arguments of the form
-L/another/library/path in the extra-libraries argument.</p>

<p>In spite of its name, h2xs may also be used to create a
skeleton pure Perl module. See the -X option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A, --omit-autoload Omit all autoload
facilities. This is the same as -c but also removes the
&quot;use AutoLoader&quot; statement from the .pm file.</p>

<p>-B, --beta-version Use an alpha/beta style version
number. Causes version number to be &quot;0.00_01&quot;
unless -v is specified.</p>

<p>-C, --omit-changes Omits creation of the Changes file,
and adds a HISTORY section to the POD template.</p>

<p>-F, --cpp-flags=addflags Additional flags to specify to
C preprocessor when scanning header for function
declarations. Writes these options in the generated
Makefile.PL too.</p>

<p>-M, --func-mask=regular expression selects
functions/macros to process.</p>

<p>-O, --overwrite-ok Allows a pre-existing extension
directory to be overwritten.</p>

<p>-P, --omit-pod Omit the autogenerated stub POD
section.</p>

<p>-X, --omit-XS Omit the XS portion. Used to generate a
skeleton pure Perl module. &quot;-c&quot; and &quot;-f&quot;
are implicitly enabled.</p>

<p>-a, --gen-accessors Generate an accessor method for each
element of structs and unions. The generated methods are
named after the element name; will return the current value
of the element if called without additional arguments; and
will set the element to the supplied value (and return the
new value) if called with an additional argument. Embedded
structures and unions are returned as a pointer rather than
the complete structure, to facilitate chained calls.</p>

<p>These methods all apply to the Ptr type for the
structure; additionally two methods are constructed for the
structure type itself, &quot;_to_ptr&quot; which returns a
Ptr type pointing to the same structure, and a
&quot;new&quot; method to construct and return a new
structure, initialised to zeroes.</p>

<p>-b, --compat-version=version Generates a .pm file which
is backwards compatible with the specified perl version.</p>

<p>For versions &lt; 5.6.0, the changes are. - no use of
our (uses use vars instead) - no use warnings</p>

<p>Specifying a compatibility version higher than the
version of perl you are using to run h2xs will have no
effect. If unspecified h2xs will default to compatibility
with the version of perl you are using to run h2xs.</p>

<p>-c, --omit-constant Omit &quot;constant()&quot; from the
.xs file and corresponding specialised &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;
from the .pm file.</p>

<p>-d, --debugging Turn on debugging messages.</p>

<p>-e, --omit-enums=[regular expression] If regular
expression is not given, skip all constants that are defined
in a C enumeration. Otherwise skip only those constants that
are defined in an enum whose name matches regular
expression.</p>

<p>Since regular expression is optional, make sure that
this switch is followed by at least one other switch if you
omit regular expression and have some pending arguments such
as header-file names. This is ok:</p>

<p>h2xs -e -n Module::Foo foo.h</p>

<p>This is not ok:</p>

<p>h2xs -n Module::Foo -e foo.h</p>

<p>In the latter, foo.h is taken as regular expression.</p>

<p>-f, --force Allows an extension to be created for a
header even if that header is not found in standard include
directories.</p>

<p>-g, --global Include code for safely storing static data
in the .xs file. Extensions that do no make use of static
data can ignore this option.</p>

<p>-h, -?, --help Print the usage, help and version for
this h2xs and exit.</p>

<p>-k, --omit-const-func For function arguments declared as
&quot;const&quot;, omit the const attribute in the generated
XS code.</p>

<p>-m, --gen-tied-var Experimental: for each variable
declared in the header file(s), declare a perl variable of
the same name magically tied to the C variable.</p>

<p>-n, --name=module_name Specifies a name to be used for
the extension, e.g., -n RPC::DCE</p>

<p>-o, --opaque-re=regular expression Use
&quot;opaque&quot; data type for the C types matched by the
regular expression, even if these types are
&quot;typedef&quot;-equivalent to types from typemaps.
Should not be used without -x.</p>

<p>This may be useful since, say, types which are
&quot;typedef&quot;-equivalent to integers may represent
OS-related handles, and one may want to work with these
handles in OO-way, as in
&quot;$handle-&gt;do_something()&quot;. Use &quot;-o .&quot;
if you want to handle all the &quot;typedef&quot;ed types as
opaque types.</p>

<p>The type-to-match is whitewashed (except for commas,
which have no whitespace before them, and multiple
&quot;*&quot; which have no whitespace between them).</p>

<p>-p, --remove-prefix=prefix Specify a prefix which should
be removed from the Perl function names, e.g., -p sec_rgy_
This sets up the XS PREFIX keyword and removes the prefix
from functions that are autoloaded via the
&quot;constant()&quot; mechanism.</p>

<p>-s, --const-subs=sub1,sub2 Create a perl subroutine for
the specified macros rather than autoload with the
constant() subroutine. These macros are assumed to have a
return type of char *, e.g., -s
sec_rgy_wildcard_name,sec_rgy_wildcard_sid.</p>

<p>-t, --default-type=type Specify the internal type that
the constant() mechanism uses for macros. The default is IV
(signed integer). Currently all macros found during the
header scanning process will be assumed to have this type.
Future versions of &quot;h2xs&quot; may gain the ability to
make educated guesses.</p>

<p>--use-new-tests When --compat-version (-b) is present
the generated tests will use &quot;Test::More&quot; rather
than &quot;Test&quot; which is the default for versions
before 5.7.2 . &quot;Test::More&quot; will be added to
PREREQ_PM in the generated &quot;Makefile.PL&quot;.</p>

<p>--use-old-tests Will force the generation of test code
that uses the older &quot;Test&quot; module.</p>

<p>--skip-exporter Do not use &quot;Exporter&quot; and/or
export any symbol.</p>

<p>--skip-ppport Do not use &quot;Devel::PPPort&quot;: no
portability to older version.</p>

<p>--skip-autoloader Do not use the module
&quot;AutoLoader&quot;; but keep the constant() function and
&quot;sub AUTOLOAD&quot; for constants.</p>

<p>--skip-strict Do not use the pragma
&quot;strict&quot;.</p>

<p>--skip-warnings Do not use the pragma
&quot;warnings&quot;.</p>

<p>-v, --version=version Specify a version number for this
extension. This version number is added to the templates.
The default is 0.01, or 0.00_01 if &quot;-B&quot; is
specified. The version specified should be numeric.</p>

<p>-x, --autogen-xsubs Automatically generate XSUBs basing
on function declarations in the header file. The package
&quot;C::Scan&quot; should be installed. If this option is
specified, the name of the header file may look like
&quot;NAME1,NAME2&quot;. In this case NAME1 is used instead
of the specified string, but XSUBs are emitted only for the
declarations included from file NAME2.</p>

<p>Note that some types of arguments/return-values for
functions may result in XSUB-declarations/typemap-entries
which need hand- editing. Such may be objects which cannot
be converted from/to a pointer (like &quot;long long&quot;),
pointers to functions, or arrays. See also the section on
&quot;LIMITATIONS of -x&quot;.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES # Default behavior, extension is Rusers h2xs
rpcsvc/rusers</p>

<p># Same, but extension is RUSERS h2xs -n RUSERS
rpcsvc/rusers</p>

<p># Extension is rpcsvc::rusers. Still finds
&lt;rpcsvc/rusers.h&gt; h2xs rpcsvc::rusers</p>

<p># Extension is ONC::RPC. Still finds
&lt;rpcsvc/rusers.h&gt; h2xs -n ONC::RPC rpcsvc/rusers</p>

<p># Without constant() or AUTOLOAD h2xs -c
rpcsvc/rusers</p>

<p># Creates templates for an extension named RPC h2xs -cfn
RPC</p>

<p># Extension is ONC::RPC. h2xs -cfn ONC::RPC</p>

<p># Extension is a pure Perl module with no XS code. h2xs
-X My::Module</p>

<p># Extension is Lib::Foo which works at least with
Perl5.005_03. # Constants are created for all #defines and
enums h2xs can find # in foo.h. h2xs -b 5.5.3 -n Lib::Foo
foo.h</p>

<p># Extension is Lib::Foo which works at least with
Perl5.005_03. # Constants are created for all #defines but
only for enums # whose names do not start with
&rsquo;bar_&rsquo;. h2xs -b 5.5.3 -e &rsquo;^bar_&rsquo; -n
Lib::Foo foo.h</p>

<p># Makefile.PL will look for library -lrpc in #
additional directory /opt/net/lib h2xs rpcsvc/rusers
-L/opt/net/lib -lrpc</p>

<p># Extension is DCE::rgynbase # prefix
&quot;sec_rgy_&quot; is dropped from perl function names
h2xs -n DCE::rgynbase -p sec_rgy_ dce/rgynbase</p>

<p># Extension is DCE::rgynbase # prefix
&quot;sec_rgy_&quot; is dropped from perl function names #
subroutines are created for sec_rgy_wildcard_name and #
sec_rgy_wildcard_sid h2xs -n DCE::rgynbase -p sec_rgy_ -s
sec_rgy_wildcard_name,sec_rgy_wildcard_sid dce/rgynbase</p>

<p># Make XS without defines in perl.h, but with function
declarations # visible from perl.h. Name of the extension is
perl1. # When scanning perl.h, define -DEXT=extern -DdEXT=
-DINIT(x)= # Extra backslashes below because the string is
passed to shell. # Note that a directory with perl header
files would # be added automatically to include path. h2xs
-xAn perl1 -F &quot;-DEXT=extern -DdEXT= -DINIT=&quot;
perl.h</p>

<p># Same with function declaration in proto.h as visible
from perl.h. h2xs -xAn perl2 perl.h,proto.h</p>

<p># Same but select only functions which match /^av_/ h2xs
-M &rsquo;^av_&rsquo; -xAn perl2 perl.h,proto.h</p>

<p># Same but treat SV* etc as &quot;opaque&quot; types
h2xs -o &rsquo;^[S]V &rsquo; -M &rsquo;^av_&rsquo; -xAn
perl2 perl.h,proto.h</p>

<p>Extension based on .h and .c files Suppose that you have
some C files implementing some functionality, and the
corresponding header files. How to create an extension which
makes this functionality accessible in Perl? The example
below assumes that the header files are interface_simple.h
and interface_hairy.h, and you want the perl module be named
as &quot;Ext::Ension&quot;. If you need some preprocessor
directives and/or linking with external libraries, see the
flags &quot;-F&quot;, &quot;-L&quot; and &quot;-l&quot; in
&quot;OPTIONS&quot;.</p>

<p>Find the directory name Start with a dummy run of
h2xs:</p>

<p>h2xs -Afn Ext::Ension</p>

<p>The only purpose of this step is to create the needed
directories, and let you know the names of these
directories. From the output you can see that the directory
for the extension is Ext/Ension.</p>

<p>Copy C files Copy your header files and C files to this
directory Ext/Ension.</p>

<p>Create the extension Run h2xs, overwriting older
autogenerated files:</p>

<p>h2xs -Oxan Ext::Ension interface_simple.h
interface_hairy.h</p>

<p>h2xs looks for header files after changing to the
extension directory, so it will find your header files
OK.</p>

<p>Archive and test As usual, run</p>

<p>cd Ext/Ension perl Makefile.PL make dist make make
test</p>

<p>Hints It is important to do &quot;make dist&quot; as
early as possible. This way you can easily merge(1) your
changes to autogenerated files if you decide to edit your
&quot;.h&quot; files and rerun h2xs.</p>

<p>Do not forget to edit the documentation in the generated
.pm file.</p>

<p>Consider the autogenerated files as skeletons only, you
may invent better interfaces than what h2xs could guess.</p>

<p>Consider this section as a guideline only, some other
options of h2xs may better suit your needs.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT No environment variables are used.</p>

<p>AUTHOR Larry Wall and others</p>

<p>SEE ALSO perl, perlxstut, ExtUtils::MakeMaker, and
AutoLoader.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The usual warnings if it cannot read or
write the files involved.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS of -x h2xs would not distinguish whether an
argument to a C function which is of the form, say,
&quot;int *&quot;, is an input, output, or input/output
parameter. In particular, argument declarations of the
form</p>

<p>int foo(n) int *n</p>

<p>should be better rewritten as</p>

<p>int foo(n) int &amp;n</p>

<p>if &quot;n&quot; is an input parameter.</p>

<p>Additionally, h2xs has no facilities to intuit that a
function</p>

<p>int foo(addr,l) char *addr int l</p>

<p>takes a pair of address and length of data at this
address, so it is better to rewrite this function as</p>

<p>int foo(sv) SV *addr PREINIT: STRLEN len; char *s; CODE:
s = SvPV(sv,len); RETVAL = foo(s, len); OUTPUT: RETVAL</p>

<p>or alternately</p>

<p>static int my_foo(SV *sv) { STRLEN len; char *s =
SvPV(sv,len);</p>

<p>return foo(s, len); }</p>

<p>MODULE = foo PACKAGE = foo PREFIX = my_</p>

<p>int foo(sv) SV *sv</p>

<p>See perlxs and perlxstut for additional details.</p>
