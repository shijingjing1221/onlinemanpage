<p>DITROFF(7) DITROFF(7)</p>

<p>NAME ditroff - classical device independent roff</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The name ditroff once marked a development
level of the troff text pro- cessing system. In actual
roff(7) systems, the name troff is used as a synonym for
ditroff.</p>

<p>The first roff system was written by Joe Osanna around
1973. It sup- ported only two output devices, the nroff
program produced text ori- ented tty output, while the troff
program generated graphical output for exactly one output
device, the Wang Graphic Systems CAT typesetter.</p>

<p>In 1979, Brian Kernighan rewrote troff to support more
devices by cre- ating an intermediate output format for
troff that can be fed into postprocessor programs which
actually do the printout on the device. Kernighan s version
marks what is known as classical troff today. In order to
distinguish it from Osannas original mono-device version, it
was called ditroff (device independent troff) on some
systems, though this naming isnt mentioned in the classical
documentation.</p>

<p>Today, any existing roff system is based on Kernighans
multi-device troff. The distinction between troff and
ditroff isn t necessary any longer, for each modern troff
provides already the complete functional- ity of ditroff. On
most systems, the name troff is used to denote ditroff.</p>

<p>The easiest way to use ditroff is the GNU roff system,
groff. The groff(1) program is a wrapper around (di)troff
that automatically han- dles postprocessing.</p>
