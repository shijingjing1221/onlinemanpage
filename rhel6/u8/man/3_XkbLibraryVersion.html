<p>XkbLibraryVersion(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbLibraryVersion(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbLibraryVersion - Determines the compatibility of
a library at run- time.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Bool XkbLibraryVersion (int *lib_major_in_out,
int *lib_minor_in_out);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS lib_major_in_out Specifies and returns the
major Xkb library version.</p>

<p>lib_minor_in_out Specifies and returns the minor Xkb
library version.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If an application is dynamically linked,
both the X server and the client-side X library must contain
the Xkb extension in order for the client to use the Xkb
extension capabilities. Therefore a dynamically linked
application must check both the library and the server for
com- patibility before using Xkb function calls. A properly
written program must check for compatibility between the
version of the Xkb library that is dynamically loaded and
the one used when the application was built. It must then
check the server version for compatibility with the version
of Xkb in the library.</p>

<p>If your application is statically linked, you must still
check for server compatibility and may check library
compatibility. (It is possi- ble to compile against one set
of header files and link against a dif- ferent,
incompatible, version of the library, although this should
not normally occur.)</p>

<p>Pass the symbolic value XkbMajorVersion in
lib_major_in_out and XkbMi- norVersion in lib_minor_in_out.
These arguments represent the version of the library used at
compile time. The XkbLibraryVersion function backfills the
major and minor version numbers of the library used at run
time in lib_major_in_out and lib_minor_in_out. If the
versions of the compile time and run time libraries are
compatible, XkbLibraryVer- sion returns True, otherwise, it
returns False.</p>

<p>In addition, in order to use the Xkb extension, you must
ensure that the extension is present in the server and that
the server supports the version of the extension expected by
the client. Use XkbQueryExtension to do this, as described
in the next section.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES True The XkbLibraryVersion returns True if
the versions of the compile time and run time libraries are
compatible.</p>

<p>False The XkbLibraryVersion returns False if the
versions of the compile time and run time libraries are not
compati- ble.</p>
