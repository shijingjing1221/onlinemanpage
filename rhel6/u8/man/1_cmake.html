<p>NAME cmake - Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.</p>

<p>USAGE cmake [options] &lt;path-to-source&gt; cmake
[options] &lt;path-to-existing-build&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &quot;cmake&quot; executable is the
CMake command-line interface. It may be used to configure
projects in scripts. Project configuration settings may be
specified on the command line with the -D option. The -i
option will cause cmake to interactively prompt for such
settings.</p>

<p>CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.
Projects specify their build process with
platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each
directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build
system for a native tool on their platform.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C &lt;initial-cache&gt; Pre-load a script to
populate the cache.</p>

<p>When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it
creates a CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with
customizable settings for the project. This option may be
used to specify a file from which to load cache entries
before the first pass through the projects cmake listfiles.
The loaded entries take priority over the projects default
values. The given file should be a CMake script containing
SET commands that use the CACHE option, not a cache-format
file.</p>

<p>-D &lt;var&gt;:&lt;type&gt;=&lt;value&gt; Create a cmake
cache entry.</p>

<p>When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it
creates a CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with
customizable settings for the project. This option may be
used to specify a setting that takes priority over the
project s default value. The option may be repeated for as
many cache entries as desired.</p>

<p>-U &lt;globbing_expr&gt; Remove matching entries from
CMake cache.</p>

<p>This option may be used to remove one or more variables
from the CMakeCache.txt file, globbing expressions using *
and ? are sup- ported. The option may be repeated for as
many cache entries as desired.</p>

<p>Use with care, you can make your CMakeCache.txt
non-working.</p>

<p>-G &lt;generator-name&gt; Specify a build system
generator.</p>

<p>CMake may support multiple native build systems on
certain plat- forms. A generator is responsible for
generating a particular build system. Possible generator
names are specified in the Generators section.</p>

<p>-T &lt;toolset-name&gt; Specify toolset name if
supported by generator.</p>

<p>Some CMake generators support a toolset name to be given
to the native build system to choose a compiler. This is
supported only on specific generators:</p>

<p>Visual Studio &gt;= 10 Xcode &gt;= 3.0</p>

<p>See native build system documentation for allowed
toolset names.</p>

<p>-Wno-dev Suppress developer warnings.</p>

<p>Suppress warnings that are meant for the author of the
CMake- Lists.txt files.</p>

<p>-Wdev Enable developer warnings.</p>

<p>Enable warnings that are meant for the author of the
CMake- Lists.txt files.</p>

<p>-E CMake command mode.</p>

<p>For true platform independence, CMake provides a list of
com- mands that can be used on all systems. Run with -E help
for the usage information. Commands available are: chdir,
compare_files, copy, copy_directory, copy_if_different,
echo, echo_append, environment, make_directory, md5sum,
remove, remove_directory, rename, tar, time, touch,
touch_nocreate. In addition, some platform specific commands
are available. On Windows: comspec, delete_regv, write_regv.
On UNIX: create_symlink.</p>

<p>-i Run in wizard mode.</p>

<p>Wizard mode runs cmake interactively without a GUI. The
user is prompted to answer questions about the project
configuration. The answers are used to set cmake cache
values.</p>

<p>-L[A][H] List non-advanced cached variables.</p>

<p>List cache variables will run CMake and list all the
variables from the CMake cache that are not marked as
INTERNAL or ADVANCED. This will effectively display current
CMake settings, which can then be changed with -D option.
Changing some of the variables may result in more variables
being created. If A is specified, then it will display also
advanced variables. If H is specified, it will also display
help for each variable.</p>

<p>--build &lt;dir&gt; Build a CMake-generated project
binary tree.</p>

<p>This abstracts a native build tool s command-line
interface with the following options:</p>

<p>&lt;dir&gt; = Project binary directory to be built.
--target &lt;tgt&gt; = Build &lt;tgt&gt; instead of default
targets. --config &lt;cfg&gt; = For multi-configuration
tools, choose &lt;cfg&gt;. --clean-first = Build target
clean first, then build. (To clean only, use --target
clean.) --use-stderr = Dont merge stdout/stderr output and
pass the original stdout/stderr handles to the native tool
so it can use the capabilities of the calling terminal (e.g.
colored output). -- = Pass remaining options to the native
tool.</p>

<p>Run cmake --build with no options for quick help.</p>

<p>-N View mode only.</p>

<p>Only load the cache. Do not actually run configure and
generate steps.</p>

<p>-P &lt;file&gt; Process script mode.</p>

<p>Process the given cmake file as a script written in the
CMake language. No configure or generate step is performed
and the cache is not modified. If variables are defined
using -D, this must be done before the -P argument.</p>

<p>--find-package Run in pkg-config like mode.</p>

<p>Search a package using find_package() and print the
resulting flags to stdout. This can be used to use cmake
instead of pkg-config to find installed libraries in plain
Makefile-based projects or in autoconf-based projects (via
share/aclo- cal/cmake.m4).</p>

<p>--graphviz=[file] Generate graphviz of dependencies, see
CMakeGraphVizOp- tions.cmake for more.</p>

<p>Generate a graphviz input file that will contain all the
library and executable dependencies in the project. See the
documenta- tion for CMakeGraphVizOptions.cmake for more
details.</p>

<p>--system-information [file] Dump information about this
system.</p>

<p>Dump a wide range of information about the current
system. If run from the top of a binary tree for a CMake
project it will dump additional information such as the
cache, log files etc.</p>

<p>--debug-trycompile Do not delete the try_compile build
tree. Only useful on one try_compile at a time.</p>

<p>Do not delete the files and directories created for
try_compile calls. This is useful in debugging failed
try_compiles. It may however change the results of the
try-compiles as old junk from a previous try-compile may
cause a different test to either pass or fail incorrectly.
This option is best used for one try-com- pile at a time,
and only when debugging.</p>

<p>--debug-output Put cmake in a debug mode.</p>

<p>Print extra stuff during the cmake run like stack traces
with message(send_error ) calls.</p>

<p>--trace Put cmake in trace mode.</p>

<p>Print a trace of all calls made and from where with mes-
sage(send_error ) calls.</p>

<p>--warn-uninitialized Warn about uninitialized
values.</p>

<p>Print a warning when an uninitialized variable is
used.</p>

<p>--warn-unused-vars Warn about unused variables.</p>

<p>Find variables that are declared or set, but not
used.</p>

<p>--no-warn-unused-cli Dont warn about command line
options.</p>

<p>Dont find variables that are declared on the command
line, but not used.</p>

<p>--check-system-vars Find problems with variable usage in
system files.</p>

<p>Normally, unused and uninitialized variables are
searched for only in CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR and CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.
This flag tells CMake to warn about other files as well.</p>

<p>COMMANDS add_compile_options Adds options to the
compilation of source files.</p>

<p>add_compile_options(&lt;option&gt; ...)</p>

<p>Adds options to the compiler command line for sources in
the current directory and below. This command can be used to
add any options, but alternative commands exist to add
preprocessor definitions or include directories. See
documentation of the directory and target COMPILE_OPTIONS
properties for details. Arguments to add_compile_options may
use &quot;generator expressions&quot; with the syntax
&quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;. Generator expressions are
evaluated during build system generation to produce
information specific to each build configuration. Valid
expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0
$&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt; = configuration name
$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1 , else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0, else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>add_custom_command Add a custom build rule to the
generated build system.</p>

<p>There are two main signatures for add_custom_command The
first signature is for adding a custom command to produce an
output.</p>

<p>add_custom_command(OUTPUT output1 [output2 ...] COMMAND
command1 [ARGS] [args1...] [COMMAND command2 [ARGS]
[args2...] ...] [MAIN_DEPENDENCY depend] [DEPENDS
[depends...]] [IMPLICIT_DEPENDS &lt;lang1&gt; depend1
[&lt;lang2&gt; depend2] ...] [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
[COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM] [APPEND])</p>

<p>This defines a command to generate specified OUTPUT
file(s). A target created in the same directory
(CMakeLists.txt file) that specifies any output of the
custom command as a source file is given a rule to generate
the file using the command at build time. Do not list the
output in more than one independent tar- get that may build
in parallel or the two instances of the rule may conflict
(instead use add_custom_target to drive the command and make
the other targets depend on that one). If an output name is
a relative path it will be interpreted relative to the build
tree directory corresponding to the current source direc-
tory. Note that MAIN_DEPENDENCY is completely optional and
is used as a suggestion to visual studio about where to hang
the custom command. In makefile terms this creates a new
target in the following form:</p>

<p>OUTPUT: MAIN_DEPENDENCY DEPENDS COMMAND</p>

<p>If more than one command is specified they will be
executed in order. The optional ARGS argument is for
backward compatibility and will be ignored.</p>

<p>The second signature adds a custom command to a target
such as a library or executable. This is useful for
performing an opera- tion before or after building the
target. The command becomes part of the target and will only
execute when the target itself is built. If the target is
already built, the command will not execute.</p>

<p>add_custom_command(TARGET target PRE_BUILD | PRE_LINK |
POST_BUILD COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...] [COMMAND
command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...] [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
[COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM])</p>

<p>This defines a new command that will be associated with
building the specified target. When the command will happen
is determined by which of the following is specified:</p>

<p>PRE_BUILD - run before all other dependencies PRE_LINK -
run after other dependencies POST_BUILD - run after the
target has been built</p>

<p>Note that the PRE_BUILD option is only supported on
Visual Stu- dio 7 or later. For all other generators
PRE_BUILD will be treated as PRE_LINK.</p>

<p>If WORKING_DIRECTORY is specified the command will be
executed in the directory given. If it is a relative path it
will be interpreted relative to the build tree directory
corresponding to the current source directory. If COMMENT is
set, the value will be displayed as a message before the
commands are executed at build time. If APPEND is specified
the COMMAND and DEPENDS option values are appended to the
custom command for the first output specified. There must
have already been a previous call to this command with the
same output. The COMMENT, WORK- ING_DIRECTORY, and
MAIN_DEPENDENCY options are currently ignored when APPEND is
given, but may be used in the future.</p>

<p>If VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the commands
will be escaped properly for the build tool so that the
invoked command receives each argument unchanged. Note that
one level of escapes is still used by the CMake language
processor before add_custom_command even sees the arguments.
Use of VERBATIM is recommended as it enables correct
behavior. When VERBATIM is not given the behavior is
platform specific because there is no pro- tection of
tool-specific special characters.</p>

<p>If the output of the custom command is not actually
created as a file on disk it should be marked as SYMBOLIC
with SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES.</p>

<p>The IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option requests scanning of
implicit depen- dencies of an input file. The language given
specifies the pro- gramming language whose corresponding
dependency scanner should be used. Currently only C and CXX
language scanners are sup- ported. The language has to be
specified for every file in the IMPLICIT_DEPENDS list.
Dependencies discovered from the scanning are added to those
of the custom command at build time. Note that the
IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option is currently supported only for
Makefile generators and will be ignored by other
generators.</p>

<p>If COMMAND specifies an executable target (created by
ADD_EXE- CUTABLE) it will automatically be replaced by the
location of the executable created at build time.
Additionally a tar- get-level dependency will be added so
that the executable target will be built before any target
using this custom command. How- ever this does NOT add a
file-level dependency that would cause the custom command to
re-run whenever the executable is recom- piled.</p>

<p>Arguments to COMMAND may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0
$&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt; = configuration name
$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1, else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0 , else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>References to target names in generator expressions
imply tar- get-level dependencies, but NOT file-level
dependencies. List target names with the DEPENDS option to
add file dependencies.</p>

<p>The DEPENDS option specifies files on which the command
depends. If any dependency is an OUTPUT of another custom
command in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file) CMake
automatically brings the other custom command into the
target in which this command is built. If DEPENDS is not
specified the command will run whenever the OUTPUT is
missing; if the command does not actually create the OUTPUT
then the rule will always run. If DEPENDS specifies any
target (created by an ADD_* command) a tar- get-level
dependency is created to make sure the target is built
before any target using this custom command. Additionally,
if the target is an executable or library a file-level
dependency is created to cause the custom command to re-run
whenever the target is recompiled.</p>

<p>add_custom_target Add a target with no output so it will
always be built.</p>

<p>add_custom_target(Name [ALL] [command1 [args1...]]
[COMMAND command2 [args2...] ...] [DEPENDS depend depend
depend ... ] [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir] [COMMENT comment]
[VERBATIM] [SOURCES src1 [src2...]])</p>

<p>Adds a target with the given name that executes the
given com- mands. The target has no output file and is
ALWAYS CONSIDERED OUT OF DATE even if the commands try to
create a file with the name of the target. Use
ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND to generate a file with dependencies. By
default nothing depends on the custom tar- get. Use
ADD_DEPENDENCIES to add dependencies to or from other
targets. If the ALL option is specified it indicates that
this target should be added to the default build target so
that it will be run every time (the command cannot be called
ALL). The command and arguments are optional and if not
specified an empty target will be created. If
WORKING_DIRECTORY is set, then the command will be run in
that directory. If it is a relative path it will be
interpreted relative to the build tree directory cor-
responding to the current source directory. If COMMENT is
set, the value will be displayed as a message before the
commands are executed at build time. Dependencies listed
with the DEPENDS argument may reference files and outputs of
custom commands cre- ated with add_custom_command() in the
same directory (CMake- Lists.txt file).</p>

<p>If VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the commands
will be escaped properly for the build tool so that the
invoked command receives each argument unchanged. Note that
one level of escapes is still used by the CMake language
processor before add_custom_target even sees the arguments.
Use of VERBATIM is recommended as it enables correct
behavior. When VERBATIM is not given the behavior is
platform specific because there is no pro- tection of
tool-specific special characters.</p>

<p>The SOURCES option specifies additional source files to
be included in the custom target. Specified source files
will be added to IDE project files for convenience in
editing even if they have not build rules.</p>

<p>add_definitions Adds -D define flags to the compilation
of source files.</p>

<p>add_definitions(-DFOO -DBAR ...)</p>

<p>Adds flags to the compiler command line for sources in
the cur- rent directory and below. This command can be used
to add any flags, but it was originally intended to add
preprocessor defi- nitions. Flags beginning in -D or /D that
look like preproces- sor definitions are automatically added
to the COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS property for the current
directory. Definitions with non-trivial values may be left
in the set of flags instead of being converted for reasons
of backwards compatibility. See documentation of the
directory, target, and source file COM- PILE_DEFINITIONS
properties for details on adding preprocessor definitions to
specific scopes and configurations.</p>

<p>add_dependencies Add a dependency between top-level
targets.</p>

<p>add_dependencies(target-name depend-target1
depend-target2 ...)</p>

<p>Make a top-level target depend on other top-level
targets. A top-level target is one created by
ADD_EXECUTABLE, ADD_LIBRARY, or ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET. Adding
dependencies with this command can be used to make sure one
target is built before another target. Dependencies added to
an IMPORTED target are followed transi- tively in its place
since the target itself does not build. See the DEPENDS
option of ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET and ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND for
adding file-level dependencies in custom rules. See the
OBJECT_DEPENDS option in SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES to add
file-level dependencies to object files.</p>

<p>add_executable Add an executable to the project using
the specified source files.</p>

<p>add_executable(&lt;name&gt; [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE]
[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] source1 source2 ... sourceN)</p>

<p>Adds an executable target called &lt;name&gt; to be
built from the source files listed in the command
invocation. The &lt;name&gt; cor- responds to the logical
target name and must be globally unique within a project.
The actual file name of the executable built is constructed
based on conventions of the native platform (such as
&lt;name&gt;.exe or just &lt;name&gt;).</p>

<p>By default the executable file will be created in the
build tree directory corresponding to the source tree
directory in which the command was invoked. See
documentation of the RUNTIME_OUT- PUT_DIRECTORY target
property to change this location. See doc- umentation of the
OUTPUT_NAME target property to change the &lt;name&gt; part
of the final file name.</p>

<p>If WIN32 is given the property WIN32_EXECUTABLE will be
set on the target created. See documentation of that target
property for details.</p>

<p>If MACOSX_BUNDLE is given the corresponding property
will be set on the created target. See documentation of the
MACOSX_BUNDLE target property for details.</p>

<p>If EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL is given the corresponding property
will be set on the created target. See documentation of the
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.</p>

<p>The add_executable command can also create IMPORTED
executable targets using this signature:</p>

<p>add_executable(&lt;name&gt; IMPORTED [GLOBAL])</p>

<p>An IMPORTED executable target references an executable
file located outside the project. No rules are generated to
build it. The target name has scope in the directory in
which it is created and below, but the GLOBAL option extends
visibility. It may be referenced like any target built
within the project. IMPORTED executables are useful for
convenient reference from commands like add_custom_command.
Details about the imported executable are specified by
setting properties whose names begin in
&quot;IMPORTED_&quot;. The most important such property is
IMPORTED_LOCATION (and its per-configuration version
IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;) which specifies the
location of the main executable file on disk. See
documentation of the IMPORTED_* properties for more
information.</p>

<p>The signature</p>

<p>add_executable(&lt;name&gt; ALIAS &lt;target&gt;)</p>

<p>creates an alias, such that &lt;name&gt; can be used to
refer to &lt;tar- get&gt; in subsequent commands. The
&lt;name&gt; does not appear in the generated buildsystem as
a make target. The &lt;target&gt; may not be an IMPORTED
target or an ALIAS. Alias targets can be used as linkable
targets, targets to read properties from, executables for
custom commands and custom targets. They can also be tested
for existance with the regular if(TARGET) subcommand. The
&lt;name&gt; may not be used to modify properties of
&lt;target&gt;, that is, it may not be used as the operand
of set_property, set_tar- get_properties,
target_link_libraries etc. An ALIAS target may not be
installed of exported.</p>

<p>add_library Add a library to the project using the
specified source files.</p>

<p>add_library(&lt;name&gt; [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]
[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] source1 source2 ... sourceN)</p>

<p>Adds a library target called &lt;name&gt; to be built
from the source files listed in the command invocation. The
&lt;name&gt; corresponds to the logical target name and must
be globally unique within a project. The actual file name of
the library built is con- structed based on conventions of
the native platform (such as lib&lt;name&gt;.a or
&lt;name&gt;.lib).</p>

<p>STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE may be given to specify the
type of library to be created. STATIC libraries are archives
of object files for use when linking other targets. SHARED
libraries are linked dynamically and loaded at runtime.
MODULE libraries are plugins that are not linked into other
targets but may be loaded dynamically at runtime using
dlopen-like functionality. If no type is given explicitly
the type is STATIC or SHARED based on whether the current
value of the variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is true. For SHARED
and MODULE libraries the POSITION_INDEPEN- DENT_CODE target
property is set to TRUE automatically.</p>

<p>By default the library file will be created in the build
tree directory corresponding to the source tree directory in
which the command was invoked. See documentation of the
ARCHIVE_OUT- PUT_DIRECTORY, LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, and
RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY target properties to change this
loca- tion. See documentation of the OUTPUT_NAME target
property to change the &lt;name&gt; part of the final file
name.</p>

<p>If EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL is given the corresponding property
will be set on the created target. See documentation of the
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.</p>

<p>The add_library command can also create IMPORTED library
targets using this signature:</p>

<p>add_library(&lt;name&gt;
&lt;SHARED|STATIC|MODULE|UNKNOWN&gt; IMPORTED [GLOBAL])</p>

<p>An IMPORTED library target references a library file
located outside the project. No rules are generated to build
it. The target name has scope in the directory in which it
is created and below, but the GLOBAL option extends
visibility. It may be referenced like any target built
within the project. IMPORTED libraries are useful for
convenient reference from commands like
target_link_libraries. Details about the imported library
are specified by setting properties whose names begin in
&quot;IMPORTED_&quot;. The most important such property is
IMPORTED_LOCA- TION (and its per-configuration version
IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CON- FIG&gt;) which specifies the
location of the main library file on disk. See documentation
of the IMPORTED_* properties for more information.</p>

<p>The signature</p>

<p>add_library(&lt;name&gt; OBJECT &lt;src&gt;...)</p>

<p>creates a special &quot;object library&quot; target. An
object library compiles source files but does not archive or
link their object files into a library. Instead other
targets created by add_library or add_executable may
reference the objects using an expression of the form
$&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib&gt; as a source, where
&quot;objlib&quot; is the object library name. For
example:</p>

<p>add_library(... $&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib&gt; ...)
add_executable(... $&lt;TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib&gt; ...)</p>

<p>will include objlibs object files in a library and an
exe- cutable along with those compiled from their own
sources. Object libraries may contain only sources (and
headers) that compile to object files. They may contain
custom commands gen- erating such sources, but not
PRE_BUILD, PRE_LINK, or POST_BUILD commands. Object
libraries cannot be imported, exported, installed, or
linked. Some native build systems may not like targets that
have only object files, so consider adding at least one real
source file to any target that references $&lt;TAR-
GET_OBJECTS:objlib&gt;.</p>

<p>The signature</p>

<p>add_library(&lt;name&gt; ALIAS &lt;target&gt;)</p>

<p>creates an alias, such that &lt;name&gt; can be used to
refer to &lt;tar- get&gt; in subsequent commands. The
&lt;name&gt; does not appear in the generated buildsystem as
a make target. The &lt;target&gt; may not be an IMPORTED
target or an ALIAS. Alias targets can be used as linkable
targets, targets to read properties from. They can also be
tested for existance with the regular if(TARGET) subcom-
mand. The &lt;name&gt; may not be used to modify properties
of &lt;tar- get&gt;, that is, it may not be used as the
operand of set_prop- erty, set_target_properties,
target_link_libraries etc. An ALIAS target may not be
installed of exported.</p>

<p>add_subdirectory Add a subdirectory to the build.</p>

<p>add_subdirectory(source_dir [binary_dir]
[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])</p>

<p>Add a subdirectory to the build. The source_dir
specifies the directory in which the source CMakeLists.txt
and code files are located. If it is a relative path it will
be evaluated with respect to the current directory (the
typical usage), but it may also be an absolute path. The
binary_dir specifies the directory in which to place the
output files. If it is a relative path it will be evaluated
with respect to the current output directory, but it may
also be an absolute path. If binary_dir is not speci- fied,
the value of source_dir, before expanding any relative path,
will be used (the typical usage). The CMakeLists.txt file in
the specified source directory will be processed immediately
by CMake before processing in the current input file
continues beyond this command.</p>

<p>If the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL argument is provided then
targets in the subdirectory will not be included in the ALL
target of the par- ent directory by default, and will be
excluded from IDE project files. Users must explicitly build
targets in the subdirectory. This is meant for use when the
subdirectory contains a separate part of the project that is
useful but not necessary, such as a set of examples.
Typically the subdirectory should contain its own project()
command invocation so that a full build system will be
generated in the subdirectory (such as a VS IDE solution
file). Note that inter-target dependencies supercede this
exclusion. If a target built by the parent project depends
on a target in the subdirectory, the dependee target will be
included in the parent project build system to satisfy the
dependency.</p>

<p>add_test Add a test to the project with the specified
arguments.</p>

<p>add_test(testname Exename arg1 arg2 ... )</p>

<p>If the ENABLE_TESTING command has been run, this command
adds a test target to the current directory. If
ENABLE_TESTING has not been run, this command does nothing.
The tests are run by the testing subsystem by executing
Exename with the specified argu- ments. Exename can be
either an executable built by this project or an arbitrary
executable on the system (like tclsh). The test will be run
with the current working directory set to the CMakeList.txt
files corresponding directory in the binary tree.</p>

<p>add_test(NAME &lt;name&gt; [CONFIGURATIONS
[Debug|Release|...]] [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir] COMMAND
&lt;command&gt; [arg1 [arg2 ...]])</p>

<p>Add a test called &lt;name&gt;. The test name may not
contain spaces, quotes, or other characters special in CMake
syntax. If COMMAND specifies an executable target (created
by add_executable) it will automatically be replaced by the
location of the executable created at build time. If a
CONFIGURATIONS option is given then the test will be
executed only when testing under one of the named
configurations. If a WORKING_DIRECTORY option is given then
the test will be executed in the given directory.</p>

<p>Arguments after COMMAND may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0
$&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt; = configuration name
$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1, else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0 , else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<p>add_test(NAME mytest COMMAND testDriver --config
$&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt; --exe $&lt;TARGET_FILE:myexe&gt;)</p>

<p>This creates a test &quot;mytest&quot; whose command
runs a testDriver tool passing the configuration name and
the full path to the executable file produced by target
&quot;myexe&quot;.</p>

<p>aux_source_directory Find all source files in a
directory.</p>

<p>aux_source_directory(&lt;dir&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>Collects the names of all the source files in the
specified directory and stores the list in the
&lt;variable&gt; provided. This command is intended to be
used by projects that use explicit template instantiation.
Template instantiation files can be stored in a
&quot;Templates&quot; subdirectory and collected
automatically using this command to avoid manually listing
all instantiations.</p>

<p>It is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the
list of source files for a library or executable target.
While this seems to work, there is no way for CMake to
generate a build system that knows when a new source file
has been added. Nor- mally the generated build system knows
when it needs to rerun CMake because the CMakeLists.txt file
is modified to add a new source. When the source is just
added to the directory without modifying this file, one
would have to manually rerun CMake to generate a build
system incorporating the new file.</p>

<p>break Break from an enclosing foreach or while loop.</p>

<p>break()</p>

<p>Breaks from an enclosing foreach loop or while loop</p>

<p>build_command Get the command line to build this
project.</p>

<p>build_command(&lt;variable&gt; [CONFIGURATION
&lt;config&gt;] [PROJECT_NAME &lt;projname&gt;] [TARGET
&lt;target&gt;])</p>

<p>Sets the given &lt;variable&gt; to a string containing
the command line for building one configuration of a target
in a project using the build tool appropriate for the
current CMAKE_GENERA- TOR.</p>

<p>If CONFIGURATION is omitted, CMake chooses a reasonable
default value for multi-configuration generators.
CONFIGURATION is ignored for single-configuration
generators.</p>

<p>If PROJECT_NAME is omitted, the resulting command line
will build the top level PROJECT in the current build
tree.</p>

<p>If TARGET is omitted, the resulting command line will
build everything, effectively using build target all or
ALL_BUILD.</p>

<p>build_command(&lt;cachevariable&gt;
&lt;makecommand&gt;)</p>

<p>This second signature is deprecated, but still available
for backwards compatibility. Use the first signature
instead.</p>

<p>Sets the given &lt;cachevariable&gt; to a string
containing the com- mand to build this project from the root
of the build tree using the build tool given by
&lt;makecommand&gt;. &lt;makecommand&gt; should be the full
path to msdev, devenv, nmake, make or one of the end user
build tools.</p>

<p>cmake_host_system_information Query host system specific
information.</p>

<p>cmake_host_system_information(RESULT &lt;variable&gt;
QUERY &lt;key&gt; ...)</p>

<p>Queries system information of the host system on which
cmake runs. One or more &lt;key&gt; can be provided to
select the informa- tion to be queried. The list of queried
values is stored in &lt;variable&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;key&gt; can be one of the following values:</p>

<p>NUMBER_OF_LOGICAL_CORES = Number of logical cores.
NUMBER_OF_PHYSICAL_CORES = Number of physical cores.
HOSTNAME = Hostname. FQDN = Fully qualified domain name.
TOTAL_VIRTUAL_MEMORY = Total virtual memory in megabytes.
AVAILABLE_VIRTUAL_MEMORY = Available virtual memory in
megabytes. TOTAL_PHYSICAL_MEMORY = Total physical memory in
megabytes. AVAILABLE_PHYSICAL_MEMORY = Available physical
memory in megabytes.</p>

<p>cmake_minimum_required Set the minimum required version
of cmake for a project.</p>

<p>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION
major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]] [FATAL_ERROR])</p>

<p>If the current version of CMake is lower than that
required it will stop processing the project and report an
error. When a version higher than 2.4 is specified the
command implicitly invokes</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]])</p>

<p>which sets the cmake policy version level to the version
speci- fied. When version 2.4 or lower is given the command
implicitly invokes</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)</p>

<p>which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and
lower.</p>

<p>The FATAL_ERROR option is accepted but ignored by CMake
2.6 and higher. It should be specified so CMake versions 2.4
and lower fail with an error instead of just a warning.</p>

<p>cmake_policy Manage CMake Policy settings.</p>

<p>As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change
existing behavior in order to fix bugs or improve
implementations of existing features. The CMake Policy
mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects
building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in
behavior. Each new policy (behavioral change) is given an
identifier of the form &quot;CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; where
&quot;&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; is an integer index. Documentation
associated with each policy describes the OLD and NEW
behavior and the reason the policy was introduced. Projects
may set each policy to select the desired behavior. When
CMake needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a
setting specified by the project. If no setting is available
the OLD behavior is assumed and a warning is produced
requesting that the policy be set.</p>

<p>The cmake_policy command is used to set policies to OLD
or NEW behavior. While setting policies individually is
supported, we encourage projects to set policies based on
CMake versions.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch[.tweak]])</p>

<p>Specify that the current CMake list file is written for
the given version of CMake. All policies introduced in the
speci- fied version or earlier will be set to use NEW
behavior. All policies introduced after the specified
version will be unset (unless variable
CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; sets a default). This
effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake
version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about their
new policies. The policy version specified must be at least
2.4 or the command will report an error. In order to get
compatibility features supporting versions earlier than 2.4
see documentation of policy CMP0001.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; NEW) cmake_policy(SET
CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; OLD)</p>

<p>Tell CMake to use the OLD or NEW behavior for a given
policy. Projects depending on the old behavior of a given
policy may silence a policy warning by setting the policy
state to OLD. Alternatively one may fix the project to work
with the new behavior and set the policy state to NEW.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(GET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>Check whether a given policy is set to OLD or NEW
behavior. The output variable value will be &quot;OLD&quot;
or &quot;NEW&quot; if the policy is set, and empty
otherwise.</p>

<p>CMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made
by the cmake_policy command affect only the top of the
stack. A new entry on the policy stack is managed
automatically for each sub- directory to protect its parents
and siblings. CMake also man- ages a new entry for scripts
loaded by include() and find_pack- age() commands except
when invoked with the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option (see also
policy CMP0011). The cmake_policy command pro- vides an
interface to manage custom entries on the policy stack:</p>

<p>cmake_policy(PUSH) cmake_policy(POP)</p>

<p>Each PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes.
This is useful to make temporary changes to policy
settings.</p>

<p>Functions and macros record policy settings when they
are created and use the pre-record policies when they are
invoked. If the function or macro implementation sets
policies, the changes automatically propagate up through
callers until they reach the closest nested policy stack
entry.</p>

<p>configure_file Copy a file to another location and
modify its contents.</p>

<p>configure_file(&lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt; [COPYONLY]
[ESCAPE_QUOTES] [@ONLY] [NEWLINE_STYLE
[UNIX|DOS|WIN32|LF|CRLF] ])</p>

<p>Copies a file &lt;input&gt; to file &lt;output&gt; and
substitutes variable values referenced in the file content.
If &lt;input&gt; is a relative path it is evaluated with
respect to the current source direc- tory. The &lt;input&gt;
must be a file, not a directory. If &lt;output&gt; is a
relative path it is evaluated with respect to the current
binary directory. If &lt;output&gt; names an existing
directory the input file is placed in that directory with
its original name.</p>

<p>If the &lt;input&gt; file is modified the build system
will re-run CMake to re-configure the file and generate the
build system again.</p>

<p>This command replaces any variables in the input file
referenced as ${VAR} or @VAR@ with their values as
determined by CMake. If a variable is not defined, it will
be replaced with nothing. If COPYONLY is specified, then no
variable expansion will take place. If ESCAPE_QUOTES is
specified then any substituted quotes will be C-style
escaped. The file will be configured with the current values
of CMake variables. If @ONLY is speci- fied, only variables
of the form @VAR@ will be replaced and ${VAR} will be
ignored. This is useful for configuring scripts that use
${VAR}.</p>

<p>Input file lines of the form &quot;#cmakedefine VAR
...&quot; will be replaced with either &quot;#define VAR
...&quot; or &quot;/* #undef VAR */&quot; depending on
whether VAR is set in CMake to any value not con- sidered a
false constant by the if() command. (Content of
&quot;...&quot;, if any, is processed as above.) Input file
lines of the form &quot;#cmakedefine01 VAR&quot; will be
replaced with either &quot;#define VAR 1&quot; or
&quot;#define VAR 0&quot; similarly.</p>

<p>With NEWLINE_STYLE the line ending could be
adjusted:</p>

<p>0 UNIX or LF for 0 DOS, WIN32 or CRLF for</p>

<p>COPYONLY must not be used with NEWLINE_STYLE.</p>

<p>create_test_sourcelist Create a test driver and source
list for building test programs.</p>

<p>create_test_sourcelist(sourceListName driverName test1
test2 test3 EXTRA_INCLUDE include.h FUNCTION function)</p>

<p>A test driver is a program that links together many
small tests into a single executable. This is useful when
building static executables with large libraries to shrink
the total required size. The list of source files needed to
build the test driver will be in sourceListName. DriverName
is the name of the test driver program. The rest of the
arguments consist of a list of test source files, can be
semicolon separated. Each test source file should have a
function in it that is the same name as the file with no
extension (foo.cxx should have int foo(int, char*[]);)
DriverName will be able to call each of the tests by name on
the command line. If EXTRA_INCLUDE is specified, then the
next argument is included into the generated file. If FUNC-
TION is specified, then the next argument is taken as a
function name that is passed a pointer to ac and av. This
can be used to add extra command line processing to each
test. The cmake vari- able CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_BEFORE_TESTMAIN
can be set to have code that will be placed directly before
calling the test main func- tion.
CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_AFTER_TESTMAIN can be set to have code that
will be placed directly after the call to the test main
function.</p>

<p>define_property Define and document custom
properties.</p>

<p>define_property(&lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY | TARGET | SOURCE
| TEST | VARIABLE | CACHED_VARIABLE&gt; PROPERTY
&lt;name&gt; [INHERITED] BRIEF_DOCS &lt;brief-doc&gt;
[docs...] FULL_DOCS &lt;full-doc&gt; [docs...])</p>

<p>Define one property in a scope for use with the
set_property and get_property commands. This is primarily
useful to associate documentation with property names that
may be retrieved with the get_property command. The first
argument determines the kind of scope in which the property
should be used. It must be one of the following:</p>

<p>GLOBAL = associated with the global namespace DIRECTORY
= associated with one directory TARGET = associated with one
target SOURCE = associated with one source file TEST =
associated with a test named with add_test VARIABLE =
documents a CMake language variable CACHED_VARIABLE =
documents a CMake cache variable</p>

<p>Note that unlike set_property and get_property no actual
scope needs to be given; only the kind of scope is
important.</p>

<p>The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by
the name of the property being defined.</p>

<p>If the INHERITED option then the get_property command
will chain up to the next higher scope when the requested
property is not set in the scope given to the command.
DIRECTORY scope chains to GLOBAL. TARGET, SOURCE, and TEST
chain to DIRECTORY.</p>

<p>The BRIEF_DOCS and FULL_DOCS options are followed by
strings to be associated with the property as its brief and
full documenta- tion. Corresponding options to the
get_property command will retrieve the documentation.</p>

<p>else Starts the else portion of an if block.</p>

<p>else(expression)</p>

<p>See the if command.</p>

<p>elseif Starts the elseif portion of an if block.</p>

<p>elseif(expression)</p>

<p>See the if command.</p>

<p>enable_language Enable a language
(CXX/C/Fortran/etc)</p>

<p>enable_language(&lt;lang&gt; [OPTIONAL] )</p>

<p>This command enables support for the named language in
CMake. This is the same as the project command but does not
create any of the extra variables that are created by the
project command. Example languages are CXX, C, Fortran.</p>

<p>This command must be called in file scope, not in a
function call. Furthermore, it must be called in the highest
directory common to all targets using the named language
directly for com- piling sources or indirectly through link
dependencies. It is simplest to enable all needed languages
in the top-level direc- tory of a project.</p>

<p>The OPTIONAL keyword is a placeholder for future
implementation and does not currently work.</p>

<p>enable_testing Enable testing for current directory and
below.</p>

<p>enable_testing()</p>

<p>Enables testing for this directory and below. See also
the add_test command. Note that ctest expects to find a test
file in the build directory root. Therefore, this command
should be in the source directory root.</p>

<p>endforeach Ends a list of commands in a FOREACH
block.</p>

<p>endforeach(expression)</p>

<p>See the FOREACH command.</p>

<p>endfunction Ends a list of commands in a function
block.</p>

<p>endfunction(expression)</p>

<p>See the function command.</p>

<p>endif Ends a list of commands in an if block.</p>

<p>endif(expression)</p>

<p>See the if command.</p>

<p>endmacro Ends a list of commands in a macro block.</p>

<p>endmacro(expression)</p>

<p>See the macro command.</p>

<p>endwhile Ends a list of commands in a while block.</p>

<p>endwhile(expression)</p>

<p>See the while command.</p>

<p>execute_process Execute one or more child processes.</p>

<p>execute_process(COMMAND &lt;cmd1&gt; [args1...]]
[COMMAND &lt;cmd2&gt; [args2...] [...]] [WORKING_DIRECTORY
&lt;directory&gt;] [TIMEOUT &lt;seconds&gt;]
[RESULT_VARIABLE &lt;variable&gt;] [OUTPUT_VARIABLE
&lt;variable&gt;] [ERROR_VARIABLE &lt;variable&gt;]
[INPUT_FILE &lt;file&gt;] [OUTPUT_FILE &lt;file&gt;]
[ERROR_FILE &lt;file&gt;] [OUTPUT_QUIET] [ERROR_QUIET]
[OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
[ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE])</p>

<p>Runs the given sequence of one or more commands with the
stan- dard output of each process piped to the standard
input of the next. A single standard error pipe is used for
all processes. If WORKING_DIRECTORY is given the named
directory will be set as the current working directory of
the child processes. If TIME- OUT is given the child
processes will be terminated if they do not finish in the
specified number of seconds (fractions are allowed). If
RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to contain
the result of running the processes. This will be an integer
return code from the last child or a string describing an
error condition. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE or ERROR_VARIABLE are
given the variable named will be set with the contents of
the standard output and standard error pipes respectively.
If the same variable is named for both pipes their output
will be merged in the order produced. If INPUT_FILE,
OUTPUT_FILE, or ERROR_FILE is given the file named will be
attached to the stan- dard input of the first process,
standard output of the last process, or standard error of
all processes respectively. If OUTPUT_QUIET or ERROR_QUIET
is given then the standard output or standard error results
will be quietly ignored. If more than one OUTPUT_* or
ERROR_* option is given for the same pipe the precedence is
not specified. If no OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* options are given
the output will be shared with the corresponding pipes of
the CMake process itself.</p>

<p>The execute_process command is a newer more powerful
version of exec_program, but the old command has been kept
for compatibil- ity.</p>

<p>export Export targets from the build tree for use by
outside projects.</p>

<p>export(TARGETS [target1 [target2 [...]]] [NAMESPACE
&lt;namespace&gt;] [APPEND] FILE &lt;filename&gt;
[EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES])</p>

<p>Create a file &lt;filename&gt; that may be included by
outside projects to import targets from the current projects
build tree. This is useful during cross-compiling to build
utility executables that can run on the host platform in one
project and then import them into another project being
compiled for the target platform. If the NAMESPACE option is
given the &lt;names- pace&gt; string will be prepended to
all target names written to the file. If the APPEND option
is given the generated code will be appended to the file
instead of overwriting it. The
EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES keyword, if present, causes
the contents of the properties matching
(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTER- FACE_LIBRARIES(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)? to
be exported, when policy CMP0022 is NEW. If a library target
is included in the export but a target to which it links is
not included the behavior is unspecified.</p>

<p>The file created by this command is specific to the
build tree and should never be installed. See the
install(EXPORT) command to export targets from an
installation tree.</p>

<p>Do not set properties that affect the location of a
target after passing it to this command. These include
properties whose names match
&quot;(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIREC-
TORY)(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?&quot;,
&quot;(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)&quot;, or &quot;LINKER_LAN-
GUAGE&quot;. Failure to follow this rule is not diagnosed
and leaves the location of the target undefined.</p>

<p>export(PACKAGE &lt;name&gt;)</p>

<p>Store the current build directory in the CMake user
package reg- istry for package &lt;name&gt;. The
find_package command may consider the directory while
searching for package &lt;name&gt;. This helps dependent
projects find and use a package from the current projects
build tree without help from the user. Note that the entry
in the package registry that this command creates works only
in conjunction with a package configuration file
(&lt;name&gt;Config.cmake) that works with the build
tree.</p>

<p>file File manipulation command.</p>

<p>file(WRITE filename &quot;message to write&quot;... )
file(APPEND filename &quot;message to write&quot;... )
file(READ filename variable [LIMIT numBytes] [OFFSET offset]

variable [&lt;format string&gt;] [UTC]) file(GENERATE OUTPUT
output_file &lt;INPUT input_file|CONTENT input_content&gt;
[CONDITION expression])</p>

<p>WRITE will write a message into a file called filename.
It overwrites the file if it already exists, and creates the
file if it does not exist. (If the file is a build input,
use config- ure_file to update the file only when its
content changes.)</p>

<p>APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE,
except it will append it to the end of the file</p>

<p>READ will read the content of a file and store it into
the vari- able. It will start at the given offset and read
up to numBytes. If the argument HEX is given, the binary
data will be converted to hexadecimal representation and
this will be stored in the variable.</p>

<p>MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will
compute a cryptographic hash of the content of a file.</p>

<p>STRINGS will parse a list of ASCII strings from a file
and store it in a variable. Binary data in the file are
ignored. Carriage return (CR) characters are ignored. It
works also for Intel Hex and Motorola S-record files, which
are automatically converted to binary format when reading
them. Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVERSION.</p>

<p>LIMIT_COUNT sets the maximum number of strings to
return. LIMIT_INPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to read
from the input file. LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of
bytes to store in the output variable. LENGTH_MINIMUM sets
the minimum length of a string to return. Shorter strings
are ignored. LENGTH_MAXIMUM sets the maximum length of a
string to return. Longer strings are split into strings no
longer than the maximum length. NEWLINE_CONSUME allows
newlines to be included in strings instead of terminating
them.</p>

<p>REGEX specifies a regular expression that a string must
match to be returned. Typical usage</p>

<p>file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)</p>

<p>stores a list in the variable &quot;myfile&quot; in
which each item is a line from the input file.</p>

<p>GLOB will generate a list of all files that match the
globbing expressions and store it into the variable.
Globbing expressions are similar to regular expressions, but
much simpler. If RELA- TIVE flag is specified for an
expression, the results will be returned as a relative path
to the given path. (We do not rec- ommend using GLOB to
collect a list of source files from your source tree. If no
CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is added or
removed then the generated build system cannot know when to
ask CMake to regenerate.)</p>

<p>Examples of globbing expressions include:</p>

<p>*.cxx - match all files with extension cxx *.vt? - match
all files with extension vta,...,vtz f[3-5].txt - match
files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt</p>

<p>GLOB_RECURSE will generate a list similar to the regular
GLOB, except it will traverse all the subdirectories of the
matched directory and match the files. Subdirectories that
are symlinks are only traversed if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given
or cmake policy CMP0009 is not set to NEW. See cmake
--help-policy CMP0009 for more information.</p>

<p>Examples of recursive globbing include:</p>

<p>/dir/*.py - match all python files in /dir and
subdirectories</p>

<p>MAKE_DIRECTORY will create the given directories, also
if their parent directories dont exist yet</p>

<p>RENAME moves a file or directory within a filesystem,
replacing the destination atomically.</p>

<p>REMOVE will remove the given files, also in
subdirectories</p>

<p>REMOVE_RECURSE will remove the given files and
directories, also non-empty directories</p>

<p>RELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from
directory to the given file.</p>

<p>TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path
with unix /. The input can be a single path or a system path
like &quot;$ENV{PATH}&quot;. Note the double quotes around
the ENV call TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes one argument. This
command will also convert the native list delimiters for a
list of paths like the PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>TO_NATIVE_PATH works just like TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will
convert from a cmake style path into the native path style
for win- dows and / for UNIX.</p>

<p>DOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file.
If LOG var is specified a log of the download will be put in
var. If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation
will be put in var. The status is returned in a list of
length 2. The first element is the numeric return value for
the operation, and the second element is a string value for
the error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the
operation. If TIMEOUT time is speci- fied, the operation
will timeout after time seconds, time should be specified as
an integer. The INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer
number of seconds of inactivity after which the opera- tion
should terminate. If EXPECTED_HASH ALGO=value is specified,
the operation will verify that the downloaded files actual
hash matches the expected value, where ALGO is one of MD5,
SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512. If it does not
match, the operation fails with an error.
(&quot;EXPECTED_MD5 sum&quot; is short-hand for
&quot;EXPECTED_HASH MD5=sum&quot;.) If SHOW_PROGRESS is
specified, progress information will be printed as status
messages until the operation is complete. For https URLs
CMake must be built with OpenSSL. TLS/SSL certificates are
not checked by default. Set TLS_VERIFY to ON to check
certificates and/or use EXPECTED_HASH to verify downloaded
content. Set TLS_CAINFO to specify a custom Certificate
Authority file. If either TLS option is not given CMake will
check variables CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY and CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO,
respectively.</p>

<p>UPLOAD will upload the given file to the given URL. If
LOG var is specified a log of the upload will be put in var.
If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation will
be put in var. The status is returned in a list of length 2.
The first element is the numeric return value for the
operation, and the second element is a string value for the
error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the operation. If
TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will timeout after
time seconds, time should be speci- fied as an integer. The
INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds of
inactivity after which the operation should terminate. If
SHOW_PROGRESS is specified, progress information will be
printed as status messages until the operation is com-
plete.</p>

<p>TIMESTAMP will write a string representation of the
modification time of filename to variable.</p>

<p>Should the command be unable to obtain a timestamp
variable will be set to the empty string &quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>See documentation of the string TIMESTAMP sub-command
for more details.</p>

<p>The file() command also provides COPY and INSTALL
signatures:</p>

<p>file(&lt;COPY|INSTALL&gt; files... DESTINATION
&lt;dir&gt; [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
[DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
[NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS]
[FILES_MATCHING] [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX
&lt;regex&gt;] [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]]
[...])</p>

<p>The COPY signature copies files, directories, and
symlinks to a destination folder. Relative input paths are
evaluated with respect to the current source directory, and
a relative destina- tion is evaluated with respect to the
current build directory. Copying preserves input file
timestamps, and optimizes out a file if it exists at the
destination with the same timestamp. Copying preserves input
permissions unless explicit permissions or
NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS are given (default is USE_SOURCE_PER-
MISSIONS). See the install(DIRECTORY) command for
documentation of permissions, PATTERN, REGEX, and EXCLUDE
options.</p>

<p>The INSTALL signature differs slightly from COPY: it
prints sta- tus messages, and NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is
default. Installa- tion scripts generated by the install()
command use this signa- ture (with some undocumented options
for internal use).</p>

<p>GENERATE will write an &lt;output_file&gt; with content
from an &lt;input_file&gt;, or from &lt;input_content&gt;.
The output is generated conditionally based on the content
of the &lt;condition&gt;. The file is written at CMake
generate-time and the input may contain gen- erator
expressions. The &lt;condition&gt;, &lt;output_file&gt; and
&lt;input_file&gt; may also contain generator expressions.
The &lt;con- dition&gt; must evaluate to either 0 or 1 . The
&lt;output_file&gt; must evaluate to a unique name among all
configurations and among all invocations of
file(GENERATE).</p>

<p>find_file Find the full path to a file.</p>

<p>find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_file( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a full path to named file.
A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the
result of this com- mand. If the full path to a file is
found the result is stored in the variable and the search
will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If
nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,
and the search will be attempted again the next time
find_file is invoked with the same variable. The name of the
full path to a file that is searched for is specified by the
names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search
loca- tions can be specified after the PATHS argument. If
ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the
environment variable var will be read and converted from a
system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.
For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path
variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the
documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies
additional subdirectories to check below each search
path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the users shell
config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH INCLUDE</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files

NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>find_library Find a library.</p>

<p>find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_library( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[NAMES_PER_DIR] [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS
path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2
...]] [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
[NO_DEFAULT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_PATH] [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH] [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH | NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a library. A cache entry
named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this
command. If the library is found the result is stored in the
variable and the search will not be repeated unless the
variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be
&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
the next time find_library is invoked with the same
variable. The name of the library that is searched for is
specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.
Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS
argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section
the environment variable var will be read and converted from
a system environment variable to a cmake style list of
paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the
system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used
for the docu- mentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES
specifies addi- tional subdirectories to check below each
search path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and &lt;prefix&gt;/lib
for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the users shell
config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and &lt;prefix&gt;/lib
for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH LIB</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and &lt;prefix&gt;/lib
for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>When more than one value is given to the NAMES option
this com- mand by default will consider one name at a time
and search every directory for it. The NAMES_PER_DIR option
tells this command to consider one directory at a time and
search for all names in it.</p>

<p>If the library found is a framework, then VAR will be
set to the full path to the framework
&lt;fullPath&gt;/A.framework. When a full path to a
framework is used as a library, CMake will use a -framework
A, and a -F&lt;fullPath&gt; to link the framework to the
target.</p>

<p>If the global property FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is
set all search paths will be tested as normal, with
&quot;64/&quot; appended, and with all matches of
&quot;lib/&quot; replaced with &quot;lib64/&quot;. This
property is automatically set for the platforms that are
known to need it if at least one of the languages supported
by the PROJECT com- mand is enabled.</p>

<p>find_package Load settings for an external project.</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
[MODULE] [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
[OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS components...] [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Finds and loads settings from an external project.
&lt;pack- age&gt;_FOUND will be set to indicate whether the
package was found. When the package is found
package-specific information is provided through variables
and imported targets documented by the package itself. The
QUIET option disables messages if the package cannot be
found. The MODULE option disables the second signature
documented below. The REQUIRED option stops process- ing
with an error message if the package cannot be found.</p>

<p>A package-specific list of required components may be
listed after the COMPONENTS option (or after the REQUIRED
option if present). Additional optional components may be
listed after OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS. Available components and
their influence on whether a package is considered to be
found are defined by the target package.</p>

<p>The [version] argument requests a version with which the
package found should be compatible (format is
major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]). The EXACT option requests
that the version be matched exactly. If no [version] and/or
compo- nent list is given to a recursive invocation inside a
find-mod- ule, the corresponding arguments are forwarded
automatically from the outer call (including the EXACT flag
for [version]). Version support is currently provided only
on a package-by-pack- age basis (details below).</p>

<p>User code should generally look for packages using the
above simple signature. The remainder of this command
documentation specifies the full command signature and
details of the search process. Project maintainers wishing
to provide a package to be found by this command are
encouraged to read on.</p>

<p>The command has two modes by which it searches for
packages: &quot;Module&quot; mode and &quot;Config&quot;
mode. Module mode is available when the command is invoked
with the above reduced signature. CMake searches for a file
called &quot;Find&lt;package&gt;.cmake&quot; in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the CMake installation. If the
file is found, it is read and processed by CMake. It is
respon- sible for finding the package, checking the version,
and produc- ing any needed messages. Many find-modules
provide limited or no support for versioning; check the
module documentation. If no module is found and the MODULE
option is not given the com- mand proceeds to Config
mode.</p>

<p>The complete Config mode command signature is:</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
[REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]] [CONFIG|NO_MODULE]
[NO_POLICY_SCOPE] [NAMES name1 [name2 ...]] [CONFIGS config1
[config2 ...]] [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ]] [PATHS path1
[path2 ... ]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
[NO_DEFAULT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_PATH] [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY] [NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH])</p>

<p>The CONFIG option may be used to skip Module mode
explicitly and switch to Config mode. It is synonymous to
using NO_MODULE. Config mode is also implied by use of
options not specified in the reduced signature.</p>

<p>Config mode attempts to locate a configuration file
provided by the package to be found. A cache entry called
&lt;package&gt;_DIR is created to hold the directory
containing the file. By default the command searches for a
package with the name &lt;package&gt;. If the NAMES option
is given the names following it are used instead of
&lt;package&gt;. The command searches for a file called
&quot;&lt;name&gt;Config.cmake&quot; or
&quot;&lt;lower-case-name&gt;-config.cmake&quot; for each
name specified. A replacement set of possible configura-
tion file names may be given using the CONFIGS option. The
search procedure is specified below. Once found, the
configura- tion file is read and processed by CMake. Since
the file is provided by the package it already knows the
location of package contents. The full path to the
configuration file is stored in the cmake variable
&lt;package&gt;_CONFIG.</p>

<p>All configuration files which have been considered by
CMake while searching for an installation of the package
with an appropriate version are stored in the cmake variable
&lt;pack- age&gt;_CONSIDERED_CONFIGS, the associated
versions in &lt;pack- age&gt;_CONSIDERED_VERSIONS.</p>

<p>If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake
will generate an error describing the problem unless the
QUIET argu- ment is specified. If REQUIRED is specified and
the package is not found a fatal error is generated and the
configure step stops executing. If &lt;package&gt;_DIR has
been set to a directory not containing a configuration file
CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.</p>

<p>When the [version] argument is given Config mode will
only find a version of the package that claims compatibility
with the requested version (format is
major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]). If the EXACT option is given
only a version of the package claiming an exact match of the
requested version may be found. CMake does not establish any
convention for the meaning of version numbers. Package
version numbers are checked by &quot;version&quot; files
provided by the packages themselves. For a candidate package
configuration file &quot;&lt;config-file&gt;.cmake&quot; the
corresponding ver- sion file is located next to it and named
either &quot;&lt;con- fig-file&gt;-version.cmake&quot; or
&quot;&lt;config-file&gt;Version.cmake&quot;. If no such
version file is available then the configuration file is
assumed to not be compatible with any requested version. A
basic version file containing generic version matching code
can be created using the macro
write_basic_package_version_file(), see its documentation
for more details. When a version file is found it is loaded
to check the requested version number. The version file is
loaded in a nested scope in which the following variables
have been defined:</p>

<p>PACKAGE_FIND_NAME = the &lt;package&gt; name
PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION = full requested version string
PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested,
else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if
requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version
if requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak
version if requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT =
number of version components, 0 to 4</p>

<p>The version file checks whether it satisfies the
requested ver- sion and sets these variables:</p>

<p>PACKAGE_VERSION = full provided version string
PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT = true if version is exact match
PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible
PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE = true if unsuitable as any
version</p>

<p>These variables are checked by the find_package command
to determine whether the configuration file provides an
acceptable version. They are not available after the
find_package call returns. If the version is acceptable the
following variables are set:</p>

<p>&lt;package&gt;_VERSION = full provided version string
&lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if provided,
else 0 &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if
provided, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_PATCH = patch
version if provided, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_TWEAK =
tweak version if provided, else 0
&lt;package&gt;_VERSION_COUNT = number of version
components, 0 to 4</p>

<p>and the corresponding package configuration file is
loaded. When multiple package configuration files are
available whose version files claim compatibility with the
version requested it is unspecified which one is chosen. No
attempt is made to choose a highest or closest version
number.</p>

<p>Config mode provides an elaborate interface and search
proce- dure. Much of the interface is provided for
completeness and for use internally by find-modules loaded
by Module mode. Most user code should simply call</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [major[.minor]] [EXACT]
[REQUIRED|QUIET])</p>

<p>in order to find a package. Package maintainers
providing CMake package configuration files are encouraged
to name and install them such that the procedure outlined
below will find them with- out requiring use of additional
options.</p>

<p>CMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes
for the package. Under each prefix several directories are
searched for a configuration file. The tables below show the
directories searched. Each entry is meant for installation
trees following Windows (W), UNIX (U), or Apple (A)
conventions.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/ (W) &lt;prefix&gt;/(cmake|CMake)/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/cmake/&lt;name&gt;*/
(U)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/&lt;name&gt;*/
(U)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/
(U)</p>

<p>On systems supporting OS X Frameworks and Application
Bundles the following directories are searched for
frameworks or bundles containing a configuration file:</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/ (A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/CMake/ (A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/
(A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/CMake/
(A) &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/ (A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/CMake/
(A)</p>

<p>In all cases the &lt;name&gt; is treated as
case-insensitive and cor- responds to any of the names
specified (&lt;package&gt; or names given by NAMES). Paths
with lib/&lt;arch&gt; are enabled if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set. If PATH_SUFFIXES is
speci- fied the suffixes are appended to each (W) or (U)
directory entry one-by-one.</p>

<p>This set of directories is intended to work in
cooperation with projects that provide configuration files
in their installation trees. Directories above marked with
(W) are intended for installations on Windows where the
prefix may point at the top of an applications installation
directory. Those marked with (U) are intended for
installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared
by multiple packages. This is merely a conven- tion, so all
(W) and (U) directories are still searched on all platforms.
Directories marked with (A) are intended for instal- lations
on Apple platforms. The cmake variables CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK
and CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE determine the order of preference
as specified below.</p>

<p>The set of installation prefixes is constructed using
the fol- lowing steps. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified all
NO_* options are enabled.</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the users shell
config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;package&gt;_DIR CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint provided by the location of another item already found.
Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.
Path entries ending in &quot;/bin&quot; or &quot;/sbin&quot;
are automatically converted to their parent directories.</p>

<p>PATH</p>

<p>5. Search project build trees recently configured in a
CMake GUI. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH is
passed. It is intended for the case when a user is building
multiple depen- dent projects one after another.</p>

<p>6. Search paths stored in the CMake user package
registry. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
is passed. On Win- dows a &lt;package&gt; may appear under
registry key</p>

<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USERtwareKitware as a REG_SZ value, with
arbitrary name, that specifies the directory containing the
package configuration file. On UNIX platforms a
&lt;package&gt; may appear under the directory</p>

<p>~/.cmake/packages/&lt;package&gt;</p>

<p>as a file, with arbitrary name, whose content specifies
the directory containing the package configuration file. See
the export(PACKAGE) command to create user package registry
entries for project build trees.</p>

<p>7. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>8. Search paths stored in the CMake system package
registry. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY is passed. On Windows a
&lt;package&gt; may appear under registry key</p>

<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINEtwareKitware as a REG_SZ value, with
arbitrary name, that specifies the directory containing the
package configuration file. There is no system package
registry on non-Windows platforms.</p>

<p>9. Search paths specified by the PATHS option. These are
typi- cally hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_package(&lt;package&gt;)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>Every non-REQUIRED find_package() call can be disabled
by set- ting the variable
CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;package&gt; to TRUE. See the
documentation for the CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;pack-
age&gt; variable for more information.</p>

<p>When loading a find module or package configuration file
find_package defines variables to provide information about
the call arguments (and restores their original state before
return- ing):</p>

<p>&lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED = true if REQUIRED option
was given &lt;package&gt;_FIND_QUIETLY = true if QUIET
option was given &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION = full
requested version string &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR
= major version if requested, else 0
&lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if
requested, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch
version if requested, else 0
&lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if
requested, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_COUNT =
number of version components, 0 to 4
&lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_EXACT = true if EXACT option
was given &lt;package&gt;_FIND_COMPONENTS = list of
requested components &lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED_&lt;c&gt;
= true if component &lt;c&gt; is required false if component
&lt;c&gt; is optional</p>

<p>In Module mode the loaded find module is responsible to
honor the request detailed by these variables; see the find
module for details. In Config mode find_package handles
REQUIRED, QUIET, and version options automatically but
leaves it to the package configuration file to handle
components in a way that makes sense for the package. The
package configuration file may set &lt;package&gt;_FOUND to
false to tell find_package that component requirements are
not satisfied.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for
discussion of the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.</p>

<p>find_path Find the directory containing a file.</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_path( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a directory containing the
named file. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to
store the result of this command. If the file in a directory
is found the result is stored in the variable and the search
will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If
nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,
and the search will be attempted again the next time
find_path is invoked with the same variable. The name of the
file in a directory that is searched for is specified by the
names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search
locations can be specified after the PATHS argument. If ENV
var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment
variable var will be read and converted from a sys- tem
environment variable to a cmake style list of paths. For
example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path
vari- able. The argument after DOC will be used for the
documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies
additional subdi- rectories to check below each search
path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the users shell
config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH INCLUDE</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>When searching for frameworks, if the file is specified
as A/b.h, then the framework search will look for
A.framework/Head- ers/b.h. If that is found the path will be
set to the path to the framework. CMake will convert this to
the correct -F option to include the file.</p>

<p>find_program Find an executable program.</p>

<p>find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_program( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a program. A cache entry
named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this
command. If the program is found the result is stored in the
variable and the search will not be repeated unless the
variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be
&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
the next time find_program is invoked with the same
variable. The name of the program that is searched for is
specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.
Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS
argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section
the environment variable var will be read and converted from
a system environment variable to a cmake style list of
paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the
system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used
for the docu- mentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES
specifies addi- tional subdirectories to check below each
search path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the users shell
configuration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>fltk_wrap_ui Create FLTK user interfaces Wrappers.</p>

<p>fltk_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName source1 source2 ...
sourceN )</p>

<p>Produce .h and .cxx files for all the .fl and .fld files
listed. The resulting .h and .cxx files will be added to a
variable named resultingLibraryName_FLTK_UI_SRCS which
should be added to your library.</p>

<p>foreach Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a
list.</p>

<p>foreach(loop_var arg1 arg2 ...) COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... endforeach(loop_var)</p>

<p>All commands between foreach and the matching endforeach
are recorded without being invoked. Once the endforeach is
evalu- ated, the recorded list of commands is invoked once
for each argument listed in the original foreach command.
Before each iteration of the loop &quot;${loop_var}&quot;
will be set as a variable with the current value in the
list.</p>

<p>foreach(loop_var RANGE total) foreach(loop_var RANGE
start stop [step])</p>

<p>Foreach can also iterate over a generated range of
numbers. There are three types of this iteration:</p>

<p>* When specifying single number, the range will have
elements 0 to &quot;total&quot;.</p>

<p>* When specifying two numbers, the range will have
elements from the first number to the second number.</p>

<p>* The third optional number is the increment used to
iterate from the first number to the second number.</p>

<p>foreach(loop_var IN [LISTS [list1 [...]]] [ITEMS [item1
[...]]])</p>

<p>Iterates over a precise list of items. The LISTS option
names list-valued variables to be traversed, including empty
elements (an empty string is a zero-length list). The ITEMS
option ends argument parsing and includes all arguments
following it in the iteration.</p>

<p>function Start recording a function for later invocation
as a command.</p>

<p>function(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endfunction(&lt;name&gt;)</p>

<p>Define a function named &lt;name&gt; that takes
arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...). Commands listed after
function, but before the matching endfunction, are not
invoked until the function is invoked. When it is invoked,
the commands recorded in the func- tion are first modified
by replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments
passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In addition to
referencing the formal parameters you can refer- ence the
variable ARGC which will be set to the number of argu- ments
passed into the function as well as ARGV0 ARGV1 ARGV2 ...
which will have the actual values of the arguments passed
in. This facilitates creating functions with optional
arguments. Additionally ARGV holds the list of all arguments
given to the function and ARGN holds the list of arguments
past the last expected argument.</p>

<p>A function opens a new scope: see set(var PARENT_SCOPE)
for details.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the
behavior of policies inside functions.</p>

<p>get_cmake_property Get a property of the CMake
instance.</p>

<p>get_cmake_property(VAR property)</p>

<p>Get a property from the CMake instance. The value of the
prop- erty is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is
not found, VAR will be set to &quot;NOTFOUND&quot;. Some
supported properties include: VARIABLES, CACHE_VARIABLES,
COMMANDS, MACROS, and COM- PONENTS.</p>

<p>See also the more general get_property() command.</p>

<p>get_directory_property Get a property of DIRECTORY
scope.</p>

<p>get_directory_property(&lt;variable&gt; [DIRECTORY
&lt;dir&gt;] &lt;prop-name&gt;)</p>

<p>Store a property of directory scope in the named
variable. If the property is not defined the empty-string is
returned. The DIRECTORY argument specifies another directory
from which to retrieve the property value. The specified
directory must have already been traversed by CMake.</p>

<p>get_directory_property(&lt;variable&gt; [DIRECTORY
&lt;dir&gt;] DEFINITION &lt;var-name&gt;)</p>

<p>Get a variable definition from a directory. This form is
useful to get a variable definition from another
directory.</p>

<p>See also the more general get_property() command.</p>

<p>get_filename_component Get a specific component of a
full filename.</p>

<p>get_filename_component(&lt;VAR&gt; &lt;FileName&gt;
&lt;COMP&gt; [CACHE])</p>

<p>Set &lt;VAR&gt; to a component of &lt;FileName&gt;,
where &lt;COMP&gt; is one of:</p>

<p>DIRECTORY = Directory without file name NAME = File name
without directory EXT = File name longest extension (.b.c
from d/a.b.c) NAME_WE = File name without directory or
longest extension ABSOLUTE = Full path to file REALPATH =
Full path to existing file with symlinks resolved PATH =
Legacy alias for DIRECTORY (use for CMake &lt;= 2.8.11)</p>

<p>Paths are returned with forward slashes and have no
trailing slahes. The longest file extension is always
considered. If the optional CACHE argument is specified, the
result variable is added to the cache.</p>

<p>get_filename_component(&lt;VAR&gt; FileName PROGRAM
[PROGRAM_ARGS &lt;ARG_VAR&gt;] [CACHE])</p>

<p>The program in FileName will be found in the system
search path or left as a full path. If PROGRAM_ARGS is
present with PRO- GRAM, then any command-line arguments
present in the FileName string are split from the program
name and stored in &lt;ARG_VAR&gt;. This is used to separate
a program name from its arguments in a command line
string.</p>

<p>get_property Get a property.</p>

<p>get_property(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY
[dir] | TARGET &lt;target&gt; | SOURCE &lt;source&gt; | TEST
&lt;test&gt; | CACHE &lt;entry&gt; | VARIABLE&gt; PROPERTY
&lt;name&gt; [SET | DEFINED | BRIEF_DOCS | FULL_DOCS])</p>

<p>Get one property from one object in a scope. The first
argument specifies the variable in which to store the
result. The second argument determines the scope from which
to get the property. It must be one of the following:</p>

<p>GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but
another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named
by full or relative path.</p>

<p>TARGET scope must name one existing target.</p>

<p>SOURCE scope must name one source file.</p>

<p>TEST scope must name one existing test.</p>

<p>CACHE scope must name one cache entry.</p>

<p>VARIABLE scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by
the name of the property to get. If the property is not set
an empty value is returned. If the SET option is given the
variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the
property has been set. If the DEFINED option is given the
variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the
property has been defined such as with define_property. If
BRIEF_DOCS or FULL_DOCS is given then the variable is set to
a string containing documenta- tion for the requested
property. If documentation is requested for a property that
has not been defined NOTFOUND is returned.</p>

<p>get_source_file_property Get a property for a source
file.</p>

<p>get_source_file_property(VAR file property)</p>

<p>Get a property from a source file. The value of the
property is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is
not found, VAR will be set to &quot;NOTFOUND&quot;. Use
set_source_files_properties to set property values. Source
file properties usually control how the file is built. One
property that is always there is LOCATION</p>

<p>See also the more general get_property() command.</p>

<p>get_target_property Get a property from a target.</p>

<p>get_target_property(VAR target property)</p>

<p>Get a property from a target. The value of the property
is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is not found,
VAR will be set to &quot;NOTFOUND&quot;. Use
set_target_properties to set property values. Properties are
usually used to control how a target is built, but some
query the target instead. This com- mand can get properties
for any target so far created. The tar- gets do not need to
be in the current CMakeLists.txt file.</p>

<p>See also the more general get_property() command.</p>

<p>get_test_property Get a property of the test.</p>

<p>get_test_property(test property VAR)</p>

<p>Get a property from the Test. The value of the property
is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is not found,
VAR will be set to &quot;NOTFOUND&quot;. For a list of
standard properties you can type cmake
--help-property-list</p>

<p>See also the more general get_property() command.</p>

<p>if Conditionally execute a group of commands.</p>

<p>if(expression) # then section. COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... elseif(expression2) # elseif section.
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... else(expression) #
else section. COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endif(expression)</p>

<p>Evaluates the given expression. If the result is true,
the com- mands in the THEN section are invoked. Otherwise,
the commands in the else section are invoked. The elseif and
else sections are optional. You may have multiple elseif
clauses. Note that the expression in the else and endif
clause is optional. Long expressions can be used and there
is a traditional order of precedence. Parenthetical
expressions are evaluated first fol- lowed by unary
operators such as EXISTS, COMMAND, and DEFINED. Then any
EQUAL, LESS, GREATER, STRLESS, STRGREATER, STREQUAL, MATCHES
will be evaluated. Then NOT operators and finally AND, OR
operators will be evaluated. Possible expressions are:</p>

<p>if(&lt;constant&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the constant is 1, ON, YES, TRUE, Y, or a
non-zero num- ber. False if the constant is 0, OFF, NO,
FALSE, N, IGNORE, NOTFOUND, , or ends in the suffix
-NOTFOUND. Named boolean constants are case-insensitive. If
the argument is not one of these constants, it is treated as
a variable:</p>

<p>if(&lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the variable is defined to a value that is not a
false constant. False otherwise. (Note macro arguments are
not vari- ables.)</p>

<p>if(NOT &lt;expression&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the expression is not true.</p>

<p>if(&lt;expr1&gt; AND &lt;expr2&gt;)</p>

<p>True if both expressions would be considered true
individually.</p>

<p>if(&lt;expr1&gt; OR &lt;expr2&gt;)</p>

<p>True if either expression would be considered true
individually.</p>

<p>if(COMMAND command-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is a command, macro or function
that can be invoked.</p>

<p>if(POLICY policy-id)</p>

<p>True if the given name is an existing policy (of the
form CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;).</p>

<p>if(TARGET target-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is an existing target, built or
imported.</p>

<p>if(EXISTS file-name) if(EXISTS directory-name)</p>

<p>True if the named file or directory exists. Behavior is
well-defined only for full paths.</p>

<p>if(file1 IS_NEWER_THAN file2)</p>

<p>True if file1 is newer than file2 or if one of the two
files doesnt exist. Behavior is well-defined only for full
paths. If the file time stamps are exactly the same, an
IS_NEWER_THAN com- parison returns true, so that any
dependent build operations will occur in the event of a tie.
This includes the case of passing the same file name for
both file1 and file2.</p>

<p>if(IS_DIRECTORY directory-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is a directory. Behavior is
well-defined only for full paths.</p>

<p>if(IS_SYMLINK file-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is a symbolic link. Behavior is
well-defined only for full paths.</p>

<p>if(IS_ABSOLUTE path)</p>

<p>True if the given path is an absolute path.</p>

<p>if(&lt;variable|string&gt; MATCHES regex)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value matches the
given regular expression.</p>

<p>if(&lt;variable|string&gt; LESS &lt;variable|string&gt;)
if(&lt;variable|string&gt; GREATER &lt;variable|string&gt;)
if(&lt;variable|string&gt; EQUAL
&lt;variable|string&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value is a valid
number and the inequality or equality is true.</p>

<p>if(&lt;variable|string&gt; STRLESS
&lt;variable|string&gt;) if(&lt;variable|string&gt;
STRGREATER &lt;variable|string&gt;)
if(&lt;variable|string&gt; STREQUAL
&lt;variable|string&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value is
lexicographi- cally less (or greater, or equal) than the
string or variable on the right.</p>

<p>if(&lt;variable|string&gt; VERSION_LESS
&lt;variable|string&gt;) if(&lt;variable|string&gt;
VERSION_EQUAL &lt;variable|string&gt;)
if(&lt;variable|string&gt; VERSION_GREATER
&lt;variable|string&gt;)</p>

<p>Component-wise integer version number comparison
(version format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).</p>

<p>if(DEFINED &lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the given variable is defined. It does not
matter if the variable is true or false just if it has been
set.</p>

<p>if((expression) AND (expression OR (expression)))</p>

<p>The expressions inside the parenthesis are evaluated
first and then the remaining expression is evaluated as in
the previous examples. Where there are nested parenthesis
the innermost are evaluated as part of evaluating the
expression that contains them.</p>

<p>The if command was written very early in CMakes history,
pre- dating the ${} variable evaluation syntax, and for
convenience evaluates variables named by its arguments as
shown in the above signatures. Note that normal variable
evaluation with ${} applies before the if command even
receives the arguments. Therefore code like</p>

<p>set(var1 OFF) set(var2 &quot;var1&quot;) if(${var2})</p>

<p>appears to the if command as</p>

<p>if(var1)</p>

<p>and is evaluated according to the if(&lt;variable&gt;)
case documented above. The result is OFF which is false.
However, if we remove the ${} from the example then the
command sees</p>

<p>if(var2)</p>

<p>which is true because var2 is defined to
&quot;var1&quot; which is not a false constant.</p>

<p>Automatic evaluation applies in the other cases whenever
the above-documented signature accepts
&lt;variable|string&gt;:</p>

<p>1) The left hand argument to MATCHES is first checked to
see if it is a defined variable, if so the variable s value
is used, otherwise the original value is used.</p>

<p>2) If the left hand argument to MATCHES is missing it
returns false without error</p>

<p>3) Both left and right hand arguments to LESS GREATER
EQUAL are independently tested to see if they are defined
variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the
original value is used.</p>

<p>4) Both left and right hand arguments to STRLESS
STREQUAL STR- GREATER are independently tested to see if
they are defined variables, if so their defined values are
used otherwise the original value is used.</p>

<p>5) Both left and right hand argumemnts to VERSION_LESS
VER- SION_EQUAL VERSION_GREATER are independently tested to
see if they are defined variables, if so their defined
values are used otherwise the original value is used.</p>

<p>6) The right hand argument to NOT is tested to see if it
is a boolean constant, if so the value is used, otherwise it
is assumed to be a variable and it is dereferenced.</p>

<p>7) The left and right hand arguments to AND OR are
independently tested to see if they are boolean constants,
if so they are used as such, otherwise they are assumed to
be variables and are dereferenced.</p>

<p>include Load and run CMake code from a file or
module.</p>

<p>include(&lt;file|module&gt; [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE
&lt;VAR&gt;] [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Load and run CMake code from the file given. Variable
reads and writes access the scope of the caller (dynamic
scoping). If OPTIONAL is present, then no error is raised if
the file does not exist. If RESULT_VARIABLE is given the
variable will be set to the full filename which has been
included or NOTFOUND if it failed.</p>

<p>If a module is specified instead of a file, the file
with name &lt;modulename&gt;.cmake is searched first in
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH, then in the CMake module directory. There
is one exception to this: if the file which calls include()
is located itself in the CMake module directory, then first
the CMake module directory is searched and CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
afterwards. See also policy CMP0017.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for
discussion of the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.</p>

<p>Add the given directories to those the compiler uses to
search for include files. Relative paths are interpreted as
relative to the current source directory.</p>

<p>The include directories are added to the directory
property INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES for the current CMakeLists
file. They are also added to the target property
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES for each target in the current
CMakeLists file. The target property val- ues are the ones
used by the generators.</p>

<p>By default the directories are appended onto the current
list of directories. This default behavior can be changed by
setting CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE to ON. By using
AFTER or BEFORE explicitly, you can select between appending
and prepending, independent of the default.</p>

<p>If the SYSTEM option is given, the compiler will be told
the directories are meant as system include directories on
some platforms (signalling this setting might achieve
effects such as the compiler skipping warnings, or these
fixed-install system files not being considered in
dependency calculations - see com- piler docs).</p>

<p>include_external_msproject Include an external Microsoft
project file in a workspace.</p>

<p>include_external_msproject(projectname location [TYPE
projectTypeGUID] [GUID projectGUID] [PLATFORM platformName]
dep1 dep2 ...)</p>

<p>Includes an external Microsoft project in the generated
workspace file. Currently does nothing on UNIX. This will
cre- ate a target named [projectname]. This can be used in
the add_dependencies command to make things depend on the
external project.</p>

<p>TYPE, GUID and PLATFORM are optional parameters that
allow one to specify the type of project, id (GUID) of the
project and the name of the target platform. This is useful
for projects requiring values other than the default (e.g.
WIX projects). These options are not supported by the Visual
Studio 6 genera- tor.</p>

<p>include_regular_expression Set the regular expression
used for dependency checking.</p>

<p>include_regular_expression(regex_match
[regex_complain])</p>

<p>Set the regular expressions used in dependency checking.
Only files matching regex_match will be traced as
dependencies. Only files matching regex_complain will
generate warnings if they cannot be found (standard header
paths are not searched). The defaults are:</p>

<p>regex_match = &quot;^.*$&quot; (match everything)
regex_complain = &quot;^$&quot; (match empty string
only)</p>

<p>install Specify rules to run at install time.</p>

<p>This command generates installation rules for a project.
Rules specified by calls to this command within a source
directory are executed in order during installation. The
order across direc- tories is not defined.</p>

<p>There are multiple signatures for this command. Some of
them define installation properties for files and targets.
Proper- ties common to multiple signatures are covered here
but they are valid only for signatures that specify
them.</p>

<p>DESTINATION arguments specify the directory on disk to
which a file will be installed. If a full path (with a
leading slash or drive letter) is given it is used directly.
If a relative path is given it is interpreted relative to
the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. The prefix can be
relocated at install time using DESTDIR mechanism explained
in the CMAKE_INSTALL_PRE- FIX variable documentation.</p>

<p>PERMISSIONS arguments specify permissions for installed
files. Valid permissions are OWNER_READ, OWNER_WRITE,
OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_READ, GROUP_WRITE, GROUP_EXECUTE,
WORLD_READ, WORLD_WRITE, WORLD_EXECUTE, SETUID, and SETGID.
Permissions that do not make sense on certain platforms are
ignored on those platforms.</p>

<p>The CONFIGURATIONS argument specifies a list of build
configura- tions for which the install rule applies (Debug,
Release, etc.).</p>

<p>The COMPONENT argument specifies an installation
component name with which the install rule is associated,
such as &quot;runtime&quot; or &quot;development&quot;.
During component-specific installation only install rules
associated with the given component name will be executed.
During a full installation all components are installed. If
COMPONENT is not provided a default component
&quot;Unspecified&quot; is created. The default component
name may be con- trolled with the
CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME variable.</p>

<p>The RENAME argument specifies a name for an installed
file that may be different from the original file. Renaming
is allowed only when a single file is installed by the
command.</p>

<p>The OPTIONAL argument specifies that it is not an error
if the file to be installed does not exist.</p>

<p>The TARGETS signature:</p>

<p>install(TARGETS targets... [EXPORT &lt;export-name&gt;]
[[ARCHIVE|LIBRARY|RUNTIME|FRAMEWORK|BUNDLE|
PRIVATE_HEADER|PUBLIC_HEADER|RESOURCE] [DESTINATION
&lt;dir&gt;] [INCLUDES DESTINATION [&lt;dir&gt; ...]]
[PERMISSIONS permissions...] [CONFIGURATIONS
[Debug|Release|...]] [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
[OPTIONAL] [NAMELINK_ONLY|NAMELINK_SKIP] ] [...])</p>

<p>The TARGETS form specifies rules for installing targets
from a project. There are five kinds of target files that
may be installed: ARCHIVE, LIBRARY, RUNTIME, FRAMEWORK, and
BUNDLE. Executables are treated as RUNTIME targets, except
that those marked with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property are
treated as BUNDLE targets on OS X. Static libraries are
always treated as ARCHIVE targets. Module libraries are
always treated as LIBRARY targets. For non-DLL platforms
shared libraries are treated as LIBRARY targets, except that
those marked with the FRAMEWORK property are treated as
FRAMEWORK targets on OS X. For DLL platforms the DLL part of
a shared library is treated as a RUNTIME target and the
corresponding import library is treated as an ARCHIVE tar-
get. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL
plat- forms. The ARCHIVE, LIBRARY, RUNTIME, and FRAMEWORK
arguments change the type of target to which the subsequent
properties apply. If none is given the installation
properties apply to all target types. If only one is given
then only targets of that type will be installed (which can
be used to install just a DLL or just an import library).The
INCLUDES DESTINATION speci- fies a list of directories which
will be added to the INTER- FACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES of the
&lt;targets&gt; when exported by install(EXPORT). If a
relative path is specified, it is treated as relative to the
$&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt;.</p>

<p>The PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and RESOURCE
arguments cause subsequent properties to be applied to
installing a FRAMEWORK shared library target s associated
files on non-Apple platforms. Rules defined by these
arguments are ignored on Apple platforms because the
associated files are installed into the appropriate
locations inside the framework folder. See documentation of
the PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and RESOURCE target
properties for details.</p>

<p>Either NAMELINK_ONLY or NAMELINK_SKIP may be specified
as a LIBRARY option. On some platforms a versioned shared
library has a symbolic link such as</p>

<p>lib&lt;name&gt;.so -&gt; lib&lt;name&gt;.so.1</p>

<p>where &quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.so.1&quot; is the soname of
the library and &quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.so&quot; is a
&quot;namelink&quot; allowing linkers to find the library
when given &quot;-l&lt;name&gt;&quot;. The NAMELINK_ONLY
option causes installation of only the namelink when a
library target is installed. The NAMELINK_SKIP option causes
installation of library files other than the namelink when a
library target is installed. When neither option is given
both portions are installed. On platforms where versioned
shared libraries do not have namelinks or when a library is
not versioned the NAMELINK_SKIP option installs the library
and the NAMELINK_ONLY option installs nothing. See the
VERSION and SOVERSION target properties for details on
creating versioned shared libraries.</p>

<p>One or more groups of properties may be specified in a
single call to the TARGETS form of this command. A target
may be installed more than once to different locations.
Consider hypo- thetical targets &quot;myExe&quot;,
&quot;mySharedLib&quot;, and &quot;myStaticLib&quot;. The
code</p>

<p>install(TARGETS myExe mySharedLib myStaticLib RUNTIME
DESTINATION bin LIBRARY DESTINATION lib ARCHIVE DESTINATION
lib/static) install(TARGETS mySharedLib DESTINATION
/some/full/path)</p>

<p>will install myExe to &lt;prefix&gt;/bin and myStaticLib
to &lt;pre- fix&gt;/lib/static. On non-DLL platforms
mySharedLib will be installed to &lt;prefix&gt;/lib and
/some/full/path. On DLL platforms the mySharedLib DLL will
be installed to &lt;prefix&gt;/bin and /some/full/path and
its import library will be installed to
&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/static and /some/full/path.</p>

<p>The EXPORT option associates the installed target files
with an export called &lt;export-name&gt;. It must appear
before any RUNTIME, LIBRARY, or ARCHIVE options. To actually
install the export file itself, call install(EXPORT). See
documentation of the install(EXPORT ...) signature below for
details.</p>

<p>Installing a target with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true
has unde- fined behavior.</p>

<p>The FILES signature:</p>

<p>install(FILES files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
[PERMISSIONS permissions...] [CONFIGURATIONS
[Debug|Release|...]] [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;] [RENAME
&lt;name&gt;] [OPTIONAL])</p>

<p>The FILES form specifies rules for installing files for
a project. File names given as relative paths are
interpreted with respect to the current source directory.
Files installed by this form are by default given
permissions OWNER_WRITE, OWNER_READ, GROUP_READ, and
WORLD_READ if no PERMISSIONS argu- ment is given.</p>

<p>The PROGRAMS signature:</p>

<p>install(PROGRAMS files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
[PERMISSIONS permissions...] [CONFIGURATIONS
[Debug|Release|...]] [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;] [RENAME
&lt;name&gt;] [OPTIONAL])</p>

<p>The PROGRAMS form is identical to the FILES form except
that the default permissions for the installed file also
include OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_EXECUTE, and WORLD_EXECUTE.
This form is intended to install programs that are not
targets, such as shell scripts. Use the TARGETS form to
install targets built within the project.</p>

<p>The DIRECTORY signature:</p>

<p>install(DIRECTORY dirs... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
[FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...] [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS
permissions...] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [OPTIONAL]
[CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]] [COMPONENT
&lt;component&gt;] [FILES_MATCHING] [[PATTERN
&lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX &lt;regex&gt;] [EXCLUDE]
[PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])</p>

<p>The DIRECTORY form installs contents of one or more
directories to a given destination. The directory structure
is copied verbatim to the destination. The last component of
each direc- tory name is appended to the destination
directory but a trail- ing slash may be used to avoid this
because it leaves the last component empty. Directory names
given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the
current source directory. If no input directory names are
given the destination directory will be created but nothing
will be installed into it. The FILE_PER- MISSIONS and
DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS options specify permissions given to
files and directories in the destination. If
USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is specified and FILE_PERMISSIONS is
not, file permissions will be copied from the source
directory struc- ture. If no permissions are specified files
will be given the default permissions specified in the FILES
form of the command, and the directories will be given the
default permissions speci- fied in the PROGRAMS form of the
command.</p>

<p>Installation of directories may be controlled with fine
granu- larity using the PATTERN or REGEX options. These
&quot;match&quot; options specify a globbing pattern or
regular expression to match directories or files encountered
within input directories. They may be used to apply certain
options (see below) to a sub- set of the files and
directories encountered. The full path to each input file or
directory (with forward slashes) is matched against the
expression. A PATTERN will match only complete file names:
the portion of the full path matching the pattern must occur
at the end of the file name and be preceded by a slash. A
REGEX will match any portion of the full path but it may use
/ and $ to simulate the PATTERN behavior. By default all
files and directories are installed whether or not they are
matched. The FILES_MATCHING option may be given before the
first match option to disable installation of files (but not
directories) not matched by any expression. For example, the
code</p>

<p>install(DIRECTORY src/ DESTINATION include/myproj
FILES_MATCHING PATTERN &quot;*.h&quot;)</p>

<p>will extract and install header files from a source
tree.</p>

<p>Some options may follow a PATTERN or REGEX expression
and are applied only to files or directories matching them.
The EXCLUDE option will skip the matched file or directory.
The PERMISSIONS option overrides the permissions setting for
the matched file or directory. For example the code</p>

<p>install(DIRECTORY icons scripts/ DESTINATION
share/myproj PATTERN &quot;CVS&quot; EXCLUDE PATTERN
&quot;scripts/*&quot; PERMISSIONS OWNER_EXECUTE OWNER_WRITE
OWNER_READ GROUP_EXECUTE GROUP_READ)</p>

<p>will install the icons directory to share/myproj/icons
and the scripts directory to share/myproj. The icons will
get default file permissions, the scripts will be given
specific permis- sions, and any CVS directories will be
excluded.</p>

<p>The SCRIPT and CODE signature:</p>

<p>install([[SCRIPT &lt;file&gt;] [CODE &lt;code&gt;]]
[...])</p>

<p>The SCRIPT form will invoke the given CMake script files
during installation. If the script file name is a relative
path it will be interpreted with respect to the current
source direc- tory. The CODE form will invoke the given
CMake code during installation. Code is specified as a
single argument inside a double-quoted string. For example,
the code</p>

<p>install(CODE &quot;MESSAGE(</p>

<p>will print a message during installation.</p>

<p>The EXPORT signature:</p>

<p>install(EXPORT &lt;export-name&gt; DESTINATION
&lt;dir&gt; [NAMESPACE &lt;namespace&gt;] [FILE
&lt;name&gt;.cmake] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
[CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
[EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES] [COMPONENT
&lt;component&gt;])</p>

<p>The EXPORT form generates and installs a CMake file
containing code to import targets from the installation tree
into another project. Target installations are associated
with the export &lt;export-name&gt; using the EXPORT option
of the install(TARGETS ...) signature documented above. The
NAMESPACE option will prepend &lt;namespace&gt; to the
target names as they are written to the import file. By
default the generated file will be called
&lt;export-name&gt;.cmake but the FILE option may be used to
specify a different name. The value given to the FILE option
must be a file name with the &quot;.cmake&quot; extension.
If a CONFIGURATIONS option is given then the file will only
be installed when one of the named configurations is
installed. Additionally, the gener- ated import file will
reference only the matching target config- urations. The
EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES keyword, if present, causes
the contents of the properties matching
(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)? to be
exported, when policy CMP0022 is NEW. If a COMPONENT option
is specified that does not match that given to the targets
associated with &lt;export-name&gt; the behavior is
undefined. If a library target is included in the export but
a target to which it links is not included the behavior is
unspecified.</p>

<p>The EXPORT form is useful to help outside projects use
targets built and installed by the current project. For
example, the code</p>

<p>install(TARGETS myexe EXPORT myproj DESTINATION bin)
install(EXPORT myproj NAMESPACE mp_ DESTINATION
lib/myproj)</p>

<p>will install the executable myexe to &lt;prefix&gt;/bin
and code to import it in the file
&quot;&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/myproj/myproj.cmake&quot;. An
outside project may load this file with the include command
and reference the myexe executable from the installation
tree using the imported target name mp_myexe as if the
target were built in its own tree.</p>

<p>NOTE: This command supercedes the INSTALL_TARGETS
command and the target properties PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and
POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT. It also replaces the FILES forms of the
INSTALL_FILES and INSTALL_PROGRAMS commands. The processing
order of these install rules relative to those generated by
INSTALL_TARGETS, INSTALL_FILES, and INSTALL_PROGRAMS
commands is not defined.</p>

<p>link_directories Specify directories in which the linker
will look for libraries.</p>

<p>link_directories(directory1 directory2 ...)</p>

<p>Specify the paths in which the linker should search for
libraries. The command will apply only to targets created
after it is called. Relative paths given to this command are
inter- preted as relative to the current source directory,
see CMP0015.</p>

<p>Note that this command is rarely necessary. Library
locations returned by find_package() and find_library() are
absolute paths. Pass these absolute library file paths
directly to the target_link_libraries() command. CMake will
ensure the linker finds them.</p>

<p>list List operations.</p>

<p>list(LENGTH &lt;list&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
list(GET &lt;list&gt; &lt;element index&gt; [&lt;element
index&gt; ...] &lt;output variable&gt;) list(APPEND
&lt;list&gt; &lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...])
list(FIND &lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;) list(INSERT &lt;list&gt; &lt;element_index&gt;
&lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...]) list(REMOVE_ITEM
&lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; [&lt;value&gt; ...])
list(REMOVE_AT &lt;list&gt; &lt;index&gt; [&lt;index&gt;
...]) list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES &lt;list&gt;) list(REVERSE
&lt;list&gt;) list(SORT &lt;list&gt;)</p>

<p>LENGTH will return a given lists length.</p>

<p>GET will return list of elements specified by indices
from the list.</p>

<p>APPEND will append elements to the list.</p>

<p>FIND will return the index of the element specified in
the list or -1 if it wasnt found.</p>

<p>INSERT will insert elements to the list to the specified
loca- tion.</p>

<p>REMOVE_AT and REMOVE_ITEM will remove items from the
list. The difference is that REMOVE_ITEM will remove the
given items, while REMOVE_AT will remove the items at the
given indices.</p>

<p>REMOVE_DUPLICATES will remove duplicated items in the
list.</p>

<p>REVERSE reverses the contents of the list in-place.</p>

<p>SORT sorts the list in-place alphabetically.</p>

<p>The list subcommands APPEND, INSERT, REMOVE_AT,
REMOVE_ITEM, REMOVE_DUPLICATES, REVERSE and SORT may create
new values for the list within the current CMake variable
scope. Similar to the SET command, the LIST command creates
new variable values in the current scope, even if the list
itself is actually defined in a parent scope. To propagate
the results of these operations upwards, use SET with
PARENT_SCOPE, SET with CACHE INTERNAL, or some other means
of value propagation.</p>

<p>NOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of
strings. To create a list the set command can be used. For
example, set(var a b c d e) creates a list with a;b;c;d;e,
and set(var &quot;a b c d e&quot;) creates a string or a
list with one item in it.</p>

<p>When specifying index values, if &lt;element index&gt;
is 0 or greater, it is indexed from the beginning of the
list, with 0 representing the first list element. If
&lt;element index&gt; is -1 or lesser, it is indexed from
the end of the list, with -1 repre- senting the last list
element. Be careful when counting with negative indices:
they do not start from 0. -0 is equivalent to 0, the first
list element.</p>

<p>load_cache Load in the values from another project s
CMake cache.</p>

<p>load_cache(pathToCacheFile READ_WITH_PREFIX prefix
entry1...)</p>

<p>Read the cache and store the requested entries in
variables with their name prefixed with the given prefix.
This only reads the values, and does not create entries in
the local projects cache.</p>

<p>load_cache(pathToCacheFile [EXCLUDE entry1...]
[INCLUDE_INTERNALS entry1...])</p>

<p>Load in the values from another cache and store them in
the local projects cache as internal entries. This is useful
for a project that depends on another project built in a
different tree. EXCLUDE option can be used to provide a list
of entries to be excluded. INCLUDE_INTERNALS can be used to
provide a list of internal entries to be included. Normally,
no internal entries are brought in. Use of this form of the
command is strongly discouraged, but it is provided for
backward compati- bility.</p>

<p>load_command Load a command into a running CMake.</p>

<p>load_command(COMMAND_NAME &lt;loc1&gt; [loc2 ...])</p>

<p>The given locations are searched for a library whose
name is cmCOMMAND_NAME. If found, it is loaded as a module
and the com- mand is added to the set of available CMake
commands. Usually, TRY_COMPILE is used before this command
to compile the module. If the command is successfully loaded
a variable named</p>

<p>CMAKE_LOADED_COMMAND_&lt;COMMAND_NAME&gt;</p>

<p>will be set to the full path of the module that was
loaded. Otherwise the variable will not be set.</p>

<p>macro Start recording a macro for later invocation as a
command.</p>

<p>macro(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endmacro(&lt;name&gt;)</p>

<p>Define a macro named &lt;name&gt; that takes arguments
named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...). Commands listed after macro, but
before the match- ing endmacro, are not invoked until the
macro is invoked. When it is invoked, the commands recorded
in the macro are first mod- ified by replacing formal
parameters (${arg1}) with the argu- ments passed, and then
invoked as normal commands. In addition to referencing the
formal parameters you can reference the val- ues ${ARGC}
which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the
function as well as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1} ${ARGV2} ... which
will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This
facilitates creating macros with optional arguments. Addi-
tionally ${ARGV} holds the list of all arguments given to
the macro and ${ARGN} holds the list of arguments past the
last expected argument. Note that the parameters to a macro
and val- ues such as ARGN are not variables in the usual
CMake sense. They are string replacements much like the C
preprocessor would do with a macro. If you want true CMake
variables and/or better CMake scope control you should look
at the function command.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the
behavior of policies inside macros.</p>

<p>mark_as_advanced Mark cmake cached variables as
advanced.</p>

<p>mark_as_advanced([CLEAR|FORCE] VAR VAR2 VAR...)</p>

<p>Mark the named cached variables as advanced. An advanced
vari- able will not be displayed in any of the cmake GUIs
unless the show advanced option is on. If CLEAR is the first
argument advanced variables are changed back to unadvanced.
If FORCE is the first argument, then the variable is made
advanced. If nei- ther FORCE nor CLEAR is specified, new
values will be marked as advanced, but if the variable
already has an advanced/non-advanced state, it will not be
changed.</p>

<p>It does nothing in script mode.</p>

<p>math Mathematical expressions.</p>

<p>math(EXPR &lt;output variable&gt; &lt;math
expression&gt;)</p>

<p>EXPR evaluates mathematical expression and returns
result in the output variable. Example mathematical
expression is 5 * ( 10 + 13 ). Supported operators are + - *
/ % | &amp; ^ ~ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; * / %. They have the same
meaning as they do in C code.</p>

<p>message Display a message to the user.</p>


<p>message([STATUS|WARNING|AUTHOR_WARNING|FATAL_ERROR|SEND_ERROR]
&quot;message to display&quot; ...)</p>

<p>The optional keyword determines the type of message:</p>

<p>(none) = Important information STATUS = Incidental
information WARNING = CMake Warning, continue processing
AUTHOR_WARNING = CMake Warning (dev), continue processing
SEND_ERROR = CMake Error, continue processing, but skip
generation FATAL_ERROR = CMake Error, stop processing and
generation</p>

<p>The CMake command-line tool displays STATUS messages on
stdout and all other message types on stderr. The CMake GUI
displays all messages in its log area. The interactive
dialogs (ccmake and CMakeSetup) show STATUS messages one at
a time on a status line and other messages in interactive
pop-up boxes.</p>

<p>CMake Warning and Error message text displays using a
simple markup language. Non-indented text is formatted in
line-wrapped paragraphs delimited by newlines. Indented text
is considered pre-formatted.</p>

<p>option Provides an option that the user can optionally
select.</p>

<p>option(&lt;option_variable&gt; &quot;help string
describing option&quot; [initial value])</p>

<p>Provide an option for the user to select as ON or OFF.
If no initial value is provided, OFF is used.</p>

<p>If you have options that depend on the values of other
options, see the module help for CMakeDependentOption.</p>

<p>project Set a name for the entire project.</p>

<p>project(&lt;projectname&gt; [languageName1 languageName2
... ] )</p>

<p>Sets the name of the project. Additionally this sets the
vari- ables &lt;projectName&gt;_BINARY_DIR and
&lt;projectName&gt;_SOURCE_DIR to the respective values.</p>

<p>Optionally you can specify which languages your project
sup- ports. Example languages are CXX (i.e. C++), C,
Fortran, etc. By default C and CXX are enabled. E.g. if you
do not have a C++ compiler, you can disable the check for it
by explicitly listing the languages you want to support,
e.g. C. By using the special language &quot;NONE&quot; all
checks for any language can be disabled. If a variable
exists called CMAKE_PROJECT_&lt;projectName&gt;_INCLUDE, the
file pointed to by that variable will be included as the
last step of the project command.</p>

<p>The top-level CMakeLists.txt file for a project must
contain a literal, direct call to the project() command;
loading one through the include() command is not sufficient.
If no such call exists CMake will implicitly add one to the
top that enables the default languages (C and CXX).</p>

<p>qt_wrap_cpp Create Qt Wrappers.</p>

<p>qt_wrap_cpp(resultingLibraryName DestName SourceLists
...)</p>

<p>Produce moc files for all the .h files listed in the
SourceLists. The moc files will be added to the library
using the DestName source list.</p>

<p>qt_wrap_ui Create Qt user interfaces Wrappers.</p>

<p>qt_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName HeadersDestName
SourcesDestName SourceLists ...)</p>

<p>Produce .h and .cxx files for all the .ui files listed
in the SourceLists. The .h files will be added to the
library using the HeadersDestNamesource list. The .cxx files
will be added to the library using the SourcesDestNamesource
list.</p>

<p>remove_definitions Removes -D define flags added by
add_definitions.</p>

<p>remove_definitions(-DFOO -DBAR ...)</p>

<p>Removes flags (added by add_definitions) from the
compiler com- mand line for sources in the current directory
and below.</p>

<p>return Return from a file, directory or function.</p>

<p>return()</p>

<p>Returns from a file, directory or function. When this
command is encountered in an included file (via include() or
find_pack- age()), it causes processing of the current file
to stop and control is returned to the including file. If it
is encountered in a file which is not included by another
file, e.g. a CMake- Lists.txt, control is returned to the
parent directory if there is one. If return is called in a
function, control is returned to the caller of the function.
Note that a macro is not a func- tion and does not handle
return like a function does.</p>

<p>separate_arguments Parse space-separated arguments into
a semicolon-separated list.</p>

<p>separate_arguments(&lt;var&gt;
&lt;UNIX|WINDOWS&gt;_COMMAND &quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot;)</p>

<p>Parses a unix- or windows-style command-line string
&quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot; and stores a semicolon-separated
list of the arguments in &lt;var&gt;. The entire command
line must be given in one &quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot;
argument.</p>

<p>The UNIX_COMMAND mode separates arguments by unquoted
whites- pace. It recognizes both single-quote and
double-quote pairs. A backslash escapes the next literal
character ( are no special escapes (is just n).</p>

<p>The WINDOWS_COMMAND mode parses a windows command-line
using the same syntax the runtime library uses to construct
argv at startup. It separates arguments by whitespace that
is not dou- ble-quoted. Backslashes are literal unless they
precede dou- ble-quotes. See the MSDN article &quot;Parsing
C Command-Line Argu- ments&quot; for details.</p>

<p>separate_arguments(VARIABLE)</p>

<p>Convert the value of VARIABLE to a semi-colon separated
list. All spaces are replaced with ;. This helps with
generating command lines.</p>

<p>set Set a CMake, cache or environment variable to a
given value.</p>

<p>set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt; [[CACHE &lt;type&gt;
&lt;docstring&gt; [FORCE]] | PARENT_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Within CMake sets &lt;variable&gt; to the value
&lt;value&gt;. &lt;value&gt; is expanded before
&lt;variable&gt; is set to it. Normally, set will set a
regular CMake variable. If CACHE is present, then the
&lt;vari- able&gt; is put in the cache instead, unless it is
already in the cache. See section Variable types in CMake
below for details of regular and cache variables and their
interactions. If CACHE is used, &lt;type&gt; and
&lt;docstring&gt; are required. &lt;type&gt; is used by the
CMake GUI to choose a widget with which the user sets a
value. The value for &lt;type&gt; may be one of</p>

<p>FILEPATH = File chooser dialog. PATH = Directory chooser
dialog. STRING = Arbitrary string. BOOL = Boolean ON/OFF
checkbox. INTERNAL = No GUI entry (used for persistent
variables).</p>

<p>If &lt;type&gt; is INTERNAL, the cache variable is
marked as internal, and will not be shown to the user in
tools like cmake-gui. This is intended for values that
should be persisted in the cache, but which users should not
normally change. INTERNAL implies FORCE.</p>

<p>Normally, set(...CACHE...) creates cache variables, but
does not modify them. If FORCE is specified, the value of
the cache vari- able is set, even if the variable is already
in the cache. This should normally be avoided, as it will
remove any changes to the cache variables value by the
user.</p>

<p>If PARENT_SCOPE is present, the variable will be set in
the scope above the current scope. Each new directory or
function creates a new scope. This command will set the
value of a vari- able into the parent directory or calling
function (whichever is applicable to the case at hand).
PARENT_SCOPE cannot be combined with CACHE.</p>

<p>If &lt;value&gt; is not specified then the variable is
removed instead of set. See also: the unset() command.</p>

<p>set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value1&gt; ...
&lt;valueN&gt;)</p>

<p>In this case &lt;variable&gt; is set to a semicolon
separated list of values.</p>

<p>&lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such
as:</p>

<p>set( ENV{PATH} /home/martink )</p>

<p>in which case the environment variable will be set.</p>

<p>*** Variable types in CMake ***</p>

<p>In CMake there are two types of variables: normal
variables and cache variables. Normal variables are meant
for the internal use of the script (just like variables in
most programming lan- guages); they are not persisted across
CMake runs. Cache vari- ables (unless set with INTERNAL) are
mostly intended for config- uration settings where the first
CMake run determines a suitable default value, which the
user can then override, by editing the cache with tools such
as ccmake or cmake-gui. Cache variables are stored in the
CMake cache file, and are persisted across CMake runs.</p>

<p>Both types can exist at the same time with the same name
but different values. When ${FOO} is evaluated, CMake first
looks for a normal variable FOO in scope and uses it if set.
If and only if no normal variable exists then it falls back
to the cache variable FOO.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p>The code set(FOO &quot;x&quot;) sets the normal variable
FOO . It does not touch the cache, but it will hide any
existing cache value FOO.</p>

<p>The code set(FOO &quot;x&quot; CACHE ...) checks for FOO
in the cache, ignoring any normal variable of the same name.
If FOO is in the cache then nothing happens to either the
normal variable or the cache variable. If FOO is not in the
cache, then it is added to the cache.</p>

<p>Finally, whenever a cache variable is added or modified
by a command, CMake also *removes* the normal variable of
the same name from the current scope so that an immediately
following evaluation of it will expose the newly cached
value.</p>

<p>Normally projects should avoid using normal and cache
variables of the same name, as this interaction can be hard
to follow. However, in some situations it can be useful. One
example (used by some projects):</p>

<p>A project has a subproject in its source tree. The child
project has its own CMakeLists.txt, which is included from
the parent CMakeLists.txt using add_subdirectory(). Now, if
the parent and the child project provide the same option
(for example a com- piler option), the parent gets the first
chance to add a user-editable option to the cache. Normally,
the child would then use the same value that the parent
uses. However, it may be necessary to hard-code the value
for the child projects option while still allowing the user
to edit the value used by the par- ent project. The parent
project can achieve this simply by set- ting a normal
variable with the same name as the option in a scope
sufficient to hide the option s cache variable from the
child completely. The parent has already set the cache
variable, so the childs set(...CACHE...) will do nothing,
and evaluating the option variable will use the value from
the normal variable, which hides the cache variable.</p>

<p>set_directory_properties Set a property of the
directory.</p>

<p>set_directory_properties(PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2
value2)</p>

<p>Set a property for the current directory and
subdirectories. If the property is not found, CMake will
report an error. The prop- erties include:
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES,
INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, and ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES.
ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES is a list of files that will be
cleaned as a part of &quot;make clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>set_property Set a named property in a given scope.</p>

<p>set_property(&lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY [dir] | TARGET
[target1 [target2 ...]] | SOURCE [src1 [src2 ...]] | TEST
[test1 [test2 ...]] | CACHE [entry1 [entry2 ...]]&gt;
[APPEND] [APPEND_STRING] PROPERTY &lt;name&gt; [value1
[value2 ...]])</p>

<p>Set one property on zero or more objects of a scope. The
first argument determines the scope in which the property is
set. It must be one of the following:</p>

<p>GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but
another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named
by full or relative path.</p>

<p>TARGET scope may name zero or more existing targets.</p>

<p>SOURCE scope may name zero or more source files. Note
that source file properties are visible only to targets
added in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt).</p>

<p>TEST scope may name zero or more existing tests.</p>

<p>CACHE scope must name zero or more cache existing
entries.</p>

<p>The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by
the name of the property to set. Remaining arguments are
used to compose the property value in the form of a
semicolon-separated list. If the APPEND option is given the
list is appended to any exist- ing property value.If the
APPEND_STRING option is given the string is append to any
existing property value as string, i.e. it results in a
longer string and not a list of strings.</p>

<p>set_source_files_properties Source files can have
properties that affect how they are built.</p>

<p>set_source_files_properties([file1 [file2 [...]]]
PROPERTIES prop1 value1 [prop2 value2 [...]])</p>

<p>Set properties associated with source files using a
key/value paired list. See properties documentation for
those known to CMake. Unrecognized properties are ignored.
Source file prop- erties are visible only to targets added
in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt).</p>

<p>set_target_properties Targets can have properties that
affect how they are built.</p>

<p>set_target_properties(target1 target2 ... PROPERTIES
prop1 value1 prop2 value2 ...)</p>

<p>Set properties on a target. The syntax for the command
is to list all the files you want to change, and then
provide the val- ues you want to set next. You can use any
prop value pair you want and extract it later with the
GET_TARGET_PROPERTY command.</p>

<p>Properties that affect the name of a targets output file
are as follows. The PREFIX and SUFFIX properties override
the default target name prefix (such as &quot;lib&quot;) and
suffix (such as &quot;.so&quot;). IMPORT_PREFIX and
IMPORT_SUFFIX are the equivalent properties for the import
library corresponding to a DLL (for SHARED library targets).
OUTPUT_NAME sets the real name of a target when it is built
and can be used to help create two targets of the same name
even though CMake requires unique logical target names.
There is also a &lt;CONFIG&gt;_OUTPUT_NAME that can set the
output name on a per-configuration basis.
&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX sets a postfix for the real name of
the target when it is built under the configuration named by
&lt;CONFIG&gt; (in upper-case, such as
&quot;DEBUG_POSTFIX&quot;). The value of this property is
initialized when the target is created to the value of the
variable CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX (except for executable
targets because earlier CMake versions which did not use
this variable for exe- cutables).</p>

<p>The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags
to the link step of a target. LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; will
add to the con- figuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;, for example,
DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO. DEFINE_SYMBOL
sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when
compiling sources in a shared library. If not set here then
it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with some
substitutions if the target is not a valid C identifier).
This is useful for headers to know whether they are being
included from inside their library or outside to properly
setup dllexport/dllimport decorations. The COMPILE_FLAGS
property sets additional compiler flags used to build
sources within the tar- get. It may also be used to pass
additional preprocessor defi- nitions.</p>

<p>The LINKER_LANGUAGE property is used to change the tool
used to link an executable or shared library. The default is
set the language to match the files in the library. CXX and
C are common values for this property.</p>

<p>For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used
to spec- ify the build version and API version respectively.
When build- ing or installing appropriate symlinks are
created if the platform supports symlinks and the linker
supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the
missing is assumed to have the same version number. For
executables VERSION can be used to specify the build
version. When building or installing appropri- ate symlinks
are created if the platform supports symlinks. For shared
libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute
is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot; version
number. These numbers are used as the image version of the
binary.</p>

<p>There are a few properties used to specify RPATH rules.
INSTALL_RPATH is a semicolon-separated list specifying the
rpath to use in installed targets (for platforms that
support it). INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that
if set to true will append directories in the linker search
path and outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH.
SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip
automatic generation of an rpath allowing the target to run
from the build tree. BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean
specifying whether to link the target in the build tree with
the INSTALL_RPATH. This takes precedence over
SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relink- ing before
installation. INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specify- ing the
directory portion of the &quot;install_name&quot; field of
shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in the installed targets.
When the target is created the values of the variables
CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH, CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH,
CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH, CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH, and
CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR are used to initialize these
properties.</p>

<p>PROJECT_LABEL can be used to change the name of the
target in an IDE like visual studio. VS_KEYWORD can be set
to change the visual studio keyword, for example Qt
integration works better if this is set to Qt4VSv1.0.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME, VS_SCC_LOCALPATH, VS_SCC_PROVIDER
and VS_SCC_AUXPATH can be set to add support for source
control bindings in a Visual Studio project file.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_&lt;variable&gt; can be set to add a Visual
Studio project-specific global variable. Qt integration
works better if VS_GLOBAL_QtVersion is set to the Qt version
FindQt4.cmake found. For example, &quot;4.7.3&quot;</p>

<p>The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run
before and after installing a target. They are used only
when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the
target. Use the INSTALL command instead.</p>

<p>The EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD property is used by the
visual studio generators. If it is set to 1 the target will
not be part of the default build when you select &quot;Build
Solution&quot;. This can also be set on a per-configuration
basis using EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_&lt;CONFIG&gt;.</p>

<p>set_tests_properties Set a property of the tests.</p>

<p>set_tests_properties(test1 [test2...] PROPERTIES prop1
value1 prop2 value2)</p>

<p>Set a property for the tests. If the property is not
found, CMake will report an error. The properties
include:</p>

<p>WILL_FAIL: If set to true, this will invert the
pass/fail flag of the test.</p>

<p>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION: If set, the test output will be
checked against the specified regular expressions and at
least one of the regular expressions has to match, otherwise
the test will fail.</p>

<p>Example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION &quot;TestPassed;All
ok&quot;</p>

<p>FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION: If set, if the output will
match to one of specified regular expressions, the test will
fail.</p>

<p>Example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
&quot;[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed&quot;</p>

<p>Both PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION and FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
expect a list of regular expressions.</p>

<p>TIMEOUT: Setting this will limit the test runtime to the
number of seconds specified.</p>

<p>site_name Set the given variable to the name of the
computer.</p>

<p>site_name(variable)</p>

<p>source_group Define a grouping for sources in the
makefile.</p>

<p>source_group(name [REGULAR_EXPRESSION regex] [FILES src1
src2 ...])</p>

<p>Defines a group into which sources will be placed in
project files. This is mainly used to setup file tabs in
Visual Studio. Any file whose name is listed or matches the
regular expression will be placed in this group. If a file
matches multiple groups, the LAST group that explicitly
lists the file will be favored, if any. If no group
explicitly lists the file, the LAST group whose regular
expression matches the file will be favored.</p>

<p>The name of the group may contain backslashes to specify
sub- groups:</p>

<p>source_group(outer\inner ...)</p>

<p>For backwards compatibility, this command also supports
the for- mat:</p>

<p>source_group(name regex)</p>

<p>string String operations.</p>

<p>string(REGEX MATCH &lt;regular_expression&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt; &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...]) string(REGEX
MATCHALL &lt;regular_expression&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;

string(FIND &lt;string&gt; &lt;substring&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt; [REVERSE]) string(TIMESTAMP &lt;output
variable&gt; [&lt;format string&gt;] [UTC])
string(MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER &lt;input string&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;)</p>

<p>REGEX MATCH will match the regular expression once and
store the match in the output variable.</p>

<p>REGEX MATCHALL will match the regular expression as many
times as possible and store the matches in the output
variable as a list.</p>

<p>REGEX REPLACE will match the regular expression as many
times as possible and substitute the replacement expression
for the match in the output. The replace expression may
refer to paren-delim- ited subexpressions of the match using
1, 2, ..., 9. Note that two backslashes (\1) are required in
CMake code to get a backslash through argument parsing.</p>

<p>REPLACE will replace all occurrences of match_string in
the input with replace_string and store the result in the
output.</p>

<p>MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will
compute a cryptographic hash of the input string.</p>

<p>COMPARE EQUAL/NOTEQUAL/LESS/GREATER will compare the
strings and store true or false in the output variable.</p>

<p>ASCII will convert all numbers into corresponding ASCII
charac- ters.</p>

<p>CONFIGURE will transform a string like CONFIGURE_FILE
transforms a file.</p>

<p>TOUPPER/TOLOWER will convert string to upper/lower
characters.</p>

<p>LENGTH will return a given strings length.</p>

<p>SUBSTRING will return a substring of a given string. If
length is -1 the remainder of the string starting at begin
will be returned.</p>

<p>STRIP will return a substring of a given string with
leading and trailing spaces removed.</p>

<p>RANDOM will return a random string of given length
consisting of characters from the given alphabet. Default
length is 5 charac- ters and default alphabet is all numbers
and upper and lower case letters. If an integer RANDOM_SEED
is given, its value will be used to seed the random number
generator.</p>

<p>FIND will return the position where the given substring
was found in the supplied string. If the REVERSE flag was
used, the command will search for the position of the last
occurrence of the specified substring.</p>

<p>The following characters have special meaning in regular
expres- sions:</p>

<p>^ Matches at beginning of input $ Matches at end of
input . Matches any single character [ ] Matches any
character(s) inside the brackets [^ ] Matches any
character(s) not inside the brackets - Inside brackets,
specifies an inclusive range between characters on either
side e.g. [a-f] is [abcdef] To match a literal - using
brackets, make it the first or the last character e.g.
[+*/-] matches basic mathematical operators. * Matches
preceding pattern zero or more times + Matches preceding
pattern one or more times ? Matches preceding pattern zero
or once only | Matches a pattern on either side of the | ()
Saves a matched subexpression, which can be referenced in
the REGEX REPLACE operation. Additionally it is saved by all
regular expression-related commands, including e.g. if(
MATCHES ), in the variables CMAKE_MATCH_(0..9).</p>

<p>*, + and ? have higher precedence than concatenation. |
has lower precedence than concatenation. This means that the
regular expression &quot;^ab+d$&quot; matches
&quot;abbd&quot; but not &quot;ababd&quot;, and the reg-
ular expression &quot;^(ab|cd)$&quot; matches &quot;ab&quot;
but not &quot;abd&quot;.</p>

<p>TIMESTAMP will write a string representation of the
current date and/or time to the output variable.</p>

<p>Should the command be unable to obtain a timestamp the
output variable will be set to the empty string
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>The optional UTC flag requests the current date/time
representa- tion to be in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
rather than local time.</p>

<p>The optional &lt;format string&gt; may contain the
following format specifiers:</p>

<p>%d The day of the current month (01-31). %H The hour on
a 24-hour clock (00-23). %I The hour on a 12-hour clock
(01-12). %j The day of the current year (001-366). %m The
month of the current year (01-12). %M The minute of the
current hour (00-59). %S The second of the current minute.
60 represents a leap second. (00-60) %U The week number of
the current year (00-53). %w The day of the current week. 0
is Sunday. (0-6) %y The last two digits of the current year
(00-99) %Y The current year.</p>

<p>Unknown format specifiers will be ignored and copied to
the out- put as-is.</p>

<p>If no explicit &lt;format string&gt; is given it will
default to:</p>

<p>%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S for local time. %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ for
UTC.</p>

<p>MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER will write a string which can be used
as an identifier in C.</p>

<p>target_compile_definitions Add compile definitions to a
target.</p>

<p>target_compile_definitions(&lt;target&gt;
&lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [items1...]
[&lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [items2...] ...])</p>

<p>Specify compile definitions to use when compiling a
given tar- get. The named &lt;target&gt; must have been
created by a command such as add_executable or add_library
and must not be an IMPORTED target. The INTERFACE, PUBLIC
and PRIVATE keywords are required to specify the scope of
the following arguments. PRI- VATE and PUBLIC items will
populate the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property of &lt;target&gt;.
PUBLIC and INTERFACE items will populate the
INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property of &lt;target&gt;.
The following arguments specify compile definitions.
Repeated calls for the same &lt;target&gt; append items in
the order called.</p>

<p>Arguments to target_compile_definitions may use
&quot;generator expressions&quot; with the syntax
&quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;. Generator expressions are
evaluated during build system generation to produce informa-
tion specific to each build configuration. Valid expressions
are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0
$&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt; = configuration name
$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1, else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0 , else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>target_compile_options Add compile options to a
target.</p>

<p>target_compile_options(&lt;target&gt; [BEFORE]
&lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [items1...]
[&lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [items2...] ...])</p>

<p>Specify compile options to use when compiling a given
target. The named &lt;target&gt; must have been created by a
command such as add_executable or add_library and must not
be an IMPORTED tar- get. If BEFORE is specified, the content
will be prepended to the property instead of being

<p>The INTERFACE, PUBLIC and PRIVATE keywords are required

of &lt;target&gt;. PUBLIC and INTERFACE items will populate
the INTERFACE_COM- PILE_OPTIONS property of &lt;target&gt;.
The following arguments specify compile opitions. Repeated

expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a

the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX

$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW

not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install

<p>target_include_directories(&lt;target&gt; [SYSTEM]
[BEFORE] &lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [items1...]
[&lt;INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE&gt; [items2...] ...])</p>

<p>Specify include directories or targets to use when
compiling a given target. The named &lt;target&gt; must have
been created by a command such as add_executable or
add_library and must not be an IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>If BEFORE is specified, the content will be prepended to
the property instead of being appended.</p>

<p>The INTERFACE, PUBLIC and PRIVATE keywords are required
to spec- ify the scope of the following arguments. PRIVATE
and PUBLIC items will populate the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
property of &lt;tar- get&gt;. PUBLIC and INTERFACE items
will populate the INTER- FACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES property
of &lt;target&gt;. The following arguments specify include
directories. Specified include direc- tories may be absolute
paths or relative paths. Repeated calls for the same
&lt;target&gt; append items in the order called.If SYSTEM is
specified, the compiler will be told the directories are
meant as system include directories on some platforms (sig-
nalling this setting might achieve effects such as the
compiler skipping warnings, or these fixed-install system
files not being considered in dependency calculations - see
compiler docs). If SYSTEM is used together with PUBLIC or
INTERFACE, the INTER- FACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES target
property will be popu- lated with the specified
directories.</p>

<p>Arguments to target_include_directories may use
&quot;generator expressions&quot; with the syntax
&quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;. Generator expressions are
evaluated during build system generation to produce informa-

.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>target_link_libraries Link a target to given
libraries.</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; [item1 [item2
[...]]] [[debug|optimized|general] &lt;item&gt;] ...)</p>

<p>Specify libraries or flags to use when linking a given
target. The named &lt;target&gt; must have been created in
the current direc- tory by a command such as add_executable
or add_library. The remaining arguments specify library
names or flags. Repeated calls for the same &lt;target&gt;
append items in the order called.</p>

<p>If a library name matches that of another target in the
project a dependency will automatically be added in the
build system to make sure the library being linked is
up-to-date before the tar- get links. Item names starting
with -, but not -l or -framework, are treated as linker
flags.</p>

<p>A &quot;debug&quot;, &quot;optimized&quot;, or
&quot;general&quot; keyword indicates that the library
immediately following it is to be used only for the cor-
responding build configuration. The &quot;debug&quot;
keyword corresponds to the Debug configuration (or to
configurations named in the DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global
property if it is set). The &quot;opti- mized&quot; keyword
corresponds to all other configurations. The
&quot;general&quot; keyword corresponds to all
configurations, and is purely optional (assumed if omitted).
Higher granularity may be achieved for per-configuration
rules by creating and linking to IMPORTED library targets.
See the IMPORTED mode of the add_library command for more
information.</p>

<p>Library dependencies are transitive by default with this
signa- ture. When this target is linked into another target
then the libraries linked to this target will appear on the
link line for the other target too. This transitive
&quot;link interface&quot; is stored in the
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES target property when pol- icy
CMP0022 is set to NEW and may be overridden by setting the
property directly. (When CMP0022 is not set to NEW,
transitive linking is builtin but may be overridden by the
LINK_INTER- FACE_LIBRARIES property. Calls to other
signatures of this com- mand may set the property making any
libraries linked exclu- sively by this signature
private.)</p>

<p>CMake will also propagate &quot;usage requirements&quot;
from linked library targets. Usage requirements affect
compilation of sources in the &lt;target&gt;. They are
specified by properties defined on linked targets. During
generation of the build sys- tem, CMake integrates usage
requirement property values with the corresponding build
properties for &lt;target&gt;:</p>

<p>INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITONS: Appends to
COMPILE_DEFINITONS INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES: Appends to
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE:
Sets POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE or checked for consistency
with existing value</p>

<p>If an &lt;item&gt; is a library in a Mac OX framework,
the Headers directory of the framework will also be
processed as a &quot;usage requirement&quot;. This has the
same effect as passing the framework directory as an include
directory. target_link_libraries(&lt;tar- get&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE&gt; &lt;lib&gt; ...
[&lt;PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE&gt; &lt;lib&gt; ... ]
...])</p>

<p>The PUBLIC, PRIVATE and INTERFACE keywords can be used
to spec- ify both the link dependencies and the link
interface in one command. Libraries and targets following
PUBLIC are linked to, and are made part of the link
interface. Libraries and targets following PRIVATE are
linked to, but are not made part of the link interface.
Libraries following INTERFACE are appended to the link
interface and are not used for linking &lt;target&gt;.</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt;
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES [[debug|optimized|general]
&lt;lib&gt;] ...)</p>

<p>The LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES mode appends the libraries
to the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES target property instead of
using them for linking. If policy CMP0022 is not NEW, then
this mode also appends libraries to the
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES and its per-configuration
equivalent. This signature is for compatibil- ity only.
Prefer the INTERFACE mode instead. Libraries speci- fied as
&quot;debug&quot; are wrapped in a generator expression to
corre- spond to debug builds. If policy CMP0022 is not NEW,
the libraries are also appended to the LINK_INTER-
FACE_LIBRARIES_DEBUG property (or to the properties
correspond- ing to configurations listed in the
DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global property if it is set).
Libraries specified as &quot;optimized&quot; are appended to
the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property. If policy CMP0022 is
not NEW, they are also appended to the LINK_INTER-
FACE_LIBRARIES property. Libraries specified as
&quot;general&quot; (or without any keyword) are treated as
if specified for both &quot;debug&quot; and
&quot;optimized&quot;.</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt;
&lt;LINK_PRIVATE|LINK_PUBLIC&gt; [[debug|optimized|general]
&lt;lib&gt;] ... [&lt;LINK_PRIVATE|LINK_PUBLIC&gt;
[[debug|optimized|general] &lt;lib&gt;] ...])</p>

<p>The LINK_PUBLIC and LINK_PRIVATE modes can be used to
specify both the link dependencies and the link interface in
one com- mand. This signature is for compatibility only.
Prefer the PUB- LIC or PRIVATE keywords instead. Libraries
and targets follow- ing LINK_PUBLIC are linked to, and are
made part of the INTER- FACE_LINK_LIBRARIES. If policy
CMP0022 is not NEW, they are also made part of the
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES. Libraries and targets following
LINK_PRIVATE are linked to, but are not made part of the
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES (or LINK_INTER-
FACE_LIBRARIES).</p>

<p>The library dependency graph is normally acyclic (a
DAG), but in the case of mutually-dependent STATIC libraries
CMake allows the graph to contain cycles (strongly connected
components). When another target links to one of the
libraries CMake repeats the entire connected component. For
example, the code</p>

<p>add_library(A STATIC a.c) add_library(B STATIC b.c)
target_link_libraries(A B) target_link_libraries(B A)
add_executable(main main.c) target_link_libraries(main
A)</p>

<p>links main to A B A B. (While one repetition is usually
sufficient, pathological object file and symbol arrangements
can require more. One may handle such cases by manually
repeating the component in the last target_link_libraries
call. However, if two archives are really so interdependent
they should proba- bly be combined into a single
archive.)</p>

<p>Arguments to target_link_libraries may use
&quot;generator expres- sions&quot; with the syntax
&quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;. Note however, that generator
expressions will not be used in OLD handling of CMP0003 or
CMP0004.</p>

<p>Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
genera- tion to produce information specific to each build
configura- tion. Valid expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0

$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1, else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0 , else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>try_compile Try building some code.</p>

<p>try_compile(RESULT_VAR &lt;bindir&gt; &lt;srcdir&gt;
&lt;projectName&gt; [targetName] [CMAKE_FLAGS flags...]
[OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;var&gt;])</p>

<p>Try building a project. In this form, srcdir should
contain a complete CMake project with a CMakeLists.txt file
and all sources. The bindir and srcdir will not be deleted
after this command is run. Specify targetName to build a
specific target instead of the all or ALL_BUILD target.</p>

<p>try_compile(RESULT_VAR &lt;bindir&gt;
&lt;srcfile|SOURCES srcfile...&gt; [CMAKE_FLAGS flags...]
[COMPILE_DEFINITIONS flags...] [LINK_LIBRARIES libs...]
[OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;var&gt;] [COPY_FILE &lt;fileName&gt;
[COPY_FILE_ERROR &lt;var&gt;]])</p>

<p>Try building an executable from one or more source
files. In this form the user need only supply one or more
source files that include a definition for main . CMake will
create a CMakeLists.txt file to build the source(s) as an
executable. Specify COPY_FILE to get a copy of the linked
executable at the given fileName and optionally
COPY_FILE_ERROR to capture any error.</p>

<p>In this version all files in bindir/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp
will be cleaned automatically. For debugging,
--debug-trycompile can be passed to cmake to avoid this
clean. However, multiple sequen- tial try_compile operations
reuse this single output directory. If you use
--debug-trycompile, you can only debug one try_com- pile
call at a time. The recommended procedure is to configure
with cmake all the way through once, then delete the cache
entry associated with the try_compile call of interest, and
then re-run cmake again with --debug-trycompile.</p>

<p>Some extra flags that can be included are,
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES, and LINK_LIBRARIES.
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS are -Ddefinition that will be passed to
the compile line.</p>

<p>The srcfile signature also accepts a LINK_LIBRARIES
argument which may contain a list of libraries or IMPORTED
targets which will be linked to in the generated project. If
LINK_LIBRARIES is specified as a parameter to try_compile,
then any LINK_LIBRARIES passed as CMAKE_FLAGS will be
ignored.</p>

<p>try_compile creates a CMakeList.txt file on the fly that
looks like this:</p>

<p>add_definitions( &lt;expanded COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from
calling cmake&gt;)
include_directories(${INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES})
link_directories(${LINK_DIRECTORIES})
add_executable(cmTryCompileExec sources)
target_link_libraries(cmTryCompileExec
${LINK_LIBRARIES})</p>

<p>In both versions of the command, if OUTPUT_VARIABLE is
speci- fied, then the output from the build process is
stored in the given variable. The success or failure of the
try_compile, i.e. TRUE or FALSE respectively, is returned in
RESULT_VAR. CMAKE_FLAGS can be used to pass -DVAR:TYPE=VALUE
flags to the cmake that is run during the build. Set
variable CMAKE_TRY_COM- PILE_CONFIGURATION to choose a build
configuration.</p>

<p>try_run Try compiling and then running some code.</p>

<p>try_run(RUN_RESULT_VAR COMPILE_RESULT_VAR bindir srcfile
[CMAKE_FLAGS &lt;Flags&gt;] [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
&lt;flags&gt;] [COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE comp]
[RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE run] [OUTPUT_VARIABLE var] [ARGS
&lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg2&gt;...])</p>

<p>Try compiling a srcfile. Return TRUE or FALSE for
success or failure in COMPILE_RESULT_VAR. Then if the
compile succeeded, run the executable and return its exit
code in RUN_RESULT_VAR. If the executable was built, but
failed to run, then RUN_RESULT_VAR will be set to
FAILED_TO_RUN. COMPILE_OUT- PUT_VARIABLE specifies the
variable where the output from the compile step goes.
RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies the variable where the output
from the running executable goes.</p>

<p>For compatibility reasons OUTPUT_VARIABLE is still
supported, which gives you the output from the compile and
run step com- bined.</p>

<p>Cross compiling issues</p>

<p>When cross compiling, the executable compiled in the
first step usually cannot be run on the build host.
try_run() checks the CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING variable to detect
whether CMake is in crosscompiling mode. If that s the case,
it will still try to compile the executable, but it will not
try to run the exe- cutable. Instead it will create cache
variables which must be filled by the user or by presetting
them in some CMake script file to the values the executable
would have produced if it had been run on its actual target
platform. These variables are RUN_RESULT_VAR (explanation
see above) and if RUN_OUTPUT_VARI- ABLE (or OUTPUT_VARIABLE)
was used, an additional cache variable
RUN_RESULT_VAR__COMPILE_RESULT_VAR__TRYRUN_OUTPUT.This is
intended to hold stdout and stderr from the executable.</p>

<p>In order to make cross compiling your project easier,
use try_run only if really required. If you use try_run, use
RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE (or OUTPUT_VARIABLE) only if really
required. Using them will require that when crosscompiling,
the cache variables will have to be set manually to the
output of the executable. You can also &quot;guard&quot; the
calls to try_run with if(CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING) and provide
an easy-to-preset alterna- tive for this case.</p>

<p>Set variable CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION to choose a
build configuration.</p>

<p>unset Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment
variable.</p>

<p>unset(&lt;variable&gt; [CACHE])</p>

<p>Removes the specified variable causing it to become
undefined. If CACHE is present then the variable is removed
from the cache instead of the current scope.</p>

<p>&lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such
as:</p>

<p>unset(ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH})</p>

<p>in which case the variable will be removed from the
current environment.</p>

<p>variable_watch Watch the CMake variable for change.</p>

<p>variable_watch(&lt;variable name&gt; [&lt;command to
execute&gt;])</p>

<p>If the specified variable changes, the message will be
printed about the variable being changed. If the command is
specified, the command will be executed. The command will
receive the fol- lowing arguments: COMMAND(&lt;variable&gt;
&lt;access&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;current list file&gt;
&lt;stack&gt;)</p>

<p>while Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is
true</p>

<p>while(condition) COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
... endwhile(condition)</p>

<p>All commands between while and the matching endwhile are
recorded without being invoked. Once the endwhile is
evaluated, the recorded list of commands is invoked as long
as the condi- tion is true. The condition is evaluated using
the same logic as the if command.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES CMake Properties - Properties supported by
CMake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for the properties supported
by CMake. Prop- erties can have different scopes. They can
either be assigned to a source file, a directory, a target
or globally to CMake. By modifying the values of properties
the behaviour of the build system can be cus- tomized.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES OF GLOBAL SCOPE
ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS Allow duplicate custom
targets to be created.</p>

<p>Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a
project have globally unique logical names (see policy
CMP0002). This is necessary to generate meaningful project
file names in Xcode and VS IDE generators. It also allows
the target names to be refer- enced unambiguously.</p>

<p>Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate
custom target names. For projects that care only about
Makefile gener- ators and do not wish to support Xcode or VS
IDE generators, one may set this property to true to allow
duplicate custom targets. The property allows multiple
add_custom_target command calls in different directories to
specify the same target name. However, setting this property
will cause non-Makefile generators to pro- duce an error and
refuse to generate the project.</p>

<p>AUTOMOC_TARGETS_FOLDER Name of FOLDER for *_automoc
targets that are added automati- cally by CMake for targets
for which AUTOMOC is enabled.</p>

<p>If not set, CMake uses the FOLDER property of the parent
target as a default value for this property. See also the
documentation for the FOLDER target property and the AUTOMOC
target property.</p>

<p>DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS Specify which configurations are
for debugging.</p>

<p>The value must be a semi-colon separated list of
configuration names. Currently this property is used only by
the tar- get_link_libraries command (see its documentation
for details). Additional uses may be defined in the
future.</p>

<p>This property must be set at the top level of the
project and before the first target_link_libraries command
invocation. If any entry in the list does not match a valid
configuration for the project the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>DISABLED_FEATURES List of features which are disabled
during the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of features which are disabled during the CMake
run. By default it contains the names of all packages which
were not found. This is determined using the
&lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables. Packages which are searched
QUIET are not listed. A project can add its own features to
this list. This property is used by the macros in
FeatureSummary.cmake.</p>

<p>ENABLED_FEATURES List of features which are enabled
during the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.
By default it contains the names of all packages which were
found. This is determined using the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND
variables. Packages which are searched QUIET are not listed.
A project can add its own features to this list. This
property is used by the macros in FeatureSummary.cmake.</p>

<p>ENABLED_LANGUAGES Read-only property that contains the
list of currently enabled languages</p>

<p>Set to list of currently enabled languages.</p>

<p>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS Whether FIND_LIBRARY should
automatically search lib64 directo- ries.</p>

<p>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is a boolean specifying
whether the FIND_LIBRARY command should automatically search
the lib64 vari- ant of directories called lib in the search
path when building 64-bit binaries.</p>

<p>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_OPENBSD_VERSIONING Whether FIND_LIBRARY
should find OpenBSD-style shared libraries.</p>

<p>This property is a boolean specifying whether the
FIND_LIBRARY command should find shared libraries with
OpenBSD-style ver- sioned extension:
&quot;.so.&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;&quot;. The property is
set to true on OpenBSD and false on other platforms.</p>

<p>GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE Enable global target
dependency graph debug mode.</p>

<p>CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target
dependency graph at the beginning of native build system
generation. This property causes it to display details of
its analysis to stderr.</p>

<p>GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES Disallow global target
dependency graph cycles.</p>

<p>CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target
dependency graph at the beginning of native build system
generation. It reports an error if the dependency graph
contains a cycle that does not consist of all STATIC library
targets. This property tells CMake to disallow all cycles
completely, even among static libraries.</p>

<p>IN_TRY_COMPILE Read-only property that is true during a
try-compile configura- tion.</p>

<p>True when building a project inside a TRY_COMPILE or
TRY_RUN command.</p>

<p>PACKAGES_FOUND List of packages which were found during
the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of packages which were found during the CMake run.
Whether a package has been found is determined using the
&lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.</p>

<p>PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND List of packages which were not found
during the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of packages which were not found during the CMake
run. Whether a package has been found is determined using
the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.</p>

<p>PREDEFINED_TARGETS_FOLDER Name of FOLDER for targets
that are added automatically by CMake.</p>

<p>If not set, CMake uses
&quot;CMakePredefinedTargets&quot; as a default value for
this property. Targets such as INSTALL, PACKAGE and
RUN_TESTS will be organized into this FOLDER. See also the
docu- mentation for the FOLDER target property.</p>

<p>REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES If set, report any undefined
properties to this file.</p>

<p>If this property is set to a filename then when CMake
runs it will report any properties or variables that were
accessed but not defined into the filename specified in this
property.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE Specify a launcher for compile
rules.</p>

<p>Makefile generators prefix compiler commands with the
given launcher command line. This is intended to allow
launchers to intercept build problems with high granularity.
Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM Specify a launcher for custom
rules.</p>

<p>Makefile generators prefix custom commands with the
given launcher command line. This is intended to allow
launchers to intercept build problems with high granularity.
Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_LINK Specify a launcher for link rules.</p>

<p>Makefile generators prefix link and archive commands
with the given launcher command line. This is intended to
allow launch- ers to intercept build problems with high
granularity. Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this
property.</p>

<p>RULE_MESSAGES Specify whether to report a message for
each make rule.</p>

<p>This property specifies whether Makefile generators
should add a progress message describing what each build
rule does. If the property is not set the default is ON. Set
the property to OFF to disable granular messages and report
only as each target com- pletes. This is intended to allow
scripted builds to avoid the build time cost of detailed
reports. If a CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES cache entry exists its
value initializes the value of this prop- erty. Non-Makefile
generators currently ignore this property.</p>

<p>TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS Set if shared
libraries may be named like archives.</p>

<p>On AIX shared libraries may be named
&quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.a&quot;. This property is set to true
on such platforms.</p>

<p>TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS Does the target platform
support shared libraries.</p>

<p>TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean specifying
whether the target platform supports shared libraries.
Basically all current general general purpose OS do so, the
exception are usually embedded systems with no or special
OSs.</p>

<p>USE_FOLDERS Use the FOLDER target property to organize
targets into folders.</p>

<p>If not set, CMake treats this property as OFF by
default. CMake generators that are capable of organizing
into a hierarchy of folders use the values of the FOLDER
target property to name those folders. See also the
documentation for the FOLDER target property.</p>

<p>__CMAKE_DELETE_CACHE_CHANGE_VARS_ Internal property</p>

<p>Used to detect compiler changes, Do not set.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON DIRECTORIES ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
Additional files to clean during the make clean stage.</p>

<p>A list of files that will be cleaned as a part of the
&quot;make clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>CACHE_VARIABLES List of cache variables available in the
current directory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of CMake
cache vari- ables currently defined. It is intended for
debugging purposes.</p>

<p>CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM Should the output of custom commands be
left.</p>

<p>If this is true then the outputs of custom commands for
this directory will not be removed during the &quot;make
clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS Preprocessor definitions for
compiling a directorys sources.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a
semicolon-sepa- rated list of preprocessor definitions using
the syntax VAR or VAR=value. Function-style definitions are
not supported. CMake will automatically escape the value
correctly for the native build system (note that CMake
language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).
This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using
the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CON- FIG&gt; where
&lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex.
&quot;COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS_DEBUG&quot;). This property will
be initialized in each direc- tory by its value in the
directorys parent.</p>

<p>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are
not sup- ported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does
not support definition values with spaces (but NMake
does).</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support
for escap- ing certain values. CMake has work-arounds for
many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass
correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly,
do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape
sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header
file. Then report the limitation. Known limitations
include:</p>

<p># - broken almost everywhere ; - broken in VS IDE 7.0
and Borland Makefiles , - broken in VS IDE % - broken in
some cases in NMake &amp; | - broken in some cases on MinGW
^ &lt; &gt;</p>

<p>CMake does not reject these values outright because they
do work in some cases. Use with caution.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
preprocessor definitions in a directory.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS. This property will be initialized in
each directory by its value in the directorys parent.</p>

<p>COMPILE_OPTIONS List of options to pass to the
compiler.</p>

<p>This property specifies the list of directories given so
far for this property. This property exists on directories
and targets.</p>

<p>The target property values are used by the generators to
set the options for the compiler.</p>

<p>Contents of COMPILE_OPTIONS may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0
$&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt; = configuration name
$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1 , else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0, else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>DEFINITIONS For CMake 2.4 compatibility only. Use
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS instead.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of flags
given so far to the add_definitions command. It is intended
for debugging purposes. Use the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
instead.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL Exclude the directory from the all
target of its parent.</p>

<p>A property on a directory that indicates if its targets
are excluded from the default build target. If it is not,
then with a Makefile for example typing make will cause the
targets to be built. The same concept applies to the default
build of other generators.</p>

<p>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM Specify #include line
transforms for dependencies in a direc- tory.</p>

<p>This property specifies rules to transform macro-like
#include lines during implicit dependency scanning of C and
C++ source files. The list of rules must be
semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
&quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the % must be lit-
eral). During dependency scanning occurrences of
A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be replaced by the value
given with the macro argument substituted for %. For
example, the entry</p>

<p>MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;</p>

<p>will convert lines of the form</p>

<p>#include MYDIR(myheader.h)</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>#include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;</p>

<p>allowing the dependency to be followed.</p>

<p>This property applies to sources in all targets within a
direc- tory. The property value is initialized in each
directory by its value in the directorys parent.</p>

<p>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES List of preprocessor include file
search directories.</p>

<p>This property specifies the list of directories given so
far to the include_directories command. This property exists
on direc- tories and targets. In addition to accepting
values from the include_directories command, values may be
set directly on any directory or any target using the
set_property command. A tar- get gets its initial value for
this property from the value of the directory property. A
directory gets its initial value from its parent directory
if it has one. Both directory and target property values are
adjusted by calls to the include_directories command.</p>

<p>The target property values are used by the generators to
set the include paths for the compiler. See also the
include_directo- ries command.</p>

<p>INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION Include file scanning regular
expression.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the regular expression
used during dependency scanning to match include files that
should be followed. See the include_regular_expression
command.</p>

<p>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION Enable interprocedural
optimization for targets in a directory.</p>

<p>If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if
they are known to be supported by the compiler.</p>

<p>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a
directory.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZA- TION. If set, this property
overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.</p>

<p>LINK_DIRECTORIES List of linker search directories.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of
directories given so far to the link_directories command. It
is intended for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>LISTFILE_STACK The current stack of listfiles being
processed.</p>

<p>This property is mainly useful when trying to debug
errors in your CMake scripts. It returns a list of what list
files are currently being processed, in order. So if one
listfile does an INCLUDE command then that is effectively
pushing the included listfile onto the stack.</p>

<p>MACROS List of macro commands available in the current
directory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of CMake
macros cur- rently defined. It is intended for debugging
purposes. See the macro command.</p>

<p>PARENT_DIRECTORY Source directory that added current
subdirectory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the source directory
that added the current source directory as a subdirectory of
the build. In the top-level directory the value is the
empty-string.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE Specify a launcher for compile
rules.</p>

<p>See the global property of the same name for details.
This overrides the global property for a directory.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM Specify a launcher for custom
rules.</p>

<p>See the global property of the same name for details.
This overrides the global property for a directory.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_LINK Specify a launcher for link rules.</p>

<p>See the global property of the same name for details.
This overrides the global property for a directory.</p>

<p>TEST_INCLUDE_FILE A cmake file that will be included
when ctest is run.</p>

<p>If you specify TEST_INCLUDE_FILE, that file will be
included and processed when ctest is run on the
directory.</p>

<p>VARIABLES List of variables defined in the current
directory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of CMake
variables currently defined. It is intended for debugging
purposes.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_&lt;section&gt; Specify a
postSolution global section in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Setting a property like this generates an entry of the
following form in the solution file:</p>

<p>GlobalSection(&lt;section&gt;) = postSolution
&lt;contents based on property value&gt;
EndGlobalSection</p>

<p>The property must be set to a semicolon-separated list
of key=value pairs. Each such pair will be transformed into
an entry in the solution global section. Whitespace around
key and value is ignored. List elements which do not contain
an equal sign are skipped.</p>

<p>This property only works for Visual Studio 7 and above;
it is ignored on other generators. The property only applies
when set on a directory whose CMakeLists.txt contains a
project() com- mand.</p>

<p>Note that CMake generates postSolution sections
Extensibility- Globals and ExtensibilityAddIns by default.
If you set the cor- responding property, it will override
the default section. For example, setting
VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_ExtensibilityGlobals will override
the default contents of the ExtensibilityGlobals section,
while keeping ExtensibilityAddIns on its default.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_PRE_&lt;section&gt; Specify a
preSolution global section in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Setting a property like this generates an entry of the
following form in the solution file:</p>

<p>GlobalSection(&lt;section&gt;) = preSolution
&lt;contents based on property value&gt;
EndGlobalSection</p>

<p>The property must be set to a semicolon-separated list
of key=value pairs. Each such pair will be transformed into
an entry in the solution global section. Whitespace around
key and value is ignored. List elements which do not contain
an equal sign are skipped.</p>

<p>This property only works for Visual Studio 7 and above;
it is ignored on other generators. The property only applies
when set on a directory whose CMakeLists.txt contains a
project() com- mand.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON TARGETS &lt;CONFIG&gt;_OUTPUT_NAME Old
per-configuration target file base name.</p>

<p>This is a configuration-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME.
Use OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; instead.</p>

<p>&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX Postfix to append to the target
file name for configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;.</p>

<p>When building with configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; the
value of this property is appended to the target file name
built on disk. For non-executable targets, this property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX if it is set when a target is
created. This property is ignored on the Mac for Frameworks
and App Bundles.</p>

<p>&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET Value for symbol
visibility compile flags</p>

<p>The &lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET property determines
the value passed in a visibility related compile option,
such as -fvisi- bility= for &lt;LANG&gt;. This property only
has an affect for libraries and executables with exports.
This property is ini- tialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBIL- ITY_PRESET if it is set when a
target is created.</p>

<p>ALIASED_TARGET Name of target aliased by this
target.</p>

<p>If this is an ALIAS target, this property contains the
name of the target aliased.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory in which to
build ARCHIVE target files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which archive
target files should be built. Multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) append a per-configuration subdirectory to the
specified directory. There are three kinds of target files
that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.
Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static
libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module
libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL
platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is
treated as a runtime target and the corre- sponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration output directory for ARCHIVE target
files.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory
to the specified directory. This property is initialized by
the value of the variable
CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set
when a tar- get is created.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME Output name for ARCHIVE target
files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the base name for archive target
files. It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and
OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties. There are three kinds
of target files that may be built: archive, library, and
runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets.
Static libraries are always treated as archive targets.
Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For
non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library
targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library
is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Win- dows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
output name for ARCHIVE target files.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
ARCHIVE_OUT- PUT_NAME.</p>

<p>AUTOMOC Should the target be processed with automoc (for
Qt projects).</p>

<p>AUTOMOC is a boolean specifying whether CMake will
handle the Qt moc preprocessor automatically, i.e. without
having to use the QT4_WRAP_CPP() or QT5_WRAP_CPP() macro.
Currently Qt4 and Qt5 are supported. When this property is
set to TRUE, CMake will scan the source files at build time
and invoke moc accordingly. If an #include statement like
#include &quot;moc_foo.cpp&quot; is found, the Q_OBJECT
class declaration is expected in the header, and moc is run
on the header file. If an #include statement like #include
&quot;foo.moc&quot; is found, then a Q_OBJECT is expected in
the current source file and moc is run on the file itself.
Addition- ally, all header files are parsed for Q_OBJECT
macros, and if found, moc is also executed on those files.
The resulting moc files, which are not included as shown
above in any of the source files are included in a generated
&lt;targetname&gt;_auto- moc.cpp file, which is compiled as
part of the target.This prop- erty is initialized by the
value of the variable CMAKE_AUTOMOC if it is set when a
target is created.</p>

<p>Additional command line options for moc can be set via
the AUTO- MOC_MOC_OPTIONS property.</p>

<p>By setting the CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE variable to
TRUE the rules for searching the files which will be
processed by moc can be relaxed. See the documentation for
this variable for more details.</p>

<p>The global property AUTOMOC_TARGETS_FOLDER can be used
to group the automoc targets together in an IDE, e.g. in
MSVS.</p>

<p>AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS Additional options for moc when
using automoc (see the AUTOMOC property)</p>

<p>This property is only used if the AUTOMOC property is
set to TRUE for this target. In this case, it holds
additional command line options which will be used when moc
is executed during the build, i.e. it is equivalent to the
optional OPTIONS argument of the qt4_wrap_cpp() macro.</p>

<p>By default it is empty.</p>

<p>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH Should build tree targets have
install tree rpaths.</p>

<p>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether
to link the target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.
This takes precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the
need for relink- ing before installation. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>BUNDLE This target is a CFBundle on the Mac.</p>

<p>If a module library target has this property set to true
it will be built as a CFBundle when built on the mac. It
will have the directory structure required for a CFBundle
and will be suitable to be used for creating Browser Plugins
or other application resources.</p>

<p>BUNDLE_EXTENSION The file extension used to name a
BUNDLE target on the Mac.</p>

<p>The default value is &quot;bundle&quot; - you can also
use &quot;plugin&quot; or whatever file extension is
required by the host app for your bundle.</p>

<p>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL Properties which must be
compatible with their link interface</p>

<p>The COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL property may contain a
list of propertiesfor this target which must be consistent
when evalu- ated as a boolean in the INTERFACE of all linked
dependees. For example, if a property &quot;FOO&quot;
appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
&quot;INTERFACE_FOO&quot; property content in all of its
dependencies must be consistent with each other, and with
the &quot;FOO&quot; property in the dependee. Consistency in
this sense has the meaning that if the property is set, then
it must have the same boolean value as all others, and if
the property is not set, then it is ignored. Note that for
each dependee, the set of properties from this property must
not intersect with the set of properties from the
COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING property.</p>

<p>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING Properties which must be
string-compatible with their link interface</p>

<p>The COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING property may contain a
list of properties for this target which must be the same
when evaluated as a string in the INTERFACE of all linked
dependees. For exam- ple, if a property &quot;FOO&quot;
appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
&quot;INTERFACE_FOO&quot; property content in all of its
dependencies must be equal with each other, and with the
&quot;FOO&quot; property in the dependee. If the property is
not set, then it is ignored. Note that for each dependee,
the set of properties from this property must not intersect
with the set of properties from the
COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL property.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS Preprocessor definitions for
compiling a targets sources.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a
semicolon-sepa- rated list of preprocessor definitions using
the syntax VAR or VAR=value. Function-style definitions are
not supported. CMake will automatically escape the value
correctly for the native build system (note that CMake
language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).
This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using
the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CON- FIG&gt; where
&lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex.
&quot;COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS_DEBUG&quot;).</p>

<p>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are
not sup- ported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does
not support definition values with spaces (but NMake
does).</p>

<p>Contents of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0
$&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt; = configuration name
$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1, else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0 , else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support
for escap- ing certain values. CMake has work-arounds for
many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass
correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly,
do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape
sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header
file. Then report the limitation. Known limitations
include:</p>

<p># - broken almost everywhere ; - broken in VS IDE 7.0
and Borland Makefiles , - broken in VS IDE % - broken in
some cases in NMake &amp; | - broken in some cases on MinGW
^ &lt; &gt;</p>

<p>CMake does not reject these values outright because they
do work in some cases. Use with caution.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
preprocessor definitions on a target.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS.</p>

<p>COMPILE_FLAGS Additional flags to use when compiling
this targets sources.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler
flags used to build sources within the target. Use
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass additional preprocessor
definitions.</p>

<p>COMPILE_OPTIONS List of options to pass to the
compiler.</p>

<p>This property specifies the list of options specified so
far for this property. This property exists on directories
and targets.</p>

<p>The target property values are used by the generators to
set the options for the compiler.</p>

<p>Contents of COMPILE_OPTIONS may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0
$&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt; = configuration name
$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the

$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1, else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0 , else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>DEBUG_POSTFIX See target property
&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.</p>

<p>This property is a special case of the more-general
&lt;CON- FIG&gt;_POSTFIX property for the DEBUG
configuration.</p>

<p>DEFINE_SYMBOL Define a symbol when compiling this target
s sources.</p>

<p>DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol
defined when compiling sources in a shared library. If not
set here then it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with
some substitutions if the target is not a valid C
identifier). This is useful for headers to know whether they
are being included from inside their library or outside to
properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations.</p>

<p>ENABLE_EXPORTS Specify whether an executable exports
symbols for loadable mod- ules.</p>

<p>Normally an executable does not export any symbols
because it is the final program. It is possible for an
executable to export symbols to be used by loadable modules.
When this property is set to true CMake will allow other
targets to &quot;link&quot; to the exe- cutable with the
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command. On all plat- forms a
target-level dependency on the executable is created for
targets that link to it. For DLL platforms an import library
will be created for the exported symbols and then used for
link- ing. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are
DLL plat- forms. For non-DLL platforms that require all
symbols to be resolved at link time, such as Mac OS X, the
module will &quot;link&quot; to the executable using a flag
like &quot;-bundle_loader&quot;. For other non-DLL platforms
the link rule is simply ignored since the dynamic loader
will automatically bind symbols when the module is
loaded.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL Exclude the target from the all
target.</p>

<p>A property on a target that indicates if the target is
excluded from the default build target. If it is not, then
with a Make- file for example typing make will cause this
target to be built. The same concept applies to the default
build of other genera- tors. Installing a target with
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD Exclude target from
&quot;Build Solution&quot;.</p>

<p>This property is only used by Visual Studio generators 7
and above. When set to TRUE, the target will not be built
when you press &quot;Build Solution&quot;.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration version of target exclusion from
&quot;Build Solu- tion&quot;.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD. If the generic
EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD is also set on a target,
EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_&lt;CONFIG&gt; takes precedence
in configu- rations for which it has a value.</p>

<p>EXPORT_NAME Exported name for target files.</p>

<p>This sets the name for the IMPORTED target generated
when it this target is is exported. If not set, the logical
target name is used by default.</p>

<p>EchoString A message to be displayed when the target is
built.</p>

<p>A message to display on some generators (such as
makefiles) when the target is built.</p>

<p>FOLDER Set the folder name. Use to organize targets in
an IDE.</p>

<p>Targets with no FOLDER property will appear as top level
enti- ties in IDEs like Visual Studio. Targets with the same
FOLDER property value will appear next to each other in a
folder of that name. To nest folders, use FOLDER values such
as GUI/Dialogs with / characters separating folder
levels.</p>

<p>FRAMEWORK This target is a framework on the Mac.</p>

<p>If a shared library target has this property set to true
it will be built as a framework when built on the mac. It
will have the directory structure required for a framework
and will be suit- able to be used with the -framework
option</p>

<p>Fortran_FORMAT Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the
Fortran source layout.</p>

<p>This property tells CMake whether the Fortran source
files in a target use fixed-format or free-format. CMake
will pass the corresponding format flag to the compiler. Use
the source-spe- cific Fortran_FORMAT property to change the
format of a specific source file. If the variable
CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.</p>

<p>Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY Specify output directory for
Fortran modules provided by the target.</p>

<p>If the target contains Fortran source files that provide
modules and the compiler supports a module output directory
this speci- fies the directory in which the modules will be
placed. When this property is not set the modules will be
placed in the build directory corresponding to the target s
source directory. If the variable
CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY is set when a target is
created its value is used to initialize this property.</p>

<p>Note that some compilers will automatically search the
module output directory for modules USEd during compilation
but others will not. If your sources USE modules their
location must be specified by INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES regardless
of this property.</p>

<p>GENERATOR_FILE_NAME Generators file for this target.</p>

<p>An internal property used by some generators to record
the name of the project or dsp file associated with this
target. Note that at configure time, this property is only
set for targets created by include_external_msproject().</p>

<p>GNUtoMS Convert GNU import library (.dll.a) to MS format
(.lib).</p>

<p>When linking a shared library or executable that exports
symbols using GNU tools on Windows (MinGW/MSYS) with Visual
Studio installed convert the import library (.dll.a) from
GNU to MS format (.lib). Both import libraries will be
installed by install(TARGETS) and exported by
install(EXPORT) and export() to be linked by applications
with either GNU- or MS-compatible tools.</p>

<p>If the variable CMAKE_GNUtoMS is set when a target is
created its value is used to initialize this property. The
variable must be set prior to the first command that enables
a language such as project() or enable_language(). CMake
provides the variable as an option to the user automatically
when configuring on Windows with GNU tools.</p>

<p>HAS_CXX Link the target using the C++ linker tool
(obsolete).</p>

<p>This is equivalent to setting the LINKER_LANGUAGE
property to CXX. See that propertys documentation for
details.</p>

<p>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM Specify #include line
transforms for dependencies in a target.</p>

<p>This property specifies rules to transform macro-like
#include lines during implicit dependency scanning of C and
C++ source files. The list of rules must be
semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
&quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the % must be lit-
eral). During dependency scanning occurrences of
A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be replaced by the value
given with the macro argument substituted for %. For
example, the entry</p>

<p>MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;</p>

<p>will convert lines of the form</p>

<p>#include MYDIR(myheader.h)</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>#include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;</p>

<p>allowing the dependency to be followed.</p>

<p>This property applies to sources in the target on which
it is set.</p>

<p>IMPORTED Read-only indication of whether a target is
IMPORTED.</p>

<p>The boolean value of this property is true for targets
created with the IMPORTED option to add_executable or
add_library. It is false for targets built within the
project.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS Configurations provided for an
IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Set this to the list of configuration names available
for an IMPORTED target. The names correspond to
configurations defined in the project from which the target
is imported. If the importing project uses a different set
of configurations the names may be mapped using the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt; prop- erty. Ignored for
non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_IMPLIB Full path to the import library for an
IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Set this to the location of the &quot;.lib&quot; part of
a windows DLL. Ignored for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_IMPLIB_&lt;CONFIG&gt; &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific
version of IMPORTED_IMPLIB property.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES Dependent shared
libraries of an imported shared library.</p>

<p>Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries
as part of their implementation. On some platforms the
linker searches for the dependent libraries of shared
libraries they are includ- ing in the link. Set this
property to the list of dependent shared libraries of an
imported library. The list should be disjoint from the list
of interface libraries in the INTER- FACE_LINK_LIBRARIES
property. On platforms requiring dependent shared libraries
to be found at link time CMake uses this list to add
appropriate files or paths to the link command line. Ignored
for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
&lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of
IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported. If set, this
property com- pletely overrides the generic property for the
named configura- tion.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES Languages compiled
into an IMPORTED static library.</p>

<p>Set this to the list of languages of source files
compiled to produce a STATIC IMPORTED library (such as
&quot;C&quot; or &quot;CXX&quot;). CMake accounts for these
languages when computing how to link a target to the
imported library. For example, when a C executable links to
an imported C++ static library CMake chooses the C++ linker
to satisfy language runtime dependencies of the static
library.</p>

<p>This property is ignored for targets that are not STATIC
libraries. This property is ignored for non-imported
targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
&lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported. If set, this
property com- pletely overrides the generic property for the
named configura- tion.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES Transitive link
interface of an IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Set this to the list of libraries whose interface is
included when an IMPORTED library target is linked to
another target. The libraries will be included on the link
line for the target. Unlike the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
property, this property applies to all imported target
types, including STATIC libraries. This property is ignored
for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>This property is ignored if the target also has a
non-empty INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.</p>

<p>This property is deprecated. Use
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
&lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported. If set, this
property com- pletely overrides the generic property for the
named configura- tion.</p>

<p>This property is ignored if the target also has a
non-empty INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.</p>

<p>This property is deprecated. Use
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY Repetition count
for cycles of IMPORTED static libraries.</p>

<p>This is LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY for IMPORTED
targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
&lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLIC- ITY.</p>

<p>If set, this property completely overrides the generic
property for the named configuration.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LOCATION Full path to the main file on disk for
an IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Set this to the location of an IMPORTED target file on
disk. For executables this is the location of the executable
file. For bundles on OS X this is the location of the
executable file inside Contents/MacOS under the application
bundle folder. For static libraries and modules this is the
location of the library or module. For shared libraries on
non-DLL platforms this is the location of the shared
library. For frameworks on OS X this is the location of the
library file symlink just inside the framework folder. For
DLLs this is the location of the &quot;.dll&quot; part of
the library. For UNKNOWN libraries this is the location of
the file to be linked. Ignored for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>Projects may skip IMPORTED_LOCATION if the
configuration-spe- cific property
IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; is set. To get the location
of an imported target read one of the LOCATION or LOCA-
TION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific
version of IMPORTED_LOCATION property.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_NO_SONAME Specifies that an IMPORTED shared
library target has no &quot;son- ame&quot;.</p>

<p>Set this property to true for an imported shared library
file that has no &quot;soname&quot; field. CMake may adjust
generated link commands for some platforms to prevent the
linker from using the path to the library in place of its
missing soname. Ignored for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_NO_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
&lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_NO_SONAME
property.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_SONAME The &quot;soname&quot; of an IMPORTED
target of shared library type.</p>

<p>Set this to the &quot;soname&quot; embedded in an
imported shared library. This is meaningful only on
platforms supporting the feature. Ignored for non-imported
targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific
version of IMPORTED_SONAME property.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORT_PREFIX What comes before the import library
name.</p>

<p>Similar to the target property PREFIX, but used for
import libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead
of regular libraries. A target property that can be set to
override the prefix (such as &quot;lib&quot;) on an import
library name.</p>

<p>IMPORT_SUFFIX What comes after the import library
name.</p>

<p>Similar to the target property SUFFIX, but used for
import libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead
of regular libraries. A target property that can be set to
override the suffix (such as &quot;.lib&quot;) on an import
library name.</p>

<p>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES List of preprocessor include file
search directories.</p>

<p>This property specifies the list of directories given so
far to the include_directories command. This property exists
on direc- tories and targets. In addition to accepting
values from the include_directories command, values may be
set directly on any directory or any target using the
set_property command. A target gets its initial value for
this property from the value of the directory property. A
directory gets its initial value from its parent directory
if it has one. Both directory and target prop- erty values
are adjusted by calls to the include_directories
command.</p>

<p>The target property values are used by the generators to
set the include paths for the compiler. See also the
include_directo- ries command.</p>

<p>Contents of INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.

generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1 , else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0, else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE Whether consumers
need to create a position-independent target</p>

<p>The INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property informs
con- sumers of this target whether they must set their
POSITION_INDE- PENDENT_CODE property to ON. If this property
is set to ON, then the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property on
all consumers will be set to ON. Similarly, if this property
is set to OFF, then the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property
on all consumers will be set to OFF. If this property is
undefined, then consumers will determine their
POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE prop- erty by other means.
Consumers must ensure that the targets that they link to
have a consistent requirement for their INTER-
FACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property.</p>

<p>INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES List of public
system include directories for a library.</p>

<p>Targets may populate this property to publish the
include direc- tories which contain system headers, and
therefore should not result in compiler warnings. Consuming
targets will then mark the same include directories as
system headers.</p>

<p>Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
genera- tion to produce information specific to each build
configura- tion. Valid expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0
$&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt; = configuration name
$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1 , else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0, else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION Enable interprocedural
optimization for a target.</p>

<p>If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if
they are known to be supported by the compiler.</p>

<p>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a
target.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZA- TION. If set, this property
overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.</p>

<p>LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a
target.</p>

<p>Target label semantics are currently unspecified.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory in which to
build LIBRARY target files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which library
target files should be built. Multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) append a per-configuration subdirectory to the
specified directory. There are three kinds of target files
that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.
Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static
libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module
libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL
platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is
treated as a runtime target and the corre- sponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration output directory for LIBRARY target
files.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory
to the specified directory. This property is initialized by
the value of the variable
CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set
when a tar- get is created.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME Output name for LIBRARY target
files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the base name for library target
files. It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and
OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties. There are three kinds
of target files that may be built: archive, library, and
runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets.
Static libraries are always treated as archive targets.
Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For
non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library
targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library
is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Win- dows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
output name for LIBRARY target files.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME.</p>

<p>LINKER_LANGUAGE Specifies language whose compiler will
invoke the linker.</p>

<p>For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this
sets the language whose compiler is used to link the target
(such as &quot;C&quot; or &quot;CXX&quot;). A typical value
for an executable is the language of the source file
providing the program entry point (main). If not set, the
language with the highest linker preference value is the
default. See documentation of
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREF- ERENCE variables.</p>

<p>If this property is not set by the user, it will be
calculated at generate-time by CMake.</p>

<p>LINK_DEPENDS Additional files on which a target binary
depends for linking.</p>

<p>Specifies a semicolon-separated list of full-paths to
files on which the link rule for this target depends. The
target binary will be linked if any of the named files is
newer than it.</p>

<p>This property is ignored by non-Makefile generators. It
is intended to specify dependencies on &quot;linker
scripts&quot; for custom Makefile link rules.</p>

<p>LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED Do not depend on linked shared
library files.</p>

<p>Set this property to true to tell CMake generators not
to add file-level dependencies on the shared library files
linked by this target. Modification to the shared libraries
will not be sufficient to re-link this target. Logical
target-level depen- dencies will not be affected so the
linked shared libraries will still be brought up to date
before this target is built.</p>

<p>This property is initialized by the value of the
variable CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED if it is set when a
target is cre- ated.</p>

<p>LINK_FLAGS Additional flags to use when linking this
target.</p>

<p>The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags
to the link step of a target. LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; will
add to the con- figuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;, for example,
DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO.</p>

<p>LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration linker flags
for a target.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LINK_FLAGS.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES List public interface libraries
for a shared library or exe- cutable.</p>

<p>By default linking to a shared library target
transitively links to targets with which the library itself
was linked. For an executable with exports (see the
ENABLE_EXPORTS property) no default transitive link
dependencies are used. This property replaces the default
transitive link dependencies with an explicit list. When the
target is linked into another target the libraries listed
(and recursively their link interface libraries) will be
provided to the other target also. If the list is empty then
no transitive link dependencies will be incorporated when
this target is linked into another target even if the
default set is non-empty. This property is initialized by
the value of the variable CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES if
it is set when a target is created. This property is ignored
for STATIC libraries.</p>

<p>This property is overridden by the
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property if policy CMP0022 is
NEW.</p>

<p>This property is deprecated. Use
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration list of public interface libraries for a
tar- get.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LINK_INTER- FACE_LIBRARIES. If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.</p>

<p>This property is overridden by the
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property if policy CMP0022 is
NEW.</p>

<p>This property is deprecated. Use
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY Repetition count for STATIC
libraries with cyclic dependencies.</p>

<p>When linking to a STATIC library target with cyclic
dependencies the linker may need to scan more than once
through the archives in the strongly connected component of
the dependency graph. CMake by default constructs the link
line so that the linker will scan through the component at
least twice. This property specifies the minimum number of
scans if it is larger than the default. CMake uses the
largest value specified by any target in a component.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration repetition count for cycles of STATIC
libraries.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LINK_INTER- FACE_MULTIPLICITY. If set, this property
completely overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.</p>

<p>LINK_LIBRARIES List of direct link dependencies.</p>

<p>This property specifies the list of libraries or targets
which will be used for linking. In addition to accepting
values from the target_link_libraries command, values may be
set directly on any target using the set_property
command.</p>

<p>The target property values are used by the generators to
set the link libraries for the compiler. See also the tar-
get_link_libraries command.</p>

<p>Contents of LINK_LIBRARIES may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0
$&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt; = configuration name
$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1 , else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0, else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC End a link line such that static
system libraries are used.</p>

<p>Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and
-Bdynamic to determine whether to use static or shared
libraries for -lXXX options. CMake uses these options to set
the link type for libraries whose full paths are not known
or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the
platform. By default CMake adds an option at the end of the
library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type
back to its starting type. This property switches the final
linker search type to -Bstatic regardless of how it started.
See also LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC.</p>

<p>LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC Assume the linker looks for
static libraries by default.</p>

<p>Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and
-Bdynamic to determine whether to use static or shared
libraries for -lXXX options. CMake uses these options to set
the link type for libraries whose full paths are not known
or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the
platform. By default the linker search type is assumed to be
-Bdynamic at the beginning of the library list. This
property switches the assumption to -Bstatic. It is intended
for use when linking an executable statically (e.g. with the
GNU -static option). See also LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC.</p>

<p>LOCATION Read-only location of a target on disk.</p>

<p>For an imported target, this read-only property returns
the value of the LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property for an
unspecified con- figuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; provided by the
target.</p>

<p>For a non-imported target, this property is provided for
compat- ibility with CMake 2.4 and below. It was meant to
get the loca- tion of an executable targets output file for
use in add_cus- tom_command. The path may contain a
build-system-specific por- tion that is replaced at build
time with the configuration get- ting built (such as
&quot;$(ConfigurationName)&quot; in VS). In CMake 2.6 and
above add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target
name in its COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the
target location. In CMake 2.8.4 and above add_custom_command
recog- nizes generator expressions to refer to target
locations any- where in the command. Therefore this property
is not needed for creating custom commands.</p>

<p>Do not set properties that affect the location of a
target after reading this property. These include properties
whose names match
&quot;(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CON-
FIG&gt;)?&quot;, &quot;(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)&quot;, or
&quot;LINKER_LANGUAGE&quot;. Failure to follow this rule is
not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
undefined.</p>

<p>LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Read-only property providing a
target location on disk.</p>

<p>A read-only property that indicates where a targets main
file is located on disk for the configuration
&lt;CONFIG&gt;. The property is defined only for library and
executable targets. An imported target may provide a set of
configurations different from that of the importing project.
By default CMake looks for an exact-match but otherwise uses
an arbitrary available configura- tion. Use the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property to map imported
configurations explicitly.</p>

<p>Do not set properties that affect the location of a
target after reading this property. These include properties
whose names match
&quot;(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CON-
FIG&gt;)?&quot;, &quot;(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)&quot;, or
&quot;LINKER_LANGUAGE&quot;. Failure to follow this rule is
not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
undefined.</p>

<p>MACOSX_BUNDLE Build an executable as an application
bundle on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>When this property is set to true the executable when
built on Mac OS X will be created as an application bundle.
This makes it a GUI executable that can be launched from the
Finder. See the MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST target property for
information about creation of the Info.plist file for the
application bun- dle. This property is initialized by the
value of the variable CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE if it is set when
a target is created.</p>

<p>MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST Specify a custom Info.plist
template for a Mac OS X App Bundle.</p>

<p>An executable target with MACOSX_BUNDLE enabled will be
built as an application bundle on Mac OS X. By default its
Info.plist file is created by configuring a template called
MacOSXBundle- Info.plist.in located in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. This property specifies an alternative
template file name which may be a full path.</p>

<p>The following target properties may be set to specify
content to be configured into the file:</p>

<p>MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING MACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE
MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER
MACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME
MACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION MACOSX_BUNDLE_COPYRIGHT</p>

<p>CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect
all tar- gets in a directory that do not have each specific
property set. If a custom Info.plist is specified by this
property it may of course hard-code all the settings instead
of using the target properties.</p>

<p>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST Specify a custom Info.plist
template for a Mac OS X Framework.</p>

<p>A library target with FRAMEWORK enabled will be built as
a framework on Mac OS X. By default its Info.plist file is
cre- ated by configuring a template called MacOSXFramework-
Info.plist.in located in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. This
property specifies an alternative template file name which
may be a full path.</p>

<p>The following target properties may be set to specify
content to be configured into the file:</p>

<p>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER
MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION</p>

<p>CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect
all tar- gets in a directory that do not have each specific
property set. If a custom Info.plist is specified by this
property it may of course hard-code all the settings instead
of using the target properties.</p>

<p>MACOSX_RPATH Whether to use rpaths on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>When this property is set to true, the directory portion
of the&quot;install_name&quot; field of shared libraries
will default to &quot;@rpath&quot;.Runtime paths will also
be embedded in binaries using this target.This property is
initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH
if it is set when a target is cre- ated.</p>

<p>MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Map from project
configuration to IMPORTED targets configura- tion.</p>

<p>Set this to the list of configurations of an imported
target that may be used for the current projects
&lt;CONFIG&gt; configura- tion. Targets imported from
another project may not provide the same set of
configuration names available in the current project.
Setting this property tells CMake what imported con-
figurations are suitable for use when building the
&lt;CONFIG&gt; con- figuration. The first configuration in
the list found to be provided by the imported target is
selected. If this property is set and no matching
configurations are available, then the imported target is
considered to be not found. This property is ignored for
non-imported targets.</p>

<p>NAME Logical name for the target.</p>

<p>Read-only logical name for the target as used by
CMake.</p>

<p>NO_SONAME Whether to set &quot;soname&quot; when linking
a shared library or module.</p>

<p>Enable this boolean property if a generated shared
library or module should not have &quot;soname&quot; set.
Default is to set &quot;soname&quot; on all shared libraries
and modules as long as the platform sup- ports it.
Generally, use this property only for leaf private libraries
or plugins. If you use it on normal shared libraries which
other targets link against, on some platforms a linker will
insert a full path to the library (as specified at link
time) into the dynamic section of the dependent binary.
There- fore, once installed, dynamic loader may eventually
fail to locate the library for the binary.</p>

<p>OSX_ARCHITECTURES Target specific architectures for OS
X.</p>

<p>The OSX_ARCHITECTURES property sets the target binary
architec- ture for targets on OS X. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES if it is set when a target is
created. Use OSX_ARCHITECTURES_&lt;CONFIG&gt; to set the
binary architectures on a per-configuration basis.
&lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex:
&quot;OSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG&quot;).</p>

<p>OSX_ARCHITECTURES_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration OS X
binary architectures for a target.</p>

<p>This property is the configuration-specific version of
OSX_ARCHITECTURES.</p>

<p>OUTPUT_NAME Output name for target files.</p>

<p>This sets the base name for output files created for an
exe- cutable or library target. If not set, the logical
target name is used by default.</p>

<p>OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration target file
base name.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
OUTPUT_NAME.</p>

<p>PDB_NAME Output name for MS debug symbols .pdb file from
linker.</p>

<p>Set the base name for debug symbols file created for an
exe- cutable or shared library target. If not set, the
logical tar- get name is used by default.</p>

<p>This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6
genera- tor.</p>

<p>PDB_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration name for MS
debug symbols .pdb file.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
PDB_NAME.</p>

<p>This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6
genera- tor.</p>

<p>PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory for MS debug
symbols .pdb file from linker.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which the MS
debug symbols will be placed by the linker. This property is
initial- ized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6
genera- tor.</p>

<p>PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
output directory for MS debug symbols .pdb files.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory
to the specified directory. This property is initialized by
the value of the variable
CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set when
a target is created.</p>

<p>This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6
genera- tor.</p>

<p>POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE Whether to create a
position-independent target</p>

<p>The POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property determines
whether posi- tion independent executables or shared
libraries will be cre- ated. This property is true by
default for SHARED and MODULE library targets and false
otherwise. This property is initial- ized by the value of
the variable CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPEN- DENT_CODE if it is set
when a target is created.</p>

<p>POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT Deprecated install support.</p>

<p>The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run
before and after installing a target. They are used only
when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the
target. Use the INSTALL command instead.</p>

<p>PREFIX What comes before the library name.</p>

<p>A target property that can be set to override the prefix
(such as &quot;lib&quot;) on a library name.</p>

<p>PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT Deprecated install support.</p>

<p>The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run
before and after installing a target. They are used only
when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the
target. Use the INSTALL command instead.</p>

<p>PRIVATE_HEADER Specify private header files in a
FRAMEWORK shared library tar- get.</p>

<p>Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK
property gener- ate frameworks on OS X and normal shared
libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a
list of header files to be placed in the PrivateHeaders
directory inside the frame- work folder. On non-Apple
platforms these headers may be installed using the
PRIVATE_HEADER option to the install(TAR- GETS) command.</p>

<p>PROJECT_LABEL Change the name of a target in an IDE.</p>

<p>Can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE
like Visual Studio.</p>

<p>PUBLIC_HEADER Specify public header files in a FRAMEWORK
shared library tar- get.</p>

<p>Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK
property gener- ate frameworks on OS X and normal shared
libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a
list of header files to be placed in the Headers directory
inside the framework folder. On non-Apple platforms these
headers may be installed using the PUBLIC_HEADER option to
the install(TARGETS) command.</p>

<p>RESOURCE Specify resource files in a FRAMEWORK shared
library target.</p>

<p>Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK
property gener- ate frameworks on OS X and normal shared
libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a
list of files to be placed in the Resources directory inside
the framework folder. On non-Apple platforms these files may
be installed using the RESOURCE option to the
install(TARGETS) command.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE Specify a launcher for compile
rules.</p>

<p>See the global property of the same name for details.
This overrides the global and directory property for a
target.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM Specify a launcher for custom
rules.</p>

<p>See the global property of the same name for details.
This overrides the global and directory property for a
target.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_LINK Specify a launcher for link rules.</p>

<p>See the global property of the same name for details.
This overrides the global and directory property for a
target.</p>

<p>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory in which to
build RUNTIME target files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which runtime
target files should be built. Multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) append a per-configuration subdirectory to the
specified directory. There are three kinds of target files
that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.
Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static
libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module
libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL
platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is
treated as a runtime target and the corre- sponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_RUN-
TIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration output directory for RUNTIME target
files.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory
to the specified directory. This property is initialized by
the value of the variable
CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set
when a tar- get is created.</p>

<p>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME Output name for RUNTIME target
files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the base name for runtime target
files. It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and
OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties. There are three kinds
of target files that may be built: archive, library, and
runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets.
Static libraries are always treated as archive targets.
Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For
non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library
targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library
is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Win- dows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.</p>

<p>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
output name for RUNTIME target files.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
RUNTIME_OUT- PUT_NAME.</p>

<p>SKIP_BUILD_RPATH Should rpaths be used for the build
tree.</p>

<p>SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip
auto- matic generation of an rpath allowing the target to
run from the build tree. This property is initialized by the
value of the variable CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH if it is set
when a target is created.</p>

<p>SOURCES Source names specified for a target.</p>

<p>Read-only list of sources specified for a target. The
names returned are suitable for passing to the
set_source_files_prop- erties command.</p>

<p>SOVERSION What version number is this target.</p>

<p>For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used
to spec- ify the build version and API version respectively.
When build- ing or installing appropriate symlinks are
created if the plat- form supports symlinks and the linker
supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the
missing is assumed to have the same version number.
SOVERSION is ignored if NO_SONAME property is set. For
shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION
attribute is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot;
version number. These numbers are used as the image version
of the binary.</p>

<p>STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS Extra flags to use when linking
static libraries.</p>

<p>Extra flags to use when linking a static library.</p>

<p>STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
flags for creating a static library.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS.</p>

<p>SUFFIX What comes after the target name.</p>

<p>A target property that can be set to override the suffix
(such as &quot;.so&quot; or &quot;.exe&quot;) on the name of
a library, module or exe- cutable.</p>

<p>TYPE The type of the target.</p>

<p>This read-only property can be used to test the type of
the given target. It will be one of STATIC_LIBRARY,
MODULE_LIBRARY, SHARED_LIBRARY, EXECUTABLE or one of the
internal target types.</p>

<p>VERSION What version number is this target.</p>

<p>For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used
to spec- ify the build version and API version respectively.
When build- ing or installing appropriate symlinks are
created if the plat- form supports symlinks and the linker
supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the
missing is assumed to have the same version number. For
executables VERSION can be used to specify the build
version. When building or installing appropriate sym- links
are created if the platform supports symlinks. For shared
libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute
is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot; version
number. These numbers are used as the image version of the
binary.</p>

<p>VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN Whether to add a compile flag
to hide symbols of inline func- tions</p>

<p>The VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN property determines
whether a flag for hiding symbols for inline functions. the
value passed used in a visibility related compile option,
such as -fvisibility=. This property only has an affect for
libraries and executables with exports. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN if it is set when a target
is created.</p>

<p>VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES Visual Studio managed project .NET
references</p>

<p>Adds one or more semicolon-delimited .NET references to
a gener- ated Visual Studio project. For example,
&quot;System;System.Win- dows.Forms&quot;.</p>

<p>VS_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION Specify the .NET
target framework version.</p>

<p>Used to specify the .NET target framework version for
C++/CLI. For example, &quot;v4.5&quot;.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_&lt;variable&gt; Visual Studio
project-specific global variable.</p>

<p>Tell the Visual Studio generator to set the global
variable &lt;variable&gt; to a given value in the generated
Visual Studio project. Ignored on other generators. Qt
integration works bet- ter if VS_GLOBAL_QtVersion is set to
the version FindQt4.cmake found. For example,
&quot;4.7.3&quot;</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_KEYWORD Visual Studio project keyword.</p>

<p>Sets the &quot;keyword&quot; attribute for a generated
Visual Studio project. Defaults to &quot;Win32Proj&quot;.
You may wish to override this value with
&quot;ManagedCProj&quot;, for example, in a Visual Studio
man- aged C++ unit test project.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_PROJECT_TYPES Visual Studio project
type(s).</p>

<p>Can be set to one or more UUIDs recognized by Visual
Studio to indicate the type of project. This value is copied
verbatim into the generated project file. Example for a
managed C++ unit test- ing project:</p>


<p>{3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB};{8BC9CEB8-8B4A-11D0-8D11-00A0C91BC942}</p>

<p>UUIDs are semicolon-delimited.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_ROOTNAMESPACE Visual Studio project root
namespace.</p>

<p>Sets the &quot;RootNamespace&quot; attribute for a
generated Visual Studio project. The attribute will be
generated only if this is set.</p>

<p>VS_KEYWORD Visual Studio project keyword.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio keyword, for
example Qt integration works better if this is set to
Qt4VSv1.0.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_AUXPATH Visual Studio Source Code Control Aux
Path.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio source code
control aux- path property.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_LOCALPATH Visual Studio Source Code Control Local
Path.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio source code
control local path property.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME Visual Studio Source Code Control
Project.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio source code
control project name property.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_PROVIDER Visual Studio Source Code Control
Provider.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio source code
control provider property.</p>

<p>VS_WINRT_EXTENSIONS Visual Studio project C++/CX
language extensions for Windows Runtime</p>

<p>Can be set to enable C++/CX language extensions.</p>

<p>VS_WINRT_REFERENCES Visual Studio project Windows
Runtime Metadata references</p>

<p>Adds one or more semicolon-delimited WinRT references to
a gen- erated Visual Studio project. For example,
&quot;Windows;Win- dows.UI.Core&quot;.</p>

<p>WIN32_EXECUTABLE Build an executable with a WinMain
entry point on windows.</p>

<p>When this property is set to true the executable when
linked on Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry
point instead of just main(). This makes it a GUI executable
instead of a con- sole application. See the CMAKE_MFC_FLAG
variable documentation to configure use of MFC for WinMain
executables. This property is initialized by the value of
the variable CMAKE_WIN32_EXE- CUTABLE if it is set when a
target is created.</p>

<p>XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt; Set Xcode target
attributes directly.</p>

<p>Tell the Xcode generator to set &lt;an-attribute&gt; to
a given value in the generated Xcode project. Ignored on
other genera- tors.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON TESTS ATTACHED_FILES Attach a list of
files to a dashboard submission.</p>

<p>Set this property to a list of files that will be
encoded and submitted to the dashboard as an addition to the
test result.</p>

<p>ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL Attach a list of files to a
dashboard submission if the test fails.</p>

<p>Same as ATTACHED_FILES, but these files will only be
included if the test does not pass.</p>

<p>COST Set this to a floating point value. Tests in a test
set will be run in descending order of cost.</p>

<p>This property describes the cost of a test. You can
explicitly set this value; tests with higher COST values
will run first.</p>

<p>DEPENDS Specifies that this test should only be run
after the specified list of tests.</p>

<p>Set this to a list of tests that must finish before this
test is run.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Specify environment variables that should be
defined for running a test.</p>

<p>If set to a list of environment variables and values of
the form MYVAR=value those environment variables will be
defined while running the test. The environment is restored
to its previous state after the test is done.</p>

<p>FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION If the output matches this
regular expression the test will fail.</p>

<p>If set, if the output matches one of specified regular
expres- sions, the test will fail.For example:
FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
&quot;[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed&quot;</p>

<p>LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a
test.</p>

<p>The list is reported in dashboard submissions.</p>

<p>MEASUREMENT Specify a CDASH measurement and value to be
reported for a test.</p>

<p>If set to a name then that name will be reported to
CDASH as a named measurement with a value of 1. You may also
specify a value by setting MEASUREMENT to
&quot;measurement=value&quot;.</p>

<p>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION The output must match this
regular expression for the test to pass.</p>

<p>If set, the test output will be checked against the
specified regular expressions and at least one of the
regular expressions has to match, otherwise the test will
fail.</p>

<p>PROCESSORS How many process slots this test requires</p>

<p>Denotes the number of processors that this test will
require. This is typically used for MPI tests, and should be
used in con- junction with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL
option.</p>

<p>REQUIRED_FILES List of files required to run the
test.</p>

<p>If set to a list of files, the test will not be run
unless all of the files exist.</p>

<p>RESOURCE_LOCK Specify a list of resources that are
locked by this test.</p>

<p>If multiple tests specify the same resource lock, they
are guar- anteed not to run concurrently.</p>

<p>RUN_SERIAL Do not run this test in parallel with any
other test.</p>

<p>Use this option in conjunction with the ctest_test
PARAL- LEL_LEVEL option to specify that this test should not
be run in parallel with any other tests.</p>

<p>TIMEOUT How many seconds to allow for this test.</p>

<p>This property if set will limit a test to not take more
than the specified number of seconds to run. If it exceeds
that the test process will be killed and ctest will move to
the next test. This setting takes precedence over
CTEST_TESTING_TIMEOUT.</p>

<p>WILL_FAIL If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail
flag of the test.</p>

<p>This property can be used for tests that are expected to
fail and return a non zero return code.</p>

<p>WORKING_DIRECTORY The directory from which the test
executable will be called.</p>

<p>If this is not set it is called from the directory the
test exe- cutable is located in.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON SOURCE FILES ABSTRACT Is this source file
an abstract class.</p>

<p>A property on a source file that indicates if the source
file represents a class that is abstract. This only makes
sense for languages that have a notion of an abstract class
and it is only used by some tools that wrap classes into
other languages.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS Preprocessor definitions for
compiling a source file.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a
semicolon-sepa- rated list of preprocessor definitions using
the syntax VAR or VAR=value. Function-style definitions are
not supported. CMake will automatically escape the value
correctly for the native build system (note that CMake
language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).
This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using
the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CON- FIG&gt; where
&lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex.
&quot;COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS_DEBUG&quot;).</p>

<p>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are
not sup- ported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does
not support definition values with spaces (but NMake does).
Xcode does not support per-configuration definitions on
source files.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support
for escap- ing certain values. CMake has work-arounds for
many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass
correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly,
do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape
sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header
file. Then report the limitation. Known limitations
include:</p>

<p># - broken almost everywhere ; - broken in VS IDE 7.0
and Borland Makefiles , - broken in VS IDE % - broken in
some cases in NMake &amp; | - broken in some cases on MinGW
^ &lt; &gt;</p>

<p>CMake does not reject these values outright because they
do work in some cases. Use with caution.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
preprocessor definitions on a source file.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS. Note that Xcode does not support
per-configuration source file flags so this property will be
ignored by the Xcode generator.</p>

<p>COMPILE_FLAGS Additional flags to be added when
compiling this source file.</p>

<p>These flags will be added to the list of compile flags
when this source file builds. Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to
pass additional preprocessor definitions.</p>

<p>EXTERNAL_OBJECT If set to true then this is an object
file.</p>

<p>If this property is set to true then the source file is
really an object file and should not be compiled. It will
still be linked into the target though.</p>

<p>Fortran_FORMAT Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the
Fortran source layout.</p>

<p>This property tells CMake whether a given Fortran source
file uses fixed-format or free-format. CMake will pass the
corre- sponding format flag to the compiler. Consider using
the tar- get-wide Fortran_FORMAT property if all source
files in a target share the same format.</p>

<p>GENERATED Is this source file generated as part of the
build process.</p>

<p>If a source file is generated by the build process CMake
will handle it differently in terms of dependency checking
etc. Oth- erwise having a non-existent source file could
create problems.</p>

<p>HEADER_FILE_ONLY Is this source file only a header
file.</p>

<p>A property on a source file that indicates if the source
file is a header file with no associated implementation.
This is set automatically based on the file extension and is
used by CMake to determine if certain dependency information
should be com- puted.</p>

<p>KEEP_EXTENSION Make the output file have the same
extension as the source file.</p>

<p>If this property is set then the file extension of the
output file will be the same as that of the source file.
Normally the output file extension is computed based on the
language of the source file, for example .cxx will go to a
.o extension.</p>

<p>LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a
source file.</p>

<p>This property has meaning only when the source file is
listed in a target whose LABELS property is also set. No
other semantics are currently specified.</p>

<p>LANGUAGE What programming language is the file.</p>

<p>A property that can be set to indicate what programming
language the source file is. If it is not set the language
is determined based on the file extension. Typical values
are CXX C etc. Set- ting this property for a file means this
file will be compiled. Do not set this for headers or files
that should not be com- piled.</p>

<p>LOCATION The full path to a source file.</p>

<p>A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the
full path to the source file.</p>

<p>MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION Place a source file inside a Mac
OS X bundle, CFBundle, or framework.</p>

<p>Executable targets with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set
are built as Mac OS X application bundles on Apple
platforms. Shared library targets with the FRAMEWORK
property set are built as Mac OS X frameworks on Apple
platforms. Module library targets with the BUNDLE property
set are built as Mac OS X CFBundle bundles on Apple
platforms. Source files listed in the target with this
property set will be copied to a directory inside the bundle
or framework content folder specified by the property value.
For bundles the content folder is
&quot;&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents&quot;. For frame- works the
content folder is
&quot;&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/&lt;ver-
sion&gt;&quot;. For cfbundles the content folder is
&quot;&lt;name&gt;.bundle/Con- tents&quot; (unless the
extension is changed). See the PUB- LIC_HEADER,
PRIVATE_HEADER, and RESOURCE target properties for
specifying files meant for Headers, PrivateHeaders, or
Resources directories.</p>

<p>OBJECT_DEPENDS Additional files on which a compiled
object file depends.</p>

<p>Specifies a semicolon-separated list of full-paths to
files on which any object files compiled from this source
file depend. An object file will be recompiled if any of the
named files is newer than it.</p>

<p>This property need not be used to specify the dependency
of a source file on a generated header file that it
includes. Although the property was originally introduced
for this pur- pose, it is no longer necessary. If the
generated header file is created by a custom command in the
same target as the source file, the automatic dependency
scanning process will recognize the dependency. If the
generated header file is created by another target, an
inter-target dependency should be created with the
add_dependencies command (if one does not already exist due
to linking relationships).</p>

<p>OBJECT_OUTPUTS Additional outputs for a Makefile
rule.</p>

<p>Additional outputs created by compilation of this source
file. If any of these outputs is missing the object will be
recom- piled. This is supported only on Makefile generators
and will be ignored on other generators.</p>

<p>SYMBOLIC Is this just a name for a rule.</p>

<p>If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true the build system
will be informed that the source file is not actually
created on disk but instead used as a symbolic name for a
build rule.</p>

<p>WRAP_EXCLUDE Exclude this source file from any code
wrapping techniques.</p>

<p>Some packages can wrap source files into alternate
languages to provide additional functionality. For example,
C++ code can be wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG
etc. If WRAP_EXCLUDE is set to true (1 etc) that indicates
that this source file should not be wrapped.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON CACHE ENTRIES ADVANCED True if entry
should be hidden by default in GUIs.</p>

<p>This is a boolean value indicating whether the entry is
consid- ered interesting only for advanced configuration.
The mark_as_advanced() command modifies this property.</p>

<p>HELPSTRING Help associated with entry in GUIs.</p>

<p>This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help
users set it through a CMake GUI.</p>

<p>MODIFIED Internal management property. Do not set or
get.</p>

<p>This is an internal cache entry property managed by
CMake to track interactive user modification of entries.
Ignore it.</p>

<p>STRINGS Enumerate possible STRING entry values for GUI
selection.</p>

<p>For cache entries with type STRING, this enumerates a
set of values. CMake GUIs may use this to provide a
selection widget instead of a generic string entry field.
This is for conve- nience only. CMake does not enforce that
the value matches one of those listed.</p>

<p>TYPE Widget type for entry in GUIs.</p>

<p>Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs
present widgets to help users set values. The GUIs use this
property as a hint to determine the widget type. Valid TYPE
values are:</p>

<p>BOOL = Boolean ON/OFF value. PATH = Path to a directory.
FILEPATH = Path to a file. STRING = Generic string value.
INTERNAL = Do not present in GUI at all. STATIC = Value
managed by CMake, do not change. UNINITIALIZED = Type not
yet specified.</p>

<p>Generally the TYPE of a cache entry should be set by the
command which creates it (set, option, find_library,
etc.).</p>

<p>VALUE Value of a cache entry.</p>

<p>This property maps to the actual value of a cache entry.
Set- ting this property always sets the value without
checking, so use with care.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY COMMANDS CMake Compatibility Listfile
Commands - Obsolete commands supported by CMake for
compatibility.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for now obsolete listfile
commands from pre- vious CMake versions, which are still
supported for compatibility rea- sons. You should instead
use the newer, faster and shinier new com- mands. ;-)</p>

<p>build_name Deprecated. Use ${CMAKE_SYSTEM} and
${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER} instead.</p>

<p>build_name(variable)</p>

<p>Sets the specified variable to a string representing the
plat- form and compiler settings. These values are now
available through the CMAKE_SYSTEM and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER
variables.</p>

<p>exec_program Deprecated. Use the execute_process()
command instead.</p>

<p>Run an executable program during the processing of the
CMake- List.txt file.</p>

<p>exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]
[ARGS &lt;arguments to executable&gt;] [OUTPUT_VARIABLE
&lt;var&gt;] [RETURN_VALUE &lt;var&gt;])</p>

<p>The executable is run in the optionally specified
directory. The executable can include arguments if it is
double quoted, but it is better to use the optional ARGS
argument to specify argu- ments to the program. This is
because cmake will then be able to escape spaces in the
executable path. An optional argument OUTPUT_VARIABLE
specifies a variable in which to store the out- put. To
capture the return value of the execution, provide a
RETURN_VALUE. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE is specified, then no
output will go to the stdout/stderr of the console running
cmake.</p>

<p>export_library_dependencies Deprecated. Use
INSTALL(EXPORT) or EXPORT command.</p>

<p>This command generates an old-style library dependencies
file. Projects requiring CMake 2.6 or later should not use
the com- mand. Use instead the install(EXPORT) command to
help export targets from an installation tree and the
export() command to export targets from a build tree.</p>

<p>The old-style library dependencies file does not take
into account per-configuration names of libraries or the
LINK_INTER- FACE_LIBRARIES target property.</p>

<p>export_library_dependencies(&lt;file&gt; [APPEND])</p>

<p>Create a file named &lt;file&gt; that can be included
into a CMake listfile with the INCLUDE command. The file
will contain a num- ber of SET commands that will set all
the variables needed for library dependency information.
This should be the last command in the top level
CMakeLists.txt file of the project. If the APPEND option is
specified, the SET commands will be appended to the given
file instead of replacing it.</p>

<p>install_files Deprecated. Use the install(FILES )
command instead.</p>

<p>This command has been superceded by the install command.
It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code. The
FILES form is directly replaced by the FILES form of the
install com- mand. The regexp form can be expressed more
clearly using the GLOB form of the file command.</p>

<p>install_files(&lt;dir&gt; extension file file ...)</p>

<p>Create rules to install the listed files with the given
exten- sion into the given directory. Only files existing in
the cur- rent source tree or its corresponding location in
the binary tree may be listed. If a file specified already
has an exten- sion, that extension will be removed first.
This is useful for providing lists of source files such as
foo.cxx when you want the corresponding foo.h to be
installed. A typical extension is .h.</p>

<p>install_files(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)</p>

<p>Any files in the current source directory that match the
regular expression will be installed.</p>

<p>install_files(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file file ...)</p>

<p>Any files listed after the FILES keyword will be
installed explicitly from the names given. Full paths are
allowed in this form.</p>

<p>The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the
installation prefix, which is stored in the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>install_programs Deprecated. Use the install(PROGRAMS )
command instead.</p>

<p>This command has been superceded by the install command.
It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code. The
FILES form is directly replaced by the PROGRAMS form of the
INSTALL command. The regexp form can be expressed more
clearly using the GLOB form of the FILE command.</p>

<p>install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; file1 file2 [file3 ...])
install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file1 [file2 ...])</p>

<p>Create rules to install the listed programs into the
given directory. Use the FILES argument to guarantee that
the file list version of the command will be used even when
there is only one argument.</p>

<p>install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)</p>

<p>In the second form any program in the current source
directory that matches the regular expression will be
installed.</p>

<p>This command is intended to install programs that are
not built by cmake, such as shell scripts. See the TARGETS
form of the INSTALL command to create installation rules for
targets built by cmake.</p>

<p>The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the
installation prefix, which is stored in the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>install_targets Deprecated. Use the install(TARGETS )
command instead.</p>

<p>This command has been superceded by the install command.
It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code.</p>

<p>install_targets(&lt;dir&gt; [RUNTIME_DIRECTORY dir]
target target)</p>

<p>Create rules to install the listed targets into the
given direc- tory. The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to
the installation pre- fix, which is stored in the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. If RUNTIME_DIRECTORY is specified,
then on systems with special runtime files (Windows DLL),
the files will be copied to that directory.</p>

<p>link_libraries Deprecated. Use the
target_link_libraries() command instead.</p>

<p>Link libraries to all targets added later.</p>

<p>link_libraries(library1 &lt;debug | optimized&gt;
library2 ...)</p>

<p>Specify a list of libraries to be linked into any
following tar- gets (typically added with the add_executable
or add_library calls). This command is passed down to all
subdirectories. The debug and optimized strings may be used
to indicate that the next library listed is to be used only
for that specific type of build.</p>

<p>make_directory Deprecated. Use the file(MAKE_DIRECTORY )
command instead.</p>

<p>make_directory(directory)</p>

<p>Creates the specified directory. Full paths should be
given. Any parent directories that do not exist will also be
created. Use with care.</p>

<p>output_required_files Deprecated. Approximate C
preprocessor dependency scanning.</p>

<p>This command exists only because ancient CMake versions
provided it. CMake handles preprocessor dependency scanning
automati- cally using a more advanced scanner.</p>

<p>output_required_files(srcfile outputfile)</p>

<p>Outputs a list of all the source files that are required
by the specified srcfile. This list is written into
outputfile. This is similar to writing out the dependencies
for srcfile except that it jumps from .h files into .cxx, .c
and .cpp files if possible.</p>

<p>remove Deprecated. Use the list(REMOVE_ITEM ) command
instead.</p>

<p>remove(VAR VALUE VALUE ...)</p>

<p>Removes VALUE from the variable VAR. This is typically
used to remove entries from a vector (e.g. semicolon
separated list). VALUE is expanded.</p>

<p>subdir_depends Deprecated. Does nothing.</p>

<p>subdir_depends(subdir dep1 dep2 ...)</p>

<p>Does not do anything. This command used to help projects
order parallel builds correctly. This functionality is now
automatic.</p>

<p>subdirs Deprecated. Use the add_subdirectory() command
instead.</p>

<p>Add a list of subdirectories to the build.</p>

<p>subdirs(dir1 dir2 ...[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL exclude_dir1
exclude_dir2 ...] [PREORDER] )</p>

<p>Add a list of subdirectories to the build. The
add_subdirectory command should be used instead of subdirs
although subdirs will still work. This will cause any
CMakeLists.txt files in the sub directories to be processed
by CMake. Any directories after the PREORDER flag are
traversed first by makefile builds, the PRE- ORDER flag has
no effect on IDE projects. Any directories after the
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL marker will not be included in the top
level makefile or project file. This is useful for having
CMake create makefiles or projects for a set of examples in
a project. You would want CMake to generate makefiles or
project files for all the examples at the same time, but you
would not want them to show up in the top level project or
be built each time make is run from the top.</p>

<p>use_mangled_mesa Copy mesa headers for use in
combination with system GL.</p>

<p>use_mangled_mesa(PATH_TO_MESA OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)</p>

<p>The path to mesa includes, should contain gl_mangle.h.
The mesa headers are copied to the specified output
directory. This allows mangled mesa headers to override
other GL headers by being added to the include directory
path earlier.</p>

<p>utility_source Specify the source tree of a third-party
utility.</p>

<p>utility_source(cache_entry executable_name
path_to_source [file1 file2 ...])</p>

<p>When a third-party utilitys source is included in the
distribu- tion, this command specifies its location and
name. The cache entry will not be set unless the
path_to_source and all listed files exist. It is assumed
that the source tree of the utility will have been built
before it is needed.</p>

<p>When cross compiling CMake will print a warning if a
util- ity_source() command is executed, because in many
cases it is used to build an executable which is executed
later on. This doesn t work when cross compiling, since the
executable can run only on their target platform. So in this
case the cache entry has to be adjusted manually so it
points to an executable which is runnable on the build
host.</p>

<p>variable_requires Deprecated. Use the if() command
instead.</p>

<p>Assert satisfaction of an option s required
variables.</p>

<p>variable_requires(TEST_VARIABLE RESULT_VARIABLE
REQUIRED_VARIABLE1 REQUIRED_VARIABLE2 ...)</p>

<p>The first argument (TEST_VARIABLE) is the name of the
variable to be tested, if that variable is false nothing
else is done. If TEST_VARIABLE is true, then the next
argument (RESULT_VARIABLE) is a variable that is set to true
if all the required variables are set. The rest of the
arguments are variables that must be true or not set to
NOTFOUND to avoid an error. If any are not true, an error is
reported.</p>

<p>write_file Deprecated. Use the file(WRITE ) command
instead.</p>

<p>write_file(filename &quot;message to write&quot;...
[APPEND])</p>

<p>The first argument is the file name, the rest of the
arguments are messages to write. If the argument APPEND is
specified, then the message will be appended.</p>

<p>NOTE 1: file(WRITE ... and file(APPEND ... do exactly
the same as this one but add some more functionality.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: When using write_file the produced file cannot
be used as an input to CMake (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file
...) because it will lead to an infinite loop. Use
configure_file if you want to generate input files to
CMake.</p>

<p>MODULES The following modules are provided with CMake.
They can be used with INCLUDE(ModuleName).</p>

<p>CMake Modules - Modules coming with CMake, the
Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for the modules and scripts
coming with CMake. Using these modules you can check the
computer system for installed software packages, features of
the compiler and the existence of headers to name just a
few.</p>

<p>AddFileDependencies ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(source_file
depend_files...)</p>

<p>Adds the given files as dependencies to source_file</p>

<p>BundleUtilities Functions to help assemble a standalone
bundle application.</p>

<p>A collection of CMake utility functions useful for
dealing with .app bundles on the Mac and bundle-like
directories on any OS.</p>

<p>The following functions are provided by this module:</p>

<p>fixup_bundle copy_and_fixup_bundle verify_app
get_bundle_main_executable get_dotapp_dir
get_bundle_and_executable get_bundle_all_executables
get_item_key clear_bundle_keys set_bundle_key_values
get_bundle_keys copy_resolved_item_into_bundle
copy_resolved_framework_into_bundle fixup_bundle_item
verify_bundle_prerequisites verify_bundle_symlinks</p>

<p>Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function,
break and PARENT_SCOPE. Also depends on
GetPrerequisites.cmake.</p>

<p>FIXUP_BUNDLE(&lt;app&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;)</p>

<p>Fix up a bundle in-place and make it standalone, such
that it can be drag-n-drop copied to another machine and run
on that machine as long as all of the system libraries are
compatible.</p>

<p>If you pass plugins to fixup_bundle as the libs
parameter, you should install them or copy them into the
bundle before calling fixup_bundle. The &quot;libs&quot;
parameter is a list of libraries that must be fixed up, but
that cannot be determined by otool output analysis. (i.e.,
plugins)</p>

<p>Gather all the keys for all the executables and
libraries in a bundle, and then, for each key, copy each
prerequisite into the bundle. Then fix each one up according
to its own list of pre- requisites.</p>

<p>Then clear all the keys and call verify_app on the final
bundle to ensure that it is truly standalone.</p>

<p>COPY_AND_FIXUP_BUNDLE(&lt;src&gt; &lt;dst&gt;
&lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;)</p>

<p>Makes a copy of the bundle &lt;src&gt; at location
&lt;dst&gt; and then fixes up the new copied bundle in-place
at &lt;dst&gt;...</p>

<p>VERIFY_APP(&lt;app&gt;)</p>

<p>Verifies that an application &lt;app&gt; appears valid
based on run- ning analysis tools on it. Calls
&quot;message(FATAL_ERROR&quot; if the application is not
verified.</p>

<p>GET_BUNDLE_MAIN_EXECUTABLE(&lt;bundle&gt;
&lt;result_var&gt;)</p>

<p>The result will be the full path name of the bundle s
main exe- cutable file or an &quot;error:&quot; prefixed
string if it could not be determined.</p>

<p>GET_DOTAPP_DIR(&lt;exe&gt; &lt;dotapp_dir_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Returns the nearest parent dir whose name ends with
&quot;.app&quot; given the full path to an executable. If
there is no such parent dir, then simply return the dir
containing the executable.</p>

<p>The returned directory may or may not exist.</p>

<p>GET_BUNDLE_AND_EXECUTABLE(&lt;app&gt; &lt;bundle_var&gt;
&lt;executable_var&gt; &lt;valid_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Takes either a &quot;.app&quot; directory name or the
name of an exe- cutable nested inside a &quot;.app&quot;
directory and returns the path to the &quot;.app&quot;
directory in &lt;bundle_var&gt; and the path to its main
executable in &lt;executable_var&gt;</p>

<p>GET_BUNDLE_ALL_EXECUTABLES(&lt;bundle&gt;
&lt;exes_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Scans the given bundle recursively for all executable
files and accumulates them into a variable.</p>

<p>GET_ITEM_KEY(&lt;item&gt; &lt;key_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Given a file (item) name, generate a key that should be
unique considering the set of libraries that need copying or
fixing up to make a bundle standalone. This is essentially
the file name including extension with &quot;.&quot;
replaced by &quot;_&quot;</p>

<p>This key is used as a prefix for CMake variables so that
we can associate a set of variables with a given item based
on its key.</p>

<p>CLEAR_BUNDLE_KEYS(&lt;keys_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Loop over the list of keys, clearing all the variables
associ- ated with each key. After the loop, clear the list
of keys itself.</p>

<p>Caller of get_bundle_keys should call clear_bundle_keys
when done with list of keys.</p>

<p>SET_BUNDLE_KEY_VALUES(&lt;keys_var&gt; &lt;context&gt;
&lt;item&gt; &lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;
&lt;copyflag&gt;)</p>

<p>Add a key to the list (if necessary) for the given item.
If added, also set all the variables associated with that
key.</p>

<p>GET_BUNDLE_KEYS(&lt;app&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;
&lt;keys_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Loop over all the executable and library files within
the bundle (and given as extra &lt;libs&gt;) and accumulate
a list of keys repre- senting them. Set values associated
with each key such that we can loop over all of them and
copy prerequisite libs into the bundle and then do
appropriate install_name_tool fixups.</p>

<p>COPY_RESOLVED_ITEM_INTO_BUNDLE(&lt;resolved_item&gt;
&lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt;)</p>

<p>Copy a resolved item into the bundle if necessary. Copy
is not necessary if the resolved_item is &quot;the same
as&quot; the resolved_embedded_item.</p>


<p>COPY_RESOLVED_FRAMEWORK_INTO_BUNDLE(&lt;resolved_item&gt;
&lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt;)</p>

<p>Copy a resolved framework into the bundle if necessary.
Copy is not necessary if the resolved_item is &quot;the same
as&quot; the resolved_embedded_item.</p>

<p>By default, BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS is not set.
If you want full frameworks embedded in your bundles, set
BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS to ON before calling
fixup_bun- dle. By default,
COPY_RESOLVED_FRAMEWORK_INTO_BUNDLE copies the framework
dylib itself plus the framework Resources directory.</p>

<p>FIXUP_BUNDLE_ITEM(&lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt;
&lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;)</p>

<p>Get the direct/non-system prerequisites of the resolved
embedded item. For each prerequisite, change the way it is
referenced to the value of the _EMBEDDED_ITEM keyed variable
for that prereq- uisite. (Most likely changing to an
&quot;@executable_path&quot; style reference.)</p>

<p>This function requires that the resolved_embedded_item
be &quot;inside&quot; the bundle already. In other words, if
you pass plugins to fixup_bundle as the libs parameter, you
should install them or copy them into the bundle before
calling fixup_bundle. The &quot;libs&quot; parameter is a
list of libraries that must be fixed up, but that cannot be
determined by otool output analysis. (i.e., plugins)</p>

<p>Also, change the id of the item being fixed up to its
own _EMBEDDED_ITEM value.</p>

<p>Accumulate changes in a local variable and make *one*
call to install_name_tool at the end of the function with
all the changes at once.</p>

<p>If the BU_CHMOD_BUNDLE_ITEMS variable is set then bundle
items will be marked writable before install_name_tool tries
to change them.</p>

<p>VERIFY_BUNDLE_PREREQUISITES(&lt;bundle&gt;
&lt;result_var&gt; &lt;info_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Verifies that the sum of all prerequisites of all files
inside the bundle are contained within the bundle or are
&quot;system&quot; libraries, presumed to exist
everywhere.</p>

<p>VERIFY_BUNDLE_SYMLINKS(&lt;bundle&gt; &lt;result_var&gt;
&lt;info_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Verifies that any symlinks found in the bundle point to
other files that are already also in the bundle... Anything
that points to an external file causes this function to fail
the ver- ification.</p>

<p>CMakeAddFortranSubdirectory Use MinGW gfortran from VS
if a fortran compiler is not found.</p>

<p>The add_fortran_subdirectory function adds a
subdirectory to a project that contains a fortran only
sub-project. The module will check the current compiler and
see if it can support for- tran. If no fortran compiler is
found and the compiler is MSVC, then this module will find
the MinGW gfortran. It will then use an external project to
build with the MinGW tools. It will also create imported
targets for the libraries created. This will only work if
the fortran code is built into a dll, so BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
is turned on in the project. In addition the CMAKE_GNUtoMS
option is set to on, so that the MS .lib files are created.
Usage is as follows:</p>

<p>cmake_add_fortran_subdirectory( &lt;subdir&gt; # name of
subdirectory PROJECT &lt;project_name&gt; # project name in
subdir top CMakeLists.txt ARCHIVE_DIR &lt;dir&gt; # dir
where project places .lib files RUNTIME_DIR &lt;dir&gt; #
dir where project places .dll files LIBRARIES &lt;lib&gt;...
# names of library targets to import LINK_LIBRARIES # link
interface libraries for LIBRARIES [LINK_LIBS &lt;lib&gt;
&lt;dep&gt;...]... CMAKE_COMMAND_LINE ... # extra command
line flags to pass to cmake NO_EXTERNAL_INSTALL # skip
installation of external project )</p>

<p>Relative paths in ARCHIVE_DIR and RUNTIME_DIR are
interpreted with respect to the build directory
corresponding to the source directory in which the function
is invoked.</p>

<p>Limitations:</p>

<p>NO_EXTERNAL_INSTALL is required for forward
compatibility with a future version that supports
installation of the external project binaries during
&quot;make install&quot;.</p>

<p>CMakeBackwardCompatibilityCXX define a bunch of
backwards compatibility variables</p>

<p>CMAKE_ANSI_CXXFLAGS - flag for ansi c++
CMAKE_HAS_ANSI_STRING_STREAM - has &lt;strstream&gt;
include(TestForANSIStreamHeaders)
include(CheckIncludeFileCXX) include(TestForSTDNamespace)
include(TestForANSIForScope)</p>

<p>CMakeDependentOption Macro to provide an option
dependent on other options.</p>

<p>This macro presents an option to the user only if a set
of other conditions are true. When the option is not
presented a default value is used, but any value set by the
user is preserved for when the option is presented again.
Example invocation:</p>

<p>CMAKE_DEPENDENT_OPTION(USE_FOO &quot;Use Foo&quot; ON
&quot;USE_BAR;NOT USE_ZOT&quot; OFF)</p>

<p>If USE_BAR is true and USE_ZOT is false, this provides
an option called USE_FOO that defaults to ON. Otherwise, it
sets USE_FOO to OFF. If the status of USE_BAR or USE_ZOT
ever changes, any value for the USE_FOO option is saved so
that when the option is re-enabled it retains its old
value.</p>

<p>CMakeDetermineVSServicePack Determine the Visual Studio
service pack of the cl in use.</p>

<p>The functionality of this module has been superseded by
the platform variable CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION
that contains the compiler version number.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<p>if(MSVC) include(CMakeDetermineVSServicePack)
DetermineVSServicePack( my_service_pack ) if(
my_service_pack ) message(STATUS &quot;Detected:
${my_service_pack}&quot;) endif() endif()</p>

<p>Function DetermineVSServicePack sets the given variable
to one of the following values or an empty string if
unknown:</p>

<p>vc80, vc80sp1 vc90, vc90sp1 vc100, vc100sp1 vc110,
vc110sp1, vc110sp2</p>

<p>CMakeExpandImportedTargets</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXPAND_IMPORTED_TARGETS(&lt;var&gt; LIBRARIES lib1
lib2...libN</p>

<p>[CONFIGURATION &lt;config&gt;] )</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXPAND_IMPORTED_TARGETS() takes a list of
libraries and replaces all imported targets contained in
this list with their actual file paths of the referenced
libraries on disk, including the libraries from their link
interfaces. If a CONFIGURATION is given, it uses the
respective configuration of the imported tar- gets if it
exists. If no CONFIGURATION is given, it uses the first
configuration from ${CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES} if set,
otherwise ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}. This macro is used by all
Check*.cmake files which use try_compile() or try_run() and
sup- port CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES , so that these checks
support imported targets in CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES:</p>

<p>cmake_expand_imported_targets(expandedLibs LIBRARIES
${CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES} CONFIGURATION
&quot;${CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION}&quot; )</p>

<p>CMakeFindFrameworks helper module to find OSX
frameworks</p>

<p>CMakeFindPackageMode</p>

<p>This file is executed by cmake when invoked with
--find-package. It expects that the following variables are
set using -D:</p>

<p>NAME = name of the package COMPILER_ID = the CMake
compiler ID for which the result is, i.e.
GNU/Intel/Clang/MSVC, etc. LANGUAGE = language for which the
result will be used, i.e. C/CXX/Fortan/ASM MODE = EXIST :
only check for existence of the given package COMPILE :
print the flags needed for compiling an object file which
uses the given package LINK : print the flags needed for
linking when using the given package QUIET = if TRUE, dont
print anything</p>

<p>CMakeForceCompiler</p>

<p>This module defines macros intended for use by
cross-compiling toolchain files when CMake is not able to
automatically detect the compiler identification.</p>

<p>Macro CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER has the following
signature:</p>

<p>CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER(&lt;compiler&gt;
&lt;compiler-id&gt;)</p>

<p>It sets CMAKE_C_COMPILER to the given compiler and the
cmake internal variable CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID to the given
compiler-id. It also bypasses the check for working compiler
and basic com- piler information tests.</p>

<p>Macro CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER has the following
signature:</p>

<p>CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER(&lt;compiler&gt;
&lt;compiler-id&gt;)</p>

<p>It sets CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to the given compiler and the
cmake internal variable CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID to the given
com- piler-id. It also bypasses the check for working
compiler and basic compiler information tests.</p>

<p>Macro CMAKE_FORCE_Fortran_COMPILER has the following
signature:</p>

<p>CMAKE_FORCE_Fortran_COMPILER(&lt;compiler&gt;
&lt;compiler-id&gt;)</p>

<p>It sets CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER to the given compiler and
the cmake internal variable CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_ID to the
given compiler-id. It also bypasses the check for working
compiler and basic compiler information tests.</p>

<p>So a simple toolchain file could look like this:</p>

<p>include (CMakeForceCompiler) set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME
Generic) CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)
CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)</p>

<p>CMakeGraphVizOptions The builtin graphviz support of
CMake.</p>

<p>CMake can generate graphviz files, showing the
dependencies between the targets in a project and also
external libraries which are linked against. When CMake is
run with the --gra- phiz=foo option, it will produce</p>

<p>* a foo.dot file showing all dependencies in the project
* a foo.dot.&lt;target&gt; file for each target, file
showing on which other targets the respective target depends
* a foo.dot.&lt;target&gt;.dependers file, showing which
other targets depend on the respective target</p>

<p>This can result in huge graphs. Using the file
CMakeGraphVizOp- tions.cmake the look and content of the
generated graphs can be influenced. This file is searched
first in ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR} and then in
${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}. If found, it is read and the variables
set in it are used to adjust options for the generated
graphviz files.</p>

<p>GRAPHVIZ_GRAPH_TYPE - The graph type Mandatory : NO
Default : &quot;digraph&quot; GRAPHVIZ_GRAPH_NAME - The
graph name. Mandatory : NO Default : &quot;GG&quot;
GRAPHVIZ_GRAPH_HEADER - The header written at the top of the
graphviz file. Mandatory : NO Default : &quot;node [n
fontsize = &quot;12&quot;];&quot; GRAPHVIZ_NODE_PREFIX - The
prefix for each node in the graphviz file. Mandatory : NO
Default : &quot;node&quot; GRAPHVIZ_EXECUTABLES - Set this
to FALSE to exclude executables from the generated graphs.
Mandatory : NO Default : TRUE GRAPHVIZ_STATIC_LIBS - Set
this to FALSE to exclude static libraries from the generated
graphs. Mandatory : NO Default : TRUE GRAPHVIZ_SHARED_LIBS -
Set this to FALSE to exclude shared libraries from the
generated graphs. Mandatory : NO Default : TRUE
GRAPHVIZ_MODULE_LIBS - Set this to FALSE to exclude static
libraries from the generated graphs. Mandatory : NO Default
: TRUE GRAPHVIZ_EXTERNAL_LIBS - Set this to FALSE to exclude
external libraries from the generated graphs. Mandatory : NO
Default : TRUE GRAPHVIZ_IGNORE_TARGETS - A list of regular
expressions for ignoring targets. Mandatory : NO Default :
empty</p>

<p>CMakePackageConfigHelpers
CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE(), WRITE_BASIC_PACKAGE_VER-
SION_FILE()</p>

<p>CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE(&lt;input&gt;
&lt;output&gt; INSTALL_DESTINATION &lt;path&gt; [PATH_VARS
&lt;var1&gt; &lt;var2&gt; ... &lt;varN&gt;]
[NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO]
[NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS_MACRO])</p>

<p>CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE() should be used instead
of the plain configure_file() command when creating the
&lt;Name&gt;Con- fig.cmake or &lt;Name&gt;-config.cmake file
for installing a project or library. It helps making the
resulting package relocatable by avoiding hardcoded paths in
the installed Config.cmake file.</p>

<p>In a FooConfig.cmake file there may be code like this to
make the install destinations know to the using project:</p>

<p>set(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR
&quot;@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_INCLUDEDIR@&quot; )
set(FOO_DATA_DIR
&quot;@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@RELATIVE_DATA_INSTALL_DIR@&quot;
) set(FOO_ICONS_DIR
&quot;@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/icons&quot; ) ...logic to
determine installedPrefix from the own location...
set(FOO_CONFIG_DIR
&quot;${installedPrefix}/@CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@&quot; )</p>

<p>All 4 options shown above are not sufficient, since the
first 3 hardcode the absolute directory locations, and the
4th case works only if the logic to determine the
installedPrefix is cor- rect, and if CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR
contains a relative path, which in general cannot be
guaranteed. This has the effect that the resulting
FooConfig.cmake file would work poorly under Windows and
OSX, where users are used to choose the install location of
a binary package at install time, independent from how
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX was set at build/cmake time.</p>

<p>Using CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE() helps. If used
correctly, it makes the resulting FooConfig.cmake file
relocatable. Usage:</p>

<p>1. write a FooConfig.cmake.in file as you are used to 2.
insert a line containing only the string
&quot;@PACKAGE_INIT@&quot; 3. instead of set(FOO_DIR
&quot;@SOME_INSTALL_DIR@&quot;), use set(FOO_DIR
&quot;@PACKAGE_SOME_INSTALL_DIR@&quot;) (this must be after
the @PACKAGE_INIT@ line) 4. instead of using the normal
configure_file(), use CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE()</p>

<p>The &lt;input&gt; and &lt;output&gt; arguments are the
input and output file, the same way as in
configure_file().</p>

<p>The &lt;path&gt; given to INSTALL_DESTINATION must be
the destination where the FooConfig.cmake file will be
installed to. This can either be a relative or absolute
path, both work.</p>

<p>The variables &lt;var1&gt; to &lt;varN&gt; given as
PATH_VARS are the vari- ables which contain install
destinations. For each of them the macro will create a
helper variable PACKAGE_&lt;var...&gt;. These helper
variables must be used in the FooConfig.cmake.in file for
setting the installed location. They are calculated by
CONFIG- URE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE() so that they are always
relative to the installed location of the package. This
works both for rela- tive and also for absolute locations.
For absolute locations it works only if the absolute
location is a subdirectory of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>By default configure_package_config_file() also
generates two helper macros, set_and_check() and
check_required_components() into the FooConfig.cmake
file.</p>

<p>set_and_check() should be used instead of the normal
set() com- mand for setting directories and file locations.
Additionally to setting the variable it also checks that the
referenced file or directory actually exists and fails with
a FATAL_ERROR other- wise. This makes sure that the created
FooConfig.cmake file does not contain wrong references. When
using the NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO, this macro is not
generated into the FooConfig.cmake file.</p>

<p>check_required_components(&lt;package_name&gt;) should
be called at the end of the FooConfig.cmake file if the
package supports com- ponents. This macro checks whether all
requested, non-optional components have been found, and if
this is not the case, sets the Foo_FOUND variable to FALSE,
so that the package is consid- ered to be not found. It does
that by testing the Foo_&lt;Compo- nent&gt;_FOUND variables
for all requested required components. When using the
NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS option, this macro is not
generated into the FooConfig.cmake file.</p>

<p>For an example see below the documentation for
WRITE_BASIC_PACK- AGE_VERSION_FILE().</p>

<p>WRITE_BASIC_PACKAGE_VERSION_FILE( filename VERSION
major.minor.patch COMPATIBILITY
(AnyNewerVersion|SameMajorVersion|ExactVersion) )</p>

<p>Writes a file for use as
&lt;package&gt;ConfigVersion.cmake file to &lt;filename&gt;.
See the documentation of find_package() for details on
this.</p>

<p>filename is the output filename, it should be in the
build tree. major.minor.patch is the version number of the
project to be installed</p>

<p>The COMPATIBILITY mode AnyNewerVersion means that the
installed package version will be considered compatible if
it is newer or exactly the same as the requested version.
This mode should be used for packages which are fully
backward compatible, also across major versions. If
SameMajorVersion is used instead, then the behaviour differs
from AnyNewerVersion in that the major version number must
be the same as requested, e.g. version 2.0 will not be
considered compatible if 1.0 is requested. This mode should
be used for packages which guarantee backward compatibil-
ity within the same major version. If ExactVersion is used,
then the package is only considered compatible if the
requested ver- sion matches exactly its own version number
(not considering the tweak version). For example, version
1.2.3 of a package is only considered compatible to
requested version 1.2.3. This mode is for packages without
compatibility guarantees. If your project has more
elaborated version matching rules, you will need to write
your own custom ConfigVersion.cmake file instead of using
this macro.</p>

<p>Internally, this macro executes configure_file() to
create the resulting version file. Depending on the
COMPATIBLITY, either the file
BasicConfigVersion-SameMajorVersion.cmake.in or Basic-
ConfigVersion-AnyNewerVersion.cmake.in is used. Please note
that these two files are internal to CMake and you should
not call configure_file() on them yourself, but they can be
used as starting point to create more sophisticted custom
ConfigVer- sion.cmake files.</p>

<p>Example using both configure_package_config_file() and
write_basic_package_version_file(): CMakeLists.txt:</p>

<p>set(INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR include/ ... CACHE )
set(LIB_INSTALL_DIR lib/ ... CACHE )
set(SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR etc/foo/ ... CACHE ) ...
include(CMakePackageConfigHelpers)
configure_package_config_file(FooConfig.cmake.in
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfig.cmake
INSTALL_DESTINATION ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/Foo/cmake PATH_VARS
INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR)
write_basic_package_version_file(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfigVersion.cmake
VERSION 1.2.3 COMPATIBILITY SameMajorVersion ) install(FILES
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfig.cmake
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfigVersion.cmake
DESTINATION ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/Foo/cmake )</p>

<p>With a FooConfig.cmake.in:</p>

<p>set(FOO_VERSION x.y.z) ... @PACKAGE_INIT@ ...
set_and_check(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR
&quot;@PACKAGE_INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR@&quot;)
set_and_check(FOO_SYSCONFIG_DIR
&quot;@PACKAGE_SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@&quot;)</p>

<p>check_required_components(Foo)</p>

<p>CMakeParseArguments</p>

<p>CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS(&lt;prefix&gt; &lt;options&gt;
&lt;one_value_keywords&gt; &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt;
args...)</p>

<p>CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS() is intended to be used in macros
or functions for parsing the arguments given to that macro
or func- tion. It processes the arguments and defines a set
of variables which hold the values of the respective
options.</p>

<p>The &lt;options&gt; argument contains all options for
the respective macro, i.e. keywords which can be used when
calling the macro without any value following, like e.g. the
OPTIONAL keyword of the install() command.</p>

<p>The &lt;one_value_keywords&gt; argument contains all
keywords for this macro which are followed by one value,
like e.g. DESTINATION keyword of the install() command.</p>

<p>The &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt; argument contains all
keywords for this macro which can be followed by more than
one value, like e.g. the TARGETS or FILES keywords of the
install() command.</p>

<p>When done, CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS() will have defined for
each of the keywords listed in &lt;options&gt;,
&lt;one_value_keywords&gt; and &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt;
a variable composed of the given &lt;prefix&gt; followed by
&quot;_&quot; and the name of the respective keyword. These
variables will then hold the respective value from the
argument list. For the &lt;options&gt; keywords this will be
TRUE or FALSE.</p>

<p>All remaining arguments are collected in a variable
&lt;pre- fix&gt;_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS, this can be checked
afterwards to see whether your macro was called with
unrecognized parameters.</p>

<p>As an example here a my_install() macro, which takes
similar arguments as the real install() command:</p>

<p>function(MY_INSTALL) set(options OPTIONAL FAST)
set(oneValueArgs DESTINATION RENAME) set(multiValueArgs
TARGETS CONFIGURATIONS) cmake_parse_arguments(MY_INSTALL
&quot;${options}&quot; &quot;${oneValueArgs}&quot;
&quot;${multiValueArgs}&quot; ${ARGN} ) ...</p>

<p>Assume my_install() has been called like this:</p>

<p>my_install(TARGETS foo bar DESTINATION bin OPTIONAL
blub)</p>

<p>After the cmake_parse_arguments() call the macro will
have set the following variables:</p>

<p>MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL = TRUE MY_INSTALL_FAST = FALSE (this
option was not used when calling my_install()
MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION = &quot;bin&quot; MY_INSTALL_RENAME =
&quot;&quot; (was not used) MY_INSTALL_TARGETS =
&quot;foo;bar&quot; MY_INSTALL_CONFIGURATIONS = &quot;&quot;
(was not used) MY_INSTALL_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS =
&quot;blub&quot; (no value expected after
&quot;OPTIONAL&quot;</p>

<p>You can then continue and process these variables.</p>

<p>Keywords terminate lists of values, e.g. if directly
after a one_value_keyword another recognized keyword
follows, this is interpreted as the beginning of the new
option. E.g. my_install(TARGETS foo DESTINATION OPTIONAL)
would result in MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION set to
&quot;OPTIONAL&quot;, but MY_INSTALL_DESTI- NATION would be
empty and MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL would be set to TRUE
therefor.</p>

<p>CMakePrintHelpers Convenience macros for printing
properties and variables, useful e.g. for debugging.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PRINT_PROPERTIES([TARGETS target1 .. targetN]</p>

<p>[SOURCES source1 .. sourceN] [DIRECTORIES dir1 .. dirN]
[TESTS test1 .. testN] [CACHE_ENTRIES entry1 .. entryN]
PROPERTIES prop1 .. propN )</p>

<p>This macro prints the values of the properties of the
given tar- gets, source files, directories, tests or cache
entries. Exactly one of the scope keywords must be used.
Example:</p>

<p>cmake_print_properties(TARGETS foo bar PROPERTIES
LOCATION INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRS)</p>

<p>This will print the LOCATION and INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRS
proper- ties for both targets foo and bar.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PRINT_VARIABLES(var1 var2 .. varN)</p>

<p>This macro will print the name of each variable followed
by its value. Example:</p>

<p>cmake_print_variables(CMAKE_C_COMPILER
CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION THIS_ONE_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</p>

<p>Gives:</p>

<p>-- CMAKE_C_COMPILER=&quot;/usr/bin/gcc&quot; ;
CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION=&quot;2&quot; ;
THIS_ONE_DOES_NOT_EXIST=&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>CMakePrintSystemInformation print system information</p>

<p>This file can be used for diagnostic purposes just
include it in a project to see various internal CMake
variables.</p>

<p>CMakePushCheckState</p>

<p>This module defines three macros:
CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE() CMAKE_POP_CHECK_STATE() and
CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE() These macros can be used to save,
restore and reset (i.e., clear con- tents) the state of the
variables CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS, CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS,
CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES and CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES used by
the various Check-files coming with CMake, like e.g.
check_function_exists() etc. The variable contents are
pushed on a stack, pushing multiple times is sup- ported.
This is useful e.g. when executing such tests in a
Find-module, where they have to be set, but after the
Find-mod- ule has been executed they should have the same
value as they had before.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE() macro receives optional
argument RESET. Whether its specified,
CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE() will set all CMAKE_REQUIRED_*
variables to empty values, same as CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE()
call will do.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<p>cmake_push_check_state(RESET)
set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS -DSOME_MORE_DEF)
check_function_exists(...) cmake_reset_check_state()
set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS -DANOTHER_DEF)
check_function_exists(...) cmake_pop_check_state()</p>

<p>CMakeVerifyManifest</p>

<p>CMakeVerifyManifest.cmake</p>

<p>This script is used to verify that embeded manifests and
side by side manifests for a project match. To run this
script, cd to a directory and run the script with cmake -P.
On the command line you can pass in versions that are OK
even if not found in the .manifest files. For example, cmake
-Dallow_versions=8.0.50608.0 -PCmakeVerifyManifest.cmake
could be used to allow an embeded manifest of 8.0.50608.0 to
be used in a project even if that version was not found in
the .manifest file.</p>

<p>CPack Build binary and source package installers.</p>

<p>The CPack module generates binary and source installers
in a variety of formats using the cpack program. Inclusion
of the CPack module adds two new targets to the resulting
makefiles, package and package_source, which build the
binary and source installers, respectively. The generated
binary installers con- tain everything installed via CMake s
INSTALL command (and the deprecated INSTALL_FILES,
INSTALL_PROGRAMS, and INSTALL_TARGETS commands).</p>

<p>For certain kinds of binary installers (including the
graphical installers on Mac OS X and Windows), CPack
generates installers that allow users to select individual
application components to install. See CPackComponent module
for that.</p>

<p>The CPACK_GENERATOR variable has different meanings in
different contexts. In your CMakeLists.txt file,
CPACK_GENERATOR is a *list of generators*: when run with no
other arguments, CPack will iterate over that list and
produce one package for each generator. In a
CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE, though, CPACK_GENERA- TOR is a
*string naming a single generator*. If you need per-cpack-
generator logic to control *other* cpack settings, then you
need a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.</p>

<p>The CMake source tree itself contains a
CPACK_PROJECT_CON- FIG_FILE. See the top level file
CMakeCPackOptions.cmake.in for an example.</p>

<p>If set, the CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE is included
automatically on a per-generator basis. It only need contain
overrides.</p>

<p>Heres how it works:</p>

<p>- cpack runs - it includes CPackConfig.cmake - it
iterates over the generators listed in that files
CPACK_GENERATOR list variable (unless told to use just a
specific one via -G on the command line...)</p>

<p>- foreach generator, it then - sets CPACK_GENERATOR to
the one currently being iterated - includes the
CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE - produces the package for that
generator</p>

<p>This is the key: For each generator listed in
CPACK_GENERATOR in CPackConfig.cmake, cpack will *reset*
CPACK_GENERATOR internally to *the one currently being used*
and then include the CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.</p>

<p>Before including this CPack module in your
CMakeLists.txt file, there are a variety of variables that
can be set to customize the resulting installers. The most
commonly-used variables are:</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME - The name of the package (or
application). If not specified, defaults to the project
name.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR - The name of the package vendor.
(e.g., &quot;Kitware&quot;).</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY - The directory in which CPack
is doing its packaging. If it is not set then this will
default (internally) to the build dir. This variable may be
defined in CPack config file or from the cpack command line
option &quot;-B&quot;. If set the command line option
override the value found in the config file.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR - Package major Version</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR - Package minor Version</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH - Package patch Version</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE - A text file used to
describe the project. Used, for example, the introduction
screen of a CPack-generated Windows installer to describe
the project.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY - Short description of
the project (only a few words).</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME - The name of the package file
to generate, not including the extension. For example,
cmake-2.6.1-Linux-i686. The default value is</p>


<p>${CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME}-${CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION}-${CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME}.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY - Installation directory
on the target system. This may be used by some CPack
generators like NSIS to create an installation directory
e.g., &quot;CMake 2.5&quot; below the installation prefix.
All installed element will be put inside this directory.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON - A branding image that will be
displayed inside the installer (used by GUI installers).</p>

<p>CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE - CPack-time project CPack
configuration file. This file included at cpack time, once
per generator after CPack has set CPACK_GENERATOR to the
actual generator being used. It allows per-generator setting
of CPACK_* variables at cpack time.</p>

<p>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE - License to be embedded in
the installer. It will typically be displayed to the user by
the produced installer (often with an explicit
&quot;Accept&quot; button, for graphical installers) prior
to installation. This license file is NOT added to installed
file but is used by some CPack generators like NSIS. If you
want to install a license file (may be the same as this one)
along with your project you must add an appropriate CMake
INSTALL command in your CMakeLists.txt.</p>

<p>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README - ReadMe file to be embedded
in the installer. It typically describes in some detail the
purpose of the project during the installation. Not all
CPack generators uses this file.</p>

<p>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME - Welcome file to be
embedded in the installer. It welcomes users to this
installer. Typically used in the graphical installers on
Windows and Mac OS X.</p>

<p>CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL - Disables the component-based
installation mechanism. When set the component specification
is ignored and all installed items are put in a single
&quot;MONOLITHIC&quot; package. Some CPack generators do
monolithic packaging by default and may be asked to do
component packaging by setting
CPACK_&lt;GENNAME&gt;_COMPONENT_INSTALL to 1/TRUE.</p>

<p>CPACK_GENERATOR - List of CPack generators to use. If
not specified, CPack will create a set of options
CPACK_BINARY_&lt;GENNAME&gt; (e.g., CPACK_BINARY_NSIS)
allowing the user to enable/disable individual generators.
This variable may be used on the command line as well as
in:</p>

<p>cpack -D CPACK_GENERATOR=&quot;ZIP;TGZ&quot;
/path/to/build/tree</p>

<p>CPACK_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE - The name of the CPack binary
configuration file. This file is the CPack configuration
generated by the CPack module for binary installers.
Defaults to CPackConfig.cmake.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES - Lists each of the
executables and associated text label to be used to create
Start Menu shortcuts. For example, setting this to the list
ccmake;CMake will create a shortcut named &quot;CMake&quot;
that will execute the installed executable ccmake. Not all
CPack generators use it (at least NSIS and OSXX11 do).</p>

<p>CPACK_STRIP_FILES - List of files to be stripped.
Starting with CMake 2.6.0 CPACK_STRIP_FILES will be a
boolean variable which enables stripping of all files (a
list of files evaluates to TRUE in CMake, so this change is
compatible).</p>

<p>The following CPack variables are specific to source
packages, and will not affect binary packages:</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME - The name of the source
package. For example cmake-2.6.1.</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES - List of files in the source
tree that will be stripped. Starting with CMake 2.6.0
CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES will be a boolean variable which
enables stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to
TRUE in CMake, so this change is compatible).</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR - List of generators used for the
source packages. As with CPACK_GENERATOR, if this is not
specified then CPack will create a set of options (e.g.,
CPACK_SOURCE_ZIP) allowing users to select which packages
will be generated.</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE - The name of the CPack
source configuration file. This file is the CPack
configuration generated by the CPack module for source
installers. Defaults to CPackSourceConfig.cmake.</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES - Pattern of files in the
source tree that won t be packaged when building a source
package. This is a list of regular expression patterns (that
must be properly escaped), e.g.,
/CVS/;/\.svn/;\.swp$;\.#;/#;.*~;cscope.*</p>

<p>The following variables are for advanced uses of
CPack:</p>

<p>CPACK_CMAKE_GENERATOR - What CMake generator should be
used if the project is CMake project. Defaults to the value
of CMAKE_GENERATOR few users will want to change this
setting.</p>

<p>CPACK_INSTALL_CMAKE_PROJECTS - List of four values that
specify what project to install. The four values are: Build
directory, Project Name, Project Component, Directory. If
omitted, CPack will build an installer that installers
everything.</p>

<p>CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME - System name, defaults to the value
of ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION - Package full version, used
internally. By default, this is built from
CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR, CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR,
and CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH.</p>

<p>CPACK_TOPLEVEL_TAG - Directory for the installed
files.</p>

<p>CPACK_INSTALL_COMMANDS - Extra commands to install
components.</p>

<p>CPACK_INSTALLED_DIRECTORIES - Extra directories to
install.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_REGISTRY_KEY - Registry key used
when installing this project. This is only used by installer
for Windows. The default value is based on the installation
directory. CPACK_CREATE_DESKTOP_LINKS - List of desktop
links to create.</p>

<p>CPackBundle CPack Bundle generator (Mac OS X) specific
options</p>

<p>Installers built on Mac OS X using the Bundle generator
use the aforementioned DragNDrop (CPACK_DMG_xxx) variables,
plus the following Bundle-specific parameters
(CPACK_BUNDLE_xxx).</p>

<p>CPACK_BUNDLE_NAME - The name of the generated bundle.
This appears in the OSX finder as the bundle name.
Required.</p>

<p>CPACK_BUNDLE_PLIST - Path to an OSX plist file that will
be used for the generated bundle. This assumes that the
caller has generated or specified their own Info.plist file.
Required.</p>

<p>CPACK_BUNDLE_ICON - Path to an OSX icon file that will
be used as the icon for the generated bundle. This is the
icon that appears in the OSX finder for the bundle, and in
the OSX dock when the bundle is opened. Required.</p>

<p>CPACK_BUNDLE_STARTUP_COMMAND - Path to a startup script.
This is a path to an executable or script that will be run
whenever an end-user double-clicks the generated bundle in
the OSX Finder. Optional.</p>

<p>CPackComponent Build binary and source package
installers</p>

<p>The CPackComponent module is the module which handles
the compo- nent part of CPack. See CPack module for general
information about CPack.</p>

<p>For certain kinds of binary installers (including the
graphical installers on Mac OS X and Windows), CPack
generates installers that allow users to select individual
application components to install. The contents of each of
the components are identified by the COMPONENT argument of
CMake s INSTALL command. These com- ponents can be annotated
with user-friendly names and descrip- tions, inter-component
dependencies, etc., and grouped in vari- ous ways to
customize the resulting installer. See the cpack_add_*
commands, described below, for more information about
component-specific installations.</p>

<p>Component-specific installation allows users to select
specific sets of components to install during the install
process. Installation components are identified by the
COMPONENT argument of CMakes INSTALL commands, and should be
further described by the following CPack commands:</p>

<p>CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL - The list of component to
install.</p>

<p>The default value of this variable is computed by CPack
and con- tains all components defined by the project. The
user may set it to only include the specified
components.</p>

<p>CPACK_&lt;GENNAME&gt;_COMPONENT_INSTALL - Enable/Disable
component install for CPack generator &lt;GENNAME&gt;.</p>

<p>Each CPack Generator (RPM, DEB, ARCHIVE, NSIS, DMG,
etc...) has a legacy default behavior. e.g. RPM builds
monolithic whereas NSIS builds component. One can change the
default behavior by setting this variable to 0/1 or
OFF/ON.</p>

<p>CPACK_COMPONENTS_GROUPING - Specify how components are
grouped for multi-package component-aware CPack
generators.</p>

<p>Some generators like RPM or ARCHIVE family (TGZ, ZIP,
...) gen- erates several packages files when asked for
component packag- ing. They group the component differently
depending on the value of this variable:</p>

<p>- ONE_PER_GROUP (default): creates one package file per
component group - ALL_COMPONENTS_IN_ONE : creates a single
package with all (requested) component - IGNORE : creates
one package per component, i.e. IGNORE component group</p>

<p>One can specify different grouping for different CPack
generator by using a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.</p>

<p>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DISPLAY_NAME - The name
to be displayed for a component.
CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DESCRIPTION - The
description of a component.
CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_GROUP - The group of a
component. CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DEPENDS - The
dependencies (list of components) on which this component
depends. CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_REQUIRED - True is
this component is required.</p>

<p>cpack_add_component - Describes a CPack installation
component named by the COMPONENT argument to a CMake INSTALL
command.</p>

<p>cpack_add_component(compname [DISPLAY_NAME name]
[DESCRIPTION description] [HIDDEN | REQUIRED | DISABLED ]
[GROUP group] [DEPENDS comp1 comp2 ... ] [INSTALL_TYPES
type1 type2 ... ] [DOWNLOADED] [ARCHIVE_FILE filename])</p>

<p>The cmake_add_component command describes an
installation compo- nent, which the user can opt to install
or remove as part of the graphical installation process.
compname is the name of the com- ponent, as provided to the
COMPONENT argument of one or more CMake INSTALL
commands.</p>

<p>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component,
used in graphical installers to display the component name.
This value can be any string.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component,
used in graphical installers to give the user additional
information about the component. Descriptions can span
multiple lines using &quot;0 as the line separator.
Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a few
lines long.</p>

<p>HIDDEN indicates that this component will be hidden in
the graphical installer, so that the user cannot directly
change whether it is installed or not.</p>

<p>REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and
there- fore will always be installed. It will be visible in
the graphi- cal installer, but it cannot be unselected.
(Typically, required components are shown greyed out).</p>

<p>DISABLED indicates that this component should be
disabled (unse- lected) by default. The user is free to
select this component for installation, unless it is also
HIDDEN.</p>

<p>DEPENDS lists the components on which this component
depends. If this component is selected, then each of the
components listed must also be selected. The dependency
information is encoded within the installer itself, so that
users cannot install incon- sistent sets of components.</p>

<p>GROUP names the component group of which this component
is a part. If not provided, the component will be a
standalone compo- nent, not part of any component group.
Component groups are described with the
cpack_add_component_group command, detailed below.</p>

<p>INSTALL_TYPES lists the installation types of which this
compo- nent is a part. When one of these installations types
is selected, this component will automatically be selected.
Instal- lation types are described with the
cpack_add_install_type com- mand, detailed below.</p>

<p>DOWNLOADED indicates that this component should be
downloaded on-the-fly by the installer, rather than packaged
in with the installer itself. For more information, see the
cpack_config- ure_downloads command.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file
created by CPack to be used for downloaded components. If
not supplied, CPack will create a file with some name based
on CPACK_PACK- AGE_FILE_NAME and the name of the component.
See cpack_config- ure_downloads for more information.</p>

<p>cpack_add_component_group - Describes a group of related
CPack installation components.</p>

<p>cpack_add_component_group(groupname [DISPLAY_NAME name]
[DESCRIPTION description] [PARENT_GROUP parent] [EXPANDED]
[BOLD_TITLE])</p>

<p>The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of
installation components, which will be placed together
within the listing of options. Typically, component groups
allow the user to select/deselect all of the components
within a single group via a single group-level option. Use
component groups to reduce the complexity of installers with
many options. groupname is an arbitrary name used to
identify the group in the GROUP argument of the
cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a
component in a group. The name of the group must not
conflict with the name of any component.</p>

<p>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component
group, used in graphical installers to display the component
group name. This value can be any string.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component
group, used in graphical installers to give the user
additional infor- mation about the components within that
group. Descriptions can span multiple lines using &quot;0 as
the line separator. Typically, these descriptions should be
no more than a few lines long.</p>

<p>PARENT_GROUP, if supplied, names the parent group of
this group. Parent groups are used to establish a hierarchy
of groups, pro- viding an arbitrary hierarchy of groups.</p>

<p>EXPANDED indicates that, by default, the group should
show up as &quot;expanded&quot;, so that the user
immediately sees all of the compo- nents within the group.
Otherwise, the group will initially show up as a single
entry.</p>

<p>BOLD_TITLE indicates that the group title should appear
in bold, to call the users attention to the group.</p>

<p>cpack_add_install_type - Add a new installation type
containing a set of predefined component selections to the
graphical installer.</p>

<p>cpack_add_install_type(typename [DISPLAY_NAME name])</p>

<p>The cpack_add_install_type command identifies a set of
prese- lected components that represents a common use case
for an application. For example, a &quot;Developer&quot;
install type might include an application along with its
header and library files, while an &quot;End user&quot;
install type might just include the applica- tions
executable. Each component identifies itself with one or
more install types via the INSTALL_TYPES argument to
cpack_add_component.</p>

<p>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the install type,
which will typically show up in a drop-down box within a
graphical installer. This value can be any string.</p>

<p>cpack_configure_downloads - Configure CPack to download
selected components on-the-fly as part of the installation
process.</p>

<p>cpack_configure_downloads(site [UPLOAD_DIRECTORY
dirname] [ALL] [ADD_REMOVE|NO_ADD_REMOVE])</p>

<p>The cpack_configure_downloads command configures
installa- tion-time downloads of selected components. For
each download- able component, CPack will create an archive
containing the con- tents of that component, which should be
uploaded to the given site. When the user selects that
component for installation, the installer will download and
extract the component in place. This feature is useful for
creating small installers that only down- load the requested
components, saving bandwidth. Additionally, the installers
are small enough that they will be installed as part of the
normal installation process, and the &quot;Change&quot;
button in Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel will
allow one to add or remove parts of the application after
the original installation. On Windows, the
downloaded-components functional- ity requires the ZipDLL
plug-in for NSIS, available at:</p>

<p>http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug-in</p>

<p>On Mac OS X, installers that download components
on-the-fly can only be built and installed on system using
Mac OS X 10.5 or later.</p>

<p>The site argument is a URL where the archives for
downloadable components will reside, e.g.,
http://www.cmake.org/files/2.6.1/installer/ All of the
archives produced by CPack should be uploaded to that
location.</p>

<p>UPLOAD_DIRECTORY is the local directory where CPack will
create the various archives for each of the components. The
contents of this directory should be uploaded to a location
accessible by the URL given in the site argument. If
omitted, CPack will use the directory CPackUploads inside
the CMake binary directory to store the generated
archives.</p>

<p>The ALL flag indicates that all components be
downloaded. Other- wise, only those components explicitly
marked as DOWNLOADED or that have a specified ARCHIVE_FILE
will be downloaded. Addition- ally, the ALL option implies
ADD_REMOVE (unless NO_ADD_REMOVE is specified).</p>

<p>ADD_REMOVE indicates that CPack should install a copy of
the installer that can be called from Windows Add/Remove
Programs dialog (via the &quot;Modify&quot; button) to
change the set of installed components. NO_ADD_REMOVE turns
off this behavior. This option is ignored on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>CPackCygwin Cygwin CPack generator (Cygwin).</p>

<p>The following variable is specific to installers build
on and/or for Cygwin:</p>

<p>CPACK_CYGWIN_PATCH_NUMBER - The Cygwin patch number.
FIXME: This documentation is incomplete.
CPACK_CYGWIN_PATCH_FILE - The Cygwin patch file. FIXME: This
documentation is incomplete. CPACK_CYGWIN_BUILD_SCRIPT - The

UDBZ (UDIF bzip2-compressed). Refer to hdiutil(1) for more
information on other available formats.</p>

<p>CPACK_DMG_DS_STORE - Path to a custom DS_Store file.
This .DS_Store file e.g. can be used to specify the Finder
window position/geometry and layout (such as hidden
toolbars, placement of the icons etc.). This file has to be
generated by the Finder (either manually or through
OSA-script) using a normal folder from which the .DS_Store
file can then be extracted.</p>

<p>CPACK_DMG_BACKGROUND_IMAGE - Path to a background image
file. This file will be used as the background for the
Finder Window when the disk image is opened. By default no
background image is set. The background image is applied
after applying the custom .DS_Store file.</p>

<p>CPACK_COMMAND_HDIUTIL - Path to the hdiutil(1) command
used to operate on disk image files on Mac OS X. This
variable can be used to override the automatically detected
command (or specify its location if the auto-detection fails
to find it.)</p>

<p>CPACK_COMMAND_SETFILE - Path to the SetFile(1) command
used to set extended attributes on files and directories on
Mac OS X. This variable can be used to override the
automatically detected command (or specify its location if
the auto-detection fails to find it.)</p>

<p>CPACK_COMMAND_REZ - Path to the Rez(1) command used to
compile resources on Mac OS X. This variable can be used to
override the automatically detected command (or specify its
location if the auto-detection fails to find it.)</p>

better deb package when Debian specific tools dpkg-xxx are
usable on the build system.</p>

<p>CPackDeb has specific features which are controlled by
the specifics CPACK_DEBIAN_XXX variables.Youll find a

installers that download component son-the-fly for Mac OS X
10.5 or newer. If left blank, this value will be set to the
minimum version of Mac OS X that supports the requested
features. Set this variable to some value (e.g., 10.4) only
if you want to guarantee that your installer will work on
that version of Mac OS X, and dont mind missing extra
features available in the installer shipping with later
versions of Mac OS X.</p>

<p>CPackRPM The builtin (binary) CPack RPM generator (Unix
only)</p>

<p>CPackRPM may be used to create RPM package using CPack.
CPackRPM is a CPack generator thus it uses the CPACK_XXX
variables used by CPack :
http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackConfiguration</p>

<p>However CPackRPM has specific features which are
controlled by the specifics CPACK_RPM_XXX variables.
CPackRPM is a component aware generator so when
CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is ON some more
CPACK_RPM_&lt;ComponentName&gt;_XXXX variables may be used
in order to have component specific values. Note however
that &lt;com- ponentName&gt; refers to the **grouping
name**. This may be either a component name or a component
GROUP name. Usually those vars correspond to RPM spec file
entities, one may find information about spec files here
http://www.rpm.org/wiki/Docs. Youll find a detailed usage of
CPackRPM on the wiki:</p>


<p>http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackPackageGenerators#RPM_.28Unix_Only.29</p>

<p>However as a handy reminder here comes the list of
specific variables:</p>

<p>CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SUMMARY - The RPM package summary.
Mandatory : YES Default : CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_NAME - The RPM package name. Mandatory :
YES Default : CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION -
The RPM package version. Mandatory : YES Default :
CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE - The
RPM package architecture. Mandatory : NO Default : - This
may be set to &quot;noarch&quot; if you know you are
building a noarch package. CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE - The
RPM package release. Mandatory : YES Default : 1 This is the
numbering of the RPM package itself, i.e. the version of the
packaging and not the version of the content (see
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION). One may change the default value
if the previous packaging was buggy and/or you want to put
here a fancy Linux distro specific numbering.
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_LICENSE - The RPM package license policy.
Mandatory : YES Default : &quot;unknown&quot;
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_GROUP - The RPM package group. Mandatory :

description. Mandatory : YES Default :
CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE if set or &quot;no package
description available&quot; CPACK_RPM_COMPRESSION_TYPE - RPM
compression type. Mandatory : NO Default : - May be used to
override RPM compression type to be used to build the RPM.
For example some Linux distribution now default to lzma or
xz compression whereas older cannot use such RPM. Using this
one can enforce compression type to be used. Possible value
are: lzma, xz, bzip2 and gzip. CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES -
RPM spec requires field. Mandatory : NO Default : - May be
used to set RPM dependencies (requires). Note that you must
enclose the complete requires string between quotes, for
example: set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES &quot;python &gt;=
2.5.0, cmake &gt;= 2.8&quot;) The required package list of
an RPM file could be printed with rpm -qp --requires
file.rpm CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SUGGESTS - RPM spec suggest
field. Mandatory : NO Default : - May be used to set weak
RPM dependencies (suggests). Note that you must enclose the
complete requires string between quotes.
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_PROVIDES - RPM spec provides field.

Mandatory : NO Default : - May be used to set RPM packages
that are obsoleted by this one.
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELOCATABLE - build a relocatable RPM.
Mandatory : NO Default : CPACK_PACKAGE_RELOCATABLE If this
variable is set to TRUE or ON CPackRPM will try to build a
relocatable RPM package. A relocatable RPM may be installed
using rpm --prefix or --relocate in order to install it at
an alternate place see rpm(8). Note that currently this may
fail if CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set to ON. If CPACK_SET_DESTDIR
is set then you will get a warning message but if there is
file installed with absolute path youll get unexpected
behavior. CPACK_RPM_SPEC_INSTALL_POST - [deprecated].
Mandatory : NO Default : - This way of specifying
post-install script is deprecated use
CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE May be used to set an RPM
post-install command inside the spec file. For example
setting it to &quot;/bin/true&quot; may be used to prevent
rpmbuild to strip binaries. CPACK_RPM_SPEC_MORE_DEFINE - RPM
extended spec definitions lines. Mandatory : NO Default : -
May be used to add any %define lines to the generated spec
file. CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG - Toggle CPackRPM debug
output. Mandatory : NO Default : - May be set when invoking
cpack in order to trace debug information during CPack RPM
run. For example you may launch CPack like this cpack -D
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG=1 -G RPM
CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE - A user provided spec file.
Mandatory : NO Default : - May be set by the user in order
to specify a USER binary spec file to be used by CPackRPM
instead of generating the file. The specified file will be
processed by configure_file( @ONLY). One can provide a
component specific file by setting
CPACK_RPM_&lt;componentName&gt;_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE.
CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE - Spec file
template. Mandatory : NO Default : - If set CPack will
generate a template for USER specified binary spec file and
stop with an error. For example launch CPack like this cpack
-D CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE=1 -G RPM
The user may then use this file in order to hand-craft is
own binary spec file which may be used with
CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE.
CPACK_RPM_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
CPACK_RPM_PRE_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE Mandatory : NO Default :
- May be used to embed a pre (un)installation script in the
spec file. The refered script file(s) will be read and
directly put after the %pre or %preun section If
CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install
script for each component can be overridden with
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PRE_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE One
may verify which scriptlet has been included with rpm -qp
--scripts package.rpm CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
CPACK_RPM_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE Mandatory : NO Default
: - May be used to embed a post (un)installation script in
the spec file. The refered script file(s) will be read and
directly put after the %post or %postun section If
CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install
script for each component can be overridden with
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE One
may verify which scriptlet has been included with rpm -qp
--scripts package.rpm CPACK_RPM_USER_FILELIST
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_USER_FILELIST Mandatory : NO
Default : - May be used to explicitly specify
%(&lt;directive&gt;) file line in the spec file. Like
%config(noreplace) or any other directive that be found in
the %files section. Since CPackRPM is generating the list of
files (and directories) the user specified files of the
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_USER_FILELIST list will be
removed from the generated list. CPACK_RPM_CHANGELOG_FILE -
RPM changelog file. Mandatory : NO Default : - May be used
to embed a changelog in the spec file. The refered file will
be read and directly put after the %changelog section.
CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST - list of path to be
excluded. Mandatory : NO Default : /etc /etc/init.d /usr
/usr/share /usr/share/doc /usr/bin /usr/lib /usr/lib64
/usr/include May be used to exclude path (directories or
files) from the auto-generated list of paths discovered by
CPack RPM. The defaut value contains a reasonable set of
values if the variable is not defined by the user. If the
variable is defined by the user then CPackRPM will NOT any
of the default path. If you want to add some path to the
default list then you can use
CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST_ADDITION variable.
CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST_ADDITION - additional
list of path to be excluded. Mandatory : NO Default : - May
be used to add more exclude path (directories or files) from
the initial default list of excluded paths. See
CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST.</p>

<p>CPackWIX CPack WiX generator specific options</p>

<p>The following variables are specific to the installers
built on Windows using WiX.</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_UPGRADE_GUID - Upgrade GUID
(Product/@UpgradeCode)</p>

<p>Will be automatically generated unless explicitly
provided.</p>

<p>It should be explicitly set to a constant generated
gloabally unique identifier (GUID) to allow your installers
to replace existing installations that use the same
GUID.</p>

<p>You may for example explicitly set this variable in your
CMake- Lists.txt to the value that has been generated per
default. You should not use GUIDs that you did not generate
yourself or which may belong to other projects.</p>

<p>A GUID shall have the following fixed length syntax:
XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX</p>

<p>(each X represents an uppercase hexadecimal digit)
CPACK_WIX_PRODUCT_GUID - Product GUID (Product/@Id)</p>

<p>Will be automatically generated unless explicitly
provided.</p>

<p>If explicitly provided this will set the Product Id of
your installer.</p>

<p>The installer will abort if it detects a pre-existing
installa- tion that uses the same GUID.</p>

<p>The GUID shall use the syntax described for
CPACK_WIX_UPGRADE_GUID.</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_LICENSE_RTF - RTF License File</p>

<p>If CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE has an .rtf extension it
is used as-is.</p>

<p>If CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE has an .txt extension it
is implicitly converted to RTF by the WiX Generator.</p>

<p>With CPACK_WIX_LICENSE_RTF you can override the license
file used by the WiX Generator in case
CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE is in an unsupported format or
the .txt -&gt; .rtf conversion does not work as
expected.</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_PRODUCT_ICON - The Icon shown next to the
program name in Add/Remove programs.</p>

<p>If set, this icon is used in place of the default
icon.</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_UI_BANNER - The bitmap will appear at the top
of all installer pages other than the welcome and completion
dialogs.</p>

<p>If set, this image will replace the default banner
image.</p>

<p>This image must be 493 by 58 pixels.</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_UI_DIALOG - Background bitmap used on the
welcome and completion dialogs.</p>

<p>If this variable is set, the installer will replace the
default dialog image.</p>

<p>This image must be 493 by 312 pixels.</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_PROGRAM_MENU_FOLDER - Start menu folder name
for launcher.</p>

<p>If this variable is not set, it will be initialized with
CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_CULTURES - Language(s) of the installer</p>

<p>Languages are compiled into the WixUI extension library.
To use them, simply provide the name of the culture. If you
specify more than one culture identifier in a comma or
semicolon delim- ited list, the first one that is found will
be used. You can find a list of supported languages at:
http://wix.source-
forge.net/manual-wix3/WixUI_localization.htm</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_TEMPLATE - Template file for WiX
generation</p>

<p>If this variable is set, the specified template will be
used to generate the WiX wxs file. This should be used if
further cus- tomization of the output is required.</p>

<p>If this variable is not set, the default MSI template
included with CMake will be used.</p>

<p>CTest Configure a project for testing with
CTest/CDash</p>

<p>Include this module in the top CMakeLists.txt file of a
project to enable testing with CTest and dashboard
submissions to CDash:</p>

<p>project(MyProject) ... include(CTest)</p>

<p>The module automatically creates a BUILD_TESTING option
that selects whether to enable testing support (ON by
default). After including the module, use code like</p>

<p>if(BUILD_TESTING) # ... CMake code to create tests ...
endif()</p>

<p>to creating tests when testing is enabled.</p>

<p>To enable submissions to a CDash server, create a
CTestCon- fig.cmake file at the top of the project with
content such as</p>

<p>set(CTEST_PROJECT_NAME &quot;MyProject&quot;)
set(CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME &quot;01:00:00 UTC&quot;)
set(CTEST_DROP_METHOD &quot;http&quot;) set(CTEST_DROP_SITE
&quot;my.cdash.org&quot;) set(CTEST_DROP_LOCATION
&quot;/submit.php?project=MyProject&quot;)
set(CTEST_DROP_SITE_CDASH TRUE)</p>

<p>(the CDash server can provide the file to a project
administra- tor who configures MyProject ). Settings in the
config file are shared by both this CTest module and the
CTest command-line tools dashboard script mode (ctest
-S).</p>

<p>While building a project for submission to CDash, CTest
scans the build output for errors and warnings and reports
them with surrounding context from the build log. This
generic approach works for all build tools, but does not
give details about the command invocation that produced a
given problem. One may get more detailed reports by
adding</p>

<p>set(CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS 1)</p>

<p>to the CTestConfig.cmake file. When this option is
enabled, the CTest module tells CMakes Makefile generators
to invoke every command in the generated build system
through a CTest launcher program. (Currently the
CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS option is ignored on non-Makefile
generators.) During a manual build each launcher
transparently runs the command it wraps. During a
CTest-driven build for submission to CDash each launcher
reports detailed information when its command fails or
warns. (Setting CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS in CTestConfig.cmake is
convenient, but also adds the launcher overhead even for
manual builds. One may instead set it in a CTest dashboard
script and add it to the CMake cache for the build
tree.)</p>

<p>CTestScriptMode</p>

<p>This file is read by ctest in script mode (-S)</p>

<p>CTestUseLaunchers Set the RULE_LAUNCH_* global
properties when CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is on.</p>

<p>CTestUseLaunchers is automatically included when you
include(CTest). However, it is split out into its own module
file so projects can use the CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS
functionality independently.</p>

<p>To use launchers, set CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS to ON in a
ctest -S dashboard script, and then also set it in the cache
of the con- figured project. Both cmake and ctest need to
know the value of it for the launchers to work properly.
CMake needs to know in order to generate proper build rules,
and ctest, in order to produce the proper error and warning
analysis.</p>

<p>For convenience, you may set the ENV variable
CTEST_USE_LAUNCH- ERS_DEFAULT in your ctest -S script, too.
Then, as long as your CMakeLists uses include(CTest) or
include(CTestUseLaunchers), it will use the value of the ENV
variable to initialize a CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS cache variable.
This cache variable initial- ization only occurs if
CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is not already defined.</p>

<p>CheckCCompilerFlag Check whether the C compiler supports
a given flag.</p>

<p>CHECK_C_COMPILER_FLAG(&lt;flag&gt; &lt;var&gt;)</p>

<p>&lt;flag&gt; - the compiler flag &lt;var&gt; - variable
to store the result</p>

<p>This internally calls the check_c_source_compiles macro
and sets CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS to &lt;flag&gt;. See
help for CheckCSource- Compiles for a listing of variables
that can otherwise modify the build. The result only tells
that the compiler does not give an error message when it
encounters the flag. If the flag has any effect or even a
specific one is beyond the scope of this module.</p>

<p>&lt;code&gt; - source code to try to compile &lt;var&gt;
- variable to store the result (1 for success, empty for
failure)</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this

<p>CheckCXXCompilerFlag Check whether the CXX compiler
supports a given flag.</p>

<p>CHECK_CXX_COMPILER_FLAG(&lt;flag&gt; &lt;var&gt;)</p>

<p>&lt;flag&gt; - the compiler flag &lt;var&gt; - variable
to store the result</p>

<p>This internally calls the check_cxx_source_compiles
macro and sets CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS to &lt;flag&gt;.
See help for Check- CXXSourceCompiles for a listing of
variables that can otherwise modify the build. The result
only tells that the compiler does not give an error message
when it encounters the flag. If the flag has any effect or

compiles and links into an executable</p>

<p>CHECK_CXX_SOURCE_COMPILES(&lt;code&gt; &lt;var&gt;
[FAIL_REGEX &lt;fail-regex&gt;])</p>

<p>CheckCXXSymbolExists Check if a symbol exists as a
function, variable, or macro in C++</p>

<p>CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS(&lt;symbol&gt; &lt;files&gt;
&lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>Check that the &lt;symbol&gt; is available after
including given header &lt;files&gt; and store the result in
a &lt;variable&gt;. Specify the list of files in one
argument as a semicolon-separated list.
CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS() can be used to check in C++ files,
as opposed to CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS(), which works only for
C.</p>

<p>If the header files define the symbol as a macro it is
consid- ered available and assumed to work. If the header
files declare the symbol as a function or variable then the
symbol must also be available for linking. If the symbol is
a type or enum value it will not be recognized (consider
using CheckTypeSize or CheckCSourceCompiles).</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link</p>

<p>CheckFortranFunctionExists macro which checks if the
Fortran function exists</p>

<p>CHECK_FORTRAN_FUNCTION_EXISTS(FUNCTION VARIABLE)</p>

<p>FUNCTION - the name of the Fortran function VARIABLE -
variable to store the result</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link</p>

<p>CheckFunctionExists Check if a C function can be
linked</p>

<p>CHECK_FUNCTION_EXISTS(&lt;function&gt;
&lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>Check that the &lt;function&gt; is provided by libraries
on the system and store the result in a &lt;variable&gt;.
This does not verify that any system header file declares
the function, only that it can be found at link time
(consider using CheckSymbolExists).</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link</p>

<p>CheckIncludeFile macro which checks the include file
exists.</p>

<p>CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE(INCLUDE VARIABLE)</p>

<p>INCLUDE - name of include file VARIABLE - variable to
return result</p>

<p>an optional third argument is the CFlags to add to the
compile line or you can use CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</p>

directories</p>

<p>CheckIncludeFileCXX Check if the include file
exists.</p>

<p>CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE_CXX(INCLUDE VARIABLE)</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories</p>

<p>CheckLanguage Check if a language can be enabled</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<p>check_language(&lt;lang&gt;)</p>

<p>where &lt;lang&gt; is a language that may be passed to
enable_lan- guage() such as &quot;Fortran&quot;. If
CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER is already defined the check
does nothing. Otherwise it tries enabling the language in a
test project. The result is cached in
CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER as the compiler that was found,
or NOT- FOUND if the language cannot be enabled.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>check_language(Fortran) if(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER)
enable_language(Fortran) else() message(STATUS &quot;No
Fortran support&quot;) endif()</p>

<p>CheckLibraryExists Check if the function exists.</p>

<p>CHECK_LIBRARY_EXISTS (LIBRARY FUNCTION LOCATION
VARIABLE)</p>

<p>LIBRARY - the name of the library you are looking for
FUNCTION - the name of the function LOCATION - location
where the library should be found VARIABLE - variable to
store the result</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link</p>

<p>CheckPrototypeDefinition Check if the protoype we expect
is correct.</p>

<p>check_prototype_definition(FUNCTION PROTOTYPE RETURN
HEADER VARIABLE)</p>

<p>FUNCTION - The name of the function (used to check if
prototype exists) PROTOTYPE- The prototype to check. RETURN
- The return value of the function. HEADER - The header
files required. VARIABLE - The variable to store the
result.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>check_prototype_definition(getpwent_r &quot;struct
passwd *getpwent_r(struct passwd *src, char *buf, int
buflen)&quot; &quot;NULL&quot; &quot;unistd.h;pwd.h&quot;
SOLARIS_GETPWENT_R)</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link</p>

<p>CheckStructHasMember Check if the given struct or class
has the specified member variable</p>

<p>CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER (STRUCT MEMBER HEADER
VARIABLE)</p>

<p>STRUCT - the name of the struct or class you are
interested in MEMBER - the member which existence you want
to check HEADER - the header(s) where the prototype should
be declared VARIABLE - variable to store the result</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories</p>

<p>Example: CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER(&quot;struct
timeval&quot; tv_sec sys/select.h HAVE_TIMEVAL_TV_SEC)</p>

<p>CheckSymbolExists Check if a symbol exists as a
function, variable, or macro</p>

<p>CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS(&lt;symbol&gt; &lt;files&gt;
&lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>Check that the &lt;symbol&gt; is available after
including given header &lt;files&gt; and store the result in
a &lt;variable&gt;. Specify the list of files in one
argument as a semicolon-separated list.</p>

<p>If the header files define the symbol as a macro it is
consid- ered available and assumed to work. If the header
files declare the symbol as a function or variable then the
symbol must also be available for linking. If the symbol is
a type or enum value it will not be recognized (consider
using CheckTypeSize or CheckCSourceCompiles). If the check
needs to be done in C++, consider using
CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS(), which does the same as
CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS(), but in C++.</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link</p>

<p>CheckTypeSize Check sizeof a type</p>

<p>CHECK_TYPE_SIZE(TYPE VARIABLE [BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY])</p>

<p>Check if the type exists and determine its size. On
return, &quot;HAVE_${VARIABLE}&quot; holds the existence of
the type, and &quot;${VARI- ABLE}&quot; holds one of the
following:</p>

<p>&lt;size&gt; = type has non-zero size &lt;size&gt;
&quot;0&quot; = type has arch-dependent size (see below)
&quot;&quot; = type does not exist</p>

<p>Furthermore, the variable &quot;${VARIABLE}_CODE&quot;
holds C preproces- sor code to define the macro
&quot;${VARIABLE}&quot; to the size of the type, or leave
the macro undefined if the type does not exist.</p>

<p>The variable &quot;${VARIABLE}&quot; may be
&quot;0&quot; when CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITEC- TURES has multiple
architectures for building OS X universal binaries. This
indicates that the type size varies across archi- tectures.
In this case &quot;${VARIABLE}_CODE&quot; contains C
preproces- sor tests mapping from each architecture macro to
the corre- sponding type size. The list of architecture
macros is stored in &quot;${VARIABLE}_KEYS&quot;, and the
value for each key is stored in
&quot;${VARIABLE}-${KEY}&quot;.</p>

<p>If the BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY option is not given, the macro
checks for headers &lt;sys/types.h&gt;, &lt;stdint.h&gt;,
and &lt;stddef.h&gt;, and saves results in HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H,
HAVE_STDINT_H, and HAVE_STDDEF_H. The type size check
automatically includes the available head- ers, thus
supporting checks of types defined in the headers.</p>

<p>Despite the name of the macro you may use it to check
the size of more complex expressions, too. To check e.g. for
the size of a struct member you can do something like
this:</p>

<p>check_type_size(&quot;((struct
something*)0)-&gt;member&quot; SIZEOF_MEMBER)</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link CMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDE_FILES = list of extra headers to
include</p>

<p>CheckVariableExists Check if the variable exists.</p>

<p>CHECK_VARIABLE_EXISTS(VAR VARIABLE)</p>

<p>VAR - the name of the variable VARIABLE - variable to
store the result</p>

<p>This macro is only for C variables.</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link</p>

<p>Dart Configure a project for testing with CTest or old
Dart Tcl Client</p>

<p>This file is the backwards-compatibility version of the
CTest module. It supports using the old Dart 1 Tcl client
for driving dashboard submissions as well as testing with
CTest. This mod- ule should be included in the
CMakeLists.txt file at the top of a project. Typical
usage:</p>

<p>include(Dart) if(BUILD_TESTING) # ... testing related
CMake code ... endif()</p>

<p>The BUILD_TESTING option is created by the Dart module
to deter- mine whether testing support should be enabled.
The default is ON.</p>

<p>DeployQt4 Functions to help assemble a standalone Qt4
executable.</p>

<p>A collection of CMake utility functions useful for
deploying Qt4 executables.</p>

<p>The following functions are provided by this module:</p>

<p>write_qt4_conf resolve_qt4_paths fixup_qt4_executable
install_qt4_plugin_path install_qt4_plugin
install_qt4_executable</p>

<p>Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function
and PAR- ENT_SCOPE. Also depends on
BundleUtilities.cmake.</p>

<p>WRITE_QT4_CONF(&lt;qt_conf_dir&gt;
&lt;qt_conf_contents&gt;)</p>

<p>Writes a qt.conf file with the &lt;qt_conf_contents&gt;
into &lt;qt_conf_dir&gt;.</p>

<p>RESOLVE_QT4_PATHS(&lt;paths_var&gt;
[&lt;executable_path&gt;])</p>

<p>Loop through &lt;paths_var&gt; list and if any don t
exist resolve them relative to the &lt;executable_path&gt;
(if supplied) or the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>FIXUP_QT4_EXECUTABLE(&lt;executable&gt;
[&lt;qtplugins&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;
&lt;plugins_dir&gt; &lt;request_qt_conf&gt;])</p>

<p>Copies Qt plugins, writes a Qt configuration file (if
needed) and fixes up a Qt4 executable using BundleUtilities
so it is standalone and can be drag-and-drop copied to
another machine as long as all of the system libraries are
compatible.</p>

<p>&lt;executable&gt; should point to the executable to be
fixed-up.</p>

<p>&lt;qtplugins&gt; should contain a list of the names or
paths of any Qt plugins to be installed.</p>

<p>&lt;libs&gt; will be passed to BundleUtilities and
should be a list of any already installed plugins, libraries
or executables to also be fixed-up.</p>

<p>&lt;dirs&gt; will be passed to BundleUtilities and
should contain and directories to be searched to find
library dependencies.</p>

<p>&lt;plugins_dir&gt; allows an custom plugins directory
to be used.</p>

<p>&lt;request_qt_conf&gt; will force a qt.conf file to be
written even if not needed.</p>

<p>INSTALL_QT4_PLUGIN_PATH(plugin executable copy
installed_plugin_path_var &lt;plugins_dir&gt;
&lt;component&gt; &lt;configurations&gt;)</p>

<p>Install (or copy) a resolved &lt;plugin&gt; to the
default plugins directory (or &lt;plugins_dir&gt;) relative
to &lt;executable&gt; and store the result in
&lt;installed_plugin_path_var&gt;.</p>

<p>If &lt;copy&gt; is set to TRUE then the plugins will be
copied rather than installed. This is to allow this module
to be used at CMake time rather than install time.</p>

<p>If &lt;component&gt; is set then anything installed will
use this COM- PONENT.</p>

<p>INSTALL_QT4_PLUGIN(plugin executable copy
installed_plugin_path_var &lt;plugins_dir&gt;
&lt;component&gt;)</p>

<p>Install (or copy) an unresolved &lt;plugin&gt; to the
default plugins directory (or &lt;plugins_dir&gt;) relative
to &lt;executable&gt; and store the result in
&lt;installed_plugin_path_var&gt;. See documentation of
INSTALL_QT4_PLUGIN_PATH.</p>

<p>INSTALL_QT4_EXECUTABLE(&lt;executable&gt;
[&lt;qtplugins&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;
&lt;plugins_dir&gt; &lt;request_qt_conf&gt;
&lt;component&gt;])</p>

<p>Installs Qt plugins, writes a Qt configuration file (if
needed) and fixes up a Qt4 executable using BundleUtilities
so it is standalone and can be drag-and-drop copied to
another machine as long as all of the system libraries are
compatible. The exe- cutable will be fixed-up at install
time. &lt;component&gt; is the COMPONENT used for bundle
fixup and plugin installation. See documentation of
FIXUP_QT4_BUNDLE.</p>

<p>Documentation DocumentationVTK.cmake</p>

<p>This file provides support for the VTK documentation
framework. It relies on several tools (Doxygen, Perl,
etc).</p>

<p>ExternalData Manage data files stored outside source
tree</p>

<p>Use this module to unambiguously reference data files
stored outside the source tree and fetch them at build time
from arbi- trary local and remote content-addressed
locations. Functions provided by this module recognize
arguments with the syntax &quot;DATA{&lt;name&gt;}&quot; as
references to external data, replace them with full paths to
local copies of those data, and create build rules to fetch
and update the local copies.</p>

<p>The DATA{} syntax is literal and the &lt;name&gt; is a
full or rela- tive path within the source tree. The source
tree must contain either a real data file at &lt;name&gt; or
a &quot;content link&quot; at &lt;name&gt;&lt;ext&gt;
containing a hash of the real file using a hash algorithm
corresponding to &lt;ext&gt;. For example, the argument
&quot;DATA{img.png}&quot; may be satisfied by either a real
&quot;img.png&quot; file in the current source directory or
a &quot;img.png.md5&quot; file contain- ing its MD5 sum.</p>

<p>The ExternalData_Expand_Arguments function evaluates
DATA{} references in its arguments and constructs a new list
of argu- ments:</p>

<p>ExternalData_Expand_Arguments( &lt;target&gt; # Name of
data management target &lt;outVar&gt; # Output variable
[args...] # Input arguments, DATA{} allowed )</p>

<p>It replaces each DATA{} reference in an argument with
the full path of a real data file on disk that will exist
after the &lt;tar- get&gt; builds.</p>

<p>The ExternalData_Add_Test function wraps around the
CMake add_test() command but supports DATA{} references in
its argu- ments:</p>

<p>ExternalData_Add_Test( &lt;target&gt; # Name of data
management target ... # Arguments of add_test(), DATA{}
allowed )</p>

<p>It passes its arguments through
ExternalData_Expand_Arguments and then invokes add_test()
using the results.</p>

<p>The ExternalData_Add_Target function creates a custom
target to manage local instances of data files stored
externally:</p>

<p>ExternalData_Add_Target( &lt;target&gt; # Name of data
management target )</p>

<p>It creates custom commands in the target as necessary to
make data files available for each DATA{} reference
previously evalu- ated by other functions provided by this
module. A list of URL templates must be provided in the
variable ExternalData_URL_TEM- PLATES using the placeholders
&quot;%(algo)&quot; and &quot;%(hash)&quot; in each
template. Data fetch rules try each URL template in order by
substituting the hash algorithm name for &quot;%(algo)&quot;
and the hash value for &quot;%(hash)&quot;.</p>

<p>The following hash algorithms are supported:</p>

<p>%(algo) &lt;ext&gt; Description ------- -----

<p>Note that the hashes are used only for unique data
identifica- tion and download verification. This is not
security software.</p>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<p>include(ExternalData) set(ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES
&quot;file:///local/%(algo)/%(hash)&quot;
&quot;http://data.org/%(algo)/%(hash)&quot;)
ExternalData_Add_Test(MyData NAME MyTest COMMAND MyExe
DATA{MyInput.png} ) ExternalData_Add_Target(MyData)</p>

<p>When test &quot;MyTest&quot; runs the
&quot;DATA{MyInput.png}&quot; argument will be replaced by
the full path to a real instance of the data file
&quot;MyInput.png&quot; on disk. If the source tree contains
a content link such as &quot;MyInput.png.md5&quot; then the
&quot;MyData&quot; target creates a real
&quot;MyInput.png&quot; in the build tree.</p>

<p>The DATA{} syntax can be told to fetch a file series
using the form &quot;DATA{&lt;name&gt;,:}&quot;, where the
&quot;:&quot; is literal. If the source tree contains a
group of files or content links named like a series then a
reference to one member adds rules to fetch all of them.
Although all members of a series are fetched, only the file
originally named by the DATA{} argument is substituted for
it. The default configuration recognizes file series names
end- ing with &quot;#.ext&quot;, &quot;_#.ext&quot;,
&quot;.#.ext&quot;, or &quot;-#.ext&quot; where
&quot;#&quot; is a sequence of decimal digits and
&quot;.ext&quot; is any single extension. Configure it with
a regex that parses &lt;number&gt; and &lt;suffix&gt; parts
from the end of &lt;name&gt;:</p>

<p>ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE = regex of the form
(&lt;number&gt;)(&lt;suffix&gt;)$</p>

<p>For more complicated cases set:</p>

<p>ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE = regex with at least two ()
groups ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_PREFIX = &lt;prefix&gt;
regex group number, if any ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_NUMBER
= &lt;number&gt; regex group number
ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_SUFFIX = &lt;suffix&gt; regex
group number</p>

<p>Configure series number matching with a regex that
matches the &lt;number&gt; part of series members named
&lt;prefix&gt;&lt;number&gt;&lt;suffix&gt;:</p>

<p>ExternalData_SERIES_MATCH = regex matching
&lt;number&gt; in all series members</p>

<p>Note that the &lt;suffix&gt; of a series does not
include a hash-algo- rithm extension.</p>

<p>The DATA{} syntax can alternatively match files
associated with the named file and contained in the same
directory. Associated files may be specified by options
using the syntax
DATA{&lt;name&gt;,&lt;opt1&gt;,&lt;opt2&gt;,...}. Each
option may specify one file by name or specify a regular
expression to match file names using the syntax
REGEX:&lt;regex&gt;. For example, the arguments</p>

<p>DATA{MyData/MyInput.mhd,MyInput.img} # File pair
DATA{MyData/MyFrames00.png,REGEX:MyFrames[0-9]+\.png} #
Series</p>

<p>will pass MyInput.mha and MyFrames00.png on the command
line but ensure that the associated files are present next
to them.</p>

<p>The DATA{} syntax may reference a directory using a
trailing slash and a list of associated files. The form
DATA{&lt;name&gt;/,&lt;opt1&gt;,&lt;opt2&gt;,...} adds rules
to fetch any files in the directory that match one of the
associated file options. For example, the argument
DATA{MyDataDir/,REGEX:.*} will pass the full path to a
MyDataDir directory on the command line and ensure that the
directory contains files corresponding to every file or
content link in the MyDataDir source directory.</p>

<p>The variable ExternalData_LINK_CONTENT may be set to the
name of a supported hash algorithm to enable automatic
conversion of real data files referenced by the DATA{}
syntax into content links. For each such &lt;file&gt; a
content link named &quot;&lt;file&gt;&lt;ext&gt;&quot; is
created. The original file is renamed to the form
&quot;.Exter- nalData_&lt;algo&gt;_&lt;hash&gt;&quot; to
stage it for future transmission to one of the locations in
the list of URL templates (by means out- side the scope of
this module). The data fetch rule created for the content
link will use the staged object if it cannot be found using
any URL template.</p>

<p>The variable ExternalData_OBJECT_STORES may be set to a
list of local directories that store objects using the
layout &lt;dir&gt;/%(algo)/%(hash). These directories will
be searched first for a needed object. If the object is not
available in any store then it will be fetched remotely
using the URL templates and added to the first local store
listed. If no stores are specified the default is a location
inside the build tree.</p>

<p>The variable ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT may be set to the
highest source directory containing any path named by a
DATA{} refer- ence. The default is CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.
External- Data_SOURCE_ROOT and CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR must refer
to directories within a single source distribution (e.g.
they come together in one tarball).</p>

<p>The variable ExternalData_BINARY_ROOT may be set to the
direc- tory to hold the real data files named by expanded
DATA{} refer- ences. The default is CMAKE_BINARY_DIR. The
directory layout will mirror that of content links under
External- Data_SOURCE_ROOT.</p>

<p>Variables ExternalData_TIMEOUT_INACTIVITY and
ExternalData_TIME- OUT_ABSOLUTE set the download inactivity
and absolute timeouts, in seconds. The defaults are 60
seconds and 300 seconds, respectively. Set either timeout to
0 seconds to disable enforcement.</p>

<p>ExternalProject Create custom targets to build projects
in external trees</p>

<p>The ExternalProject_Add function creates a custom target
to drive download, update/patch, configure, build, install
and test steps of an external project:</p>

<p>ExternalProject_Add(&lt;name&gt; # Name for custom
target [DEPENDS projects...] # Targets on which the project
depends [PREFIX dir] # Root dir for entire project
[LIST_SEPARATOR sep] # Sep to be replaced by ; in cmd lines

<p>The *_DIR options specify directories for the project,
with default directories computed as follows. If the PREFIX
option is given to ExternalProject_Add() or the EP_PREFIX
directory prop- erty is set, then an external project is
built and installed under the specified prefix:</p>

<p>TMP_DIR = &lt;prefix&gt;/tmp STAMP_DIR =
&lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;-stamp DOWNLOAD_DIR =
&lt;prefix&gt;/src SOURCE_DIR =
&lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt; BINARY_DIR =
&lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;-build INSTALL_DIR =
&lt;prefix&gt;</p>

<p>Otherwise, if the EP_BASE directory property is set then
compo- nents of an external project are stored under the
specified base:</p>

<p>TMP_DIR = &lt;base&gt;/tmp/&lt;name&gt; STAMP_DIR =
&lt;base&gt;/Stamp/&lt;name&gt; DOWNLOAD_DIR =
&lt;base&gt;/Download/&lt;name&gt; SOURCE_DIR =
&lt;base&gt;/Source/&lt;name&gt; BINARY_DIR =
&lt;base&gt;/Build/&lt;name&gt; INSTALL_DIR =
&lt;base&gt;/Install/&lt;name&gt;</p>

<p>If no PREFIX, EP_PREFIX, or EP_BASE is specified then
the default is to set PREFIX to
&quot;&lt;name&gt;-prefix&quot;. Relative paths are
interpreted with respect to the build directory
corresponding to the source directory in which
ExternalProject_Add is invoked.</p>

<p>If SOURCE_DIR is explicitly set to an existing directory
the project will be built from it. Otherwise a download step
must be specified using one of the DOWNLOAD_COMMAND, CVS_*,
SVN_*, or URL options. The URL option may refer locally to a
directory or source tarball, or refer to a remote tarball
(e.g. http://.../src.tgz).</p>

<p>The ExternalProject_Add_Step function adds a custom step
to an external project:</p>

<p>ExternalProject_Add_Step(&lt;name&gt; &lt;step&gt; #
Names of project and custom step [COMMAND cmd...] # Command
line invoked by this step [COMMENT &quot;text...&quot;] #
Text printed when step executes [DEPENDEES steps...] # Steps
on which this step depends [DEPENDERS steps...] # Steps that
depend on this step [DEPENDS files...] # Files on which this
step depends [ALWAYS 1] # No stamp file, step always runs
[WORKING_DIRECTORY dir] # Working directory for command [LOG
1] # Wrap step in script to log output )</p>

<p>The command line, comment, and working directory of
every stan- dard and custom step is processed to replace
tokens &lt;SOURCE_DIR&gt;, &lt;BINARY_DIR&gt;,
&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;, and &lt;TMP_DIR&gt; with corresponding
property values.</p>

<p>Any builtin step that specifies a
&quot;&lt;step&gt;_COMMAND cmd...&quot; or custom step that
specifies a &quot;COMMAND cmd...&quot; may specify addi-
tional command lines using the form &quot;COMMAND
cmd...&quot;. At build time the commands will be executed in
order and aborted if any one fails. For example:</p>

<p>... BUILD_COMMAND make COMMAND echo done ...</p>

<p>specifies to run &quot;make&quot; and then &quot;echo
done&quot; during the build step. Whether the current
working directory is preserved between commands is not
defined. Behavior of shell operators like
&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; is not defined.</p>

<p>The ExternalProject_Get_Property function retrieves
external project target properties:</p>

<p>ExternalProject_Get_Property(&lt;name&gt; [prop1 [prop2
[...]]])</p>

<p>It stores property values in variables of the same name.
Prop- erty names correspond to the keyword argument names of
ExternalProject_Add.</p>

<p>The ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets function generates
custom targets for the steps listed:</p>

<p>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(&lt;name&gt; [step1
[step2 [...]]])</p>

<p>If STEP_TARGETS is set then
ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets is automatically called at
the end of matching calls to External- Project_Add_Step.
Pass STEP_TARGETS explicitly to individual
ExternalProject_Add calls, or implicitly to all ExternalPro-
ject_Add calls by setting the directory property
EP_STEP_TAR- GETS.</p>

<p>If STEP_TARGETS is not set, clients may still manually
call ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets after calling
ExternalPro- ject_Add or ExternalProject_Add_Step.</p>

<p>This functionality is provided to make it easy to drive
the steps independently of each other by specifying targets
on build command lines. For example, you may be submitting
to a sub-project based dashboard, where you want to drive
the config- ure portion of the build, then submit to the
dashboard, followed by the build portion, followed by tests.
If you invoke a custom target that depends on a step halfway
through the step depen- dency chain, then all the previous
steps will also run to ensure everything is up to date.</p>

<p>For example, to drive configure, build and test steps
indepen- dently for each ExternalProject_Add call in your
project, write the following line prior to any
ExternalProject_Add calls in your CMakeLists file:</p>

<p>set_property(DIRECTORY PROPERTY EP_STEP_TARGETS
configure build test)</p>

<p>FeatureSummary Macros for generating a summary of
enabled/disabled features</p>

<p>This module provides the macros feature_summary(),
set_pack- age_properties() and add_feature_info(). For
compatibility it also still provides set_package_info(),
set_feature_info(), print_enabled_features() and
print_disabled_features().</p>

<p>These macros can be used to generate a summary of
enabled and disabled packages and/or feature for a build
tree:</p>

<p>-- The following OPTIONAL packages have been found:
LibXml2 (required version &gt;= 2.4) , XML processing
library. , &lt;http://xmlsoft.org&gt; * Enables HTML-import
in MyWordProcessor * Enables odt-export in MyWordProcessor
PNG , A PNG image library. ,
&lt;http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/&gt; * Enables saving
screenshots -- The following OPTIONAL packages have not been
found: Lua51 , The Lua scripting language. ,
&lt;http://www.lua.org&gt; * Enables macros in
MyWordProcessor Foo , Foo provides cool stuff.</p>

<p>FEATURE_SUMMARY( [FILENAME &lt;file&gt;] [APPEND] [VAR
&lt;variable_name&gt;] [INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES]
[FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES] [DESCRIPTION
&quot;Found packages:&quot;] WHAT (ALL | PACKAGES_FOUND |
PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND | ENABLED_FEATURES | DISABLED_FEATURES]
)</p>

<p>The FEATURE_SUMMARY() macro can be used to print
information about enabled or disabled packages or features
of a project. By default, only the names of the
features/packages will be printed and their required version
when one was specified. Use SET_PACK- AGE_PROPERTIES() to
add more useful information, like e.g. a download URL for
the respective package or their purpose in the project.</p>

<p>The WHAT option is the only mandatory option. Here you
specify what information will be printed:</p>

<p>ALL: print everything ENABLED_FEATURES: the list of all
features which are enabled DISABLED_FEATURES: the list of
all features which are disabled PACKAGES_FOUND: the list of
all packages which have been found PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: the
list of all packages which have not been found
OPTIONAL_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have been
found which have the type OPTIONAL
OPTIONAL_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which have
not been found which have the type OPTIONAL
RECOMMENDED_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have
been found which have the type RECOMMENDED
RECOMMENDED_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which
have not been found which have the type RECOMMENDED
REQUIRED_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have been
found which have the type REQUIRED
REQUIRED_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which have
not been found which have the type REQUIRED
RUNTIME_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have been
found which have the type RUNTIME
RUNTIME_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which have
not been found which have the type RUNTIME</p>

<p>If a FILENAME is given, the information is printed into
this file. If APPEND is used, it is appended to this file,
otherwise the file is overwritten if it already existed. If
the VAR option is used, the information is
&quot;printed&quot; into the specified vari- able. If
FILENAME is not used, the information is printed to the
terminal. Using the DESCRIPTION option a description or
headline can be set which will be printed above the actual
content. If INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES is given, packages which
have been searched with find_package(... QUIET) will also be
listed. By default they are skipped. If
FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES is given, CMake will
abort if a package which is marked as REQUIRED has not been
found.</p>

<p>Example 1, append everything to a file:</p>

<p>feature_summary(WHAT ALL FILENAME
${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/all.log APPEND)</p>

<p>Example 2, print the enabled features into the variable
enabled- FeaturesText, including QUIET packages:</p>

<p>feature_summary(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES
INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES DESCRIPTION &quot;Enabled
Features:&quot; VAR enabledFeaturesText) message(STATUS
&quot;${enabledFeaturesText}&quot;)</p>

<p>SET_PACKAGE_PROPERTIES(&lt;name&gt; PROPERTIES [ URL
&lt;url&gt; ] [ DESCRIPTION &lt;description&gt; ] [ TYPE
(RUNTIME|OPTIONAL|RECOMMENDED|REQUIRED) ] [ PURPOSE
&lt;purpose&gt; ] )</p>

<p>Use this macro to set up information about the named
package, which can then be displayed via FEATURE_SUMMARY().
This can be done either directly in the Find-module or in
the project which uses the module after the find_package()
call. The features for which information can be set are
added automatically by the find_package() command.</p>

<p>URL: this should be the homepage of the package, or
something similar. Ideally this is set already directly in
the Find-mod- ule.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A short description what that package is,
at most one sentence. Ideally this is set already directly
in the Find-module.</p>

<p>TYPE: What type of dependency has the using project on
that package. Default is OPTIONAL. In this case it is a
package which can be used by the project when available at
buildtime, but it also work without. RECOMMENDED is similar
to OPTIONAL, i.e. the project will build if the package is
not present, but the func- tionality of the resulting
binaries will be severly limited. If a REQUIRED package is
not available at buildtime, the project may not even build.
This can be combined with the FATAL_ON_MISS-
ING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES argument for feature_summary(). Last,
a RUNTIME package is a package which is actually not used at
all during the build, but which is required for actually
running the resulting binaries. So if such a package is
missing, the project can still be built, but it may not work
later on. If set_pack- age_properties() is called multiple
times for the same package with different TYPEs, the TYPE is
only changed to higher TYPEs ( RUNTIME &lt; OPTIONAL &lt;
RECOMMENDED &lt; REQUIRED ), lower TYPEs are ignored. The
TYPE property is project-specific, so it cannot be set by
the Find-module, but must be set in the project.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: This describes which features this package
enables in the project, i.e. it tells the user what
functionality he gets in the resulting binaries. If
set_package_properties() is called multiple times for a
package, all PURPOSE properties are appended to a list of
purposes of the package in the project. As the TYPE
property, also the PURPOSE property is project-spe- cific,
so it cannot be set by the Find-module, but must be set in
the project.</p>

<p>Example for setting the info for a package:</p>

<p>find_package(LibXml2) set_package_properties(LibXml2
PROPERTIES DESCRIPTION &quot;A XML processing library.&quot;
URL &quot;http://xmlsoft.org/&quot;)</p>

<p>set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES TYPE
RECOMMENDED PURPOSE &quot;Enables HTML-import in
MyWordProcessor&quot;) ... set_package_properties(LibXml2
PROPERTIES TYPE OPTIONAL PURPOSE &quot;Enables odt-export in
MyWordProcessor&quot;)</p>

<p>find_package(DBUS) set_package_properties(DBUS
PROPERTIES TYPE RUNTIME PURPOSE &quot;Necessary to disable
the screensaver during a presentation&quot; )</p>

<p>ADD_FEATURE_INFO(&lt;name&gt; &lt;enabled&gt;
&lt;description&gt;)</p>

<p>Use this macro to add information about a feature with
the given &lt;name&gt;. &lt;enabled&gt; contains whether
this feature is enabled or not, &lt;description&gt; is a
text describing the feature. The infor- mation can be
displayed using feature_summary() for ENABLED_FEA- TURES and
DISABLED_FEATURES respectively.</p>

<p>Example for setting the info for a feature:</p>

<p>option(WITH_FOO &quot;Help for foo&quot; ON)
add_feature_info(Foo WITH_FOO &quot;The Foo feature provides
very cool stuff.&quot;)</p>

<p>The following macros are provided for compatibility with
previ- ous CMake versions:</p>

<p>SET_PACKAGE_INFO(&lt;name&gt; &lt;description&gt;
[&lt;url&gt; [&lt;purpose&gt;] ] )</p>

<p>Use this macro to set up information about the named
package, which can then be displayed via FEATURE_SUMMARY().
This can be done either directly in the Find-module or in
the project which uses the module after the find_package()
call. The features for which information can be set are
added automatically by the find_package() command.</p>

<p>PRINT_ENABLED_FEATURES()</p>

<p>Does the same as FEATURE_SUMMARY(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES
DESCRIP- TION &quot;Enabled features:&quot;)</p>

<p>PRINT_DISABLED_FEATURES()</p>

<p>Does the same as FEATURE_SUMMARY(WHAT DISABLED_FEATURES
DESCRIPTION &quot;Disabled features:&quot;)</p>

<p>SET_FEATURE_INFO(&lt;name&gt; &lt;description&gt;
[&lt;url&gt;] )</p>

<p>Does the same as SET_PACKAGE_INFO(&lt;name&gt;
&lt;description&gt; &lt;url&gt; )</p>

<p>FindALSA Find alsa</p>

<p>Find the alsa libraries (asound)</p>

<p>This module defines the following variables: ALSA_FOUND
- True if ALSA_INCLUDE_DIR &amp; ALSA_LIBRARY are found
ALSA_LIBRARIES - Set when ALSA_LIBRARY is found
ALSA_INCLUDE_DIRS - Set when ALSA_INCLUDE_DIR is found</p>

<p>ALSA_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find asoundlib.h, etc.
ALSA_LIBRARY - the asound library ALSA_VERSION_STRING - the
version of alsa found (since CMake 2.8.8)</p>

<p>FindASPELL Try to find ASPELL</p>

<p>Once done this will define</p>

<p>ASPELL_FOUND - system has ASPELL ASPELL_EXECUTABLE - the
ASPELL executable ASPELL_INCLUDE_DIR - the ASPELL include
directory ASPELL_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use
ASPELL ASPELL_DEFINITIONS - Compiler switches required for
using ASPELL</p>

<p>FindAVIFile Locate AVIFILE library and include paths</p>

<p>AVIFILE (http://avifile.sourceforge.net/)is a set of
libraries for i386 machines to use various AVI codecs.
Support is limited beyond Linux. Windows provides native AVI
support, and so doesnt need this library. This module
defines</p>

<p>AVIFILE_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find avifile.h , etc.
AVIFILE_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against
AVIFILE_DEFINITIONS, definitions to use when compiling
AVIFILE_FOUND, If false, dont try to use AVIFILE</p>

<p>FindArmadillo Find Armadillo</p>

<p>Find the Armadillo C++ library</p>

<p>Using Armadillo:</p>

<p>find_package(Armadillo REQUIRED)
include_directories(${ARMADILLO_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_executable(foo foo.cc) target_link_libraries(foo
${ARMADILLO_LIBRARIES})</p>

<p>This module sets the following variables:</p>

<p>ARMADILLO_FOUND - set to true if the library is found
ARMADILLO_INCLUDE_DIRS - list of required include
directories ARMADILLO_LIBRARIES - list of libraries to be
linked ARMADILLO_VERSION_MAJOR - major version number
ARMADILLO_VERSION_MINOR - minor version number
ARMADILLO_VERSION_PATCH - patch version number
ARMADILLO_VERSION_STRING - version number as a string (ex:
&quot;1.0.4&quot;) ARMADILLO_VERSION_NAME - name of the
version (ex: &quot;Antipodean Antileech&quot;)</p>

<p>FindBISON Find bison executable and provides macros to
generate custom build rules</p>

<p>The module defines the following variables:</p>

<p>BISON_EXECUTABLE - path to the bison program
BISON_VERSION - version of bison BISON_FOUND - true if the
program was found</p>

<p>The minimum required version of bison can be specified
using the standard CMake syntax, e.g. find_package(BISON
2.1.3)</p>

<p>If bison is found, the module defines the macros:</p>

<p>BISON_TARGET(&lt;Name&gt; &lt;YaccInput&gt;
&lt;CodeOutput&gt; [VERBOSE &lt;file&gt;] [COMPILE_FLAGS
&lt;string&gt;])</p>

<p>which will create a custom rule to generate a parser.
&lt;YaccIn- put&gt; is the path to a yacc file.
&lt;CodeOutput&gt; is the name of the source file generated
by bison. A header file is also be generated, and contains
the token list. If COMPILE_FLAGS option is specified, the
next parameter is added in the bison command line. if
VERBOSE option is specified, &lt;file&gt; is created and
contains verbose descriptions of the grammar and parser. The
macro defines a set of variables:</p>

<p>BISON_${Name}_DEFINED - true is the macro ran
successfully BISON_${Name}_INPUT - The input source file, an
alias for &lt;YaccInput&gt; BISON_${Name}_OUTPUT_SOURCE -
The source file generated by bison
BISON_${Name}_OUTPUT_HEADER - The header file generated by
bison BISON_${Name}_OUTPUTS - The sources files generated by
bison BISON_${Name}_COMPILE_FLAGS - Options used in the
bison command line</p>


<p>====================================================================
Example:</p>

<p>find_package(BISON) BISON_TARGET(MyParser parser.y
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.cpp) add_executable(Foo
main.cpp ${BISON_MyParser_OUTPUTS})
====================================================================</p>

<p>FindBLAS Find BLAS library</p>

<p>This module finds an installed fortran library that
implements the BLAS linear-algebra interface (see
http://www.netlib.org/blas/). The list of libraries searched
for is taken from the autoconf macro file, acx_blas.m4
(distributed at
http://ac-archive.sourceforge.net/ac-archive/acx_blas.html).</p>

<p>This module sets the following variables:</p>

<p>BLAS_FOUND - set to true if a library implementing the
BLAS interface is found BLAS_LINKER_FLAGS - uncached list of
required linker flags (excluding -l and -L). BLAS_LIBRARIES
- uncached list of libraries (using full path name) to link
against to use BLAS BLAS95_LIBRARIES - uncached list of
libraries (using full path name) to link against to use
BLAS95 interface BLAS95_FOUND - set to true if a library
implementing the BLAS f95 interface is found BLA_STATIC if
set on this determines what kind of linkage we do (static)
BLA_VENDOR if set checks only the specified vendor, if not
set checks all the possibilities BLA_F95 if set on tries to
find the f95 interfaces for BLAS/LAPACK</p>

<p>C/CXX should be enabled to use Intel mkl</p>

<p>FindBZip2 Try to find BZip2</p>

<p>Once done this will define</p>

<p>BZIP2_FOUND - system has BZip2 BZIP2_INCLUDE_DIR - the
BZip2 include directory BZIP2_LIBRARIES - Link these to use
BZip2 BZIP2_NEED_PREFIX - this is set if the functions are
prefixed with BZ2_ BZIP2_VERSION_STRING - the version of
BZip2 found (since CMake 2.8.8)</p>

<p>FindBoost Find Boost include dirs and libraries</p>

<p>Use this module by invoking find_package with the
form:</p>

<p>find_package(Boost [version] [EXACT] # Minimum or EXACT
version e.g. 1.36.0 [REQUIRED] # Fail with error if Boost is
not found [COMPONENTS &lt;libs&gt;...] # Boost libraries by
their canonical name ) # e.g. &quot;date_time&quot; for
&quot;libboost_date_time&quot;</p>

<p>This module finds headers and requested component
libraries OR a CMake package configuration file provided by
a &quot;Boost CMake&quot; build. For the latter case skip to
the &quot;Boost CMake&quot; section below. For the former
case results are reported in variables:</p>

<p>Boost_FOUND - True if headers and requested libraries
were found Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS - Boost include directories
Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS - Link directories for Boost libraries
Boost_LIBRARIES - Boost component libraries to be linked
Boost_&lt;C&gt;_FOUND - True if component &lt;C&gt; was
found (&lt;C&gt; is upper-case) Boost_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY -
Libraries to link for component &lt;C&gt; (may include
target_link_libraries debug/optimized keywords)
Boost_VERSION - BOOST_VERSION value from boost/version.hpp
Boost_LIB_VERSION - Version string appended to library
filenames Boost_MAJOR_VERSION - Boost major version number
(X in X.y.z) Boost_MINOR_VERSION - Boost minor version
number (Y in x.Y.z) Boost_SUBMINOR_VERSION - Boost subminor
version number (Z in x.y.Z) Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS
(Windows) - Pass to add_definitions() to have diagnostic
information about Boosts automatic linking displayed during
compilation</p>

<p>This module reads hints about search locations from
variables:</p>

<p>BOOST_ROOT - Preferred installation prefix (or
BOOSTROOT) BOOST_INCLUDEDIR - Preferred include directory
e.g. &lt;prefix&gt;/include BOOST_LIBRARYDIR - Preferred
library directory e.g. &lt;prefix&gt;/lib
Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS - Set to ON to disable searching in
locations not specified by these hint variables. Default is
OFF. Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS - List of Boost versions not
known to this module (Boost install locations may contain
the version)</p>

<p>and saves search results persistently in CMake cache
entries:</p>

<p>Boost_INCLUDE_DIR - Directory containing Boost headers
Boost_LIBRARY_DIR - Directory containing Boost libraries
Boost_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY_DEBUG - Component &lt;C&gt; library
debug variant Boost_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY_RELEASE - Component
&lt;C&gt; library release variant</p>

<p>Users may set these hints or results as cache entries.
Projects should not read these entries directly but instead
use the above result variables. Note that some hint names
start in upper-case &quot;BOOST&quot;. One may specify these
as environment variables if they are not specified as CMake
variables or cache entries.</p>

<p>This module first searches for the Boost header files
using the above hint variables (excluding BOOST_LIBRARYDIR)
and saves the result in Boost_INCLUDE_DIR. Then it searches
for requested component libraries using the above hints
(excluding BOOST_INCLUDEDIR and Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS),
&quot;lib&quot; directo- ries near Boost_INCLUDE_DIR, and
the library name configuration settings below. It saves the
library directory in Boost_LIBRARY_DIR and individual
library locations in Boost_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY_DEBUG and
Boost_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY_RELEASE. When one changes settings
used by previous searches in the same build tree (excluding
environment variables) this module discards pre- vious
search results affected by the changes and searches
again.</p>

<p>Boost libraries come in many variants encoded in their
file name. Users or projects may tell this module which
variant to find by setting variables:</p>

<p>Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED - Set to OFF to use the
non-multithreaded libraries ( mt tag). Default is ON.
Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS - Set to ON to force the use of the
static libraries. Default is OFF. Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME -
Set to ON or OFF to specify whether to use libraries linked
statically to the C++ runtime ( s tag). Default is platform
dependent. Boost_USE_DEBUG_PYTHON - Set to ON to use
libraries compiled with a debug Python build (y tag).
Default is OFF. Boost_USE_STLPORT - Set to ON to use
libraries compiled with STLPort ( p tag). Default is OFF.
Boost_USE_STLPORT_DEPRECATED_NATIVE_IOSTREAMS - Set to ON to
use libraries compiled with STLPort deprecated &quot;native
iostreams&quot; (n tag). Default is OFF. Boost_COMPILER -
Set to the compiler-specific library suffix (e.g.
&quot;-gcc43&quot;). Default is auto-computed for the C++
compiler in use. Boost_THREADAPI - Suffix for
&quot;thread&quot; component library name, such as
&quot;pthread&quot; or &quot;win32&quot;. Names with and
without this suffix will both be tried.</p>

<p>Other variables one may set to control this module
are:</p>

<p>Boost_DEBUG - Set to ON to enable debug output from
FindBoost. Please enable this before filing any bug report.
Boost_DETAILED_FAILURE_MSG - Set to ON to add detailed
information to the failure message even when the REQUIRED
option is not given to the find_package call. Boost_REALPATH
- Set to ON to resolve symlinks for discovered libraries to
assist with packaging. For example, the &quot;system&quot;
component library may be resolved to
&quot;/usr/lib/libboost_system.so.1.42.0&quot; instead of
&quot;/usr/lib/libboost_system.so&quot;. This does not
affect linking and should not be enabled unless the user
needs this information.</p>

<p>On Visual Studio and Borland compilers Boost headers
request automatic linking to corresponding libraries. This
requires matching libraries to be linked explicitly or
available in the link library search path. In this case
setting Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS to OFF may not achieve dynamic
linking. Boost automatic linking typically requests static
libraries with a few exceptions (such as Boost.Python).
Use</p>


<p>add_definitions(${Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS})</p>

<p>to ask Boost to report information about automatic
linking requests.</p>

<p>Example to find Boost headers only:</p>

<p>find_package(Boost 1.36.0) if(Boost_FOUND)
include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_executable(foo foo.cc) endif()</p>

<p>Example to find Boost headers and some libraries:</p>

<p>set(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS ON)
set(Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED ON) set(Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME
OFF) find_package(Boost 1.36.0 COMPONENTS date_time
filesystem system ...) if(Boost_FOUND)
include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_executable(foo foo.cc) target_link_libraries(foo
${Boost_LIBRARIES}) endif()</p>

<p>Boost CMake
----------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>If Boost was built using the boost-cmake project it
provides a package configuration file for use with
find_packages Config mode. This module looks for the package
configuration file called BoostConfig.cmake or
boost-config.cmake and stores the result in cache entry
&quot;Boost_DIR&quot;. If found, the package con- figuration
file is loaded and this module returns with no fur- ther
action. See documentation of the Boost CMake package con-
figuration for details on what it provides.</p>

<p>Set Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE to ON to disable the search for
boost-cmake.</p>

<p>FindBullet Try to find the Bullet physics engine</p>

<p>This module defines the following variables</p>

<p>BULLET_FOUND - Was bullet found BULLET_INCLUDE_DIRS -
the Bullet include directories BULLET_LIBRARIES - Link to
this, by default it includes all bullet components
(Dynamics, Collision, LinearMath, &amp; SoftBody)</p>

<p>This module accepts the following variables</p>

<p>BULLET_ROOT - Can be set to bullet install path or
Windows build path</p>

<p>FindCABLE Find CABLE</p>

<p>This module finds if CABLE is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>CABLE the path to the cable executable CABLE_TCL_LIBRARY
the path to the Tcl wrapper library CABLE_INCLUDE_DIR the
path to the include directory</p>

<p>To build Tcl wrappers, you should add shared library and
link it to ${CABLE_TCL_LIBRARY}. You should also add
${CABLE_INCLUDE_DIR} as an include directory.</p>

<p>FindCUDA Tools for building CUDA C files: libraries and
build dependen- cies.</p>

<p>This script locates the NVIDIA CUDA C tools. It should
work on linux, windows, and mac and should be reasonably up
to date with CUDA C releases.</p>

<p>This script makes use of the standard find_package
arguments of &lt;VERSION&gt;, REQUIRED and QUIET. CUDA_FOUND
will report if an acceptable version of CUDA was found.</p>

<p>The script will prompt the user to specify
CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR if the prefix cannot be determined by
the location of nvcc in the system path and REQUIRED is
specified to find_package(). To use a different installed
version of the toolkit set the envi- ronment variable
CUDA_BIN_PATH before running cmake (e.g.
CUDA_BIN_PATH=/usr/local/cuda1.0 instead of the default
/usr/local/cuda) or set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR after
configuring. If you change the value of
CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR, various compo- nents that depend on
the path will be relocated.</p>

<p>It might be necessary to set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR
manually on certain platforms, or to use a cuda runtime not
installed in the default location. In newer versions of the
toolkit the cuda library is included with the graphics
driver- be sure that the driver version matches what is
needed by the cuda runtime ver- sion.</p>

<p>The following variables affect the behavior of the
macros in the script (in alphebetical order). Note that any
of these flags can be changed multiple times in the same
directory before call- ing CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,
CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, CUDA_COMPILE_PTX or
CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.</p>

<p>CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE (Default matches host bit size)
-- Set to ON to compile for 64 bit device code, OFF for 32
bit device code. Note that making this different from the
host code when generating object or C files from CUDA code
just won t work, because size_t gets defined by nvcc in the
generated source. If you compile to PTX and then load the
file yourself, you can mix bit sizes between device and
host.</p>

<p>CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE (Default ON) --
Set to ON if you want the custom build rule to be attached
to the source file in Visual Studio. Turn OFF if you add the
same cuda file to multiple targets.</p>

<p>This allows the user to build the target from the CUDA
file; however, bad things can happen if the CUDA source file
is added to multiple targets. When performing parallel
builds it is possible for the custom build command to be run
more than once and in parallel causing cryptic build errors.
VS runs the rules for every source file in the target, and a
source can have only one rule no matter how many projects it
is added to. When the rule is run from multiple targets race
conditions can occur on the generated file. Eventually
everything will get built, but if the user is unaware of
this behavior, there may be confusion. It would be nice if
this script could detect the reuse of source files across
multiple targets and turn the option off for the user, but
no good solution could be found.</p>

<p>CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN (Default OFF) -- Set to ON to enable
and extra compilation pass with the -cubin option in Device
mode. The output is parsed and register, shared memory usage
is printed during build.</p>

<p>CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION (Default OFF for device mode) --
Set to ON for Emulation mode. -D_DEVICEEMU is defined for
CUDA C files when CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION is TRUE.</p>

<p>CUDA_GENERATED_OUTPUT_DIR (Default
CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR) -- Set to the path you wish to
have the generated files placed. If it is blank output files
will be placed in CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR. Intermediate
files will always be placed in
CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR/CMakeFiles.</p>

<p>CUDA_HOST_COMPILATION_CPP (Default ON) -- Set to OFF for
C compilation of host code.</p>

<p>CUDA_HOST_COMPILER (Default CMAKE_C_COMPILER,
$(VCInstallDir)/bin for VS) -- Set the host compiler to be
used by nvcc. Ignored if -ccbin or --compiler-bindir is
already present in the CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or
CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; variables. For Visual Studio
targets $(VCInstallDir)/bin is a special value that expands
out to the path when the command is run from withing VS.</p>

<p>CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; --
Additional NVCC command line arguments. NOTE: multiple
arguments must be semi-colon delimited (e.g.
--compiler-options;-Wall)</p>

<p>CUDA_PROPAGATE_HOST_FLAGS (Default ON) -- Set to ON to
propagate CMAKE_{C,CXX}_FLAGS and their configuration
dependent counterparts (e.g. CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG)
automatically to the host compiler through nvccs -Xcompiler
flag. This helps make the generated host code match the rest
of the system better. Sometimes certain flags give nvcc
problems, and this will help you turn the flag propagation
off. This does not affect the flags supplied directly to
nvcc via CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or through the OPTION flags
specified through CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, or
CUDA_WRAP_SRCS. Flags used for shared library compilation
are not affected by this flag.</p>

<p>CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION (Default OFF) -- If set this
will enable separable compilation for all CUDA runtime
object files. If used outside of CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and
CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY (e.g. calling CUDA_WRAP_SRCS directly),
CUDA_COMPUTE_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECT_FILE_NAME and
CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS should be
called.</p>

<p>CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD (Default OFF) -- Set to ON to see all
the commands used when building the CUDA file. When using a
Makefile generator the value defaults to VERBOSE (run make
VERBOSE=1 to see output), although setting
CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD to ON will always print the output.</p>

<p>The script creates the following macros (in alphebetical
order):</p>

<p>CUDA_ADD_CUFFT_TO_TARGET( cuda_target ) -- Adds the
cufft library to the target (can be any target). Handles
whether you are in emulation mode or not.</p>

<p>CUDA_ADD_CUBLAS_TO_TARGET( cuda_target ) -- Adds the
cublas library to the target (can be any target). Handles
whether you are in emulation mode or not.</p>

<p>CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE( cuda_target file0 file1 ... [WIN32]
[MACOSX_BUNDLE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] ) --
Creates an executable &quot;cuda_target&quot; which is made
up of the files specified. All of the non CUDA C files are
compiled using the standard build rules specified by CMAKE
and the cuda files are compiled to object files using nvcc
and the host compiler. In addition CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS is
added automatically to include_directories(). Some standard
CMake target calls can be used on the target after calling
this macro (e.g. set_target_properties and
target_link_libraries), but setting properties that adjust
compilation flags will not affect code compiled by nvcc.
Such flags should be modified before calling
CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.</p>

<p>CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY( cuda_target file0 file1 ... [STATIC |
SHARED | MODULE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] ) -- Same
as CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE except that a library is created.</p>

<p>CUDA_BUILD_CLEAN_TARGET() -- Creates a convience target
that deletes all the dependency files generated. You should
make clean after running this target to ensure the
dependency files get regenerated.</p>

<p>CUDA_COMPILE( generated_files file0 file1 ... [STATIC |
SHARED | MODULE] [OPTIONS ...] ) -- Returns a list of
generated files from the input source files to be used with
ADD_LIBRARY or ADD_EXECUTABLE.</p>

<p>CUDA_COMPILE_PTX( generated_files file0 file1 ...
[OPTIONS ...] ) -- Returns a list of PTX files generated
from the input source files.</p>

<p>CUDA_COMPUTE_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECT_FILE_NAME(
output_file_var cuda_target object_files ) -- Compute the
name of the intermediate link file used for separable
compilation. This file name is typically passed into
CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS. output_file_var is
produced based on cuda_target the list of objects files that
need separable compilation as specified by object_files. If
the object_files list is empty, then output_file_var will be
empty. This function is called automatically for
CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY and CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE. Note that this is
a function and not a macro.</p>

<p>CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( path0 path1 ... ) -- Sets the
directories that should be passed to nvcc (e.g. nvcc -Ipath0
-Ipath1 ... ). These paths usually contain other .cu
files.</p>

<p>CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS( output_file_var
cuda_target nvcc_flags object_files)</p>

<p>-- Generates the link object required by separable
compilation from the given object files. This is called
automatically for CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY,
but can be called manually when using CUDA_WRAP_SRCS
directly. When called from CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY or
CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE the nvcc_flags passed in are the same as
the flags passed in via the OPTIONS argument. The only nvcc
flag added automatically is the bitness flag as specified by
CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE. Note that this is a function
instead of a macro.</p>

<p>CUDA_WRAP_SRCS ( cuda_target format generated_files
file0 file1 ... [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [OPTIONS ...] )
-- This is where all the magic happens. CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,
CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, and CUDA_COMPILE_PTX all
call this function under the hood.</p>

<p>Given the list of files (file0 file1 ... fileN) this
macro generates custom commands that generate either PTX or
linkable objects (use &quot;PTX&quot; or &quot;OBJ&quot; for
the format argument to switch). Files that dont end with .cu
or have the HEADER_FILE_ONLY property are ignored.</p>

<p>The arguments passed in after OPTIONS are extra command
line options to give to nvcc. You can also specify per
configuration options by specifying the name of the
configuration followed by the options. General options must
preceed configuration specific options. Not all
configurations need to be specified, only the ones provided
will be used.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -DFLAG=2 &quot;-DFLAG_OTHER=space in flag&quot;
DEBUG -g RELEASE --use_fast_math RELWITHDEBINFO
--use_fast_math;-g MINSIZEREL --use_fast_math</p>

<p>For certain configurations (namely VS generating object
files with CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE set to
ON), no generated file will be produced for the given cuda
file. This is because when you add the cuda file to Visual
Studio it knows that this file produces an object file and
will link in the resulting object file automatically.</p>

<p>This script will also generate a separate cmake script
that is used at build time to invoke nvcc. This is for
several reasons.</p>

<p>1. nvcc can return negative numbers as return values
which confuses Visual Studio into thinking that the command
succeeded. The script now checks the error codes and
produces errors when there was a problem.</p>

<p>2. nvcc has been known to not delete incomplete results
when it encounters problems. This confuses build systems
into thinking the target was generated when in fact an
unusable file exists. The script now deletes the output
files if there was an error.</p>

<p>3. By putting all the options that affect the build into
a file and then make the build rule dependent on the file,
the output files will be regenerated when the options
change.</p>

<p>This script also looks at optional arguments STATIC,
SHARED, or MODULE to determine when to target the object
compilation for a shared library. BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is
ignored in CUDA_WRAP_SRCS, but it is respected in
CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY. On some systems special flags are added
for building objects intended for shared libraries. A
preprocessor macro, &lt;target_name&gt;_EXPORTS is defined
when a shared library compilation is detected.</p>

<p>Flags passed into add_definitions with -D or /D are
passed along to nvcc.</p>

<p>The script defines the following variables:</p>

<p>CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR -- The major version of cuda as
reported by nvcc. CUDA_VERSION_MINOR -- The minor version.
CUDA_VERSION CUDA_VERSION_STRING --
CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR.CUDA_VERSION_MINOR</p>

<p>CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR -- Path to the CUDA Toolkit
(defined if not set). CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR -- Path to the CUDA
SDK. Use this to find files in the SDK. This script will not
directly support finding specific libraries or headers, as
that isnt supported by NVIDIA. If you want to change
libraries when the path changes see the FindCUDA.cmake
script for an example of how to clear these variables. There
are also examples of how to use the CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR to
locate headers or libraries, if you so choose (at your own
risk). CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS -- Include directory for cuda
headers. Added automatically for CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and
CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY. CUDA_LIBRARIES -- Cuda RT library.
CUDA_CUFFT_LIBRARIES -- Device or emulation library for the
Cuda FFT implementation (alternative to:
CUDA_ADD_CUFFT_TO_TARGET macro) CUDA_CUBLAS_LIBRARIES --
Device or emulation library for the Cuda BLAS implementation
(alterative to: CUDA_ADD_CUBLAS_TO_TARGET macro).
CUDA_cupti_LIBRARY -- CUDA Profiling Tools Interface
library. Only available for CUDA version 4.0+.
CUDA_curand_LIBRARY -- CUDA Random Number Generation
library. Only available for CUDA version 3.2+.
CUDA_cusparse_LIBRARY -- CUDA Sparse Matrix library. Only
available for CUDA version 3.2+. CUDA_npp_LIBRARY -- NVIDIA
Performance Primitives library. Only available for CUDA
version 4.0+. CUDA_nppc_LIBRARY -- NVIDIA Performance
Primitives library (core). Only available for CUDA version
5.5+. CUDA_nppi_LIBRARY -- NVIDIA Performance Primitives
library (image processing). Only available for CUDA version

Only available for CUDA version 3.2+. Windows only.
CUDA_nvcuvid_LIBRARY -- CUDA Video Decoder library. Only
available for CUDA version 3.2+. Windows only.</p>

<p>Find the CxxTest suite and declare a helper macro for
creating unit tests and integrating them with CTest. For
more details on CxxTest see http://cxxtest.tigris.org</p>

<p>INPUT Variables</p>

<p>CXXTEST_USE_PYTHON [deprecated since 1.3] Only used in
the case both Python &amp; Perl are detected on the system
to control which CxxTest code generator is used. Valid only
for CxxTest version 3.</p>

<p>NOTE: In older versions of this Find Module, this
variable controlled if the Python test generator was used
instead of the Perl one, regardless of which scripting
language the user had installed.</p>

<p>CXXTEST_TESTGEN_ARGS (since CMake 2.8.3) Specify a list
of options to pass to the CxxTest code generator. If not
defined, --error-printer is passed.</p>

<p>CXXTEST_FOUND True if the CxxTest framework was found
CXXTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS Where to find the CxxTest include
directory CXXTEST_PERL_TESTGEN_EXECUTABLE The perl-based
test generator CXXTEST_PYTHON_TESTGEN_EXECUTABLE The
python-based test generator CXXTEST_TESTGEN_EXECUTABLE
(since CMake 2.8.3) The test generator that is actually used
(chosen using user preferences and interpreters found in the
system) CXXTEST_TESTGEN_INTERPRETER (since CMake 2.8.3) The

enable_testing()</p>

<p>CXXTEST_ADD_TEST(unittest_foo foo_test.cc
${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/foo_test.h)
target_link_libraries(unittest_foo foo) # as needed
endif()</p>

<p>This will (if CxxTest is found): 1. Invoke the testgen
executable to autogenerate foo_test.cc in the binary tree
from &quot;foo_test.h&quot; in the current source directory.
2. Create an executable and test called unittest_foo.</p>

<p>#============= Example foo_test.h:</p>

<p>#include &lt;cxxtest/TestSuite.h&gt;</p>

<p>class MyTestSuite : public CxxTest::TestSuite { public:
void testAddition( void ) { TS_ASSERT( 1 + 1 &gt; 1 );

DART_ROOT to point to where it found it.</p>

<p>FindDevIL</p>

<p>This module locates the developers image library.
http://ope- nil.sourceforge.net/</p>

<p>This module sets:</p>

<p>IL_LIBRARIES - the name of the IL library. These include
the full path to the core DevIL library. This one has to be
linked into the application. ILU_LIBRARIES - the name of the
ILU library. Again, the full path. This library is for
filters and effects, not actual loading. It doesnt have to
be linked if the functionality it provides is not used.
ILUT_LIBRARIES - the name of the ILUT library. Full path.
This part of the library interfaces with OpenGL. It is not
strictly needed in applications. IL_INCLUDE_DIR - where to
find the il.h, ilu.h and ilut.h files. IL_FOUND - this is
set to TRUE if all the above variables were set. This will
be set to false if ILU or ILUT are not found, even if they
are not needed. In most systems, if one library is found all
the others are as well. Thats the way the DevIL developers
release it.</p>

<p>FindDoxygen This module looks for Doxygen and the path
to Graphvizs dot</p>

<p>Doxygen is a documentation generation tool. Please see
http://www.doxygen.org</p>

variables:</p>

<p>DOXYGEN_SKIP_DOT = If true this module will skip trying
to find Dot (an optional component often used by
Doxygen)</p>

<p>This modules defines the following variables:</p>

<p>DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE = The path to the doxygen command.
DOXYGEN_FOUND = Was Doxygen found or not? DOXYGEN_VERSION =
The version reported by doxygen --version</p>

<p>DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE = The path to the dot program
used by doxygen. DOXYGEN_DOT_FOUND = Was Dot found or not?
DOXYGEN_DOT_PATH = The path to dot not including the
executable</p>

<p>FindEXPAT Find expat</p>

<p>Find the native EXPAT headers and libraries.</p>

FLEX_VERSION - the version of flex FLEX_LIBRARIES - The flex
libraries FLEX_INCLUDE_DIRS - The path to the flex
headers</p>

<p>The minimum required version of flex can be specified
using the standard syntax, e.g. find_package(FLEX
2.5.13)</p>

<p>If flex is found on the system, the module provides the
macro:</p>

<p>FLEX_TARGET(Name FlexInput FlexOutput [COMPILE_FLAGS
&lt;string&gt;])</p>

<p>which creates a custom command to generate the
&lt;FlexOutput&gt; file from the &lt;FlexInput&gt; file. If
COMPILE_FLAGS option is specified, the next parameter is
added to the flex command line. Name is an alias used to get
details of this custom command. Indeed the macro defines the
following variables:</p>

<p>FLEX_${Name}_DEFINED - true is the macro ran
successfully FLEX_${Name}_OUTPUTS - the source file
generated by the custom rule, an alias for FlexOutput
FLEX_${Name}_INPUT - the flex source file, an alias for
${FlexInput}</p>

<p>Flex scanners oftenly use tokens defined by Bison: the
code generated by Flex depends of the header generated by
Bison. This module also defines a macro:</p>

<p>ADD_FLEX_BISON_DEPENDENCY(FlexTarget BisonTarget)</p>

<p>which adds the required dependency between a scanner and
a parser where &lt;FlexTarget&gt; and &lt;BisonTarget&gt;
are the first parameters of respectively FLEX_TARGET and
BISON_TARGET macros.</p>


<p>====================================================================
Example:</p>

<p>find_package(BISON) find_package(FLEX)</p>

<p>BISON_TARGET(MyParser parser.y
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.cpp)
FLEX_TARGET(MyScanner lexer.l

[INSTALL_DESTINATION &lt;dest- dir&gt;] LANGUAGES
&lt;lang1&gt; &lt;lang2&gt; ... )</p>

<p>Process the given pot file to mo files. If
INSTALL_DESTINATION is given then automatically install
rules will be created, the language subdirectory will be
taken into account (by default use share/locale/). If ALL is
specified, the pot file is processed when building the all
traget. It creates a custom target &quot;potfile&quot;.</p>

<p>GETTEXT_PROCESS_PO_FILES( &lt;lang&gt; [ALL]
[INSTALL_DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;] PO_FILES &lt;po1&gt;
&lt;po2&gt; ... )</p>

<p>FindHDF5 Find HDF5, a library for reading and writing
self describing array data.</p>

<p>This module invokes the HDF5 wrapper compiler that
should be installed alongside HDF5. Depending upon the HDF5
Configura- tion, the wrapper compiler is called either h5cc
or h5pcc. If this succeeds, the module will then call the
compiler with the -show argument to see what flags are used
when compiling an HDF5 client application.</p>

<p>The module will optionally accept the COMPONENTS
argument. If no COMPONENTS are specified, then the find
module will default to finding only the HDF5 C library. If
one or more COMPONENTS are specified, the module will
attempt to find the language bindings for the specified
components. The only valid compo- nents are C, CXX, Fortran,
HL, and Fortran_HL. If the COMPO- NENTS argument is not
given, the module will attempt to find only the C
bindings.</p>

<p>On UNIX systems, this module will read the variable
HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES to determine whether or not to
prefer a static link to a dynamic link for HDF5 and all of
its depen- dencies. To use this feature, make sure that the
HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES variable is set before the call to
find_package.</p>

<p>To provide the module with a hint about where to find
your HDF5 installation, you can set the environment variable
HDF5_ROOT. The Find module will then look in this path when
searching for HDF5 executables, paths, and libraries.</p>

<p>In addition to finding the includes and libraries
required to compile an HDF5 client application, this module
also makes an effort to find tools that come with the HDF5
distribution that may be useful for regression testing.</p>

<p>FindMPI Find a Message Passing Interface (MPI)
implementation</p>

<p>The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a library used to
write high-performance distributed-memory parallel
applications, and is typically deployed on a cluster. MPI is
a standard interface (defined by the MPI forum) for which
many implementations are available. All of them have
somewhat different include paths, libraries to link against,
etc., and this module tries to smooth out those
differences.</p>

<p>=== Variables ===</p>

<p>This module will set the following variables per
language in your project, where &lt;lang&gt; is one of C,
CXX, or Fortran:</p>

<p>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_FOUND TRUE if FindMPI found MPI flags
for &lt;lang&gt; MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER MPI Compiler
wrapper for &lt;lang&gt; MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILE_FLAGS
Compilation flags for MPI programs
MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_INCLUDE_PATH Include path(s) for MPI header
MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LINK_FLAGS Linking flags for MPI programs
MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARIES All libraries to link MPI
programs against</p>

<p>Additionally, FindMPI sets the following variables for
running MPI programs from the command line:</p>

<p>MPIEXEC Executable for running MPI programs
MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG Flag to pass to MPIEXEC before giving
it the number of processors to run on MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS Flags
to pass to MPIEXEC directly before the executable to run.
MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS Flags to pass to MPIEXEC after other
flags</p>

<p>=== Usage ===</p>

<p>To use this module, simply call FindMPI from a
CMakeLists.txt file, or run find_package(MPI), then run
CMake. If you are happy with the auto- detected
configuration for your language, then youre done. If not,
you have two options:</p>

<p>1. Set MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER to the MPI wrapper
(mpicc, etc.) of your choice and reconfigure. FindMPI will
attempt to determine all the necessary variables using THAT
compiler s compile and link flags. 2. If this fails, or if
your MPI implementation does not come with a compiler
wrapper, then set both MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARIES and
MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_INCLUDE_PATH. You may also set any other
variables listed above, but these two are required. This
will circumvent autodetection entirely.</p>

<p>When configuration is successful,
MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER will be set to the compiler
wrapper for &lt;lang&gt;, if it was found.
MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_FOUND and other variables above will be set
if any MPI implementation was found for &lt;lang&gt;,
regardless of whether a compiler was found.</p>

<p>When using MPIEXEC to execute MPI applications, you
should typi- cally use all of the MPIEXEC flags as
follows:</p>

<p>${MPIEXEC} ${MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG} PROCS
${MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS} EXECUTABLE ${MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS} ARGS</p>

<p>where PROCS is the number of processors on which to
execute the program, EXECUTABLE is the MPI program, and ARGS
are the argu- ments to pass to the MPI program.</p>

<p>=== Backward Compatibility ===</p>

<p>For backward compatibility with older versions of
FindMPI, these variables are set, but deprecated:</p>

<p>MPI_FOUND MPI_COMPILER MPI_LIBRARY MPI_COMPILE_FLAGS
MPI_INCLUDE_PATH MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY MPI_LINK_FLAGS
MPI_LIBRARIES</p>

<p>In new projects, please use the MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_XXX
equivalents.</p>

<p>FindMatlab this module looks for Matlab</p>

<p>Defines:</p>

<p>MATLAB_INCLUDE_DIR: include path for mex.h, engine.h
MATLAB_LIBRARIES: required libraries: libmex, etc

include paths to use Motif MOTIF_LIBRARIES - Link these to
use Motif</p>

<p>FindOpenAL</p>

<p>Locate OpenAL This module defines OPENAL_LIBRARY
OPENAL_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to OpenAL
OPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers</p>

<p>$OPENALDIR is an environment variable that would
correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$OPENALDIR used in
building OpenAL.</p>

<p>Once done this will define</p>

<p>OPENGL_FOUND - system has OpenGL OPENGL_XMESA_FOUND -
system has XMESA OPENGL_GLU_FOUND - system has GLU
OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR - the GL include directory
OPENGL_LIBRARIES - Link these to use OpenGL and GLU</p>

<p>If you want to use just GL you can use these values</p>

<p>OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY - Path to OpenGL Library
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY - Path to GLU Library</p>

<p>On OSX default to using the framework version of opengl
People will have to change the cache values of
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY and OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY to use OpenGL with
X11 on OSX</p>

<p>FindOpenMP Finds OpenMP support</p>

<p>This module can be used to detect OpenMP support in a
compiler. If the compiler supports OpenMP, the flags
required to compile with OpenMP support are returned in
variables for the different languages. The variables may be
empty if the compiler does not need a special flag to
support OpenMP.</p>

<p>The following variables are set:</p>

<p>OpenMP_C_FLAGS - flags to add to the C compiler for
OpenMP support OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS - flags to add to the CXX
compiler for OpenMP support OPENMP_FOUND - true if openmp is
detected</p>

<p>Supported compilers can be found at
http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-compilers/</p>

<p>FindOpenSSL Try to find the OpenSSL encryption
library</p>

<p>Once done this will define</p>

<p>OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR - Set this variable to the root
installation of OpenSSL</p>

<p>Read-Only variables:</p>

<p>OPENSSL_FOUND - system has the OpenSSL library
OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR - the OpenSSL include directory
OPENSSL_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use OpenSSL
OPENSSL_VERSION - This is set to
$major.$minor.$revision$path (eg. 0.9.8s)</p>

<p>FindOpenSceneGraph Find OpenSceneGraph</p>

<p>This module searches for the OpenSceneGraph core
&quot;osg&quot; library as well as OpenThreads, and whatever
additional COMPONENTS (nodekits) that you specify.</p>

<p>See http://www.openscenegraph.org</p>

<p>NOTE: To use this module effectively you must either
require CMake &gt;= 2.6.3 with
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6.3) or download and place
FindOpenThreads.cmake, Findosg_func- tions.cmake,
Findosg.cmake, and Find&lt;etc&gt;.cmake files into your
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.</p>

<p>==================================</p>

<p>This module accepts the following variables (note mixed
case)</p>

<p>OpenSceneGraph_DEBUG - Enable debugging output</p>

<p>OpenSceneGraph_MARK_AS_ADVANCED - Mark cache variables
as advanced automatically</p>

<p>The following environment variables are also respected
for find- ing the OSG and it s various components.
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH can also be used for this (see
find_library() CMake documentation).</p>

<p>&lt;MODULE&gt;_DIR (where MODULE is of the form
&quot;OSGVOLUME&quot; and there is a FindosgVolume.cmake
file) OSG_DIR OSGDIR OSG_ROOT</p>

<p>[CMake 2.8.10]: The CMake variable OSG_DIR can now be
used as well to influence detection, instead of needing to
specify an environment variable.</p>

<p>This module defines the following output variables:</p>

<p>OPENSCENEGRAPH_FOUND - Was the OSG and all of the
specified components found?</p>

<p>OPENSCENEGRAPH_VERSION - The version of the OSG which
was found</p>

<p>OPENSCENEGRAPH_INCLUDE_DIRS - Where to find the
headers</p>

<p>OPENSCENEGRAPH_LIBRARIES - The OSG libraries</p>

<p>================================== Example Usage:</p>

<p>find_package(OpenSceneGraph 2.0.0 REQUIRED osgDB
osgUtil) # libOpenThreads &amp; libosg automatically
searched
include_directories(${OPENSCENEGRAPH_INCLUDE_DIRS})</p>

<p>add_executable(foo foo.cc) target_link_libraries(foo
${OPENSCENEGRAPH_LIBRARIES})</p>

<p>FindOpenThreads</p>

<p>OpenThreads is a C++ based threading library. Its
largest user- base seems to OpenSceneGraph so you might
notice I accept OSGDIR as an environment path. I consider
this part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph
components. Each component is separate and you must opt in
to each module.</p>

<p>Locate OpenThreads This module defines
OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY OPENTHREADS_FOUND, if false, do not try
to link to OpenThreads OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to
find the headers</p>

<p>$OPENTHREADS_DIR is an environment variable that would
corre- spond to the ./configure --prefix=$OPENTHREADS_DIR
used in building osg.</p>

<p>[CMake 2.8.10]: The CMake variables OPENTHREADS_DIR or
OSG_DIR can now be used as well to influence detection,
instead of need- ing to specify an environment variable.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing.</p>

<p>FindPHP4 Find PHP4</p>

<p>This module finds if PHP4 is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>PHP4_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where php.h can be found
PHP4_EXECUTABLE = full path to the php4 binary</p>

<p>FindPNG Find the native PNG includes and library</p>

<p>This module searches libpng, the library for working
with PNG images.</p>

<p>It defines the following variables</p>

<p>PNG_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find png.h, etc.
PNG_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against to use PNG.
PNG_DEFINITIONS - You should
add_definitons(${PNG_DEFINITIONS}) before compiling code
that includes png library files. PNG_FOUND, If false, do not
try to use PNG. PNG_VERSION_STRING - the version of the PNG
library found (since CMake 2.8.8)</p>

<p>Also defined, but not for general use are</p>

<p>PNG_LIBRARY, where to find the PNG library.</p>

<p>For backward compatiblity the variable PNG_INCLUDE_DIR
is also set. It has the same value as PNG_INCLUDE_DIRS.</p>

<p>Since PNG depends on the ZLib compression library, none
of the above will be defined unless ZLib can be found.</p>

<p>FindPackageHandleStandardArgs</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(&lt;name&gt; ... )</p>

<p>This function is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake
modules files. It handles the REQUIRED, QUIET and
version-related argu- ments to find_package(). It also sets
the &lt;packagename&gt;_FOUND variable. The package is
considered found if all variables &lt;var1&gt;... listed
contain valid results, e.g. valid filepaths.</p>

<p>There are two modes of this function. The first argument
in both modes is the name of the Find-module where it is
called (in original casing).</p>

<p>The first simple mode looks like this:</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(&lt;name&gt;
(DEFAULT_MSG|&quot;Custom failure message&quot;)
&lt;var1&gt;...&lt;varN&gt; )</p>

<p>If the variables &lt;var1&gt; to &lt;varN&gt; are all
valid, then &lt;UPPER- CASED_NAME&gt;_FOUND will be set to
TRUE. If DEFAULT_MSG is given as second argument, then the
function will generate itself use- ful success and error
messages. You can also supply a custom error message for the
failure case. This is not recommended.</p>

<p>The second mode is more powerful and also supports
version checking:</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(NAME [FOUND_VAR
&lt;resultVar&gt;] [REQUIRED_VARS
&lt;var1&gt;...&lt;varN&gt;] [VERSION_VAR
&lt;versionvar&gt;] [HANDLE_COMPONENTS] [CONFIG_MODE]
[FAIL_MESSAGE &quot;Custom failure message&quot;] )</p>

<p>In this mode, the name of the result-variable can be set
either to either &lt;UPPERCASED_NAME&gt;_FOUND or
&lt;OriginalCase_Name&gt;_FOUND using the FOUND_VAR option.
Other names for the result-variable are not allowed. So for
a Find-module named FindFooBar.cmake, the two possible names
are FooBar_FOUND and FOOBAR_FOUND. It is recommended to use
the original case version. If the FOUND_VAR option is not
used, the default is &lt;UPPERCASED_NAME&gt;_FOUND.</p>

<p>As in the simple mode, if &lt;var1&gt; through
&lt;varN&gt; are all valid, &lt;packagename&gt;_FOUND will
be set to TRUE. After REQUIRED_VARS the variables which are
required for this package are listed. Fol- lowing
VERSION_VAR the name of the variable can be specified which
holds the version of the package which has been found. If
this is done, this version will be checked against the
(poten- tially) specified required version used in the
find_package() call. The EXACT keyword is also handled. The
default messages include information about the required
version and the version which has been actually found, both
if the version is ok or not. If the package supports
components, use the HANDLE_COMPONENTS option to enable
handling them. In this case, find_package_han-
dle_standard_args() will report which components have been
found and which are missing, and the
&lt;packagename&gt;_FOUND variable will be set to FALSE if
any of the required components (i.e. not the ones listed
after OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS) are missing. Use the option
CONFIG_MODE if your FindXXX.cmake module is a wrapper for a
find_package(... NO_MODULE) call. In this case VERSION_VAR
will be set to &lt;NAME&gt;_VERSION and the macro will
automatically check whether the Config module was found. Via
FAIL_MESSAGE a custom failure message can be specified, if
this is not used, the default message will be displayed.</p>

<p>Example for mode 1:</p>

<p>find_package_handle_standard_args(LibXml2 DEFAULT_MSG
LIBXML2_LIBRARY LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR)</p>

<p>LibXml2 is considered to be found, if both
LIBXML2_LIBRARY and LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR are valid. Then also
LIBXML2_FOUND is set to TRUE. If it is not found and
REQUIRED was used, it fails with FATAL_ERROR, independent
whether QUIET was used or not. If it is found, success will
be reported, including the content of &lt;var1&gt;. On
repeated Cmake runs, the same message wont be printed
again.</p>

<p>Example for mode 2:</p>

<p>find_package_handle_standard_args(LibXslt FOUND_VAR
LibXslt_FOUND REQUIRED_VARS LibXslt_LIBRARIES
LibXslt_INCLUDE_DIRS VERSION_VAR LibXslt_VERSION_STRING)</p>

<p>In this case, LibXslt is considered to be found if the
vari- able(s) listed after REQUIRED_VAR are all valid, i.e.
LibXslt_LIBRARIES and LibXslt_INCLUDE_DIRS in this case. The
result will then be stored in LibXslt_FOUND . Also the
version of LibXslt will be checked by using the version
contained in LibXslt_VERSION_STRING. Since no FAIL_MESSAGE
is given, the default messages will be printed.</p>

<p>Another example for mode 2:</p>

<p>find_package(Automoc4 QUIET NO_MODULE HINTS
/opt/automoc4) find_package_handle_standard_args(Automoc4
CONFIG_MODE)</p>

<p>In this case, FindAutmoc4.cmake wraps a call to
find_pack- age(Automoc4 NO_MODULE) and adds an additional
search directory for automoc4. Here the result will be
stored in AUTOMOC4_FOUND. The following
FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS() call produces a proper
success/error message.</p>

<p>FindPackageMessage</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(&lt;name&gt; &quot;message for
user&quot; &quot;find result details&quot;)</p>

<p>This macro is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake
modules files. It will print a message once for each unique
find result. This is useful for telling the user where a
package was found. The first argument specifies the name
(XXX) of the package. The second argument specifies the
message to display. The third argument lists details about
the find result so that if they change the message will be
displayed again. The macro also obeys the QUIET argument to
the find_package command.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>if(X11_FOUND) FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(X11 &quot;Found X11:
${X11_X11_LIB}&quot;
&quot;[${X11_X11_LIB}][${X11_INCLUDE_DIR}]&quot;) else() ...
endif()</p>

<p>FindPerl Find perl</p>

<p>this module looks for Perl</p>

<p>PERL_EXECUTABLE - the full path to perl PERL_FOUND - If
false, dont attempt to use perl. PERL_VERSION_STRING -
version of perl found (since CMake 2.8.8)</p>

<p>FindPerlLibs Find Perl libraries</p>

<p>This module finds if PERL is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>PERLLIBS_FOUND = True if perl.h &amp; libperl were found
PERL_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where perl.h is found
PERL_LIBRARY = path to libperl PERL_EXECUTABLE = full path
to the perl binary</p>

<p>The minimum required version of Perl can be specified
using the standard syntax, e.g. find_package(PerlLibs
6.0)</p>

<p>The following variables are also available if needed
(introduced after CMake 2.6.4)</p>

<p>PERL_SITESEARCH = path to the sitesearch install dir

<p>FindPhysFS</p>

<p>Locate PhysFS library This module defines
PHYSFS_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
PHYSFS_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to PHYSFS
PHYSFS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find physfs.h</p>

<p>$PHYSFSDIR is an environment variable that would
correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$PHYSFSDIR used in
building PHYSFS.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing.</p>

<p>FindPike Find Pike</p>

<p>This module finds if PIKE is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>PIKE_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where program.h is found
PIKE_EXECUTABLE = full path to the pike binary</p>

<p>FindPkgConfig a pkg-config module for CMake</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules(&lt;PREFIX&gt; [REQUIRED] [QUIET]
&lt;MODULE&gt; [&lt;MODULE&gt;]*) checks for all the given
modules</p>

<p>pkg_search_module(&lt;PREFIX&gt; [REQUIRED] [QUIET]
&lt;MODULE&gt; [&lt;MODULE&gt;]*) checks for given modules
and uses the first working one</p>

<p>When the REQUIRED argument was set, macros will fail
with an error when module(s) could not be found</p>

<p>When the QUIET argument is set, no status messages will
be printed.</p>

<p>It sets the following variables:</p>

<p>PKG_CONFIG_FOUND ... if pkg-config executable was found
PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE ... pathname of the pkg-config program
PKG_CONFIG_VERSION_STRING ... the version of the pkg-config
program found (since CMake 2.8.8)</p>

<p>For the following variables two sets of values exist;
first one is the common one and has the given PREFIX. The
second set con- tains flags which are given out when
pkgconfig was called with the --static option.</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_FOUND ... set to 1 if module(s) exist
&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LIBRARIES ... only the libraries (w/o the
-l) &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LIBRARY_DIRS ... the paths of the
libraries (w/o the -L) &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LDFLAGS ... all
required linker flags &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LDFLAGS_OTHER ... all
other linker flags &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_INCLUDE_DIRS ... the -I
preprocessor flags (w/o the -I) &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_CFLAGS ...
all required cflags &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_CFLAGS_OTHER ... the
other compiler flags</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt; for common case
&lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt;_STATIC for static
linking</p>

<p>There are some special variables whose prefix depends on
the count of given modules. When there is only one module,
&lt;PREFIX&gt; stays unchanged. When there are multiple
modules, the prefix will be changed to
&lt;PREFIX&gt;_&lt;MODNAME&gt;:</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_VERSION ... version of the module
&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_PREFIX ... prefix-directory of the module
&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_INCLUDEDIR ... include-dir of the module
&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LIBDIR ... lib-dir of the module</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt; when |MODULES| == 1,
else &lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt;_&lt;MODNAME&gt;</p>

<p>A &lt;MODULE&gt; parameter can have the following
formats:</p>

<p>{MODNAME} ... matches any version
{MODNAME}&gt;={VERSION} ... at least version &lt;VERSION&gt;
is required {MODNAME}={VERSION} ... exactly version
&lt;VERSION&gt; is required {MODNAME}&lt;={VERSION} ...
modules must not be newer than &lt;VERSION&gt;</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules (GLIB2 glib-2.0)</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules (GLIB2 glib-2.0&gt;=2.10) requires at
least version 2.10 of glib2 and defines e.g.
GLIB2_VERSION=2.10.3</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules (FOO glib-2.0&gt;=2.10 gtk+-2.0)
requires both glib2 and gtk2, and defines e.g.
FOO_glib-2.0_VERSION=2.10.3 FOO_gtk+-2.0_VERSION=2.8.20</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules (XRENDER REQUIRED xrender) defines
e.g.: XRENDER_LIBRARIES=Xrender;X11
XRENDER_STATIC_LIBRARIES=Xrender;X11;pthread;Xau;Xdmcp</p>

<p>pkg_search_module (BAR libxml-2.0 libxml2
libxml&gt;=2)</p>

<p>FindPostgreSQL Find the PostgreSQL installation.</p>

<p>In Windows, we make the assumption that, if the
PostgreSQL files are installed, the default directory will
be C:Program FilesPostgreSQL.</p>

<p>This module defines</p>

<p>PostgreSQL_LIBRARIES - the PostgreSQL libraries needed
for linking PostgreSQL_INCLUDE_DIRS - the directories of the
PostgreSQL headers PostgreSQL_VERSION_STRING - the version
of PostgreSQL found (since CMake 2.8.8)</p>

<p>FindProducer</p>

<p>Though Producer isn t directly part of OpenSceneGraph,
its pri- mary user is OSG so I consider this part of the
Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph components. You
ll notice that I accept OSGDIR as an environment path.</p>

<p>Each component is separate and you must opt in to each
module. You must also opt into OpenGL (and OpenThreads?) as
these mod- ules won t do it for you. This is to allow you
control over your own system piece by piece in case you need
to opt out of certain components or change the Find behavior
for a particular module (perhaps because the default
FindOpenGL.cmake module doesnt work with your system as an
example). If you want to use a more convenient module that
includes everything, use the FindOpen- SceneGraph.cmake
instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.</p>

<p>Locate Producer This module defines PRODUCER_LIBRARY
PRO- DUCER_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to Producer
PRO- DUCER_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers</p>

<p>$PRODUCER_DIR is an environment variable that would
correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$PRODUCER_DIR used in
building osg.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing.</p>

<p>FindProtobuf</p>

<p>Locate and configure the Google Protocol Buffers
library.</p>

<p>The following variables can be set and are optional:</p>

<p>PROTOBUF_SRC_ROOT_FOLDER - When compiling with MSVC, if
this cache variable is set the protobuf-default VS project
build locations (vsprojects/Debug &amp; vsprojects/Release)
will be searched for libraries and binaries.</p>

<p>PROTOBUF_IMPORT_DIRS - List of additional directories to
be searched for imported .proto files. (New in CMake
2.8.8)</p>

<p>Defines the following variables:</p>

<p>PROTOBUF_FOUND - Found the Google Protocol Buffers
library (libprotobuf &amp; header files)
PROTOBUF_INCLUDE_DIRS - Include directories for Google

libraries</p>

<p>[New in CMake 2.8.5]</p>

<p>PROTOBUF_PROTOC_LIBRARIES - The protoc libraries
PROTOBUF_LITE_LIBRARIES - The protobuf-lite libraries</p>

<p>The following cache variables are also available to set
or use:</p>

<p>PROTOBUF_LIBRARY - The protobuf library
PROTOBUF_PROTOC_LIBRARY - The protoc library
PROTOBUF_INCLUDE_DIR - The include directory for protocol
buffers PROTOBUF_PROTOC_EXECUTABLE - The protoc compiler</p>

<p>[New in CMake 2.8.5]</p>

<p>PROTOBUF_LIBRARY_DEBUG - The protobuf library (debug)
PROTOBUF_PROTOC_LIBRARY_DEBUG - The protoc library (debug)
PROTOBUF_LITE_LIBRARY - The protobuf lite library
PROTOBUF_LITE_LIBRARY_DEBUG - The protobuf lite library

<p>FindPythonInterp Find python interpreter</p>

<p>This module finds if Python interpreter is installed and
deter- mines where the executables are. This code sets the
following variables:</p>

<p>PYTHONINTERP_FOUND - Was the Python executable found
PYTHON_EXECUTABLE - path to the Python interpreter</p>

<p>PYTHON_VERSION_STRING - Python version found e.g. 2.5.2
PYTHON_VERSION_MAJOR - Python major version found e.g. 2
PYTHON_VERSION_MINOR - Python minor version found e.g. 5
PYTHON_VERSION_PATCH - Python patch version found e.g. 2</p>

<p>The Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to
specify a list of version numbers that should be taken into
account when searching for Python. You need to set this
variable before call- ing find_package(PythonInterp).</p>

<p>FindPythonLibs Find python libraries</p>

<p>This module finds if Python is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>PYTHONLIBS_FOUND - have the Python libs been found
PYTHON_LIBRARIES - path to the python library
PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH - path to where Python.h is found
(deprecated) PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS - path to where Python.h is
found PYTHON_DEBUG_LIBRARIES - path to the debug library
(deprecated) PYTHONLIBS_VERSION_STRING - version of the
Python libs found (since CMake 2.8.8)</p>

<p>The Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to
specify a list of version numbers that should be taken into
account when searching for Python. You need to set this
variable before call- ing find_package(PythonLibs).</p>

<p>If youd like to specify the installation of Python to
use, you should modify the following cache variables:</p>

<p>PYTHON_LIBRARY - path to the python library
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR - path to where Python.h is found</p>

<p>FindQt Searches for all installed versions of Qt.</p>

<p>This should only be used if your project can work with
multiple versions of Qt. If not, you should just directly
use FindQt4 or FindQt3. If multiple versions of Qt are found
on the machine, then The user must set the option
DESIRED_QT_VERSION to the ver- sion they want to use. If
only one version of qt is found on the machine, then the
DESIRED_QT_VERSION is set to that version and the matching
FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is included. Once the user sets
DESIRED_QT_VERSION, then the FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is
included.</p>

<p>QT_REQUIRED if this is set to TRUE then if CMake can not
find Qt4 or Qt3 an error is raised and a message is sent to
the user.</p>

<p>DESIRED_QT_VERSION OPTION is created QT4_INSTALLED is
set to TRUE if qt4 is found. QT3_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if
qt3 is found.</p>

<p>FindQt3 Locate Qt include paths and libraries</p>

<p>This module defines:</p>

<p>QT_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find qt.h, etc. QT_LIBRARIES -
the libraries to link against to use Qt. QT_DEFINITIONS -
definitions to use when compiling code that uses Qt.
QT_FOUND - If false, dont try to use Qt. QT_VERSION_STRING -
the version of Qt found</p>

<p>If you need the multithreaded version of Qt, set
QT_MT_REQUIRED to TRUE</p>

<p>Also defined, but not for general use are:</p>

<p>QT_MOC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the moc tool.
QT_UIC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the uic tool.
QT_QT_LIBRARY, where to find the Qt library.
QT_QTMAIN_LIBRARY, where to find the qtmain library. This is
only required by Qt3 on Windows.</p>

<p>FindQt4 Find Qt 4</p>

<p>This module can be used to find Qt4. The most important
issue is that the Qt4 qmake is available via the system
path. This qmake is then used to detect basically everything
else. This module defines a number of key variables and
macros. The variable QT_USE_FILE is set which is the path to
a CMake file that can be included to compile Qt 4
applications and libraries. It sets up the compilation
environment for include directories, preproces- sor defines
and populates a QT_LIBRARIES variable.</p>

<p>Typical usage could be something like:</p>

<p>find_package(Qt4 4.4.3 REQUIRED QtCore QtGui QtXml)
include(${QT_USE_FILE}) add_executable(myexe main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(myexe ${QT_LIBRARIES})</p>

<p>The minimum required version can be specified using the
standard find_package()-syntax (see example above). For
compatibility with older versions of FindQt4.cmake it is
also possible to set the variable QT_MIN_VERSION to the
minimum required version of Qt4 before the find_package(Qt4)
command. If both are used, the version used in the
find_package() command overrides the one from
QT_MIN_VERSION.</p>

<p>When using the components argument, QT_USE_QT* variables
are automatically set for the QT_USE_FILE to pick up. If one
wishes to manually set them, the available ones to set
include:</p>

<p>QT_DONT_USE_QTCORE QT_DONT_USE_QTGUI QT_USE_QT3SUPPORT
QT_USE_QTASSISTANT QT_USE_QAXCONTAINER QT_USE_QAXSERVER
QT_USE_QTDESIGNER QT_USE_QTMOTIF QT_USE_QTMAIN
QT_USE_QTMULTIMEDIA QT_USE_QTNETWORK QT_USE_QTNSPLUGIN
QT_USE_QTOPENGL QT_USE_QTSQL QT_USE_QTXML QT_USE_QTSVG
QT_USE_QTTEST QT_USE_QTUITOOLS QT_USE_QTDBUS QT_USE_QTSCRIPT
QT_USE_QTASSISTANTCLIENT QT_USE_QTHELP QT_USE_QTWEBKIT
QT_USE_QTXMLPATTERNS QT_USE_PHONON QT_USE_QTSCRIPTTOOLS
QT_USE_QTDECLARATIVE</p>

<p>QT_USE_IMPORTED_TARGETS If this variable is set to TRUE,
FindQt4.cmake will create imported library targets for the
various Qt libraries and set the library variables like
QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY to point at these imported targets instead
of the library file on disk. This provides much better
handling of the release and debug versions of the Qt
libraries and is also always backwards compatible, except
for the case that dependencies of libraries are exported,
these will then also list the names of the imported targets
as dependency and not the file location on disk. This is
much more flexible, but requires that FindQt4.cmake is
executed before such an exported dependency file is
processed.</p>

<p>Note that if using IMPORTED targets, the qtmain.lib
static library is automatically linked on Windows. To
disable that globally, set the QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN variable
before finding Qt4. To disable that for a particular
executable, set the QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN target property to
True on the executable.</p>

<p>QT_INCLUDE_DIRS_NO_SYSTEM If this variable is set to
TRUE, the Qt include directories in the QT_USE_FILE will NOT
have the SYSTEM keyword set.</p>

<p>There are also some files that need processing by some
Qt tools such as moc and uic. Listed below are macros that
may be used to process those files.</p>

<p>macro QT4_WRAP_CPP(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
create moc code from a list of files containing Qt class
with the Q_OBJECT declaration. Per-directory preprocessor
definitions are also added. Options may be given to moc,
such as those found when executing &quot;moc
-help&quot;.</p>

<p>macro QT4_WRAP_UI(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
create code from a list of Qt designer ui files. Options may
be given to uic, such as those found when executing
&quot;uic -help&quot;</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS
...) create code from a list of Qt resource files. Options
may be given to rcc, such as those found when executing
&quot;rcc -help&quot;</p>

<p>macro QT4_GENERATE_MOC(inputfile outputfile ) creates a
rule to run moc on infile and create outfile. Use this if
for some reason QT4_WRAP_CPP() isnt appropriate, e.g.
because you need a custom filename for the moc file or
something similar.</p>

<p>macro QT4_AUTOMOC(sourcefile1 sourcefile2 ... ) The
qt4_automoc macro is obsolete. Use the CMAKE_AUTOMOC feature
instead. This macro is still experimental. It can be used to
have moc automatically handled. So if you have the files
foo.h and foo.cpp, and in foo.h a a class uses the Q_OBJECT
macro, moc has to run on it. If you dont want to use
QT4_WRAP_CPP() (which is reliable and mature), you can
insert #include &quot;foo.moc&quot; in foo.cpp and then give
foo.cpp as argument to QT4_AUTOMOC(). This will the scan all
listed files at cmake-time for such included moc files and
if it finds them cause a rule to be generated to run moc at
build time on the accompanying header file foo.h. If a
source file has the SKIP_AUTOMOC property set it will be
ignored by this macro.</p>

<p>You should have a look on the AUTOMOC property for
targets to achieve the same results.</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE(outfiles interface
basename) Create the interface header and implementation
files with the given basename from the given interface xml
file and add it to the list of sources.</p>

<p>You can pass additional parameters to the qdbusxml2cpp
call by setting properties on the input file:</p>

<p>INCLUDE the given file will be included in the generate
interface header</p>

<p>CLASSNAME the generated class is named accordingly</p>

<p>NO_NAMESPACE the generated class is not wrapped in a
namespace</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACES(outfiles inputfile ... )
Create the interface header and implementation files for all
listed interface xml files. The basename will be
automatically determined from the name of the xml file.</p>

<p>The source file properties described for
QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE also apply here.</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_ADAPTOR(outfiles xmlfile parentheader
parentclassname [basename] [classname]) create a dbus
adaptor (header and implementation file) from the xml file
describing the interface, and add it to the list of sources.
The adaptor forwards the calls to a parent class, defined in
parentheader and named parentclassname. The name of the
generated files will be &lt;basename&gt;adaptor.{cpp,h}
where basename defaults to the basename of the xml file. If
&lt;classname&gt; is provided, then it will be used as the
classname of the adaptor itself.</p>

<p>macro QT4_GENERATE_DBUS_INTERFACE( header
[interfacename] OPTIONS ...) generate the xml interface file
from the given header. If the optional argument
interfacename is omitted, the name of the interface file is
constructed from the basename of the header with the suffix
.xml appended. Options may be given to qdbuscpp2xml, such as
those found when executing &quot;qdbuscpp2xml
--help&quot;</p>

<p>macro QT4_CREATE_TRANSLATION( qm_files directories ...
sources ... ts_files ... OPTIONS ...) out: qm_files in:
directories sources ts_files options: flags to pass to
lupdate, such as -extensions to specify extensions for a
directory scan. generates commands to create .ts (vie
lupdate) and .qm (via lrelease) - files from directories
and/or sources. The ts files are created and/or updated in
the source tree (unless given with full paths). The qm files
are generated in the build tree. Updating the translations
can be done by adding the qm_files to the source list of
your library/executable, so they are always updated, or by
adding a custom target to control when they get
updated/generated.</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_TRANSLATION( qm_files ts_files ... ) out:
qm_files in: ts_files generates commands to create .qm from
.ts - files. The generated filenames can be found in
qm_files. The ts_files must exist and are not updated in any
way.</p>

<p>function QT4_USE_MODULES( target [link_type]
modules...)</p>

<p>This function is obsolete. Use target_link_libraries
with IMPORTED targets instead. Make &lt;target&gt; use the
&lt;modules&gt; from Qt. Using a Qt module means to link to
the library, add the relevant include directories for the
module, and add the relevant compiler defines for using the
module. Modules are roughly equivalent to components of Qt4,
so usage would be something like: qt4_use_modules(myexe Core
Gui Declarative) to use QtCore, QtGui and QtDeclarative. The
optional &lt;link_type&gt; argument can be specified as
either LINK_PUBLIC or LINK_PRIVATE to specify the same
argument to the target_link_libraries call.</p>

<p>Below is a detailed list of variables that FindQt4.cmake
sets. QT_FOUND If false, dont try to use Qt. Qt4_FOUND If
false, dont try to use Qt 4. QT4_FOUND If false, dont try to
use Qt 4. This variable is for compatibility only.</p>

contained in QT_DEFINITIONS.</p>

<p>QT_INCLUDES List of paths to all include directories of
Qt4 QT_INCLUDE_DIR and QT_QTCORE_INCLUDE_DIR are always in

<p>QT_QT_LIBRARY Qt-Library is now split</p>

<p>FindQuickTime</p>

<p>Locate QuickTime This module defines QUICKTIME_LIBRARY
QUICK- TIME_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to gdal

<p>$QUICKTIME_DIR is an environment variable that would
correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$QUICKTIME_DIR</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing.</p>

<p>FindRTI Try to find M&amp;S HLA RTI libraries</p>

<p>This module finds if any HLA RTI is installed and
locates the standard RTI include files and libraries.</p>

<p>RTI is a simulation infrastructure standardized by IEEE
and SISO. It has a well defined C++ API that assures that
simulation applications are independent on a particular RTI
implementation.</p>


<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-Time_Infrastructure_(simulation)</p>

<p>This code sets the following variables:</p>

<p>RTI_INCLUDE_DIR = the directory where RTI includes file
are found RTI_LIBRARIES = The libraries to link against to
use RTI RTI_DEFINITIONS = -DRTI_USES_STD_FSTREAM RTI_FOUND =
Set to FALSE if any HLA RTI was not found</p>

<p>Report problems to &lt;certi-devel@nongnu.org&gt;</p>

<p>FindRuby Find Ruby</p>

<p>This module finds if Ruby is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. Ruby 1.8 and 1.9
are supported.</p>

<p>The minimum required version of Ruby can be specified
using the standard syntax, e.g. find_package(Ruby 1.8)</p>

<p>It also determines what the name of the library is. This
code sets the following variables:</p>

<p>RUBY_EXECUTABLE = full path to the ruby binary
RUBY_INCLUDE_DIRS = include dirs to be used when using the
ruby library RUBY_LIBRARY = full path to the ruby library
RUBY_VERSION = the version of ruby which was found, e.g.
&quot;1.8.7&quot; RUBY_FOUND = set to true if ruby ws found
successfully</p>

<p>RUBY_INCLUDE_PATH = same as RUBY_INCLUDE_DIRS, only
provided for compatibility reasons, dont use it</p>

<p>FindSDL Locate SDL library</p>

<p>This module defines</p>

<p>SDL_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
SDL_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
SDL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h SDL_VERSION_STRING,
human-readable string containing the version of SDL</p>

<p>This module responds to the the flag:</p>

<p>SDL_BUILDING_LIBRARY If this is defined, then no
SDL_main will be linked in because only applications need
main(). Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an
application and this module will attempt to locate and set
the the proper link flags as part of the returned
SDL_LIBRARY variable.</p>

<p>Dont forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your
project for the OS X framework based version. (Other
versions link to -lSDL- main which this module will try to
find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this module will
automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.</p>

<p>Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP in
your configuration and no SDL_LIBRARY, it means CMake did
not find your SDL library (SDL.dll, libsdl.so,
SDL.framework, etc). Set SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your
SDL library, and configure again. Similarly, if you see an
empty SDLMAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this value as
appropriate. These values are used to generate the final
SDL_LIBRARY variable, but when these values are unset,
SDL_LIBRARY does not get created.</p>

<p>$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond
to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.
l.e.galup 9-20-02</p>

<p>Modified by Eric Wing. Added code to assist with
automated building by using environmental variables and
providing a more controlled/consistent search behavior.
Added new modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc). Also corrected the
header search path to follow &quot;proper&quot; SDL
guidelines. Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by
some platforms. Added a search for threads which is needed
by some platforms. Added needed compile switches for
MinGW.</p>

<p>On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if
found) over others. People will have to manually change the
cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to override this selection or
set the CMake environ- ment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the
search paths.</p>

<p>Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to
just SDL.h This needed to change because &quot;proper&quot;
SDL convention is #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;, not
&lt;SDL/SDL.h&gt;. This is done for portability reasons
because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see
FreeBSD).</p>

<p>FindSDL_image Locate SDL_image library</p>

<p>This module defines:</p>

<p>SDL_IMAGE_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link
against SDL_IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
SDL_IMAGE_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
SDL_IMAGE_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing
the version of SDL_image</p>

<p>For backward compatiblity the following variables are
also set:</p>

<p>SDLIMAGE_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_IMAGE_LIBRARIES)
SDLIMAGE_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS)
SDLIMAGE_FOUND (same value as SDL_IMAGE_FOUND)</p>

<p>$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond
to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building
SDL.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing. This was influenced by the
FindSDL.cmake module, but with modifications to recognize OS
X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).</p>

<p>FindSDL_mixer Locate SDL_mixer library</p>

<p>This module defines:</p>

<p>SDL_MIXER_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link
against SDL_MIXER_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
SDL_MIXER_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
SDL_MIXER_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing
the version of SDL_mixer</p>

<p>For backward compatiblity the following variables are
also set:</p>

<p>SDLMIXER_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_MIXER_LIBRARIES)
SDLMIXER_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_MIXER_INCLUDE_DIRS)

<p>SDL_NET_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link
against SDL_NET_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
SDL_NET_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
SDL_NET_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing
the version of SDL_net</p>

<p>For backward compatiblity the following variables are
also set:</p>

<p>SDLNET_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_NET_LIBRARIES)
SDLNET_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_NET_INCLUDE_DIRS)
SDLNET_FOUND (same value as SDL_NET_FOUND)</p>

<p>$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond

X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).</p>

<p>FindSDL_sound Locates the SDL_sound library</p>

<p>This module depends on SDL being found and must be
called AFTER FindSDL.cmake is called.</p>

<p>This module defines</p>

<p>SDL_SOUND_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL_sound.h
SDL_SOUND_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL_sound
SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES, this contains the list of libraries
that you need to link against. This is a read-only variable
and is marked INTERNAL. SDL_SOUND_EXTRAS, this is an
optional variable for you to add your own flags to
SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES. This is prepended to
SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES. This is available mostly for cases this
module failed to anticipate for and you must add additional
flags. This is marked as ADVANCED. SDL_SOUND_VERSION_STRING,
human-readable string containing the version of
SDL_sound</p>

<p>This module also defines (but you shouldnt need to use
directly)</p>

<p>SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY, the name of just the SDL_sound
library you would link against. Use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES for
you link instructions and not this one.</p>

<p>And might define the following as needed</p>

<p>MIKMOD_LIBRARY MODPLUG_LIBRARY OGG_LIBRARY
VORBIS_LIBRARY SMPEG_LIBRARY FLAC_LIBRARY SPEEX_LIBRARY</p>

<p>Typically, you should not use these variables directly,
and you should use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES which contains
SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY and the other audio libraries (if needed)
to successfully com- pile on your system.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing. This module is a bit more
complicated than the other FindSDL* family modules. The
reason is that SDL_sound can be compiled in a large variety
of different ways which are independent of platform.
SDL_sound may dynamically link against other 3rd party
libraries to get additional codec support, such as Ogg
Vorbis, SMPEG, ModPlug, MikMod, FLAC, Speex, and poten-
tially others. Under some circumstances which I dont fully
understand, there seems to be a requirement that dependent
libraries of libraries you use must also be explicitly
linked against in order to successfully compile. SDL_sound
does not currently have any system in place to know how it
was compiled. So this CMake module does the hard work in
trying to discover which 3rd party libraries are required
for building (if any). This module uses a brute force
approach to create a test program that uses SDL_sound, and
then tries to build it. If the build fails, it parses the
error output for known symbol names to fig- ure out which
libraries are needed.</p>

<p>Responds to the $SDLDIR and $SDLSOUNDDIR environmental
variable that would correspond to the ./configure
--prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.</p>

<p>On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if
found) over others. People will have to manually change the
cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to override this selectionor set
the CMake environ- ment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the
search paths.</p>

<p>FindSDL_ttf Locate SDL_ttf library</p>

<p>This module defines:</p>

<p>SDL_TTF_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link
against SDL_TTF_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
SDL_TTF_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
SDL_TTF_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing
the version of SDL_ttf</p>

<p>For backward compatiblity the following variables are
also set:</p>

<p>SDLTTF_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_TTF_LIBRARIES)
SDLTTF_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_TTF_INCLUDE_DIRS)
SDLTTF_FOUND (same value as SDL_TTF_FOUND)</p>

<p>$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond
to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building
SDL.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing. This was influenced by the
FindSDL.cmake module, but with modifications to recognize OS
X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).</p>

<p>FindSWIG Find SWIG</p>

<p>This module finds an installed SWIG. It sets the
following variables:</p>

<p>SWIG_FOUND - set to true if SWIG is found SWIG_DIR - the
directory where swig is installed SWIG_EXECUTABLE - the path
to the swig executable SWIG_VERSION - the version number of
the swig executable</p>

<p>The minimum required version of SWIG can be specified
using the standard syntax, e.g. find_package(SWIG 1.1)</p>

<p>All information is collected from the SWIG_EXECUTABLE so
the version to be found can be changed from the command line
by means of setting SWIG_EXECUTABLE</p>

<p>FindSelfPackers Find upx</p>

<p>This module looks for some executable packers (i.e.
software that compress executables or shared libs into
on-the-fly self-extracting executables or shared libs.
Examples:</p>

<p>UPX: http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/upx.html</p>

<p>FindSquish -- Typical Use</p>

<p>This module can be used to find Squish. Currently Squish
ver- sions 3 and 4 are supported.</p>

<p>SQUISH_FOUND If false, dont try to use Squish
SQUISH_VERSION The full version of Squish found
SQUISH_VERSION_MAJOR The major version of Squish found
SQUISH_VERSION_MINOR The minor version of Squish found
SQUISH_VERSION_PATCH The patch version of Squish found</p>

<p>SQUISH_INSTALL_DIR The Squish installation directory
(containing bin, lib, etc) SQUISH_SERVER_EXECUTABLE The
squishserver executable SQUISH_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE The
squishrunner executable</p>

<p>SQUISH_INSTALL_DIR_FOUND Was the install directory
found? SQUISH_SERVER_EXECUTABLE_FOUND Was the server
executable found? SQUISH_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE_FOUND Was the
client executable found?</p>

<p>It provides the function squish_v4_add_test() for adding
a squish test to cmake using Squish 4.x:</p>

<p>squish_v4_add_test(cmakeTestName AUT targetName SUITE
suiteName TEST squishTestName [SETTINGSGROUP group]
[PRE_COMMAND command] [POST_COMMAND command] )</p>

<p>The arguments have the following meaning:</p>

<p>cmakeTestName: this will be used as the first argument
for add_test() AUT targetName: the name of the cmake target
which will be used as AUT, i.e. the executable which will be
tested. SUITE suiteName: this is either the full path to the
squish suite, or just the last directory of the suite, i.e.
the suite name. In this case the CMakeLists.txt which calls
squish_add_test() must be located in the parent directory of
the suite directory. TEST squishTestName: the name of the
squish test, i.e. the name of the subdirectory of the test
inside the suite directory. SETTINGSGROUP group: if
specified, the given settings group will be used for
executing the test. If not specified, the groupname will be
&quot;CTest_&lt;username&gt;&quot; PRE_COMMAND command: if
specified, the given command will be executed before
starting the squish test. POST_COMMAND command: same as
PRE_COMMAND, but after the squish test has been
executed.</p>

<p>enable_testing() find_package(Squish 4.0) if
(SQUISH_FOUND) squish_v4_add_test(myTestName AUT myApp SUITE
${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/tests/mySuite TEST someSquishTest
SETTINGSGROUP myGroup ) endif ()</p>

<p>For users of Squish version 3.x the macro
squish_v3_add_test() is provided:</p>

<p>squish_v3_add_test(testName applicationUnderTest
testCase envVars testWrapper) Use this macro to add a test
using Squish 3.x.</p>

<p>enable_testing() find_package(Squish) if (SQUISH_FOUND)
squish_v3_add_test(myTestName myApplication testCase envVars
testWrapper) endif ()</p>

<p>macro SQUISH_ADD_TEST(testName applicationUnderTest
testCase envVars testWrapper)</p>

<p>This is deprecated. Use SQUISH_V3_ADD_TEST() if you are
using Squish 3.x instead.</p>

<p>FindSubversion Extract information from a subversion
working copy</p>

<p>The module defines the following variables:</p>

<p>Subversion_SVN_EXECUTABLE - path to svn command line
client Subversion_VERSION_SVN - version of svn command line
client Subversion_FOUND - true if the command line client
was found SUBVERSION_FOUND - same as Subversion_FOUND, set
for compatiblity reasons</p>

<p>The minimum required version of Subversion can be
specified using the standard syntax, e.g.
find_package(Subversion 1.4)</p>

<p>If the command line client executable is found two
macros are defined:</p>

<p>Subversion_WC_INFO(&lt;dir&gt; &lt;var-prefix&gt;)
Subversion_WC_LOG(&lt;dir&gt; &lt;var-prefix&gt;)</p>

<p>Subversion_WC_INFO extracts information of a subversion
working copy at a given location. This macro defines the
following vari- ables:</p>

<p>&lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_URL - url of the repository (at
&lt;dir&gt;) &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_ROOT - root url of the
repository &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_REVISION - current revision
&lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_LAST_CHANGED_AUTHOR - author of last
commit &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_LAST_CHANGED_DATE - date of
last commit &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_LAST_CHANGED_REV -
revision of last commit &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_INFO - output
of command svn info &lt;dir&gt;</p>

<p>Subversion_WC_LOG retrieves the log message of the base
revision of a subversion working copy at a given location.
This macro defines the variable:</p>

<p>&lt;var-prefix&gt;_LAST_CHANGED_LOG - last log of base
revision</p>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<p>find_package(Subversion) if(SUBVERSION_FOUND)
Subversion_WC_INFO(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} Project)
message(&quot;Current revision is
${Project_WC_REVISION}&quot;)
Subversion_WC_LOG(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} Project)
message(&quot;Last changed log is
${Project_LAST_CHANGED_LOG}&quot;) endif()</p>

<p>FindTCL TK_INTERNAL_PATH was removed.</p>

<p>This module finds if Tcl is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>TCL_FOUND = Tcl was found TK_FOUND = Tk was found
TCLTK_FOUND = Tcl and Tk were found TCL_LIBRARY = path to
Tcl library (tcl tcl80) TCL_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where
tcl.h can be found TCL_TCLSH = path to tclsh binary (tcl
tcl80) TK_LIBRARY = path to Tk library (tk tk80 etc)
TK_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where tk.h can be found TK_WISH =
full path to the wish executable</p>

<p>In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some
issues for people who are not necessarily Tcl/Tk
gurus/developpers, some variables were moved or removed.
Changes compared to CMake 2.4 are:</p>

<p>=&gt; they were only useful for people writing Tcl/Tk
extensions. =&gt; these libs are not packaged by default
with Tcl/Tk distributions. Even when Tcl/Tk is built from
source, several flavors of debug libs are created and there
is no real reason to pick a single one specifically (say,
amongst tcl84g, tcl84gs, or tcl84sgx). Let s leave that
choice to the user by allowing him to assign TCL_LIBRARY to
any Tcl library, debug or not. =&gt; this ended up being
only a Win32 variable, and there is a lot of confusion
regarding the location of this file in an installed Tcl/Tk
tree anyway (see 8.5 for example). If you need the internal
path at this point it is safer you ask directly where the
*source* tree is and dig from there.</p>

<p>FindTIFF Find TIFF library</p>

<p>Find the native TIFF includes and library This module
defines</p>

<p>TIFF_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find tiff.h, etc.

<p>TIFF_LIBRARY, where to find the TIFF library.</p>

<p>FindTclStub TCL_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG and
TK_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG were removed.</p>

<p>This module finds Tcl stub libraries. It first finds Tcl
include files and libraries by calling FindTCL.cmake. How to
Use the Tcl Stubs Library:</p>

<p>http://tcl.activestate.com/doc/howto/stubs.html</p>

<p>Using Stub Libraries:</p>

<p>http://safari.oreilly.com/0130385603/ch48lev1sec3</p>

<p>This code sets the following variables:</p>

<p>TCL_STUB_LIBRARY = path to Tcl stub library

the path to the tclsh executable</p>

<p>In cygwin, look for the cygwin version first. Dont look
for it later to avoid finding the cygwin version on a Win32
build.</p>

<p>FindThreads This module determines the thread library of
the system.</p>

<p>The following variables are set</p>

<p>CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT - the thread library
CMAKE_USE_SPROC_INIT - are we using sproc?
CMAKE_USE_WIN32_THREADS_INIT - using WIN32 threads?
CMAKE_USE_PTHREADS_INIT - are we using pthreads

<p>For systems with multiple thread libraries, caller can
set</p>

<p>CMAKE_THREAD_PREFER_PTHREAD</p>

<p>FindUnixCommands Find unix commands from cygwin</p>

<p>This module looks for some usual Unix commands.</p>

<p>FindVTK Find a VTK installation or build tree.</p>

<p>The following variables are set if VTK is found. If VTK
is not found, VTK_FOUND is set to false.</p>

locate VTK:</p>

<p>VTK_DIR - The directory containing VTKConfig.cmake. This
is either the root of the build tree, or the lib/vtk
directory. This is the only cache entry.</p>

<p>The following variables are set for backward
compatibility and should not be used in new code:</p>

<p>USE_VTK_FILE - The full path to the UseVTK.cmake file.
This is provided for backward compatibility. Use
VTK_USE_FILE instead.</p>

<p>FindWget Find wget</p>

<p>This module looks for wget. This module defines the
following values:</p>

<p>WGET_EXECUTABLE: the full path to the wget tool.
WGET_FOUND: True if wget has been found.</p>

<p>FindWish Find wish installation</p>

<p>This module finds if TCL is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>Findosg</p>

<p>NOTE: It is highly recommended that you use the new
FindOpen- SceneGraph.cmake introduced in CMake 2.6.3 and not
use this Find module directly.</p>

<p>This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find
OpenSceneGraph components. Each component is separate and
you must opt in to each module. You must also opt into
OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer if needed) as these
modules wont do it for you. This is to allow you control
over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt
out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a
particular module (perhaps because the default
FindOpenGL.cmake module doesnt work with your system as an
example). If you want to use a more convenient module that
includes everything, use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake
instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.</p>

<p>This CMake file contains two macros to assist with
searching for OSG libraries and nodekits. Please see
FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake for full documentation.</p>

<p>FindwxWidgets Find a wxWidgets (a.k.a., wxWindows)
installation.</p>

<p>This module finds if wxWidgets is installed and selects
a default configuration to use. wxWidgets is a modular
library. To specify the modules that you will use, you need
to name them as components to the package:</p>

<p>find_package(wxWidgets COMPONENTS core base ...)</p>

<p>There are two search branches: a windows style and a
unix style. For windows, the following variables are
searched for and set to defaults in case of multiple
choices. Change them if the defaults are not desired (i.e.,
these are the only variables you should change to select a
configuration):</p>

<p>wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR - Base wxWidgets directory (e.g.,
C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3). wxWidgets_LIB_DIR - Path to wxWidgets
libraries (e.g., C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3/lib/vc_lib).
wxWidgets_CONFIGURATION - Configuration to use (e.g., msw,
mswd, mswu, mswunivud, etc.)
wxWidgets_EXCLUDE_COMMON_LIBRARIES - Set to TRUE to exclude
linking of commonly required libs (e.g., png tiff jpeg zlib
regex expat).</p>

<p>For unix style it uses the wx-config utility. You can
select between debug/release, unicode/ansi,
universal/non-universal, and static/shared in the QtDialog
or ccmake interfaces by turn- ing ON/OFF the following
variables:</p>

<p>wxWidgets_USE_DEBUG wxWidgets_USE_UNICODE
wxWidgets_USE_UNIVERSAL wxWidgets_USE_STATIC</p>

<p>There is also a wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS variable for
all other options that need to be passed to the wx-config
utility. For example, to use the base toolkit found in the
/usr/local path, set the variable (before calling the
FIND_PACKAGE command) as such:</p>

<p>set(wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS --toolkit=base
--prefix=/usr)</p>

<p>The following are set after the configuration is done
for both windows and unix style:</p>

<p>wxWidgets_FOUND - Set to TRUE if wxWidgets was found.
wxWidgets_INCLUDE_DIRS - Include directories for WIN32 i.e.,
where to find &quot;wx/wx.h&quot; and
&quot;wx/setup.h&quot;; possibly empty for unices.
wxWidgets_LIBRARIES - Path to the wxWidgets libraries.
wxWidgets_LIBRARY_DIRS - compile time link dirs, useful for
rpath on UNIX. Typically an empty string in WIN32
environment. wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS - Contains defines
required to compile/link against WX, e.g. WXUSINGDLL
wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG- Contains defines required to
compile/link against WX debug builds, e.g. __WXDEBUG__
wxWidgets_CXX_FLAGS - Include dirs and compiler flags for
unices, empty on WIN32. Essentially &quot; wx-config
--cxxflags&quot;. wxWidgets_USE_FILE - Convenience include
file.</p>

<p>Sample usage:</p>

<p># Note that for MinGW users the order of libs is
important! find_package(wxWidgets COMPONENTS net gl core
base) if(wxWidgets_FOUND) include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE}) #
and for each of your dependent executable/library targets:
target_link_libraries(&lt;YourTarget&gt;
${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES}) endif()</p>

<p>If wxWidgets is required (i.e., not an optional
part):</p>

<p>find_package(wxWidgets REQUIRED net gl core base)
include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE}) # and for each of your
dependent executable/library targets:
target_link_libraries(&lt;YourTarget&gt;
${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})</p>

<p>FindwxWindows Find wxWindows (wxWidgets)
installation</p>

<p>This module finds if wxWindows/wxWidgets is installed
and deter- mines where the include files and libraries are.
It also deter- mines what the name of the library is. Please
note this file is DEPRECATED and replaced by
FindwxWidgets.cmake. This code sets the following
variables:</p>

<p>WXWINDOWS_FOUND = system has WxWindows
WXWINDOWS_LIBRARIES = path to the wxWindows libraries on
Unix/Linux with additional linker flags from &quot;wx-config
--libs&quot; CMAKE_WXWINDOWS_CXX_FLAGS = Compiler flags for
wxWindows, essentially &quot; wx-config --cxxflags&quot; on
Linux WXWINDOWS_INCLUDE_DIR = where to find
&quot;wx/wx.h&quot; and &quot;wx/setup.h&quot;
WXWINDOWS_LINK_DIRECTORIES = link directories, useful for
rpath on Unix WXWINDOWS_DEFINITIONS = extra defines</p>

<p>OPTIONS If you need OpenGL support please</p>

<p>set(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)</p>

<p>in your CMakeLists.txt *before* you include this
file.</p>

<p>HAVE_ISYSTEM - true required to replace -I by -isystem
on g++</p>

<p>For convenience include Use_wxWindows.cmake in your
projects CMakeLists.txt using include(${CMAKE_CUR-
RENT_LIST_DIR}/Use_wxWindows.cmake).</p>

<p>USAGE</p>

<p>FortranCInterface Fortran/C Interface Detection</p>

<p>This module automatically detects the API by which C and
Fortran languages interact. Variables indicate if the
mangling is found:</p>

<p>FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_FOUND = Global subroutines and
functions FortranCInterface_MODULE_FOUND = Module
subroutines and functions (declared by &quot;MODULE
PROCEDURE&quot;)</p>

<p>A function is provided to generate a C header file
containing macros to mangle symbol names:</p>

<p>FortranCInterface_HEADER(&lt;file&gt; [MACRO_NAMESPACE
&lt;macro-ns&gt;] [SYMBOL_NAMESPACE &lt;ns&gt;] [SYMBOLS
[&lt;module&gt;:]&lt;function&gt; ...])</p>

<p>It generates in &lt;file&gt; definitions of the
following macros:</p>

<p>#define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL (name,NAME) ... #define
FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_(name,NAME) ... #define
FortranCInterface_MODULE (mod,name, MOD,NAME) ... #define
FortranCInterface_MODULE_(mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...</p>

<p>These macros mangle four categories of Fortran symbols,
respec- tively:</p>

<p>- Global symbols without _: call mysub() - Global
symbols with _ : call my_sub() - Module symbols without _:
use mymod; call mysub() - Module symbols with _ : use mymod;
call my_sub()</p>

<p>If mangling for a category is not known, its macro is
left unde- fined. All macros require raw names in both lower
case and upper case. The MACRO_NAMESPACE option replaces the
default &quot;FortranC- Interface_&quot; prefix with a given
namespace &quot;&lt;macro-ns&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>The SYMBOLS option lists symbols to mangle automatically
with C preprocessor definitions:</p>

<p>&lt;function&gt; ==&gt; #define
&lt;ns&gt;&lt;function&gt; ...
&lt;module&gt;:&lt;function&gt; ==&gt; #define
&lt;ns&gt;&lt;module&gt;_&lt;function&gt; ...</p>

<p>If the mangling for some symbol is not known then no
preproces- sor definition is created, and a warning is
displayed. The SYM- BOL_NAMESPACE option prefixes all
preprocessor definitions gen- erated by the SYMBOLS option
with a given namespace &quot;&lt;ns&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<p>include(FortranCInterface) FortranCInterface_HEADER(FC.h
MACRO_NAMESPACE &quot;FC_&quot;)</p>

<p>This creates a &quot;FC.h&quot; header that defines
mangling macros FC_GLOBAL(), FC_GLOBAL_(), FC_MODULE(), and
FC_MODULE_().</p>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<p>include(FortranCInterface)
FortranCInterface_HEADER(FCMangle.h MACRO_NAMESPACE
&quot;FC_&quot; SYMBOL_NAMESPACE &quot;FC_&quot; SYMBOLS
mysub mymod:my_sub)</p>

<p>This creates a &quot;FCMangle.h&quot; header that
defines the same FC_*() mangling macros as the previous
example plus preprocessor sym- bols FC_mysub and
FC_mymod_my_sub.</p>

<p>Another function is provided to verify that the Fortran
and C/C++ compilers work together:</p>

<p>FortranCInterface_VERIFY([CXX] [QUIET])</p>

<p>It tests whether a simple test executable using Fortran
and C (and C++ when the CXX option is given) compiles and
links suc- cessfully. The result is stored in the cache
entry FortranCIn- terface_VERIFIED_C (or
FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_CXX if CXX is given) as a
boolean. If the check fails and QUIET is not given the
function terminates with a FATAL_ERROR message describing
the problem. The purpose of this check is to stop a build
early for incompatible compiler combinations. The test is
built in the Release configuration.</p>

<p>FortranCInterface is aware of possible GLOBAL and MODULE
man- glings for many Fortran compilers, but it also provides
an interface to specify new possible manglings. Set the
variables</p>

<p>FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS
FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS</p>

<p>before including FortranCInterface to specify manglings
of the symbols &quot;MySub&quot;, &quot;My_Sub&quot;,
&quot;MyModule:MySub&quot;, and &quot;My_Mod-
ule:My_Sub&quot;. For example, the code:</p>

<p>set(FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS mysub_ my_sub__
MYSUB_) # ^^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^
set(FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS __mymodule_MOD_mysub
__my_module_MOD_my_sub) # ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^
include(FortranCInterface)</p>

<p>tells FortranCInterface to try given GLOBAL and MODULE
man- glings. (The carets point at raw symbol names for
clarity in this example but are not needed.)</p>

<p>GNUInstallDirs Define GNU standard installation
directories</p>

<p>Provides install directory variables as defined for GNU
soft- ware:</p>


<p>http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html</p>

<p>Inclusion of this module defines the following
variables:</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_&lt;dir&gt; - destination for files of a
given type CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_&lt;dir&gt; - corresponding
absolute path</p>

<p>where &lt;dir&gt; is one of:</p>

<p>BINDIR - user executables (bin) SBINDIR - system admin
executables (sbin) LIBEXECDIR - program executables
(libexec) SYSCONFDIR - read-only single-machine data (etc)
SHAREDSTATEDIR - modifiable architecture-independent data
(com) LOCALSTATEDIR - modifiable single-machine data (var)
LIBDIR - object code libraries (lib or lib64 or
lib/&lt;multiarch-tuple&gt; on Debian) INCLUDEDIR - C header
files (include) OLDINCLUDEDIR - C header files for non-gcc
(/usr/include) DATAROOTDIR - read-only
architecture-independent data root (share) DATADIR -
read-only architecture-independent data (DATAROOTDIR)
INFODIR - info documentation (DATAROOTDIR/info) LOCALEDIR -
locale-dependent data (DATAROOTDIR/locale) MANDIR - man
documentation (DATAROOTDIR/man) DOCDIR - documentation root
(DATAROOTDIR/doc/PROJECT_NAME)</p>

<p>Each CMAKE_INSTALL_&lt;dir&gt; value may be passed to
the DESTINATION options of install() commands for the
corresponding file type. If the includer does not define a
value the above-shown default will be used and the value
will appear in the cache for editing by the user. Each
CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_&lt;dir&gt; value contains an absolute
path constructed from the corresponding destination by
prepending (if necessary) the value of
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>GenerateExportHeader Function for generation of export
macros for libraries</p>

<p>This module provides the function
GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER() and the accompanying
ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS() function.</p>

<p>The GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER function can be used to
generate a file suitable for preprocessor inclusion which
contains EXPORT macros to be used in library classes.</p>

<p>GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER( LIBRARY_TARGET</p>

<p>[BASE_NAME &lt;base_name&gt;] [EXPORT_MACRO_NAME
&lt;export_macro_name&gt;] [EXPORT_FILE_NAME
&lt;export_file_name&gt;] [DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME
&lt;deprecated_macro_name&gt;] [NO_EXPORT_MACRO_NAME
&lt;no_export_macro_name&gt;] [STATIC_DEFINE
&lt;static_define&gt;] [NO_DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME
&lt;no_deprecated_macro_name&gt;] [DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED]
[PREFIX_NAME &lt;prefix_name&gt;]</p>

<p>)</p>

<p>ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS( [&lt;output_variable&gt;]
)</p>

<p>By default GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER() generates macro
names in a file name determined by the name of the library.
The ADD_COM- PILER_EXPORT_FLAGS function adds
-fvisibility=hidden to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS if supported, and is
a no-op on Windows which does not need extra compiler flags
for exporting support. You may optionally pass a single
argument to ADD_COM- PILER_EXPORT_FLAGS that will be
populated with the required CXX_FLAGS required to enable
visibility support for the com- piler/architecture in
use.</p>

<p>This means that in the simplest case, users of these
functions will be equivalent to:</p>

<p>add_compiler_export_flags() add_library(somelib
someclass.cpp) generate_export_header(somelib)
install(TARGETS somelib DESTINATION ${LIBRARY_INSTALL_DIR})
install(FILES someclass.h
${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/somelib_export.h DESTINATION
${INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR} )</p>

<p>And in the ABI header files:</p>

<p>#include &quot;somelib_export.h&quot; class
SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass { ... };</p>

<p>The CMake fragment will generate a file in the
${CMAKE_CUR- RENT_BINARY_DIR} called somelib_export.h
containing the macros SOMELIB_EXPORT, SOMELIB_NO_EXPORT,
SOMELIB_DEPRECATED, SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_EXPORT and
SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_NO_EXPORT. The resulting file should be
installed with other headers in the library.</p>

<p>The BASE_NAME argument can be used to override the file
name and the names used for the macros</p>

<p>add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
generate_export_header(somelib BASE_NAME other_name )</p>

<p>Generates a file called other_name_export.h containing
the macros OTHER_NAME_EXPORT, OTHER_NAME_NO_EXPORT and
OTHER_NAME_DEPRECATED etc.</p>

<p>The BASE_NAME may be overridden by specifiying other
options in the function. For example:</p>

<p>add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
generate_export_header(somelib EXPORT_MACRO_NAME
OTHER_NAME_EXPORT )</p>

<p>creates the macro OTHER_NAME_EXPORT instead of
SOMELIB_EXPORT, but other macros and the generated file name
is as default.</p>

<p>add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
generate_export_header(somelib DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME
KDE_DEPRECATED )</p>

<p>creates the macro KDE_DEPRECATED instead of
SOMELIB_DEPRECATED.</p>

<p>If LIBRARY_TARGET is a static library, macros are
defined with- out values.</p>

<p>If the same sources are used to create both a shared and
a static library, the uppercased symbol
${BASE_NAME}_STATIC_DEFINE should be used when building the
static library</p>

<p>add_library(shared_variant SHARED ${lib_SRCS})
add_library(static_variant ${lib_SRCS})
generate_export_header(shared_variant BASE_NAME
libshared_and_static) set_target_properties(static_variant
PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS
-DLIBSHARED_AND_STATIC_STATIC_DEFINE)</p>

<p>This will cause the export macros to expand to nothing
when building the static library.</p>

<p>If DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED is specified, then a macro
${BASE_NAME}_NO_DEPRECATED will be defined This macro can be
used to remove deprecated code from preprocessor output.</p>

<p>option(EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED &quot;Exclude deprecated parts
of the library&quot; FALSE) if (EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED)
set(NO_BUILD_DEPRECATED DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED) endif()
generate_export_header(somelib ${NO_BUILD_DEPRECATED})</p>

<p>And then in somelib:</p>

<p>class SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass { public: #ifndef
SOMELIB_NO_DEPRECATED SOMELIB_DEPRECATED void oldMethod();
#endif };</p>

<p>#ifndef SOMELIB_NO_DEPRECATED void
SomeClass::oldMethod() { } #endif</p>

<p>If PREFIX_NAME is specified, the argument will be used
as a pre- fix to all generated macros.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>generate_export_header(somelib PREFIX_NAME VTK_)</p>

<p>Generates the macros VTK_SOMELIB_EXPORT etc.</p>

<p>GetPrerequisites Functions to analyze and list
executable file prerequisites.</p>

<p>This module provides functions to list the .dll, .dylib
or .so files that an executable or shared library file
depends on. (Its prerequisites.)</p>

<p>It uses various tools to obtain the list of required
shared library files:</p>

<p>dumpbin (Windows) objdump (MinGW on Windows) ldd
(Linux/Unix) otool (Mac OSX)</p>

<p>The following functions are provided by this module:</p>

<p>get_prerequisites list_prerequisites
list_prerequisites_by_glob gp_append_unique
is_file_executable gp_item_default_embedded_path (projects
can override with gp_item_default_embedded_path_override)
gp_resolve_item (projects can override with
gp_resolve_item_override) gp_resolved_file_type (projects
can override with gp_resolved_file_type_override)
gp_file_type</p>

<p>Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function,
break, return and PARENT_SCOPE.</p>

<p>GET_PREREQUISITES(&lt;target&gt;
&lt;prerequisites_var&gt; &lt;exclude_system&gt;
&lt;recurse&gt; &lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;)</p>

<p>Get the list of shared library files required by
&lt;target&gt;. The list in the variable named
&lt;prerequisites_var&gt; should be empty on first entry to
this function. On exit, &lt;prerequisites_var&gt; will
contain the list of required shared library files.</p>

<p>&lt;target&gt; is the full path to an executable file.
&lt;prerequi- sites_var&gt; is the name of a CMake variable
to contain the results. &lt;exclude_system&gt; must be 0 or
1 indicating whether to include or exclude
&quot;system&quot; prerequisites. If &lt;recurse&gt; is set
to 1 all prerequisites will be found recursively, if set to
0 only direct prerequisites are listed. &lt;exepath&gt; is
the path to the top level executable used for
@executable_path replacment on the Mac. &lt;dirs&gt; is a
list of paths where libraries might be found: these paths
are searched first when a target without any path info is
given. Then standard system locations are also searched:
PATH, Framework locations, /usr/lib...</p>

<p>LIST_PREREQUISITES(&lt;target&gt; [&lt;recurse&gt;
[&lt;exclude_system&gt; [&lt;verbose&gt;]]])</p>

<p>Print a message listing the prerequisites of
&lt;target&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;target&gt; is the name of a shared library or
executable target or the full path to a shared library or
executable file. If &lt;recurse&gt; is set to 1 all
prerequisites will be found recur- sively, if set to 0 only
direct prerequisites are listed. &lt;exclude_system&gt; must
be 0 or 1 indicating whether to include or exclude
&quot;system&quot; prerequisites. With &lt;verbose&gt; set
to 0 only the full path names of the prerequisites are
printed, set to 1 extra informatin will be displayed.</p>

<p>LIST_PREREQUISITES_BY_GLOB(&lt;glob_arg&gt;
&lt;glob_exp&gt;)</p>

<p>Print the prerequisites of shared library and executable
files matching a globbing pattern. &lt;glob_arg&gt; is GLOB
or GLOB_RECURSE and &lt;glob_exp&gt; is a globbing
expression used with &quot;file(GLOB&quot; or
&quot;file(GLOB_RECURSE&quot; to retrieve a list of matching
files. If a matching file is executable, its prerequisites
are listed.</p>

<p>Any additional (optional) arguments provided are passed
along as the optional arguments to the list_prerequisites
calls.</p>

<p>GP_APPEND_UNIQUE(&lt;list_var&gt; &lt;value&gt;)</p>

<p>Append &lt;value&gt; to the list variable
&lt;list_var&gt; only if the value is not already in the
list.</p>

<p>IS_FILE_EXECUTABLE(&lt;file&gt; &lt;result_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Return 1 in &lt;result_var&gt; if &lt;file&gt; is a
binary executable, 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>GP_ITEM_DEFAULT_EMBEDDED_PATH(&lt;item&gt;
&lt;default_embedded_path_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Return the path that others should refer to the item by
when the item is embedded inside a bundle.</p>

<p>Override on a per-project basis by providing a
project-specific gp_item_default_embedded_path_override
function.</p>

<p>GP_RESOLVE_ITEM(&lt;context&gt; &lt;item&gt;
&lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;resolved_item_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Resolve an item into an existing full path file.</p>

<p>Override on a per-project basis by providing a
project-specific gp_resolve_item_override function.</p>

<p>GP_RESOLVED_FILE_TYPE(&lt;original_file&gt; &lt;file&gt;
&lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;type_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Return the type of &lt;file&gt; with respect to
&lt;original_file&gt;. String describing type of
prerequisite is returned in variable named
&lt;type_var&gt;.</p>

<p>Use &lt;exepath&gt; and &lt;dirs&gt; if necessary to
resolve non-absolute &lt;file&gt; values -- but only for
non-embedded items.</p>

<p>Possible types are:</p>

<p>system local embedded other</p>

<p>Override on a per-project basis by providing a
project-specific gp_resolved_file_type_override
function.</p>

<p>GP_FILE_TYPE(&lt;original_file&gt; &lt;file&gt;
&lt;type_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Return the type of &lt;file&gt; with respect to
&lt;original_file&gt;. String describing type of
prerequisite is returned in variable named
&lt;type_var&gt;.</p>

<p>Possible types are:</p>

<p>system local embedded other</p>

<p>InstallRequiredSystemLibraries</p>

<p>By including this file, all library files listed in the
variable CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS will be installed
with install(PROGRAMS ...) into bin for WIN32 and lib for
non-WIN32. If CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_SKIP is set
to TRUE before including this file, then the INSTALL command
is not called. The user can use the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS to use a custom install
command and install them however they want. If it is the
MSVC compiler, then the microsoft run time libraries will be
found and automatically added to the
CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS, and installed. If
CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES is set and it is the MSVC com-
piler, then the debug libraries are installed when
available. If CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES_ONLY is set then
only the debug libraries are installed when both debug and
release are avail- able. If CMAKE_INSTALL_MFC_LIBRARIES is
set then the MFC run time libraries are installed as well as
the CRT run time libraries. If
CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_DESTINATION is set then the
libraries are installed to that directory rather than the
default. If CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_NO_WARNINGS is
NOT set, then this file warns about required files that do
not exist. You can set this variable to ON before including
this file to avoid the warning. For example, the Visual
Studio Express editions do not include the redistributable
files, so if you include this file on a machine with only VS
Express installed, youll get the warning.</p>

<p>MacroAddFileDependencies
MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(&lt;_file&gt;
depend_files...)</p>

<p>Using the macro MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES() is
discouraged. There are usually better ways to specify the
correct dependen- cies.</p>

<p>MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(&lt;_file&gt;
depend_files...) is just a convenience wrapper around the
OBJECT_DEPENDS source file prop- erty. You can just use
set_property(SOURCE &lt;file&gt; APPEND PROP- ERTY
OBJECT_DEPENDS depend_files) instead.</p>

<p>ProcessorCount ProcessorCount(var)</p>

<p>Determine the number of processors/cores and save value
in ${var}</p>

<p>Sets the variable named ${var} to the number of physical
cores available on the machine if the information can be
determined. Otherwise it is set to 0. Currently this
functionality is imple- mented for AIX, cygwin, FreeBSD,
HPUX, IRIX, Linux, Mac OS X, QNX, Sun and Windows.</p>

<p>This function is guaranteed to return a positive integer
(&gt;=1) if it succeeds. It returns 0 if theres a problem
determining the processor count.</p>

<p>Example use, in a ctest -S dashboard script:</p>

<p>include(ProcessorCount) ProcessorCount(N) if(NOT N EQUAL
0) set(CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS -j${N}) set(ctest_test_args
${ctest_test_args} PARALLEL_LEVEL ${N}) endif()</p>

<p>This function is intended to offer an approximation of
the value of the number of compute cores available on the
current machine, such that you may use that value for
parallel building and par- allel testing. It is meant to
help utilize as much of the machine as seems reasonable. Of
course, knowledge of what else might be running on the
machine simultaneously should be used when deciding whether
to request a machines full capacity all for yourself.</p>

<p>Qt4ConfigDependentSettings</p>

<p>This file is included by FindQt4.cmake, don t include it
directly.</p>

<p>Qt4Macros</p>

<p>This file is included by FindQt4.cmake, dont include it
directly.</p>

<p>SelectLibraryConfigurations</p>

<p>select_library_configurations( basename )</p>

<p>This macro takes a library base name as an argument, and
will choose good values for basename_LIBRARY,
basename_LIBRARIES, basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG, and
basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE depending on what has been found
and set. If only base- name_LIBRARY_RELEASE is defined,
basename_LIBRARY will be set to the release value, and
basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG will be set to
basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG-NOTFOUND. If only
basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG is defined, then basename_LIBRARY
will take the debug value, and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE will
be set to base- name_LIBRARY_RELEASE-NOTFOUND.</p>

<p>If the generator supports configuration types, then
base- name_LIBRARY and basename_LIBRARIES will be set with
debug and optimized flags specifying the library to be used
for the given configuration. If no build type has been set
or the generator in use does not support configuration
types, then base- name_LIBRARY and basename_LIBRARIES will
take only the release value, or the debug value if the
release one is not set.</p>

<p>SquishTestScript</p>

<p>This script launches a GUI test using Squish. You should
not call the script directly; instead, you should access it
via the SQUISH_ADD_TEST macro that is defined in
FindSquish.cmake.</p>

<p>This script starts the Squish server, launches the test
on the client, and finally stops the squish server. If any
of these steps fail (including if the tests do not pass)
then a fatal error is raised.</p>

<p>TestBigEndian Define macro to determine endian type</p>

<p>Check if the system is big endian or little endian</p>

<p>TEST_BIG_ENDIAN(VARIABLE) VARIABLE - variable to store
the result to</p>

<p>TestCXXAcceptsFlag Test CXX compiler for a flag</p>

<p>Check if the CXX compiler accepts a flag</p>

<p>Macro CHECK_CXX_ACCEPTS_FLAG(FLAGS VARIABLE) - checks if
the function exists FLAGS - the flags to try VARIABLE -
variable to store the result</p>

<p>TestForANSIForScope Check for ANSI for scope support</p>

<p>Check if the compiler restricts the scope of variables
declared in a for-init-statement to the loop body.</p>

<p>CMAKE_NO_ANSI_FOR_SCOPE - holds result</p>

<p>TestForANSIStreamHeaders Test for compiler support of
ANSI stream headers iostream, etc.</p>

<p>check if the compiler supports the standard ANSI
iostream header (without the .h)</p>

<p>CMAKE_NO_ANSI_STREAM_HEADERS - defined by the
results</p>

<p>TestForSSTREAM Test for compiler support of ANSI sstream
header</p>

<p>TestForSTDNamespace Test for std:: namespace support</p>

<p>check if the compiler supports std:: on stl classes</p>

<p>CMAKE_NO_STD_NAMESPACE - defined by the results</p>

<p>UseEcos This module defines variables and macros
required to build eCos application.</p>

<p>This file contains the following macros:
ECOS_ADD_INCLUDE_DIREC- TORIES() - add the eCos include dirs
ECOS_ADD_EXECUTABLE(name source1 ... sourceN ) - create an
eCos executable ECOS_ADJUST_DIRECTORY(VAR source1 ...
sourceN ) - adjusts the path of the source files and puts
the result into VAR</p>

<p>Macros for selecting the toolchain:
ECOS_USE_ARM_ELF_TOOLS() - enable the ARM ELF toolchain for
the directory where it is called ECOS_USE_I386_ELF_TOOLS() -
enable the i386 ELF toolchain for the directory where it is
called ECOS_USE_PPC_EABI_TOOLS() - enable the PowerPC
toolchain for the directory where it is called</p>

<p>It contains the following variables: ECOS_DEFINITIONS
ECOSCON- FIG_EXECUTABLE ECOS_CONFIG_FILE - defaults to
ecos.ecc, if your eCos configuration file has a different
name, adjust this variable for internal use only:</p>

<p>This file provides functions for Java. It is assumed
that Find- Java.cmake has already been loaded. See
FindJava.cmake for information on how to load Java into your
CMake project.</p>

<p>add_jar(target_name</p>

<p>[SOURCES] source1 [source2 ...] [resource1 ...]
[INCLUDE_JARS jar1 [jar2 ...]] [ENTRY_POINT entry] [VERSION
version] [OUTPUT_NAME name] [OUTPUT_DIR dir] )</p>

<p>This command creates a &lt;target_name&gt;.jar. It
compiles the given source files (source) and adds the given
resource files (resource) to the jar file. If only resource
files are given then just a jar file is created. The list of
include jars are added to the classpath when compiling the
java sources and also to the dependencies of the target.
INCLUDE_JARS also accepts other target names created by
add_jar. For backwards compatibil- ity, jar files listed as
sources are ignored (as they have been since the first
version of this module).</p>

<p>The default OUTPUT_DIR can also be changed by setting
the vari- able CMAKE_JAVA_TARGET_OUTPUT_DIR.</p>

<p>Additional instructions:</p>

<p>To add compile flags to the target you can set these
flags with the following variable:</p>

<p>set(CMAKE_JAVA_COMPILE_FLAGS -nowarn)</p>

<p>To add a path or a jar file to the class path you can do
this with the CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH variable.</p>

<p>set(CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH
/usr/share/java/shibboleet.jar)</p>

<p>To use a different output name for the target you can
set it with:</p>

<p>add_jar(foobar foobar.java OUTPUT_NAME
shibboleet.jar)</p>

<p>To use a different output directory than
CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR you can set it with:</p>

<p>add_jar(foobar foobar.java OUTPUT_DIR
${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/bin)</p>

<p>To define an entry point in your jar you can set it with
the ENTRY_POINT named argument:</p>

<p>add_jar(example ENTRY_POINT
com/examples/MyProject/Main)</p>

<p>To add a VERSION to the target output name you can set
it using the VERSION named argument to add_jar. This will
create a jar file with the name shibboleet-1.0.0.jar and
will create a symlink shibboleet.jar pointing to the jar
with the version information.</p>

<p>add_jar(shibboleet shibbotleet.java VERSION 1.2.0)</p>

<p>If the target is a JNI library, utilize the following
commands to create a JNI symbolic link:</p>

<p>set(CMAKE_JNI_TARGET TRUE) add_jar(shibboleet
shibbotleet.java VERSION 1.2.0) install_jar(shibboleet
${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/shibboleet)
install_jni_symlink(shibboleet ${JAVA_LIB_INSTALL_DIR})</p>

<p>If a single target needs to produce more than one jar
from its java source code, to prevent the accumulation of
duplicate class files in subsequent jars, set/reset
CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX prior to calling the add_jar()
function:</p>

<p>set(CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX com/redhat/foo) add_jar(foo
foo.java)</p>

<p>set(CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX com/redhat/bar) add_jar(bar
bar.java)</p>

<p>Target Properties:</p>

<p>The add_jar() functions sets some target properties. You
can get these properties with the get_property(TARGET
&lt;target_name&gt; PROPERTY &lt;propery_name&gt;)
command.</p>

<p>INSTALL_FILES The files which should be installed. This
is used by install_jar(). JNI_SYMLINK The JNI symlink which
should be installed. This is used by install_jni_symlink().
JAR_FILE The location of the jar file so that you can
include it. CLASS_DIR The directory where the class files
can be found. For example to use them with javah.</p>

<p>find_jar(&lt;VAR&gt;</p>

<p>name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [VERSIONS version1 [version2]] [DOC &quot;cache
documentation string&quot;] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a full path to the named
jar. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to stor
the result of this command. If the full path to a jar is
found the result is stored in the variable and the search
will not repeated unless the variable is cleared. If nothing
is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the
search will be attempted again next time find_jar is invoked
with the same variable. The name of the full path to a file
that is searched for is specified by the names listed after
NAMES argument. Additional search locations can be specified
after the PATHS argument. If you require special a version
of a jar file you can specify it with the VERSIONS argu-
ment. The argument after DOC will be used for the
documentation string in the cache.</p>

<p>install_jar(TARGET_NAME DESTINATION)</p>

<p>This command installs the TARGET_NAME files to the given
DESTI- NATION. It should be called in the same scope as
add_jar() or it will fail.</p>

<p>install_jni_symlink(TARGET_NAME DESTINATION)</p>

<p>This command installs the TARGET_NAME JNI symlinks to
the given DESTINATION. It should be called in the same scope
as add_jar() or it will fail.</p>

<p>create_javadoc(&lt;VAR&gt;</p>

<p>PACKAGES pkg1 [pkg2 ...] [SOURCEPATH &lt;sourcepath&gt;]
[CLASSPATH &lt;classpath&gt;] [INSTALLPATH &lt;install
path&gt;] [DOCTITLE &quot;the documentation title&quot;]
[WINDOWTITLE &quot;the title of the document&quot;] [AUTHOR
TRUE|FALSE] [USE TRUE|FALSE] [VERSION TRUE|FALSE] )</p>

<p>Create java documentation based on files or packages.
For more details please read the javadoc manpage.</p>

<p>There are two main signatures for create_javadoc. The
first sig- nature works with package names on a path with
source files:</p>

<p>Example: create_javadoc(my_example_doc PACKAGES
com.exmaple.foo com.example.bar SOURCEPATH
&quot;${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}&quot; CLASSPATH
${CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH} WINDOWTITLE &quot;My
example&quot; DOCTITLE &quot;&lt;h1&gt;My
example&lt;/h1&gt;&quot; AUTHOR TRUE USE TRUE VERSION TRUE
)</p>

<p>The second signature for create_javadoc works on a given
list of files.</p>

<p>create_javadoc(&lt;VAR&gt; FILES file1 [file2 ...]
[CLASSPATH &lt;classpath&gt;] [INSTALLPATH &lt;install
path&gt;] [DOCTITLE &quot;the documentation title&quot;]
[WINDOWTITLE &quot;the title of the document&quot;] [AUTHOR
TRUE|FALSE] [USE TRUE|FALSE] [VERSION TRUE|FALSE] )</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>create_javadoc(my_example_doc FILES ${example_SRCS}
CLASSPATH ${CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH} WINDOWTITLE &quot;My
example&quot; DOCTITLE &quot;&lt;h1&gt;My
example&lt;/h1&gt;&quot; AUTHOR TRUE USE TRUE VERSION TRUE
)</p>

<p>Both signatures share most of the options. These options
are the same as what you can find in the javadoc manpage.
Please look at the manpage for CLASSPATH, DOCTITLE,
WINDOWTITLE, AUTHOR, USE and VERSION.</p>

<p>The documentation will be by default installed to</p>

<p>${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/javadoc/&lt;VAR&gt;</p>

<p>if you dont set the INSTALLPATH.</p>

<p>UseJavaClassFilelist</p>

<p>This script create a list of compiled Java class files
to be added to a jar file. This avoids including cmake files
which get created in the binary directory.</p>

<p>UseJavaSymlinks</p>

<p>Helper script for UseJava.cmake</p>

<p>UsePkgConfig Obsolete pkg-config module for CMake, use
FindPkgConfig instead.</p>

<p>This module defines the following macro:</p>

<p>PKGCONFIG(package includedir libdir linkflags
cflags)</p>

<p>Calling PKGCONFIG will fill the desired information into
the 4 given arguments, e.g. PKGCONFIG(libart-2.0
LIBART_INCLUDE_DIR LIBART_LINK_DIR LIBART_LINK_FLAGS
LIBART_CFLAGS) if pkg-config was NOT found or the specified
software package doesnt exist, the variable will be empty
when the function returns, otherwise they will contain the
respective information</p>

<p>UseQt4 Use Module for QT4</p>

<p>Sets up C and C++ to use Qt 4. It is assumed that
FindQt.cmake has already been loaded. See FindQt.cmake for
information on how to load Qt 4 into your CMake project.</p>

<p>UseSWIG SWIG module for CMake</p>

<p>Defines the following macros:</p>

<p>SWIG_ADD_MODULE(name language [ files ]) - Define swig
module with given name and specified language
SWIG_LINK_LIBRARIES(name [ libraries ]) - Link libraries to
swig module</p>

<p>All other macros are for internal use only. To get the
actual name of the swig module, use:
${SWIG_MODULE_${name}_REAL_NAME}. Set Source files
properties such as CPLUSPLUS and SWIG_FLAGS to specify
special behavior of SWIG. Also global CMAKE_SWIG_FLAGS can
be used to add special flags to all swig calls. Another spe-
cial variable is CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR, it allows one to specify
where to write all the swig generated module (swig -outdir
option) The name-specific variable
SWIG_MODULE_&lt;name&gt;_EXTRA_DEPS may be used to specify
extra dependencies for the generated mod- ules. If the
source file generated by swig need some special flag you can
use set_source_files_properties( ${swig_gener-
ated_file_fullname}</p>

<p>POLICIES CMP0000 A minimum required CMake version must
be specified.</p>

<p>CMake requires that projects specify the version of
CMake to which they have been written. This policy has been
put in place so users trying to build the project may be
told when they need to update their CMake. Specifying a
version also helps the project build with CMake versions
newer than that specified. Use the cmake_minimum_required
command at the top of your main CMakeLists.txt file:</p>

<p>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION
&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;)</p>

<p>where &quot;&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;&quot; is the
version of CMake you want to sup- port (such as
&quot;2.6&quot;). The command will ensure that at least the
given version of CMake is running and help newer versions be
compatible with the project. See documentation of
cmake_mini- mum_required for details.</p>

<p>Note that the command invocation must appear in the
CMake- Lists.txt file itself; a call in an included file is
not suffi- cient. However, the cmake_policy command may be
called to set policy CMP0000 to OLD or NEW behavior
explicitly. The OLD behavior is to silently ignore the
missing invocation. The NEW behavior is to issue an error
instead of a warning. An included file may set CMP0000
explicitly to affect how this policy is enforced for the
main CMakeLists.txt file.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.</p>

<p>CMP0001 CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY should no longer
be used.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior is to check
CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY and present it to the user.
The NEW behavior is to ignore CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY
completely.</p>

<p>In CMake 2.4 and below the variable
CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBIL- ITY was used to request
compatibility with earlier versions of CMake. In CMake 2.6
and above all compatibility issues are han- dled by policies
and the cmake_policy command. However, CMake must still
check CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY for projects written for
CMake 2.4 and below.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0002 Logical target names must be globally
unique.</p>

<p>Targets names created with add_executable, add_library,
or add_custom_target are logical build target names. Logical
tar- get names must be globally unique because:</p>

<p>- Unique names may be referenced unambiguously both in
CMake code and on make tool command lines. - Logical names
are used by Xcode and VS IDE generators to produce
meaningful project names for the targets.</p>

<p>The logical name of executable and library targets does
not have to correspond to the physical file names built.
Consider using the OUTPUT_NAME target property to create two
targets with the same physical name while keeping logical
names distinct. Custom targets must simply have globally
unique names (unless one uses the global property
ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS with a Make- files
generator).</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0003 Libraries linked via full path no longer produce
linker search paths.</p>

<p>This policy affects how libraries whose full paths are
NOT known are found at link time, but was created due to a
change in how CMake deals with libraries whose full paths
are known. Consider the code</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so)</p>

<p>CMake 2.4 and below implemented linking to libraries
whose full paths are known by splitting them on the link
line into separate components consisting of the linker
search path and the library name. The example code might
have produced something like</p>

<p>... -L/path/to -lA ...</p>

<p>in order to link to library A. An analysis was performed
to order multiple link directories such that the linker
would find library A in the desired location, but there are
cases in which this does not work. CMake versions 2.6 and
above use the more reliable approach of passing the full
path to libraries directly to the linker in most cases. The
example code now produces something like</p>

<p>... /path/to/libA.so ....</p>

<p>Unfortunately this change can break code like</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)</p>

<p>where &quot;B&quot; is meant to find
&quot;/path/to/libB.so&quot;. This code is wrong because the
user is asking the linker to find library B but has not
provided a linker search path (which may be added with the
link_directories command). However, with the old link- ing
implementation the code would work accidentally because the
linker search path added for library A allowed library B to
be found.</p>

<p>In order to support projects depending on linker search
paths added by linking to libraries with known full paths,
the OLD behavior for this policy will add the linker search
paths even though they are not needed for their own
libraries. When this policy is set to OLD, CMake will
produce a link line such as</p>

<p>... -L/path/to /path/to/libA.so -lB ...</p>

<p>which will allow library B to be found as it was
previously. When this policy is set to NEW, CMake will
produce a link line such as</p>

<p>... /path/to/libA.so -lB ...</p>

<p>which more accurately matches what the project
specified.</p>

<p>The setting for this policy used when generating the
link line is that in effect when the target is created by an
add_exe- cutable or add_library command. For the example
described above, the code</p>

<p>cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 OLD) # or cmake_policy(VERSION
2.4) add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)</p>

<p>will work and suppress the warning for this policy. It
may also be updated to work with the corrected linking
approach:</p>

<p>cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW) # or cmake_policy(VERSION
2.6) link_directories(/path/to) # needed to find library B
add_executable(myexe myexe.c) target_link_libraries(myexe
/path/to/libA.so B)</p>

<p>Even better, library B may be specified with a full
path:</p>

<p>add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so
/path/to/libB.so)</p>

<p>When all items on the link line have known paths CMake
does not check this policy so it has no effect.</p>

<p>Note that the warning for this policy will be issued for
at most one target. This avoids flooding users with messages
for every target when setting the policy once will probably
fix all tar- gets.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0004 Libraries linked may not have leading or
trailing whitespace.</p>

<p>CMake versions 2.4 and below silently removed leading
and trail- ing whitespace from libraries linked with code
like</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(myexe &quot; A &quot;)</p>

<p>This could lead to subtle errors in user projects.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to silently remove
leading and trailing whitespace. The NEW behavior for this
policy is to diagnose the existence of such whitespace as an
error. The set- ting for this policy used when checking the
library names is that in effect when the target is created
by an add_executable or add_library command.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0005 Preprocessor definition values are now escaped
automatically.</p>

<p>This policy determines whether or not CMake should
generate escaped preprocessor definition values added via
add_defini- tions. CMake versions 2.4 and below assumed that
only trivial values would be given for macros in
add_definitions calls. It did not attempt to escape
non-trivial values such as string lit- erals in generated
build rules. CMake versions 2.6 and above support escaping
of most values, but cannot assume the user has not added
escapes already in an attempt to work around limita- tions
in earlier versions.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to place definition
values given to add_definitions directly in the generated
build rules without attempting to escape anything. The NEW
behavior for this policy is to generate correct escapes for
all native build tools automatically. See documentation of
the COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS target property for limitations of
the escaping implemen- tation.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0006 Installing MACOSX_BUNDLE targets requires a
BUNDLE DESTINATION.</p>

<p>This policy determines whether the install(TARGETS)
command must be given a BUNDLE DESTINATION when asked to
install a target with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set. CMake
2.4 and below did not distinguish application bundles from
normal executables when installing targets. CMake 2.6
provides a BUNDLE option to the install(TARGETS) command
that specifies rules specific to appli- cation bundles on
the Mac. Projects should use this option when installing a
target with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to fall back to the
RUNTIME DESTINATION if a BUNDLE DESTINATION is not given.
The NEW behavior for this policy is to produce an error if a
bundle tar- get is installed without a BUNDLE
DESTINATION.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0007 list command no longer ignores empty
elements.</p>

<p>This policy determines whether the list command will
ignore empty elements in the list. CMake 2.4 and below list
commands ignored all empty elements in the list. For
example, a;b;;c would have length 3 and not 4. The OLD
behavior for this policy is to ignore empty list elements.
The NEW behavior for this pol- icy is to correctly count
empty elements in a list.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0008 Libraries linked by full-path must have a valid
library file name.</p>

<p>In CMake 2.4 and below it is possible to write code
like</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(myexe /full/path/to/somelib)</p>

<p>where &quot;somelib&quot; is supposed to be a valid
library file name such as &quot;libsomelib.a&quot; or
&quot;somelib.lib&quot;. For Makefile generators this
produces an error at build time because the dependency on
the full path cannot be found. For VS IDE and Xcode
generators this used to work by accident because CMake would
always split off the library directory and ask the linker to
search for the library by name (-lsomelib or somelib.lib).
Despite the failure with Makefiles, some projects have code
like this and build only with VS and/or Xcode. This version
of CMake prefers to pass the full path directly to the
native build tool, which will fail in this case because it
does not name a valid library file.</p>

<p>This policy determines what to do with full paths that
do not appear to name a valid library file. The OLD behavior
for this policy is to split the library name from the path
and ask the linker to search for it. The NEW behavior for
this policy is to trust the given path and pass it directly
to the native build tool unchanged.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.1. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0009 FILE GLOB_RECURSE calls should not follow
symlinks by default.</p>

<p>In CMake 2.6.1 and below, FILE GLOB_RECURSE calls would
follow through symlinks, sometimes coming up with
unexpectedly large result sets because of symlinks to top
level directories that contain hundreds of thousands of
files.</p>

<p>This policy determines whether or not to follow symlinks
encoun- tered during a FILE GLOB_RECURSE call. The OLD
behavior for this policy is to follow the symlinks. The NEW
behavior for this pol- icy is not to follow the symlinks by
default, but only if FOL- LOW_SYMLINKS is given as an
additional argument to the FILE com- mand.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.2. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0010 Bad variable reference syntax is an error.</p>

<p>In CMake 2.6.2 and below, incorrect variable reference
syntax such as a missing close-brace (&quot;${FOO&quot;) was
reported but did not stop processing of CMake code. This
policy determines whether a bad variable reference is an
error. The OLD behavior for this policy is to warn about the
error, leave the string untouched, and continue. The NEW
behavior for this policy is to report an error.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.3. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0011 Included scripts do automatic cmake_policy PUSH
and POP.</p>

<p>In CMake 2.6.2 and below, CMake Policy settings in
scripts loaded by the include() and find_package() commands
would affect the includer. Explicit invocations of
cmake_policy(PUSH) and cmake_policy(POP) were required to
isolate policy changes and protect the includer. While some
scripts intend to affect the policies of their includer,
most do not. In CMake 2.6.3 and above, include() and
find_package() by default PUSH and POP an entry on the
policy stack around an included script, but provide a
NO_POLICY_SCOPE option to disable it. This policy determines
whether or not to imply NO_POLICY_SCOPE for compatibility.
The OLD behavior for this policy is to imply NO_POLICY_SCOPE
for include() and find_package() commands. The NEW behavior
for this policy is to allow the commands to do their default
cmake_policy PUSH and POP.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.3. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0012 if() recognizes numbers and boolean
constants.</p>

<p>In CMake versions 2.6.4 and lower the if() command
implicitly dereferenced arguments corresponding to
variables, even those named like numbers or boolean
constants, except for 0 and 1. Numbers and boolean constants
such as true, false, yes, no, on, off, y, n, notfound,
ignore (all case insensitive) were recog- nized in some
cases but not all. For example, the code
&quot;if(TRUE)&quot; might have evaluated as false. Numbers
such as 2 were recognized only in boolean expressions like
&quot;if(NOT 2)&quot; (leading to false) but not as a
single-argument like &quot;if(2)&quot; (also leading to
false). Later versions of CMake prefer to treat numbers and
boolean constants literally, so they should not be used as
variable names.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to implicitly
dereference variables named like numbers and boolean
constants. The NEW behavior for this policy is to recognize
numbers and boolean constants without dereferencing
variables with such names.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0013 Duplicate binary directories are not
allowed.</p>

<p>CMake 2.6.3 and below silently permitted
add_subdirectory() calls to create the same binary directory
multiple times. Dur- ing build system generation files would
be written and then overwritten in the build tree and could
lead to strange behav- ior. CMake 2.6.4 and above explicitly
detect duplicate binary directories. CMake 2.6.4 always
considers this case an error. In CMake 2.8.0 and above this
policy determines whether or not the case is an error. The
OLD behavior for this policy is to allow duplicate binary
directories. The NEW behavior for this policy is to disallow
duplicate binary directories with an error.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0014 Input directories must have CMakeLists.txt.</p>

<p>CMake versions before 2.8 silently ignored missing
CMake- Lists.txt files in directories referenced by
add_subdirectory() or subdirs(), treating them as if present
but empty. In CMake 2.8.0 and above this policy determines
whether or not the case is an error. The OLD behavior for
this policy is to silently ignore the problem. The NEW
behavior for this policy is to report an error.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0015 link_directories() treats paths relative to the
source dir.</p>

<p>In CMake 2.8.0 and lower the link_directories() command
passed relative paths unchanged to the linker. In CMake
2.8.1 and above the link_directories() command prefers to
interpret relative paths with respect to
CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR, which is consistent with
include_directories() and other commands. The OLD behavior
for this policy is to use relative paths verba- tim in the
linker command. The NEW behavior for this policy is to
convert relative paths to absolute paths by appending the
relative path to CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.1. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0016 target_link_libraries() reports error if its
only argument is not a target.</p>

<p>In CMake 2.8.2 and lower the target_link_libraries()
command silently ignored if it was called with only one
argument, and this argument wasnt a valid target. In CMake
2.8.3 and above it reports an error in this case.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.3. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0017 Prefer files from the CMake module directory
when including from there.</p>

<p>Starting with CMake 2.8.4, if a cmake-module shipped
with CMake (i.e. located in the CMake module directory)
calls include() or find_package(), the files located in the
CMake module directory are preferred over the files in
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. This makes sure that the modules
belonging to CMake always get those files included which
they expect, and against which they were devel- oped and
tested. In all other cases, the files found in
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH still take precedence over the ones in the
CMake module directory. The OLD behaviour is to always
prefer files from CMAKE_MODULE_PATH over files from the
CMake modules directory.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.4. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0018 Ignore CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS
variable.</p>

<p>CMake 2.8.8 and lower compiled sources in SHARED and
MODULE libraries using the value of the undocumented
CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS platform variable.
The vari- able contained platform-specific flags needed to
compile objects for shared libraries. Typically it included
a flag such as -fPIC for position independent code but also
included other flags needed on certain platforms. CMake
2.8.9 and higher pre- fer instead to use the
POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE target property to determine what
targets should be position independent, and new undocumented
platform variables to select flags while ignor- ing
CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS completely.</p>

<p>The default for either approach produces identical
compilation flags, but if a project modifies
CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS from its original
value this policy determines which approach to use.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to ignore the
POSITION_INDE- PENDENT_CODE property for all targets and use
the modified value of
CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS for SHARED and
MODULE libraries.</p>

<p>The NEW behavior for this policy is to ignore
CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS whether it is
modified or not and honor the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
target property.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.9. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0019 Do not re-expand variables in include and link
information.</p>

<p>CMake 2.8.10 and lower re-evaluated values given to the
include_directories, link_directories, and link_libraries
com- mands to expand any leftover variable references at the
end of the configuration step. This was for strict
compatibility with VERY early CMake versions because all
variable references are now normally evaluated during CMake
language processing. CMake 2.8.11 and higher prefer to skip
the extra evaluation.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to re-evaluate the
values for strict compatibility. The NEW behavior for this
policy is to leave the values untouched.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.11.
CMake ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set
and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set
it to OLD or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0020 Automatically link Qt executables to qtmain
target on Windows.</p>

<p>CMake 2.8.10 and lower required users of Qt to always
specify a link dependency to the qtmain.lib static library
manually on Windows. CMake 2.8.11 gained the ability to
evaluate generator expressions while determining the link
dependencies from IMPORTED targets. This allows CMake itself
to automatically link executables which link to Qt to the
qtmain.lib library when using IMPORTED Qt targets. For
applications already linking to qtmain.lib, this should have
little impact. For applications which supply their own
alternative WinMain implementation and for applications
which use the QAxServer library, this automatic linking will
need to be disabled as per the documentation.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is not to link
executables to qtmain.lib automatically when they link to
the QtCore IMPORTED- target. The NEW behavior for this
policy is to link executables to qtmain.lib automatically
when they link to QtCore IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.11.
CMake ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set
and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set
it to OLD or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0021 Fatal error on relative paths in
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES target property.</p>

<p>CMake 2.8.10.2 and lower allowed the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
target property to contain relative paths. The base path for
such rel- ative entries is not well defined. CMake 2.8.12
issues a FATAL_ERROR if the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES property
contains a rela- tive path.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is not to warn about
relative paths in the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES target property.
The NEW behavior for this policy is to issue a FATAL_ERROR
if INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES contains a relative path.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.12.
CMake ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set
and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set
it to OLD or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0022 INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES defines the link
interface.</p>

<p>CMake 2.8.11 constructed the link interface of a target
from properties matching
(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_&lt;CON- FIG&gt;)?.
The modern way to specify config-sensitive content is to use
generator expressions and the IMPORTED_ prefix makes uni-
form processing of the link interface with generator
expressions impossible. The INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES target
property was introduced as a replacement in CMake 2.8.12.
This new property is named consistently with the
INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS, INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
and INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS properties. For in-build
targets, CMake will use the INTER- FACE_LINK_LIBRARIES
property as the source of the link interface only if policy
CMP0022 is NEW. When exporting a target which has this
policy set to NEW, only the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES
property will be processed and generated for the IMPORTED
target by default. A new option to the install(EXPORT) and
export com- mands allows export of the old-style properties
for compatibil- ity with downstream users of CMake versions
older than 2.8.12. The target_link_libraries command will no
longer populate the properties matching
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)? if this policy is
NEW.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to ignore the INTER-
FACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property for in-build targets. The NEW
behavior for this policy is to use the
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property for in-build targets, and
ignore the old properties matching
(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.12.
CMake ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set
and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set
it to OLD or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0023 Plain and keyword target_link_libraries
signatures cannot be mixed.</p>

<p>CMake 2.8.12 introduced the target_link_libraries
signature using the PUBLIC, PRIVATE, and INTERFACE keywords
to generalize the LINK_PUBLIC and LINK_PRIVATE keywords
introduced in CMake 2.8.7. Use of signatures with any of
these keywords sets the link interface of a target
explicitly, even if empty. This pro- duces confusing
behavior when used in combination with the his- torical
behavior of the plain target_link_libraries signature. For
example, consider the code:</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(mylib A)
target_link_libraries(mylib PRIVATE B)</p>

<p>After the first line the link interface has not been set
explic- itly so CMake would use the link implementation, A,
as the link interface. However, the second line sets the
link interface to empty. In order to avoid this subtle
behavior CMake now prefers to disallow mixing the plain and
keyword signatures of tar- get_link_libraries for a single
target.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to allow keyword and
plain target_link_libraries signatures to be mixed. The NEW
behavior for this policy is to not to allow mixing of the
keyword and plain signatures.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.12.
CMake ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set
and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set
it to OLD or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>VARIABLES VARIABLES THAT CHANGE BEHAVIOR
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS Global flag to cause add_library to create
shared libraries if on.</p>

<p>If present and true, this will cause all libraries to be
built shared unless the library was explicitly added as a
static library. This variable is often added to projects as
an OPTION so that each user of a project can decide if they
want to build the project using shared or static
libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES List of files which
have been installed using an ABSOLUTE DES- TINATION
path.</p>

<p>This variable is defined by CMake-generated
cmake_install.cmake scripts. It can be used (read-only) by
programs or scripts that source those install scripts. This
is used by some CPack genera- tors (e.g. RPM).</p>

<p>CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE Switch between strict and
relaxed automoc mode.</p>

<p>By default, automoc behaves exactly as described in the
documen- tation of the AUTOMOC target property. When set to
TRUE, it accepts more input and tries to find the correct
input file for moc even if it differs from the documented
behaviour. In this mode it e.g. also checks whether a header
file is intended to be processed by moc when a
&quot;foo.moc&quot; file has been included.</p>

<p>Relaxed mode has to be enabled for KDE4
compatibility.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY Version of cmake required
to build project</p>

<p>From the point of view of backwards compatibility, this
speci- fies what version of CMake should be supported. By
default this value is the version number of CMake that you
are running. You can set this to an older version of CMake
to support deprecated commands of CMake in projects that
were written to use older versions of CMake. This can be set
by the user or set at the beginning of a CMakeLists
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Specifies the build type on
single-configuration generators.</p>

<p>This statically specifies what build type
(configuration) will be built in this build tree. Possible
values are empty, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and
MinSizeRel. This variable is only meaningful to
single-configuration generators (such as make and Ninja)
i.e. those which choose a single configuration when CMake
runs to generate a build tree as opposed to
multi-configuration generators which offer selection of the
build configuration within the generated build environment.
There are many per-con- fig properties and variables
(usually following clean SOME_VAR_&lt;CONFIG&gt; order
conventions), such as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;,
specified as uppercase:
CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[DEBUG|RELEASE|RELWITHDEBINFO|MINSIZEREL]. For
example, in a build tree configured to build type Debug,
CMake will see to having CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG settings get
added to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS settings. See also
CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE Enables color output when using the
Makefile generator.</p>

<p>When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce
colored out- put. Default is ON.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES Specifies the available build
types on multi-config generators.</p>

<p>This specifies what build types (configurations) will be
avail- able such as Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo etc. This
has rea- sonable defaults on most platforms, but can be
extended to pro- vide other build types. See also
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE for details of managing configuration data,
and CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR.</p>

<p>CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES Enables tracing output for
target properties.</p>

<p>This variable can be populated with a list of properties
to gen- erate debug output for when evaluating target
properties. Cur- rently it can only be used when evaluating
the INCLUDE_DIRECTO- RIES, COMPILE_DEFINITIONS and
COMPILE_OPTIONS target properties. In that case, it outputs
a backtrace for each entry in the tar- get property. Default
is unset.</p>

<p>CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt; Variable
for disabling find_package() calls.</p>

<p>Every non-REQUIRED find_package() call in a project can
be dis- abled by setting the variable
CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;Packa- geName&gt; to TRUE.
This can be used to build a project without an optional
package, although that package is installed.</p>

<p>This switch should be used during the initial CMake run.
Other- wise if the package has already been found in a
previous CMake run, the variables which have been stored in
the cache will still be there. In that case it is
recommended to remove the cache variables for this package
from the cache using the cache editor or cmake -U</p>

<p>CMAKE_ERROR_DEPRECATED Whether to issue deprecation
errors for macros and functions.</p>

<p>If TRUE, this can be used by macros and functions to
issue fatal errors when deprecated macros or functions are
used. This vari- able is FALSE by default.</p>

<p>CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION Ask
cmake_install.cmake script to error out as soon as a file
with absolute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.</p>

<p>The fatal error is emitted before the installation of
the offending file takes place. This variable is used by
CMake-gen- erated cmake_install.cmake scripts. If one sets
this variable to ON while running the script, it may get
fatal error messages from the script.</p>

<p>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES Prefixes to prepend when
looking for libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies what prefixes to add to library names
when the find_library command looks for libraries. On UNIX
systems this is typically lib, meaning that when trying to
find the foo library it will look for libfoo.</p>

<p>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES Suffixes to append when
looking for libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies what suffixes to add to library names
when the find_library command looks for libraries. On
Windows systems this is typically .lib and .dll, meaning
that when trying to find the foo library it will look for
foo.dll etc.</p>

<p>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE Tell find_package to
warn if called without an explicit mode.</p>

<p>If find_package is called without an explicit mode
option (MOD- ULE, CONFIG or NO_MODULE) and no
Find&lt;pkg&gt;.cmake module is in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH then
CMake implicitly assumes that the caller intends to search
for a package configuration file. If no pack- age
configuration file is found then the wording of the failure
message must account for both the case that the package is
really missing and the case that the project has a bug and
failed to provide the intended Find module. If instead the
caller specifies an explicit mode option then the failure
mes- sage can be more specific.</p>

<p>Set CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE to TRUE to tell
find_pack- age to warn when it implicitly assumes Config
mode. This helps developers enforce use of an explicit mode
in all calls to find_package within a project.</p>

<p>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX()
commands.</p>

<p>Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in
FIND_XXX() commands. This is useful in cross-compiled
environments where some system directories contain
incompatible but possibly link- able libraries. For example,
on cross-compiled cluster environ- ments, this allows a user
to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the
front-end machine that modules like FindX11 (and others)
would normally search. By default this is empty; it is
intended to be set by the project. Note that
CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH takes a list of directory names, NOT a
list of prefixes. If you want to ignore paths under prefixes
(bin, include, lib, etc.), youll need to specify them
explicitly. See also CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE()
and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the
contained directories for the existence of the file which is
currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended
to be set by the project. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PRE- FIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME Default component
used in install() commands.</p>

<p>If an install() command is used without the COMPONENT
argument, these files will be grouped into a default
component. The name of this default install component will
be taken from this vari- able. It defaults to
&quot;Unspecified&quot;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX Install directory used by
install.</p>

<p>If &quot;make install&quot; is invoked or INSTALL is
built, this directory is prepended onto all install
directories. This variable defaults to /usr/local on UNIX
and c:/Program Files on Windows.</p>

<p>On UNIX one can use the DESTDIR mechanism in order to
relocate the whole installation. DESTDIR means DESTination
DIRectory. It is commonly used by makefile users in order to
install software at non-default location. It is usually
invoked like this:</p>

<p>make DESTDIR=/home/john install</p>

<p>which will install the concerned software using the
installation prefix, e.g. &quot;/usr/local&quot; prepended
with the DESTDIR value which finally gives
&quot;/home/john/usr/local&quot;.</p>

<p>WARNING: DESTDIR may not be used on Windows because
installation prefix usually contains a drive letter like in
&quot;C:/Program Files&quot; which cannot be prepended with
some other prefix.</p>

<p>The installation prefix is also added to
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PRE- FIX_PATH so that find_package,
find_program, find_library, find_path, and find_file will
search the prefix for other soft- ware.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_LIBRARY().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY().
FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the contained directories
for the existence of the library which is currently
searched. By default it is empty, it is intended to be set
by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_MFC_FLAG Tell cmake to use MFC for an executable
or dll.</p>

<p>This can be set in a CMakeLists.txt file and will enable
MFC in the application. It should be set to 1 for the static
MFC library, and 2 for the shared MFC library. This is used
in Visual Studio 6 and 7 project files. The CMakeSetup
dialog used MFC and the CMakeLists.txt looks like this:</p>

<p>add_definitions(-D_AFXDLL) set(CMAKE_MFC_FLAG 2)
add_executable(CMakeSetup WIN32 ${SRCS})</p>

<p>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH List of directories to search for
CMake modules.</p>

<p>Commands like include() and find_package() search for
files in directories listed by this variable before checking
the default modules that come with CMake.</p>

<p>CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS Skip _BUILD_TYPE flags if
true.</p>

<p>This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake
to tell CMake to skip the _BUILD_TYPE flags.</p>

<p>CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; Default for CMake
Policy CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; when it is otherwise left unset.</p>

<p>Commands cmake_minimum_required(VERSION) and
cmake_policy(VER- SION) by default leave policies introduced
after the given ver- sion unset. Set
CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; to OLD or NEW to
specify the default for policy CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;, where
&lt;NNNN&gt; is the policy number.</p>

<p>This variable should not be set by a project in CMake
code; use cmake_policy(SET) instead. Users running CMake may
set this variable in the cache (e.g. -DCMAKE_POL-
ICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;=&lt;OLD|NEW&gt;) to set a policy
not otherwise set by the project. Set to OLD to quiet a
policy warning while using old behavior or to NEW to try
building the project with new behavior.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(),
with appropriate suffixes added.</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX()
commands. It contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the
FIND_XXX() commands append appropriate subdirectories to the
base directories. So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each of the
directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each
of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append
/include . By default it is empty, it is intended to be set
by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH,
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_PROGRAM().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM().
FIND_PRO- GRAM() will check each of the contained
directories for the existence of the program which is
currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended
to be set by the project. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY Don t make the install
target depend on the all target.</p>

<p>By default, the &quot;install&quot; target depends on
the &quot;all&quot; target. This has the effect, that when
&quot;make install&quot; is invoked or INSTALL is built,
first the &quot;all&quot; target is built, then the
installation starts. If CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY is
set to TRUE, this dependency is not created, so the
installation process will start immediately, independent
from whether the project has been completely built or
not.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH Path to be ignored by
FIND_XXX() commands.</p>

<p>Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in
FIND_XXX() commands. This is useful in cross-compiled
environments where some system directories contain
incompatible but possibly link- able libraries. For example,
on cross-compiled cluster environ- ments, this allows a user
to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the
front-end machine that modules like FindX11 (and others)
would normally search. By default this contains a list of
directories containing incompatible binaries for the host
system. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH,
CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, and
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE()
and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the
contained directories for the existence of the file which is
currently searched. By default it contains the standard
directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be
modified by the project, use CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH for this.
See also CMAKE_SYS- TEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_LIBRARY().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY().
FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the contained directories
for the existence of the library which is currently
searched. By default it contains the standard directories
for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by
the project, use CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH for this. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_XXX(), with appropriate suffixes added.</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX()
commands. It contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the
FIND_XXX() commands append appropriate subdirectories to the
base directories. So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each of the
directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each
of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append
/include . By default this contains the standard directories
for the current system and the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. It is
NOT intended to be modified by the project, use
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYS-
TEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PRO- GRAM_PATH, and
CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_PROGRAM().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM().
FIND_PRO- GRAM() will check each of the contained
directories for the existence of the program which is
currently searched. By default it contains the standard
directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be
modified by the project, use CMAKE_PRO- GRAM_PATH for this.
See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE Specify a CMake file that
overrides platform information.</p>

<p>CMake loads the specified file while enabling support
for each language from either the project() or
enable_language() com- mands. It is loaded after CMakes
builtin compiler and platform information modules have been
loaded but before the information is used. The file may set
platform information variables to override CMakes
defaults.</p>

<p>This feature is intended for use only in overriding
information variables that must be set before CMake builds
its first test project to check that the compiler for a
language works. It should not be used to load a file in
cases that a normal include() will work. Use it only as a
last resort for behavior that cannot be achieved any other
way. For example, one may set CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT to change
the default value used to initial- ize CMAKE_C_FLAGS before
it is cached. The override file should NOT be used to set
anything that could be set after languages are enabled, such
as variables like CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIREC- TORY that
affect the placement of binaries. Information set in the
file will be used for try_compile and try_run builds
too.</p>

<p>CMAKE_WARN_DEPRECATED Whether to issue deprecation
warnings for macros and functions.</p>

<p>If TRUE, this can be used by macros and functions to
issue dep- recation warnings. This variable is FALSE by
default.</p>

<p>CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION Ask
cmake_install.cmake script to warn each time a file with
absolute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.</p>

<p>This variable is used by CMake-generated
cmake_install.cmake scripts. If one sets this variable to ON
while running the script, it may get warning messages from
the script.</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT DESCRIBE THE SYSTEM APPLE True if running
on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>Set to true on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>BORLAND True if the Borland compiler is being used.</p>

<p>This is set to true if the Borland compiler is being
used.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CL_64 Using the 64 bit compiler from Microsoft</p>

<p>Set to true when using the 64 bit cl compiler from
Microsoft.</p>

running on.</p>

<p>The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR but for the host
system instead of the target system when cross
compiling.</p>

target architecture library directory names.</p>

<p>This is used to detect
CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE from the implicit
linker search path by matching the &lt;arch&gt; name.</p>

<p>CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX Maximum object file full-path
length allowed by native build tools.</p>

<p>CMake computes for every source file an object file name
that is unique to the source file and deterministic with
respect to the full path to the source file. This allows
multiple source files in a target to share the same name if
they lie in different directories without rebuilding when
one is added or removed. However, it can produce long full
paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path using a
hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds
a limit. CMake has a built-in limit for each platform that
is sufficient for common tools, but some native tools may
have a lower limit. This variable may be set to specify the
limit explicitly. The value must be an integer no less than
128.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM Name of system cmake is compiling for.</p>

<p>This variable is the composite of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME and
CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION, like this ${CMAKE_SYS-
TEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION}. If CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
is not set, then CMAKE_SYSTEM is the same as
CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Name of the OS CMake is building
for.</p>

<p>This is the name of the operating system on which CMake
is tar- geting. On systems that have the uname command, this

and Darwin for Mac OS X are the values found on the big
three operating systems.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR The name of the CPU CMake is
building for.</p>

<p>On systems that support uname, this variable is set to
the out- put of uname -p, on windows it is set to the value
of the envi- ronment variable PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION OS version CMake is building
for.</p>

<p>A numeric version string for the system, on systems that
support uname, this variable is set to the output of uname
-r. On other systems this is set to major-minor version
numbers.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IGNORE_EXTENSIONS File extensions
that should be ignored by the build.</p>

<p>This is a list of file extensions that may be part of a
project for a given language but are not compiled.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header
files.</p>

<p>CMake does not explicitly specify these directories on
compiler command lines for language &lt;LANG&gt;. This
prevents system include directories from being treated as
user include directories on some compilers.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES Implicit
linker search path detected for language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>Compilers typically pass directories containing language
runtime libraries and default library search paths when they
invoke a linker. These paths are implicit linker search
directories for the compilers language. CMake automatically
detects these directories for each language and reports the
results in this variable.</p>

<p>When a library in one of these directories is given by
full path to target_link_libraries() CMake will generate the
-l&lt;name&gt; form on link lines to ensure the linker
searches its implicit directories for the library. Note that
some toolchains read implicit directories from an
environment variable such as LIBRARY_PATH so keep its value
consistent when operating in a given build tree.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_FRAMEWORK_DIRECTORIES
Implicit linker framework search path detected for language
&lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>These paths are implicit linker framework search
directories for the compilers language. CMake automatically
detects these directories for each language and reports the
results in this variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES Implicit link
libraries and flags detected for language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>Compilers typically pass language runtime library names
and other flags when they invoke a linker. These flags are
implicit link options for the compilers language. CMake
automatically detects these libraries and flags for each
language and reports the results in this variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE Target
architecture library directory name detected for
&lt;lang&gt;.</p>

<p>If the &lt;lang&gt; compiler passes to the linker an
architecture-spe- cific system library search directory such
as &lt;pre- fix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; this variable contains
the &lt;arch&gt; name if/as detected by CMake.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE Preference value
for linker language selection.</p>

<p>The &quot;linker language&quot; for executable, shared
library, and module targets is the language whose compiler
will invoke the linker. The LINKER_LANGUAGE target property
sets the language explic- itly. Otherwise, the linker
language is that whose linker pref- erence value is highest
among languages compiled and linked into the target. See
also the CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPA- GATES
variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES True if
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE propagates across tar-
gets.</p>

<p>This is used when CMake selects a linker language for a
target. Languages compiled directly into the target are
always consid- ered. A language compiled into static
libraries linked by the target is considered if this
variable is true.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_EXECUTABLE Rule variable to link
an executable.</p>

<p>Rule variable to link an executable for the given
language.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_OUTPUT_EXTENSION Extension for the
output of a compile for a single file.</p>

<p>This is the extension for an object file for the given
&lt;LANG&gt;. For example .obj for C on Windows.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_PLATFORM_ID An internal variable
subject to change.</p>

<p>This is used in determining the platform and is subject
to change.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SIZEOF_DATA_PTR Size of
pointer-to-data types for language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>This holds the size (in bytes) of pointer-to-data types
in the target platform ABI. It is defined for languages C
and CXX (C++).</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS Extensions of
source files for the given language.</p>

<p>This is the list of extensions for a given languages
source files.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNU&lt;LANG&gt; True if the compiler
is GNU.</p>

<p>If the selected &lt;LANG&gt; compiler is the GNU
compiler then this is TRUE, if not it is FALSE. Unlike the
other per-language vari- ables, this uses the GNU syntax for
identifying languages instead of the CMake syntax.
Recognized values of the &lt;LANG&gt; suffix are:</p>

<p>CC = C compiler CXX = C++ compiler G77 = Fortran
compiler</p>

<p>CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_DEFAULT Fortran default module
output directory.</p>

<p>Most Fortran compilers write .mod files to the current
working directory. For those that do not, this is set to
&quot;.&quot; and used when the Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
target property is not set.</p>

<p>CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_FLAG Fortran flag for module output
directory.</p>

<p>This stores the flag needed to pass the value of the
For- tran_MODULE_DIRECTORY target property to the
compiler.</p>

<p>CMAKE_Fortran_MODOUT_FLAG Fortran flag to enable module
output.</p>

<p>Most Fortran compilers write .mod files out by default.
For others, this stores the flag needed to enable module
output.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INTERNAL_PLATFORM_ABI An internal variable subject
to change.</p>

<p>This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is
subject to change.</p>

<p>CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_&lt;LANG&gt; Specify a
CMake file that overrides platform information for
&lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>This is a language-specific version of
CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE loaded only when enabling
lan- guage &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE BUILD
CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX Default filename postfix for
libraries under configuration &lt;CON- FIG&gt;.</p>

<p>When a non-executable target is created its
&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX target property is initialized with
the value of this variable if it is set.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET Default value for
&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET of targets.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET property on all the targets.
See that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the
ARCHIVE targets when built.</p>

AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS property on all the targets. See that
target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH Use the install path for
the RPATH</p>

<p>Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when
building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the
software is installed the executables etc are relinked by
CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to
true then the software is always built with the install path
for the RPATH and does not need to be relinked when
installed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX See variable
CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.</p>

<p>This variable is a special case of the more-general
CMAKE_&lt;CON- FIG&gt;_POSTFIX variable for the DEBUG
configuration.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS Linker flags to be used to create
executables.</p>

<p>These flags will be used by the linker when creating an
exe- cutable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Flags to be used

on tar- gets when they are created. See that target property
for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR Automatically add the current
source- and build directories to the include path.</p>

<p>If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds in
each directory ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} and ${CMAKE_CUR-
RENT_BINARY_DIR} to the include path for this directory.
These additional include directories do not propagate down
to subdi- rectories. This is useful mainly for out-of-source
builds, where files generated into the build tree are
included by files located in the source tree.</p>

<p>By default CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR is OFF.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE Automatically add
the current source- and build directories to the
INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.</p>

<p>If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds
for each shared library target, static library target,
module target and executable target,
${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} and ${CMAKE_CUR-
RENT_BINARY_DIR} to the INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.By
default CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE is OFF.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR Mac OS X directory name for
installed targets.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR is used to initialize the
INSTALL_NAME_DIR property on all targets. See that target
prop- erty for more information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH The rpath to use for installed
targets.</p>

<p>A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use
in installed targets (for platforms that support it). This
is used to initialize the target property INSTALL_RPATH for
all targets.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH Add paths to linker
search and installed rpath.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if
set to true will append directories in the linker search
path and out- side the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. This is
used to initial- ize the target property
INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH for all tar- gets.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the
LIBRARY targets when built.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH_FLAG The flag to be used to add a
library search path to a compiler.</p>

<p>The flag will be used to specify a library directory to
the com- piler. On most compilers this is
&quot;-L&quot;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LINK_DEF_FILE_FLAG Linker flag to be used to
specify a .def file for dll creation.</p>

<p>The flag will be used to add a .def file when creating a
dll on Windows; this is only defined on Windows.</p>

dependencies on shared library files.</p>

<p>This variable initializes the LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED
property on targets when they are created. See that target
property for additional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES Default value for
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES of targets.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG Flag to be used to link a
library specified by a path to its file.</p>

<p>The flag will be used before a library file path is
given to the linker. This is needed only on very few
platforms.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FLAG Flag to be used to link a
library into an executable.</p>

<p>The flag will be used to specify a library to link to an
exe- cutable. On most compilers this is &quot;-l&quot;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE Default value for MACOSX_BUNDLE of
targets.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the MACOSX_BUNDLE
property on all the targets. See that target property for
additional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS Linker flags to be used to
create modules.</p>

module.</p>

<p>CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Flags to be
used when linking a module.</p>

<p>Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when
creating modules.</p>

<p>CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH Do not use the builtin ELF
editor to fix RPATHs on installation.</p>

<p>When an ELF binary needs to have a different RPATH after
instal- lation than it does in the build tree, CMake uses a
builtin edi- tor to change the RPATH in the installed copy.
If this variable is set to true then CMake will relink the
binary before instal- lation instead of using its builtin
editor.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the MS debug
symbol files from linker.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See that
target property for addi- tional information.</p>

POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE of targets.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
POSITION_INDEPEN- DENT_CODE property on all the targets. See
that target property for additional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the
RUNTIME targets when built.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS Linker flags to be used to
create shared libraries.</p>

<p>These flags will be used by the linker when creating a
shared library.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Flags to be
used when linking a shared library.</p>

<p>Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when
creating shared libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH Do not include RPATHs in the
build tree.</p>

<p>Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when
building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the
software is installed the executables etc are relinked by
CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to
true then the software is always built with no RPATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH Do not include RPATHs in the
install tree.</p>

<p>Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when
building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the
software is installed the executables etc are relinked by
CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to
true then the software is always installed without RPATH,
even if RPATH is enabled when building. This can be useful
for example to allow running tests from the build directory
with RPATH enabled before the installa- tion step. To omit
RPATH in both the build and install steps, use
CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH instead.</p>

<p>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS Linker flags to be used to
create static libraries.</p>

<p>These flags will be used by the linker when creating a
static library.</p>

<p>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Flags to be
used when linking a static library.</p>

<p>Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when
creating static libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION Build configuration used
for try_compile and try_run projects.</p>

<p>Projects built by try_compile and try_run are built syn-
chronously during the CMake configuration step. Therefore a
specific build configuration must be chosen even if the
gener- ated build system supports multiple
configurations.</p>

<p>CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS Use relative paths (May not
work!).</p>

<p>If this is set to TRUE, then CMake will use relative
paths between the source and binary tree. This option does
not work for more complicated projects, and relative paths
are used when possible. In general, it is not possible to
move CMake gener- ated makefiles to a different location
regardless of the value of this variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN Default value for
VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN of targets.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
VISIBILITY_INLINES_HID- DEN property on all the targets. See
that target property for additional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE Default value for
WIN32_EXECUTABLE of targets.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the WIN32_EXECUTABLE
prop- erty on all the targets. See that target property for
addi- tional information.</p>

<p>EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH Old executable location
variable.</p>

<p>The target property RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercedes
this variable for a target if it is set. Executable targets
are oth- erwise placed in this directory.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH Old library location variable.</p>

<p>The target properties ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
LIBRARY_OUT- PUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
supercede this vari- able for a target if they are set.
Library targets are other- wise placed in this
directory.</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION variables defined by
cmake, that give information about the project, and
cmake</p>

<p>CMAKE_AR Name of archiving tool for static
libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies the name of the program that creates
archive or static libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_ARGC Number of command line arguments passed to
CMake in script mode.</p>

<p>When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to
the num- ber of command line arguments. See also
CMAKE_ARGV0, 1, 2 ...</p>

<p>CMAKE_ARGV0 Command line argument passed to CMake in
script mode.</p>

<p>When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to
the first command line argument. It then also sets
CMAKE_ARGV1, CMAKE_ARGV2, ... and so on, up to the number of
command line arguments given. See also CMAKE_ARGC.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR The path to the top level of the build
tree.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the top level of the current
CMake build tree. For an in-source build, this would be the
same as CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL Tool used for the actual build
process.</p>

<p>This variable is set to the program that will be needed
to build the output of CMake. If the generator selected was
Visual Stu- dio 6, the CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL will be set to
msdev, for Unix Make- files it will be set to make or gmake,
and for Visual Studio 7 it set to devenv. For NMake
Makefiles the value is nmake. This can be useful for adding
special flags and commands based on the final build
environment.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR The directory with the
CMakeCache.txt file.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the directory that has the
CMake- Cache.txt file in it. This is the same as
CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION Major version of CMake used to
create the CMakeCache.txt file</p>

<p>This stores the major version of CMake used to write a
CMake cache file. It is only different when a different
version of CMake is run on a previously created cache
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION Minor version of CMake used to
create the CMakeCache.txt file</p>

<p>This stores the minor version of CMake used to write a
CMake cache file. It is only different when a different
version of CMake is run on a previously created cache
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION Patch version of CMake used to
create the CMakeCache.txt file</p>

<p>This stores the patch version of CMake used to write a
CMake cache file. It is only different when a different
version of CMake is run on a previously created cache
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR Build-time reference to
per-configuration output subdirectory.</p>

<p>For native build systems supporting multiple
configurations in the build tree (such as Visual Studio and
Xcode), the value is a reference to a build-time variable
specifying the name of the per-configuration output
subdirectory. On Makefile generators this evaluates to
&quot;.&quot; because there is only one configuration in a
build tree. Example values:</p>

<p>$(IntDir) = Visual Studio 6 $(OutDir) = Visual Studio 7,
8, 9 $(Configuration) = Visual Studio 10 $(CONFIGURATION) =
Xcode . = Make-based tools</p>

<p>Since these values are evaluated by the native build
system, this variable is suitable only for use in command
lines that will be evaluated at build time. Example of
intended usage:</p>

<p>add_executable(mytool mytool.c) add_custom_command(
OUTPUT out.txt COMMAND
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool
${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt DEPENDS mytool
in.txt ) add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)</p>

<p>Note that CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR is no longer necessary for
this pur- pose but has been left for compatibility with
existing projects. Instead add_custom_command() recognizes
executable target names in its COMMAND option, so
&quot;${CMAKE_CUR-
RENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool&quot; can be
replaced by just &quot;mytool&quot;.</p>

<p>This variable is read-only. Setting it is undefined
behavior. In multi-configuration build systems the value of
this variable is passed as the value of preprocessor symbol
&quot;CMAKE_INTDIR&quot; to the compilation of all source
files.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COMMAND The full path to the cmake executable.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the CMake executable cmake
which is useful from custom commands that want to use the
cmake -E option for portable system commands. (e.g.
/usr/local/bin/cmake</p>

<p>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING Is CMake currently cross
compiling.</p>

<p>This variable will be set to true by CMake if CMake is
cross compiling. Specifically if the build platform is
different from the target platform.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND Full path to ctest command installed
with cmake.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the CTest executable ctest
which is useful from custom commands that want to use the
cmake -E option for portable system commands.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR The path to the binary
directory currently being processed.</p>

<p>This the full path to the build directory that is
currently being processed by cmake. Each directory added by
add_subdirec- tory will create a binary directory in the
build tree, and as it is being processed this variable will
be set. For in-source builds this is the current source
directory being processed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR Full directory of the listfile
currently being processed.</p>

<p>As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this
variable will always be set to the directory where the
listfile which is currently being processed
(CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE) is located. The value has dynamic
scope. When CMake starts processing com- mands in a source
file it sets this variable to the directory where this file
is located. When CMake finishes processing com- mands from
the file it restores the previous value. Therefore the value
of the variable inside a macro or function is the directory
of the file invoking the bottom-most entry on the call
stack, not the directory of the file containing the macro or
function definition.</p>

<p>See also CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE Full path to the listfile
currently being processed.</p>

<p>As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this
variable will always be set to the one currently being
processed. The value has dynamic scope. When CMake starts
processing commands in a source file it sets this variable
to the location of the file. When CMake finishes processing
commands from the file it restores the previous value.
Therefore the value of the vari- able inside a macro or
function is the file invoking the bot- tom-most entry on the
call stack, not the file containing the macro or function
definition.</p>

<p>See also CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_LINE The line number of the current
file being processed.</p>

<p>This is the line number of the file currently being
processed by cmake.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR The path to the source
directory currently being processed.</p>

<p>This the full path to the source directory that is
currently being processed by cmake.</p>

<p>CMAKE_DL_LIBS Name of library containing dlopen and
dlcose.</p>

<p>The name of the library that has dlopen and dlclose in
it, usu- ally -ldl on most UNIX machines.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EDIT_COMMAND Full path to cmake-gui or ccmake.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the CMake executable that can
graphi- cally edit the cache. For example, cmake-gui,
ccmake, or cmake -i.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX The suffix for executables on
this platform.</p>

<p>The suffix to use for the end of an executable filename
if any, .exe on Windows.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt; overrides this for
language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR The extra generator used to build
the project.</p>

<p>When using the Eclipse, CodeBlocks or KDevelop
generators, CMake generates Makefiles (CMAKE_GENERATOR) and
additionally project files for the respective IDE. This IDE
project file generator is stored in CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR
(e.g. &quot;Eclipse CDT4&quot;).</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXTRA_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES Additional suffixes
for shared libraries.</p>

<p>Extensions for shared libraries other than that
specified by CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX, if any. CMake uses
this to recog- nize external shared library files during
analysis of libraries linked by a target.</p>

<p>CMAKE_GENERATOR The generator used to build the
project.</p>

<p>The name of the generator that is being used to generate
the build files. (e.g. &quot;Unix Makefiles&quot;,
&quot;Visual Studio 6&quot;, etc.)</p>

<p>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET Native build system toolset name
specified by user.</p>

<p>Some CMake generators support a toolset name to be given
to the native build system to choose a compiler. If the user
specifies a toolset name (e.g. via the cmake -T option) the
value will be available in this variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY Path to top of source tree.</p>

being run.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE Full path to the CMake file that
included the current one.</p>

<p>While processing a CMake file loaded by include() or
find_pack- age() this variable contains the full path to the
file including it. The top of the include stack is always
the CMakeLists.txt for the current directory. See also

in this for- mat: ${CMAKE_ROOT}/Modules</p>

<p>CMAKE_SCRIPT_MODE_FILE Full path to the -P script file
currently being processed.</p>

<p>When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to

then the library search path is modified to look for 64 bit
libraries first.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH If true, do not add run time path
information.</p>

<p>If this is set to TRUE, then the rpath information is
not added to compiled executables. The default is to add
rpath informa- tion if the platform supports it. This allows
for easy running from the build tree. To omit RPATH in the
install step, but not the build step, use
CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH instead.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR The path to the top level of the source
tree.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the top level of the current

1 in X.X.X.1).</p>

<p>This specifies the tweak version of the CMake executable
being run. Releases use tweak &lt; 20000000 and development
versions use the date format CCYYMMDD for the tweak
level.</p>

<p>CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE Create verbose makefiles if
on.</p>

<p>This variable defaults to false. You can set this
variable to true to make CMake produce verbose makefiles
that show each com- mand line as it is used.</p>

<p>CMAKE_VERSION The full version of cmake in
major.minor.patch[.tweak[-id]] for- mat.</p>

<p>This specifies the full version of the CMake executable
being run. This variable is defined by versions 2.6.3 and

[-id] component appears in non-release versions and may be
arbitrary text.</p>

<p>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET Visual Studio Platform Toolset
name.</p>
