<p>NAME pamseq - generate PAM image of all possible tuple
values, in sequence</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamseq [-tupletype=tupletype] depth maxval</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate
an option. You may use either white space or an equals sign
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamseq generates a PAM image of a specified depth and
specified maxval that consists of a single row. The row
consists of one tuple of every possible value, in order.</p>

<p>For a depth of one, the order is simple: From 0 to
maxval, going from left to right. For higher depths, the
highest numbered plane goes from 0 to maxval (going left to
right) while all the other planes have value 0. Then the
sequence repeats except with the next highest plane set to a
value of 1, then 2, etc.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -tupletype This is the value of the
&quot;tuple_type&quot; attribute of the created PAM image.
It can be any string up to 255 characters.</p>

<p>USAGE To create a simple ramp of the values 0..255, for
input to various matrix calculations, try</p>

<p>pamseq 1 255 (Before pamseq existed, pgmramp was often
pressed into service for this).</p>

<p>To create a PPM color map of all the possible colors
representable with a maxval of 5, do</p>

<p>pamseq 3 5 -tupletype=RGB | pamtopnm</p>

<p>Again, with a modern program based on the Netpbm
library, you dont need the pamtopnm because a PAM RGB image
is equivalent to a PPM image.</p>

<p>You can use such a color map with
pnmremap(1)toquantizethecolorsinan image. With the maxval of
5 given in the example, you get a color map of the set of
&quot;web safe&quot; colors as defined by Netscape. Most web
browsers guarantee that they can produce at least these 216
colors (215 plus black).</p>

<p>HISTORY pamseq was added to Netpbm in June 2002.</p>
