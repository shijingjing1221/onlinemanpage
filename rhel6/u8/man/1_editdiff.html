<p>NAME rediff, editdiff - fix offsets and counts of a
hand-edited diff</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rediff ORIGINAL EDITED</p>

<p>rediff EDITED</p>

<p>rediff {[--help] | [--version]}</p>

<p>editdiff FILE</p>

<p>editdiff {[--help] | [--version]}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION You can use rediff to correct a hand-edited
unified diff. Take a copy of the diff you want to edit, and
edit it without changing any offsets or counts (the lines
that begin @@). Then run rediff, telling it the name of the
original diff file and the name of the one you have edited,
and it will output the edited diff file but with corrected
offsets and counts.</p>

<p>A small script, editdiff, is provided for editing a diff
file in-place.</p>

<p>The types of changes that are currently handled are:</p>

<p>&middot; Modifying the text of any file content line (of
course).</p>

<p>&middot; Adding new line insertions or deletions.</p>

<p>&middot; Adding, changing or removing context lines.
Lines at the context horizon are dealt with by adjusting the
offset and/or count.</p>

<p>&middot; Adding a single hunk (@@-prefixed section).</p>

<p>&middot; Removing multiple hunk (@@-prefixed
sections).</p>

<p>Alternatively, if only one argument is provided, it is
taken to be the edited file and the counts and offsets are
adjusted as appropriate. Some assumptions are made when used
in this mode. See recountdiff(1) for more information.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display a short usage message.</p>

<p>--version Display the version number of rediff.</p>
