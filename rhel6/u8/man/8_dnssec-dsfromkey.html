<p>DNSSEC-DSFROMKEY(8) BIND9 DNSSEC-DSFROMKEY(8)</p>

<p>NAME dnssec-dsfromkey - DNSSEC DS RR generation tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dnssec-dsfromkey [-v level] [-1] [-2] [-a alg]
[-l domain] {keyfile}</p>

<p>dnssec-dsfromkey {-s} [-1] [-2] [-a alg] [-K directory]
[-l domain] [-s] [-c class] [-f file] [-A] [-v level]
{dnsname}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dnssec-dsfromkey outputs the Delegation
Signer (DS) resource record (RR), as defined in RFC 3658 and
RFC 4509, for the given key(s).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -1 Use SHA-1 as the digest algorithm (the
default is to use both SHA-1 and SHA-256).</p>

<p>-2 Use SHA-256 as the digest algorithm.</p>

<p>-a algorithm Select the digest algorithm. The value of
algorithm must be one of SHA-1 (SHA1), SHA-256 (SHA256) or
GOST. These values are case insensitive.</p>

<p>-K directory Look for key files (or, in keyset mode,
keyset- files) in directory.</p>

<p>-f file Zone file mode: in place of the keyfile name,
the argument is the DNS domain name of a zone master file,
which can be read from file. If the zone name is the same as
file, then it may be omitted.</p>

<p>-A Include ZSKs when generating DS records. Without this
option, only keys which have the KSK flag set will be
converted to DS records and printed. Useful only in zone
file mode.</p>

<p>-l domain Generate a DLV set instead of a DS set. The
specified domain is appended to the name for each record in
the set. The DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) RR is
described in RFC 4431.</p>

<p>-s Keyset mode: in place of the keyfile name, the
argument is the DNS domain name of a keyset file.</p>

<p>-c class Specifies the DNS class (default is IN). Useful
only in keyset or zone file mode.</p>

<p>-v level Sets the debugging level.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE To build the SHA-256 DS RR from the
Kexample.com.+003+26160 keyfile name, the following command
would be issued:</p>

<p>dnssec-dsfromkey -2 Kexample.com.+003+26160</p>

<p>The command would print something like:</p>

<p>example.com. IN DS 26160 5 2
3A1EADA7A74B8D0BA86726B0C227AA85AB8BBD2B2004F41A868A54F0
C5EA0B94</p>

<p>FILES The keyfile can be designed by the key
identification Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii or the full file name
Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key as generated by dnssec-keygen(8).</p>

<p>The keyset file name is built from the directory, the
string keyset- and the dnsname.</p>

<p>CAVEAT A keyfile error can give a &quot;file not
found&quot; even if the file exists.</p>
