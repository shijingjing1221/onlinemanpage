<p>NAME tpm_restrictpubek - restrict the ability to display
the public portion of the Endorsement Key to the owner</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tpm_restrictpubek [OPTION]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tpm_restrictpubek reports the status of who
can display the public portion of the Endorsement Key. This
is the default behavior and also available with the --status
option. This operation will be in effect until the owner is
cleared and prompts for the owner passord. With the
--restrict option, the ability to display the public portion
of the Endorsement Key is resticted to the owner (via the
TPM_DisablePubekRead API). The command prompts for the owner
password to complete the operation. The --status and
--restrict options are mutually exclusive and the last one
on the command line will be carried out.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display command usage info.</p>

<p>-v, --version Display command version info.</p>

<p>-l, --log [none|error|info|debug] Set logging level.</p>

<p>-u, --unicode Use TSS UNICODE encoding for passwords to
comply with applications using TSS popup boxes</p>

<p>-s, --status Display the status of who can see the
public portion of the Endorsement Key</p>

<p>-r, --restrict Restrict seeing the public portion of the
Endorsement Key to the owner</p>

<p>-z, --well-known Authenticate using 20 bytes of zeros as
owner password (the default TSS Well Known Secret), instead
of prompting for an owner password.</p>
