<p>sane-find-scanner(1) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-find-scanner(1)</p>

<p>NAME sane-find-scanner - find SCSI and USB scanners and
their device files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sane-find-scanner [-h|-?] [-v] [-q] [-p] [-f]
[-F filename] [devname]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sane-find-scanner is a command-line tool to
find SCSI and USB scanners and determine their Unix device
files. Its primary aim is to make sure that scanners can be
detected by SANE backends.</p>

<p>For SCSI scanners, it checks the default generic SCSI
device files (e.g., /dev/sg0) and /dev/scanner. The test is
done by sending a SCSI inquiry command and looking for a
device type of &quot;scanner&quot; or &quot;proces-
sor&quot; (some old HP scanners seem to send
&quot;processor&quot;). So sane-find-scanner will find any
SCSI scanner connected to those default device files even if
it isn t supported by any SANE backend.</p>

<p>For USB scanners, first the USB kernel scanner device
files (e.g. /dev/usb/scanner0), /dev/usb/scanner, and
/dev/usbscanner) are tested. The files are opened and the
vendor and device ids are determined, if the operating
system supports this feature. Currently USB scanners are
only found this way if they are supported by the Linux
scanner module or the FreeBSD or OpenBSD uscanner driver.
After that test, sane-find-scanner tries to scan for USB
devices found by the USB library libusb (if available).
There is no special USB class for scan- ners, so the
heuristics used to distinguish scanners from other USB
devices is not perfect. sane-find-scanner also tries to find
out the type of USB chip used in the scanner. If detected,
it will be printed after the vendor and product ids.
sane-find-scanner will even find USB scanners, that are not
supported by any SANE backend.</p>

<p>sane-find-scanner wont find most parallel port scanners,
or scanners connected to proprietary ports. Some parallel
port scanners may be detected by sane-find-scanner -p. At
the time of writing this will only detect Mustek parallel
port scanners.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, -? Prints a short usage message.</p>

<p>-v Verbose output. If used once, sane-find-scanner shows
every device name and the test result. If used twice, SCSI
inquiry information and the USB device descriptors are also
printed.</p>

<p>-q Be quiet. Print only the devices, no comments.</p>

<p>-p Probe parallel port scanners.</p>

<p>-f Force opening all explicitly given devices as SCSI
and USB devices. That s useful if sane-find-scanner is wrong
in deter- mining the device type.</p>

<p>-F filename filename is a file that contains USB
descriptors in the format of /proc/bus/usb/devices as used
by Linux. sane-find-scanner tries to identify the chipset(s)
of all USB scanners found in such a file. This option is
useful for developers when the out- put of &quot;cat
/proc/bus/usb/devices&quot; is available but the scanner
itself isnt.</p>

<p>devname Test device file &quot;devname&quot;. No other
devices are checked if devname is given.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE sane-find-scanner -v Check all SCSI and USB
devices for available scanners and print a line for every
device file.</p>

<p>sane-find-scanner /dev/scanner Look for a (SCSI) scanner
only at /dev/scanner and print the result.</p>

<p>sane-find-scanner -p Probe for parallel port
scanners.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED PLATFORMS USB support is limited to Linux
(kernel, libusb), FreeBSD (kernel, libusb), NetBSD (libusb),
OpenBSD (kernel, libusb). Detecting the ven- dor and device
ids only works with Linux or libusb.</p>

<p>SCSI support is available on Irix, EMX, Linux, Next,
AIX, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and HP-UX.</p>

<p>BUGS No support for most parallel port scanners yet.
Detection of USB chipsets is limited to a few chipsets.</p>
