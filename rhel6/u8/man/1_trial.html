<p>TRIAL(1) TRIAL(1)</p>

<p>NAME trial - run unit tests</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS trial [options]
[[file|package|module|TestCase|testmethod]...]</p>

<p>trial --help</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION trial loads and executes a suite of unit
tests, obtained from modules, packages and files listed on
the command line.</p>

<p>trial will take either filenames or fully qualified
Python names as arguments. Thus trial myproject/foo.py ,
trial myproject.foo and trial
myproject.foo.SomeTestCase.test_method are all valid ways to
invoke trial.</p>

<p>-b, --debug Run the tests in the Python debugger. Also
does post-mortem debugging on exceptions. Will load .pdbrc
from current direc- tory if it exists.</p>

<p>-B, --debug-stacktraces Report Deferred creation and
callback stack traces</p>

<p>--coverage Generate coverage information in
_trial_temp/coverage/. Requires Python 2.3 or higher.</p>

<p>--disablegc Disable the garbage collector. I don t know
why this is in trial.</p>

<p>-x, --extra Add an extra argument. (This is a hack
necessary for interfacing with emacss gud.)</p>

<p>-e, --rterrors Print tracebacks to standard output as
soon as they occur</p>

<p>--force-gc Run gc.collect() before and after each test
case. This can be used to isolate errors that occur when
objects get collected. This option would be the default,
except it makes tests run about ten times slower.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print a usage message to standard output,
then exit.</p>

<p>--help-reporters Print a list of valid reporters to
standard output, then exit.</p>

<p>--help-reactors List the names of possibly available
reactors.</p>

<p>-l, --logfile &lt;logfile&gt; Direct the log to a
different file. The default file is test.log.
&lt;logfile&gt; is relative to _trial_temp.</p>

<p>-n, --dry-run Go through all the tests and make them
pass without running.</p>

<p>-N, --no-recurse By default, trial recurses through
packages to find every module inside every subpackage.
Unless, that is, you specify this option.</p>

<p>--nopm Don t automatically jump into debugger for
post-mortem analysis of exceptions. Only usable in
conjunction with --debug.</p>

<p>--profile Run tests under the Python profiler.</p>

<p>-r, --reactor &lt;reactor&gt; Choose which reactor to
use. See --help-reactors for a list.</p>

<p>--recursionlimit Set Python s recursion limit. See
sys.setrecursionlimit()</p>

<p>--reporter Select the reporter to use for Trials output.
Use the --help- reporters option to see a list of valid
reporters.</p>

<p>--spew Print an insanely verbose log of everything that
happens. Useful when debugging freezes or locks in complex
code.</p>

<p>--tbformat &lt;format&gt; Format to display tracebacks
with. Acceptable values are default, brief and verbose .
brief produces tracebacks that play nicely with Emacs
GUD.</p>

<p>--temp-directory &lt;directory&gt; WARNING: Do not use
this options unless you know what you are doing. By default,
trial creates a directory called _trial_temp under the
current working directory. When trial runs, it first deletes
this directory, then creates it, then changes into the
directory to run the tests. The log file and any coverage
files are stored here. Use this option if you wish to have
trial run in a directory other than _trial_temp. Be warned,
trial will delete the directory before re-creating it.</p>

<p>--testmodule &lt;filename&gt; Ask trial to look into
&lt;filename&gt; and run any tests specified using the
Emacs-style buffer variable test-case-name.</p>

<p>--unclean-warnings As of Twisted 8.0, trial will report
an error if the reactor is left unclean at the end of the
test. This option is provided to assist in migrating from
Twisted 2.5 to Twisted 8.0 and later. Enabling this option
will turn the errors into warnings.</p>

<p>-u, --until-failure Keep looping the tests until one of
them raises an error or a failure. This is particularly
useful for reproducing intermit- tent failures.</p>

<p>--version Prints the Twisted version number and
exit.</p>

<p>--without-module &lt;modulenames&gt; Simulate the lack
of the specified comma-separated list of mod- ules. This
makes it look like the modules are not present in the
system, causing tests to check the behavior for that
configura- tion.</p>

<p>-z, --random [&lt;seed&gt;] Run the tests in random
order using the specified seed.</p>
