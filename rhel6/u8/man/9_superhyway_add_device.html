<p>SUPERHYWAY_ADD_DEVIC(9) Busses
SUPERHYWAY_ADD_DEVIC(9)</p>

<p>NAME superhyway_add_device - Add a SuperHyway module</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int superhyway_add_device(unsigned long base,
struct superhyway_device * sdev, struct superhyway_bus *
bus);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS base Physical address where module is
mapped.</p>

<p>sdev SuperHyway device to add, or NULL to allocate a new
one.</p>

<p>bus Bus where SuperHyway module resides.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is responsible for adding a new
SuperHyway module. This sets up a new struct
superhyway_device for the module being added if sdev ==
NULL.</p>

<p>Devices are initially added in the order that they are
scanned (from the top-down of the memory map), and are
assigned an ID based on the order that they are added. Any
manual addition of a module will thus get the ID after the
devices already discovered regardless of where it resides in
memory.</p>

<p>Further work can and should be done in
superhyway_scan_bus, to be sure that any new modules are
properly discovered and subsequently registered.</p>
