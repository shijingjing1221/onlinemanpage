<p>NAME XmDisplay The Display widget class</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Display.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XmDisplay object is used by the Motif
widgets to store information that is specific to a display.
It also allows the toolkit to access certain information on
widget hierarchies that would otherwise be unavailable. Each
client has one XmDisplay object for each display it
accesses.</p>

<p>An XmDisplay object is automatically created when the
application cre- ates the first shell on a display (usually
accomplished by a call to XtAppInitialize or
XtAppCreateShell). It is not necessary to create an
XmDisplay object by any other means. An application can use
the func- tion XmGetXmDisplay to obtain the widget ID of the
XmDisplay object for a given display.</p>

<p>An application cannot supply initial values for
XmDisplay resources as arguments to a call to any function
that creates widgets. The applica- tion or user can supply
initial values in a resource file. After cre- ating the
first shell on the display, the application can use
XmGetXmDisplay to obtain the widget ID of the XmDisplay
object and then call XtSetValues to set the XmDisplay
resources.</p>

<p>XmDisplay resources specify the drag protocol style for
a client par- ticipating in drag and drop transactions. The
two basic protocol types are preregister and dynamic. When a
preregister protocol is used, the toolkit handles any
communication between the initiator and receiver clients and
displays the appropriate drag-over and drag-under visual
effects. A client registers its drop sites in advance and
this informa- tion is stored in a property for each
top-level window. When the drag pointer enters a top-level
window, the drop site information is read by the initiator.
A dynamic protocol allows the source and destination clients
to dynamically communicate drag and drop state information
between each other, and to update their respective visuals
accordingly. The toolkit provides drop site information as
the pointer passes over any given drop site. In this mode, a
receiver can supply a procedure to generate its own
drag-under effects.</p>

<p>Classes Display inherits behavior and resources from
Core, Composite, Shell, WMShell, VendorShell, TopLevelShell,
and ApplicationShell classes.</p>

<p>The class pointer is xmDisplayClass.</p>

<p>The class name is XmDisplay.</p>

<p>New Resources The following table defines a set of
widget resources used by the pro- grammer to specify data.
The programmer can also set the resource val- ues for the
inherited classes to set attributes for this widget. To
reference a resource by name or by class in a .Xdefaults
file, remove the XmN or XmC prefix and use the remaining
letters. To specify one of the defined values for a resource
in a .Xdefaults file, remove the Xm prefix and use the
remaining letters (in either lowercase or uppercase, but
include any underscores between words). The codes in the
access column indicate if the given resource can be set at
creation time (C), set by using XtSetValues (S), retrieved
by using XtGetValues (G), or is not applicable (N/A).</p>

XmNdefaultButtonEmphasis Specifies whether to change the
look of the PushButton widget and gadget that have the
XmNshowAsDefault resource set. When the PushButton is the
default, it has an etched out button which is enclosed with
another etched in border. The XmNde- faultButtonEmphasis has
the follow possible values, which affect the location
cursor:</p>

<p>XmINTERNAL_HIGHLIGHT Causes the location cursor to
appear in between the two etched borders to minimize the
space required.</p>

<p>XmEXTERNAL_HIGHLIGHT Causes the PushButton to draw the
location cursor outside the second border.</p>

<p>XmNdefaultVirtualBindings Specifies the default virtual
bindings for the display. Fol- lowing is an example of a
specification for the defaultVirtu- alBindings resource in a
resource file:</p>

<p>*defaultVirtualBindings: osfBackSpace:
&lt;Key&gt;BackSpace osfInsert: &lt;Key&gt;InsertChar
osfDelete: &lt;Key&gt;DeleteChar ... osfLeft:
&lt;Key&gt;left, Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;H</p>

<p>XmNdragInitiatorProtocolStyle Specifies the drag and
drop protocol requirements or prefer- ence when the client
is an initiator. The possible values are</p>

<p>XmDRAG_PREREGISTER As an initiator, this client does not
use the dynamic protocol and can only arrange visual effects
with receivers who provide preregistered information.</p>

<p>XmDRAG_DYNAMIC As an initiator, this client does not
make use of any preregistered drop site information made
avail- able by other clients, and can only arrange visual
effects with receivers who use the dynamic proto- col.</p>

<p>XmDRAG_NONE Specifies that drag and drop is disabled for
this client.</p>

<p>XmDRAG_DROP_ONLY As an initiator, this client does not
use either the preregistered drop site information or the
dynamic protocol. It supports dragging, and any time the
cursor is over a client that supports drag and drop, valid
feedback is provided. There are no other visual effects.</p>

<p>XmDRAG_PREFER_DYNAMIC As an initiator, this client can
support both the preregister and dynamic protocols, but
prefers to use dynamic protocols whenever possible in order
to provide high-quality drag-under feedback.</p>

<p>XmDRAG_PREFER_PREREGISTER As an initiator, this client
can support both the preregister and dynamic protocols, but
prefers to use the preregister protocol whenever possible in
order to accommodate performance needs or to pro- vide
consistent drag-over feedback.</p>

<p>XmDRAG_PREFER_RECEIVER Indicates that this client can
support both prereg- ister and dynamic protocols, but will
defer to the preference of the receiver client. This value
is valid only for the XmNdragInitiatorProtocolStyle
resource, and is its default value.</p>

<p>XmNdragReceiverProtocolStyle Specifies the drag and drop
protocol requirements or prefer- ence when this client is a
receiver. The values are</p>

<p>XmDRAG_PREREGISTER As a receiver, this client
preregisters drop site information and does not use the
dynamic protocol. It can only arrange visual effects with
initiators who make use of the preregistered
information.</p>

<p>XmDRAG_DYNAMIC As a receiver, this client uses the
dynamic proto- col and does not preregister drop site
information. It can only arrange visual effects with
initiators who use the dynamic protocol.</p>

<p>XmDRAG_NONE Specifies that drag and drop is disabled for
this client.</p>

<p>XmDRAG_DROP_ONLY As a receiver, this client neither uses
the dynamic protocol nor preregisters drop site information.
It supports dropping, and when dragging over this client,
valid feedback is always provided, but there are no other
visual effects.</p>

<p>XmDRAG_PREFER_DYNAMIC As a receiver, this client can
support both the preregister and dynamic protocols, but
prefers to use the dynamic protocol whenever possible in
order to provide high-quality drag-under feedback.</p>

<p>XmDRAG_PREFER_PREREGISTER As a receiver, this client can
support both the preregister and dynamic protocols, but
prefers to use the preregister protocol whenever possible in
order to accommodate performance needs.</p>

<p>The default value of this resource is dependent on the
capa- bilities of the display. If the display supports the
shape extension, allowing the dynamic protocol to use
arbitrarily sized drag cursors, the default of this resource
is XmDRAG_PREFER_DYNAMIC, otherwise the default is
XmDRAG_PRE- FER_PREREGISTER.</p>

<p>The actual protocol used between an initiator and a
receiver is based on the protocol style of the receiver and
initiator. The decision matrix is described in the following
table.</p>


<p>+---------------+----------------------------------------------+
|Drag Initiator | | | | | | | Drag Receiver Protocol Style |
| | |
+---------------+------------------------------+---+---+-------+
+---------------+------------------------------+---+---+-------+
+---------------+------------------------------+---+---+-------+
+---------------+------------------------------+---+---+-------+
+---------------+------------------------------+---+---+-------+
+---------------+------------------------------+---+---+-------+
+---------------+------------------------------+---+---+-------+
The value XmDRAG_NONE does not appear in the matrix. When
specified for either the initiator or receiver side,
XmDRAG_NONE implies that drag and drop transactions are not
supported. A value of XmDRAG_DROP_ONLY (Drop Only) results
when an initiator and receiver cannot compromise protocol
styles, that is, one client requires dynamic mode while the
other can only support preregister mode, or if either
explic- itly has specified XmDRAG_DROP_ONLY.</p>

<p>XmNdragStartCallback Specifies the list of callbacks
that are invoked when the XmDragStart function is called.
The type of structure whose address is passed to this
callback is XmDragStartCallback- Struct. The callback reason
is XmCR_DRAG_START.</p>

<p>XmNenableBtn1Transfer Specifies if selection and
transfer actions are integrated on Btn1 and extend actions
are activated on Btn2. This resource can take the following
values:</p>

<p>XmOFF Disables integration and selection activation on
Btn1.</p>

<p>XmBUTTON2_TRANSFER Enables integration and selection
activation on Btn1 and transfer on Btn2.</p>

<p>XmBUTTON2_ADJUST Enables integration and selection
activation on Btn1 and adjust on Btn2.</p>

<p>This resource affects the actions of Text, TextField,
List, and Container.</p>

<p>XmNenableButtonTab Specifies if the action for the
&lt;Tab&gt; key (KNextField and KPrevField actions) is to be
modified. A value of True modi- fies the key to move as an
arrow key until the boundary of a tab group is reached.
Then, at the boundary of the tab group, KNextField and
KPrevField will move to the next or previous tab group,
respectively. A value of False does not cause mod-
ification.</p>

<p>XmNenableDragIcon Specifies which set of icons are to be
used for system default cursors during drag and drop
operations. A value of False specifies that earlier versions
of Motif release icons are used, a value of True specifies
that alternate icons are used. This resource affects both
the 16x16 and the 32x32 icons that the system defaults for
each of the Screen objects associated with this display.</p>

<p>XmNenableEtchedInMenu Specifies the shadowing of the
button widgets and gadgets in menus when the control is
activated. A value of True causes the selected menu to be
drawn with the shadow etched in; this shadow style is
consistent with the selected appearance of other button
widgets outside of menus. A value of False causes the
selected menu to be draw with the shadow etched out. This
resource affects the actions of PushButton, Toggle- Button,
and CascadeButton widgets and gadgets when they are children
of Menu.</p>

<p>When this resource is set, the background of a button in
a menu uses the XmNselectColor (derived from the XmNselect-
Pixel) when armed as a default. A PushButton uses the
XmNarm- Color if it is defined. A ToggleButton uses the
XmNselect- Color if XmNindicatorOn is False and
XmNfillOnSelect is True.</p>

<p>XmNenableToggleColor Specifies how to determine the
default value of the XmNse- lectColor resource of
ToggleButton and ToggleButtonGadget. A value of True causes
the default value of XmNselectColor to be set to the value
of XmNhighlightColor. A value of False causes the default
value of XmNselectColor to be set to the value of
XmNbackground. This resource only affects the appearance of
ToggleButton widgets and gadgets that are in XmONE_OF_MANY
or XmONE_OF_MANY_ROUND mode. In addition,
XmNenableToggleColor only influences the default value of
XmNselectColor. That is, if the user or application sets a
value for XmNselectColor, then XmNenableToggleColor is
ignored.</p>

<p>XmNenableToggleVisual Specifies the visual appearance of
the ToggleButton widget and/or gadget. This resource affects
the default value of the ToggleButton[Gadget]
XmNindicatorType and XmNindicatorOn resources. When the
ToggleButton is in a RadioBox, a value of True causes the
XmONE_OF_MANY_ROUND (a shadowed circle) to be the default.
Otherwise, when this resource is True, the Tog- gleButton
XmNindicatorOn resource causes a default of XmN_OF_MANY,
which will be a shadowed square with a check mark (check
box).</p>

<p>A value of False causes the following:</p>

<p>XmONE_OF_MANY Is a shadowed diamond.</p>

<p>XmN_OF_MANY Is a shadowed square.</p>

<p>XmNenableUnselectableDrag Specifies whether or not it is
possible to drag from Label and Scale. A value of True
enables the drag; a value of False disables it.</p>

<p>XmNenableWarp Specifies if an application is allowed to
warp the pointer from the user. A value of True enables
warping, a value of False does not.</p>

<p>XmNmotifVersion Specifies the current version of Motif
that the current implementation is supposed to behave like.
By default, this resource gets its value from release values
in Xm.h.</p>

<p>XmNnoFontCallback This callback is called whenever a
rendition attempts to load a font or fontset and fails. This
can happen on creation if the font is specified as
XmLOAD_IMMEDIATE or when an attempt is made to render an
XmString using a font specified as XmLOAD_DEFERRED. An
application can have this callback attempt to remedy this
problem by calling XmRenditionUpdate on the input rendition
to provide a font for the widget to use. This may be done by
either providing an an alternative font name to be loaded
using the XmNfontName and XmNfontType resources or with an
already loaded font using the XmNfont resource. The callback
reason is XmCR_NO_FONT. This callback uses the
XmDisplayCallbackStruct structure.</p>

<p>XmNnoRenditionCallback This callback is called whenever
an attempt is made to render a segment with a RENDITION tag
which does not match any ren- ditions in a given render
table. The callback reason is XmCR_NO_RENDITION. This
callback uses the XmDisplayCallback- Struct structure.</p>

<p>An application can have this callback attempt to remedy
this problem by creating a new rendition with the given tag
and adding it to render_table.</p>

<p>The XmNnoRenditionCallback should deallocate the render
table passed in in the render_table field of the callback
struc- ture. Note that the table will automatically be
deallocated if the XmRenderTableAddRenditions function is
called on it. The callback should NOT deallocate the
modified render table that is passed back to Motif in the
render_table field. If the application wishes to manipulate
this render table fur- ther, it should make a copy with the
XmRenderTableCopy func- tion before returning from the
callback.</p>

<p>XmNuserData Specifies a client data pointer for
applications. An inter- nally unused resource.</p>

<p>Inherited Resources All of the superclass resources
inherited by XmDisplay are designated N/A (not
applicable).</p>

<p>Callback Information A pointer to the following
structure is passed to the XmNdragStartCall- back
callback:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int reason; XEvent *event; Widget
timeStamp; Boolean doit; }XmDragStartCallbackStruct;</p>

<p>reason Indicates why the callback was invoked</p>

<p>event Points to the XEvent that triggered the
callback</p>

<p>widget Indicates the ID of the widget from which the
drag was initi- ated.</p>

<p>doit Is an IN/OUT member that allows the callback to
determine whether to continue with the drag or cancel.
Setting doit to False will cancel the drag. The default
value is NULL.</p>

<p>A pointer to the following structure is passed to the
XmNnoFontCallback and XmNnoRenditionCallback callbacks:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int reason; XEvent *event; XmRendition
rendition; char *font_name; XmRenderTable render_table;
XmStringTag tag; }XmDisplayCallbackStruct;</p>

<p>reason Indicates why the callback was invoked.</p>

<p>event Points to the XEvent that triggered the callback.
It can be NULL.</p>

<p>rendition Specifies the rendition with the missing
font.</p>

<p>font_name Specifies the name of the font or font set
which could not be loaded.</p>

<p>render_table Specifies the render table with the missing
rendition.</p>

<p>tag Specifies the tag of the missing rendition.</p>

<p>The following table describes the reasons for which the
individual callback structure fields are valid.</p>
