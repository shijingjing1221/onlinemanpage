<p>NAME grops - PostScript driver for groff</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS grops [ -glmv ] [ -bn ] [ -cn ] [ -Fdir ] [
-ppapersize ] [ -Pprologue ] [ -wn ] [ files... ]</p>

<p>It is possible to have whitespace between a command line
option and its parameter.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION grops translates the output of GNU troff to
PostScript. Normally grops should be invoked by using the
groff command with a -Tps option. (Actually, this is the
default for groff.) If no files are given, grops will read
the standard input. A filename of - will also cause grops to
read the standard input. PostScript output is written to the
standard output. When grops is run by groff options can be
passed to grops using the groff -P option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -bn Workaround broken spoolers and previewers.
Normally grops pro- duces output that conforms the Document
Structuring Conventions version 3.0. Unfortunately some
spoolers and previewers cant handle such output. The value
of n controls what grops does to its output acceptable to
such programs. A value of 0 will cause grops not to employ
any workarounds. Add 1 if no %%BeginDocu- mentSetup and
%%EndDocumentSetup comments should be generated; this is
needed for early versions of TranScript that get con- fused
by anything between the %%EndProlog comment and the first
%%Page comment. Add 2 if lines in included files beginning
with %! should be stripped out; this is needed for Suns
pageview previewer. Add 4 if %%Page, %%Trailer and
%%EndProlog comments should be stripped out of included
files; this is needed for spoolers that dont understand the
%%BeginDocument and %%EndDoc- ument comments. Add 8 if the
first line of the PostScript out- put should be
%!PS-Adobe-2.0 rather than %!PS-Adobe-3.0; this is needed
when using Suns Newsprint with a printer that requires page
reversal. The default value can be specified by a</p>

<p>broken n</p>

<p>command in the DESC file. Otherwise the default value is
0.</p>

<p>-cn Print n copies of each page.</p>

<p>-Fdir Prepend directory dir/devname to the search path
for prologue, font, and device description files; name is
the name of the device, usually ps.</p>

<p>-g Guess the page length. This generates PostScript code
that guesses the page length. The guess will be correct only
if the imageable area is vertically centered on the page.
This option allows you to generate documents that can be
printed both on letter (8.5&times;11) paper and on A4 paper
without change.</p>

<p>-l Print the document in landscape format.</p>

<p>-m Turn manual feed on for the document.</p>

<p>-ppaper-size Set physical dimension of output medium.
This overrides the papersize and paperlength commands in the
DESC file; it accepts the same arguments as the papersize
command.</p>

<p>-Pprologue-file Use the file prologue-file (in the font
path) as the prologue instead of the default prologue file
prologue. This option overrides the environment variable
GROPS_PROLOGUE.</p>

<p>-wn Lines should be drawn using a thickness of n
thousandths of an em. If this option is not given, the line
thickness defaults to 0.04 em.</p>

<p>-v Print the version number.</p>

<p>USAGE There are styles called R, I, B, and BI mounted at
font positions 1 to 4. The fonts are grouped into families
A, BM, C, H, HN, N, P and T having members in each of these
styles:</p>

<p>TR Times-Roman</p>

<p>TI Times-Italic</p>

<p>TB Times-Bold</p>

<p>TBI Times-BoldItalic</p>

<p>There is also the following font which is not a member
of a family:</p>

<p>ZCMI ZapfChancery-MediumItalic</p>

<p>There are also some special fonts called SS and S. Zapf
Dingbats is available as ZD and a reversed version of
ZapfDingbats (with symbols pointing in the opposite
direction) is available as ZDR; most charac- ters in these
fonts are unnamed and must be accessed using .</p>

<p>The default color for m and M is black; for colors
defined in the rgb color space, setrgbcolor is used, for cmy
and cmyk setcmyk- color, and for gray setgray.</p>

<p>grops understands various X commands produced using the
sequence; grops will only interpret commands that begin with
a ps: tag.</p>

<p>ps: exec code This executes the arbitrary PostScript
commands in code. The PostScript currentpoint will be set to
the position of the command before executing code. The
origin will be at the top left corner of the page, and y
coordinates will increase down the page. A procedure u will
be defined that converts groff units to the coordinate
system in effect. For example,</p>

<p>.nr x 1i ps: execnx u 0 rlineto stroke</p>

<p>will draw a horizontal line one inch long. code may make
changes to the graphics state, but any changes will persist
only to the end of the page. A dictionary containing the
definitions specified by the def and mdef will be on top of
the dictionary stack. If your code adds definitions to this
dictionary, you should allocate space for them usingps mdef
. Any defini- tions will persist only until the end of the
page. If you use theY escape sequence with an argument that
names a macro, code can extend over multiple lines. For
example,</p>

<p>.nr x 1i .de y ps: exec nx u 0 rlineto stroke .. Yy</p>

<p>is another way to draw a horizontal line one inch
long.</p>

<p>ps: file name This is the same as the exec command
except that the PostScript code is read from file name.</p>

<p>ps: def code Place a PostScript definition contained in
code in the prologue. There should be at most one definition
per definitions can be split over severalcode arguments are
simply joined together separated by newlines. The
definitions are placed in a dictionary which is
automatically pushed on the dictionary stack when an exec
command is executed. If you use theY escape sequence with an
argument that names a macro, code can extend over multiple
lines.</p>

<p>ps: mdef n code Like def, except that code may contain
up to n definitions. grops needs to know how many
definitions code contains so that it can create an
appropriately sized PostScript dictionary to contain
them.</p>

<p>ps: import file llx lly urx ury width [ height ] Import
a PostScript graphic from file. The arguments llx, lly, urx,
and ury give the bounding box of the graphic in the default
PostScript coordinate system; they should all be integers;
llx and lly are the x and y coordinates of the lower left
corner of the graphic; urx and ury are the x and y
coordinates of the upper right corner of the graphic; width
and height are integers that give the desired width and
height in groff units of the graphic. The graphic will be
scaled so that it has this width and height and translated
so that the lower left corner of the graphic is located at
the position associated with If the height argument is
omitted it will be scaled uniformly in the x and y
directions so that it has the specified width. Note that the
contents of the troff; so vertical space for the graphic is
not automatically added, and the width and height arguments
are not allowed to have attached scaling indicators. If the
PostScript file com- plies with the Adobe Document
Structuring Conventions and con- tains a %%BoundingBox
comment, then the bounding box can be automatically
extracted from within groff by using the psbb request.</p>

<p>The -mps macros (which are automatically loaded when
grops is run by the groff command) include a PSPIC macro
which allows a picture to be easily imported. This has the
format</p>

<p>.PSPIC [-L|-R|-I n] file [width [height]]</p>

<p>file is the name of the file containing the
illustration; width and height give the desired width and
height of the graphic. The width and height arguments may
have scaling indicators attached; the default scaling
indicator is i. This macro will scale the graphic uniformly
in the x and y directions so that it is no more than width
wide and height high. By default, the graphic will be
horizontally centered. The -L and -R cause the graphic to be
left-aligned and right-aligned respectively. The -I option
causes the graphic to be indented by n.</p>

<p>ps: invis ps: endinvis No output will be generated for
text and drawing commands that are bracketed with these
intended for use when output from troff will be previewed
before being processed with grops; if the previewer is
unable to dis- play certain characters or other constructs,
then other substi- tute characters or constructs can be used
for previewing by bracketing them with these</p>

<p>For example, gxditview is not able to display a proper
(em character because the standard X11 fonts do not provide
it; this problem can be overcome by executing the following
request</p>

<p>.char(emps: invis -.25.05l .9m .05m ps: endinvi(em</p>

<p>In this case, gxditview will be unable to display the(em
char- acter and will draw the line, whereas grops will print
the(em character and ignore the line.</p>

<p>The input to grops must be in the format output by
troff(1). This is described in groff_out(5). In addition the
device and font description files for the device used must
meet certain requirements. The device and font description
files supplied for ps device meet all these requirements.
afmtodit(1) can be used to create font files from AFM files.
The resolution must be an integer multiple of 72 times the
sizescale. The ps device uses a resolution of 72000 and a
sizescale of 1000. The device description file should
contain a command</p>

<p>paperlength n</p>

<p>which says that output should be generated which is
suitable for print- ing on a page whose length is n machine
units. Common values are 792000 for letter paper and 841890
for paper in A4 format. Alterna- tively, it can contain</p>

<p>papersize string</p>

<p>to specify a paper size; see groff_font(5) for more
information. Each font description file must contain a
command</p>

<p>internalname psname</p>

<p>which says that the PostScript name of the font is
psname. It may also contain a command</p>

<p>encoding enc_file</p>

<p>which says that the PostScript font should be reencoded
using the encoding described in enc_file; this file should
consist of a sequence of lines of the form:</p>

<p>pschar code</p>

<p>where pschar is the PostScript name of the character,
and code is its position in the encoding expressed as a
decimal integer. Lines start- ing with # and blank lines are
ignored. The code for each character given in the font file
must correspond to the code for the character in encoding
file, or to the code in the default encoding for the font if
the PostScript font is not to be reencoded. This code can be
used with the escape sequence in troff to select the
character, even if the character does not have a groff name.
Every character in the font file must exist in the
PostScript font, and the widths given in the font file must
match the widths used in the PostScript font. grops will
assume that a character with a groff name of space is blank
(makes no marks on the page); it can make use of such a
character to generate more efficient and compact PostScript
output.</p>

<p>grops can automatically include the downloadable fonts
necessary to print the document. Any downloadable fonts
which should, when required, be included by grops must be
listed in the file
/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/font/devps/download; this should
consist of lines of the form</p>

<p>font filename</p>

<p>where font is the PostScript name of the font, and
filename is the name of the file containing the font; lines
beginning with # and blank lines are ignored; fields may be
separated by tabs or spaces; filename will be searched for
using the same mechanism that is used for groff font metric
files. The download file itself will also be searched for
using this mechanism; currently, only the first found file
in the font path is used.</p>

<p>If the file containing a downloadable font or imported
document con- forms to the Adobe Document Structuring
Conventions, then grops will interpret any comments in the
files sufficiently to ensure that its own output is
conforming. It will also supply any needed font resources
that are listed in the download file as well as any needed
file resources. It is also able to handle inter-resource
dependencies. For example, suppose that you have a
downloadable font called Garamond, and also a downloadable
font called Garamond-Outline which depends on Gara- mond
(typically it would be defined to copy Garamonds font
dictionary, and change the PaintType), then it is necessary
for Garamond to be appear before Garamond-Outline in the
PostScript document. grops will handle this automatically
provided that the downloadable font file for
Garamond-Outline indicates its dependence on Garamond by
means of the Document Structuring Conventions, for example
by beginning with the following lines</p>

<p>%!PS-Adobe-3.0 Resource-Font %%DocumentNeededResources:
font Garamond %%EndComments %%IncludeResource: font
Garamond</p>

<p>In this case both Garamond and Garamond-Outline would
need to be listed in the download file. A downloadable font
should not include its own name in a
%%DocumentSuppliedResources comment.</p>

<p>grops will not interpret %%DocumentFonts comments. The
%%DocumentNeed- edResources, %%DocumentSuppliedResources,
%%IncludeResource, %%BeginRe- source and %%EndResource
comments (or possibly the old %%DocumentNeed- edFonts,
%%DocumentSuppliedFonts, %%IncludeFont, %%BeginFont and
%%End- Font comments) should be used.</p>

<p>TrueType fonts TrueType fonts can be used with grops if
converted first to Type 42 format, an especial PostScript
wrapper equivalent to the PFA format mentioned in
pfbtops(1). There are several different methods to gener-
ate a type42 wrapper and most of them involve the use of a
PostScript interpreter such as Ghostscript see gs(1). Yet,
the easiest method involves the use of the application
ttftot42. This program uses freetype(3) (version 1.3.1) to
generate type42 font wrappers and well- formed AFM files
that can be fed to the afmtodit(1) script to create
appropriate metric files. The resulting font wrappers should
be added to the download file. ttftot42 source code can be
downloaded from ftp://www.giga.or.at/pub/nih/ttftot42/
ftp://www.giga.or.at/pub/nih/ ttftot42/.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT GROPS_PROLOGUE If this is set to foo, then
grops will use the file foo (in the font path) instead of
the default prologue file prologue. The option -P overrides
this environment variable.</p>
