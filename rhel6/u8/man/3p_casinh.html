<p>CASINH(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CASINH(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME casinh, casinhf, casinhl - complex arc hyperbolic
sine functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;complex.h&gt;</p>

<p>double complex casinh(double complex z); float complex
casinhf(float complex z); long double complex casinhl(long
double complex z);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall compute the complex
arc hyperbolic sine of z, with branch cuts outside the
interval [-i, +i] along the imaginary axis.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE These functions shall return the complex
arc hyperbolic sine value, in the range of a strip
mathematically unbounded along the real axis and in the
interval [-ipi/2, +ipi/2] along the imaginary axis.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
