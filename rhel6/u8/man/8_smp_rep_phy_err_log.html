<p>SMP_REP_PHY_ERR_LOG(8) SMP_UTILS
SMP_REP_PHY_ERR_LOG(8)</p>

<p>NAME smp_rep_phy_err_log - invoke REPORT PHY ERROR LOG
SMP function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smp_rep_phy_err_log [--help] [--hex]
[--interface=PARAMS] [--phy=ID] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR]
[--verbose] [--version] SMP_DEVICE[,N]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends a SAS Management Protocol (SMP) REPORT
PHY ERROR LOG request function to a SMP target. The SMP
target is identified by the SMP_DEVICE and the SAS_ADDR.
Depending on the interface, the SAS_ADDR may be deduced from
the SMP_DEVICE. With one interface there is one SMP_DEVICE
per machine so the SMP_DEVICE,N syntax is needed to differ-
entiate between HBAs if there are multiple present.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Mandatory arguments to long options are
mandatory for short options as well.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex output the response in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-I, --interface=PARAMS interface specific parameters. In
this case &quot;interface&quot; refers to the path through
the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.</p>

<p>-p, --phy=ID phy identifier. ID is a value between 0 and
127. Default is 0.</p>

<p>-r, --raw send the response to stdout in binary. All
error messages are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-s, --sa=SAS_ADDR specifies the SAS address of the SMP
target device. Typically this is an expander. This option
may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the targets SAS
address within it. The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS
addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in
hexadecimal either prefix it with 0x or put a trailing h on
it.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the verbosity of the output. Can
be used multiple times</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>NOTES Similar information is maintained for SAS SSP
target phys (e.g. on a SAS disk). It can be obtained from
the Protocol Specific Port log page with the sg_logs
utility.</p>

<p>Similar information may be obtained for SAS initiator
phys (e.g. on a SAS HBA). As an example in Linux 2.6.28
error information can be found in this directory
/sys/class/sas_phy/phy-4:0 (for the phy 0 in SCSI/SAS host
4).</p>

<p>Similar information may be obtained for SATA device phys
(e.g. on a SATA disk). If there is a SAT layer between OS
and the SATA device then the sg_sat_phy_event utility can
fetch the information.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The SMP REPORT PHY ERROR LOG function was
introduced in SAS-1 . The &quot;Expander change count&quot;
field was added in SAS-2 .</p>
