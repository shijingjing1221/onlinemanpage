<p>NAME mouse-test - a tool for determining mouse type and
device its attached to.</p>

<p>SYNTAX mouse-test [ device ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This experimental and incomplete application
tries to help in detecting which protocol does your mouse
speak. It is able to detect MouseMan devices, and to choose
between -t ms (three-buttons aware) and -t bare old
two-buttons-only serial mice.</p>

<p>BUGS I know the application is buggy, but I only own one
mouse device. If you are interested in this application,
just call me and awake me from my laziness.</p>

<p>OPTIONS device [ device ... ]</p>

<p>Check this device for a mouse. If no devices are listed,
mouse-test will try all possible devices.</p>
