<p>OPTIONS -h Gives a list of possible commands</p>

<p>-i &lt;hciX&gt; The command is applied to device hciX ,
which must be the name of an installed Bluetooth device. If
not specified, the command will be sent to the first
available Bluetooth device.</p>

<p>COMMANDS dev Display local devices</p>

<p>inq Inquire remote devices. For each discovered device,
Bluetooth device address, clock offset and class are
printed.</p>

<p>scan Inquire remote devices. For each discovered device,
device name are printed.</p>

<p>name &lt;bdaddr&gt; Print device name of remote device
with Bluetooth address bdaddr.</p>

<p>info &lt;bdaddr&gt; Print device name, version and
supported features of remote device with Bluetooth address
bdaddr.</p>

<p>spinq Start periodic inquiry process. No inquiry results
are printed.</p>

<p>epinq Exit periodic inquiry process.</p>

<p>cmd &lt;ogf&gt; &lt;ocf&gt; [parameters] Submit an
arbitrary HCI command to local device. ogf, ocf and
parameters are hexadecimal bytes.</p>

<p>con Display active baseband connections</p>

<p>cc [--role=m|s] [--pkt-type=&lt;ptype&gt;]
&lt;bdaddr&gt; Create baseband connection to remote device
with Bluetooth address bdaddr. Option --pkt-type specifies a
list of allowed packet types. &lt;ptype&gt; is a
comma-separated list of packet types, where the possible
packet types are DM1, DM3, DM5, DH1, DH3, DH5, HV1, HV2,
HV3. Default is to allow all packet types. Option --role can
have value m (do not allow role switch, stay master) or s
(allow role switch, become slave if the peer asks to become
master). Default is m.</p>

<p>dc &lt;bdaddr&gt; [reason] Delete baseband connection
from remote device with Bluetooth address bdaddr. The reason
can be one of the Bluetooth HCI error codes. Default is 19
for user ended connections. The value must be given in
decimal.</p>

<p>sr &lt;bdaddr&gt; &lt;role&gt; Switch role for the
baseband connection from the remote device to master or
slave.</p>

<p>cpt &lt;bdaddr&gt; &lt;packet types&gt; Change packet
types for baseband connection to device with Blue- tooth
address bdaddr. packet types is a comma-separated list of
packet types, where the possible packet types are DM1, DM3,
DM5, DH1, DH3, DH5, HV1, HV2, HV3.</p>

<p>rssi &lt;bdaddr&gt; Display received signal strength
information for the connection to the device with Bluetooth
address bdaddr.</p>

<p>lq &lt;bdaddr&gt; Display link quality for the
connection to the device with Blue- tooth address
bdaddr.</p>

<p>tpl &lt;bdaddr&gt; [type] Display transmit power level
for the connection to the device with Bluetooth address
bdaddr. The type can be 0 for the cur- rent transmit power
level (which is default) or 1 for the maxi- mum transmit
power level.</p>

<p>afh &lt;bdaddr&gt; Display AFH channel map for the
connection to the device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.</p>

<p>lp &lt;bdaddr&gt; [value] With no value, displays link
policy settings for the connection to the device with
Bluetooth address bdaddr. If value is given, sets the link
policy settings for that connection to value. Possible
values are RSWITCH, HOLD, SNIFF and PARK.</p>

<p>lst &lt;bdaddr&gt; [value] With no value, displays link
supervision timeout for the connec- tion to the device with
Bluetooth address bdaddr. If value is given, sets the link
supervision timeout for that connection to value slots, or
to infinite if value is 0.</p>

<p>auth &lt;bdaddr&gt; Request authentication for the
device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.</p>

<p>enc &lt;bdaddr&gt; [encrypt enable] Enable or disable
the encryption for the device with Bluetooth address
bdaddr.</p>

<p>key &lt;bdaddr&gt; Change the connection link key for
the device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.</p>

<p>clkoff &lt;bdaddr&gt; Read the clock offset for the
device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.</p>

<p>clock [bdaddr] [which clock] Read the clock for the
device with Bluetooth address bdaddr. The clock can be 0 for
