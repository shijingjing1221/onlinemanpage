<p>LATEX(1) LATEX(1)</p>

<p>NAME latex, elatex, lambda, pdflatex - structured text
formatting and type- setting</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS latex [ first line ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>The LaTeX language is described in the book LaTeX - A
Document Prepara- tion System. LaTeX is a TeX macro package,
not a modification to the TeX source program, so all the
capabilities described in tex(1) are present.</p>

<p>The LaTeX macros encourage writers to think about the
content of their documents, rather than the form. The ideal,
very difficult to realize, is to have no formatting commands
(like switch to italic or skip 2 picas ) in the document at
all; instead, everything is done by spe- cific markup
instructions: emphasize, start a section.</p>

<p>The primary source of documentation for LaTeX is the
LaTeX manual ref- erenced below, and the local guide in the
file local-guide.tex or local.tex or some such.</p>

<p>elatex is the e-TeX extended mode version of LaTeX
format.</p>

<p>lambda is the Omega version of the LaTeX format.</p>

<p>pdflatex is the pdfTeX version of the LaTeX format.</p>

<p>On some systems latex209 and slitex are available for
compatibility with older versions of LaTeX. These should not
be used for new texts.</p>
