<p>WCWIDTH(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCWIDTH(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcwidth - number of column positions of a
wide-character code</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>int wcwidth(wchar_t wc);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcwidth() function shall determine the
number of column positions required for the wide character
wc. The application shall ensure that the value of wc is a
character representable as a wchar_t, and is a
wide-character code corresponding to a valid character in
the current locale.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wcwidth() function shall either return
0 (if wc is a null wide- character code), or return the
number of column positions to be occu- pied by the
wide-character code wc, or return -1 (if wc does not corre-
spond to a printable wide-character code).</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE This function was removed from the
final ISO/IEC 9899:1990/Amendment 1:1995 (E), and the return
value for a non-printable wide character is not
specified.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
