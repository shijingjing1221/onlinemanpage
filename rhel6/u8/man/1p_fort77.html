<p>FORT77(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FORT77(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fort77 - FORTRAN compiler (FORTRAN)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fort77 [-c][-g][-L directory]... [-O
optlevel][-o outfile][-s][-w] operand...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fort77 utility is the interface to the
FORTRAN compilation system; it shall accept the full
FORTRAN-77 language defined by the ANSI X3.9-1978 standard.
The system conceptually consists of a compiler and link
editor. The files referenced by operands are compiled and
linked to produce an executable file. It is unspecified
whether the linking occurs entirely within the operation of
fort77; some implemen- tations may produce objects that are
not fully resolved until the file is executed.</p>

<p>If the -c option is present, for all pathname operands
of the form file .f, the files:</p>

<p>$(basename pathname.f).o</p>

<p>shall be created or overwritten as the result of
successful compila- tion. If the -c option is not specified,
it is unspecified whether such .o files are created or
deleted for the file .f operands.</p>

<p>If there are no options that prevent link editing (such
as -c) and all operands compile and link without error, the
resulting executable file shall be written into the file
named by the -o option (if present) or to the file a.out.
The executable file shall be created as specified in the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, except
that the file permissions shall be set to:</p>

<p>S_IRWXO | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXU</p>

<p>and that the bits specified by the umask of the process
shall be cleared.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The fort77 utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines, except that:</p>

<p>* The -l library operands have the format of options,
but their posi- tion within a list of operands affects the
order in which libraries are searched.</p>

<p>* The order of specifying the multiple -L options is
significant.</p>

<p>* Conforming applications shall specify each option
separately; that is, grouping option letters (for example,
-cg) need not be recog- nized by all implementations.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-c Suppress the link-edit phase of the compilation, and
do not remove any object files that are produced.</p>

<p>-g Produce symbolic information in the object or
executable files; the nature of this information is
unspecified, and may be modi- fied by implementation-defined
interactions with other options.</p>

<p>-s Produce object or executable files, or both, from
which symbolic and other information not required for proper
execution using the exec family of functions defined in the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 has been
removed (stripped). If both -g and -s options are present,
the action taken is unspeci- fied.</p>

<p>-o outfile Use the pathname outfile, instead of the
default a.out, for the executable file produced. If the -o
option is present with -c, the result is unspecified.</p>

<p>-L directory Change the algorithm of searching for the
libraries named in -l operands to look in the directory
named by the directory path- name before looking in the
usual places. Directories named in -L options shall be
searched in the specified order. At least ten instances of
this option shall be supported in a single fort77 command
invocation. If a directory specified by a -L option con-
tains a file named libf.a, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>-O optlevel Specify the level of code optimization. If
the optlevel option- argument is the digit 0 , all special
code optimizations shall be disabled. If it is the digit,
the nature of the optimiza- tion is unspecified. If the -O
option is omitted, the nature of the systems default
optimization is unspecified. It is unspeci- fied whether
code generated in the presence of the -O 0 option is the
same as that generated when -O is omitted. Other optlevel
values may be supported.</p>

<p>-w Suppress warnings.</p>

<p>Multiple instances of -L options can be specified.</p>

<p>OPERANDS An operand is either in the form of a pathname
or the form -l library. At least one operand of the pathname
form shall be specified. The fol- lowing operands shall be
supported:</p>

<p>file.f The pathname of a FORTRAN source file to be
compiled and option- ally passed to the link editor. The
filename operand shall be of this form if the -c option is
used.</p>

<p>file.a A library of object files typically produced by
ar, and passed directly to the link editor. Implementations
may recognize implementation-defined suffixes other than .a
as denoting object file libraries.</p>

<p>file.o An object file produced by fort77 -c and passed
directly to the link editor. Implementations may recognize
implementation- defined suffixes other than .o as denoting
object files.</p>

<p>The processing of other files is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>-l library (The letter ell.) Search the library
named:</p>

<p>liblibrary.a</p>

<p>A library is searched when its name is encountered, so
the placement of a -l operand is significant. Several
standard libraries can be speci- fied in this manner, as
described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.
Implementations may recognize implementation-defined
suffixes other than .a as denoting libraries.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input file shall be one of the
following: a text file containing FORTRAN source code; an
object file in the format produced by fort77 -c; or a
library of object files, in the format produced by archiving
zero or more object files, using ar. Implementations may
supply addi- tional utilities that produce files in these
formats. Additional input files are
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>A &lt;tab&gt; encountered within the first six
characters on a line of source code shall cause the compiler
to interpret the following character as if it were the
seventh character on the line (that is, in column 7).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of fort77:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>TMPDIR Determine the pathname that should override the
default direc- tory for temporary files, if any.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages. If more than one file operand ending in
.f (or possibly other unspecified suf- fixes) is given, for
each such file:</p>

<p>&quot;%sn&quot;, &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>may be written to allow identification of the diagnostic
message with the appropriate input file.</p>

<p>This utility may produce warning messages about certain
conditions that do not warrant returning an error (non-zero)
exit value.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES Object files, listing files, and executable
files shall be produced in unspecified formats.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION Standard Libraries The fort77
utility shall recognize the following -l operand for the
standard library:</p>

<p>-l f This library contains all functions referenced in
the ANSI X3.9-1978 standard. This operand shall not be
required to be present to cause a search of this
library.</p>

<p>In the absence of options that inhibit invocation of the
link editor, such as -c, the fort77 utility shall cause the
equivalent of a -l f operand to be passed to the link editor
as the last -l operand, causing it to be searched after all
other object files and libraries are loaded.</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether the library libf.a exists as a
regular file. The implementation may accept as -l operands
names of objects that do not exist as regular files.</p>

<p>External Symbols The FORTRAN compiler and link editor
shall support the significance of external symbols up to a
length of at least 31 bytes; case folding is permitted. The
action taken upon encountering symbols exceeding the
implementation-defined maximum symbol length is
unspecified.</p>

<p>The compiler and link editor shall support a minimum of
511 external symbols per source or object file, and a
minimum of 4095 external sym- bols total. A diagnostic
message is written to standard output if the
implementation-defined limit is exceeded; other actions are
unspeci- fied.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful compilation or link edit.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS When fort77 encounters a
compilation error, it shall write a diagnostic to standard
error and continue to compile other source code operands. It
shall return a non-zero exit status, but it is
implementation- defined whether an object module is created.
If the link edit is unsuccessful, a diagnostic message shall
be written to standard error, and fort77 shall exit with a
non-zero status.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following usage example compiles xyz.f and
creates the executable file foo:</p>

<p>fort77 -o foo xyz.f</p>

<p>The following example compiles xyz.f and creates the
object file xyz.o:</p>

<p>fort77 -c xyz.f</p>

<p>The following example compiles xyz.f and creates the
executable file a.out:</p>

<p>fort77 xyz.f</p>

<p>The following example compiles xyz.f, links it with b.o,
and creates the executable a.out:</p>

<p>fort77 xyz.f b.o</p>

<p>RATIONALE The name of this utility was chosen as fort77
to parallel the renaming of the C compiler. The name f77 was
not chosen to avoid problems with historical
implementations. The ANSI X3.9-1978 standard was selected as
a normative reference because the ISO/IEC version of
FORTRAN-77 has been superseded by the ISO/IEC 1539:1990
standard (Fortran-90).</p>

<p>The file inclusion and symbol definition #define
mechanisms used by the c99 utility were not included in this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001-even though they are commonly
implemented-since there is no requirement that the FORTRAN
compiler use the C preproces- sor.</p>

<p>The -onetrip option was not included in this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, even though many historical compilers
support it, because it is derived from FORTRAN-66; it is an
anachronism that should not be perpetuated.</p>

<p>Some implementations produce compilation listings. This
aspect of FOR- TRAN has been left unspecified because there
was controversy concerning the various methods proposed for
implementing it: a -V option over- lapped with historical
vendor practice and a naming convention of cre- ating files
with .l suffixes collided with historical lex file naming
practice.</p>

<p>There is no -I option in this version of this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 to specify a directory for file
inclusion. An INCLUDE directive has been a part of the
Fortran-90 discussions, but an interface supporting that
standard is not in the current scope.</p>

<p>It is noted that many FORTRAN compilers produce an
object module even when compilation errors occur; during a
subsequent compilation, the compiler may patch the object
module rather than recompiling all the code. Consequently,
it is left to the implementor whether or not an object file
is created.</p>

<p>A reference to MIL-STD-1753 was removed from an early
proposal in response to a request from the POSIX
FORTRAN-binding standard develop- ers. It was not the
intention of the standard developers to require
certification of the FORTRAN compiler, and IEEE Std
1003.9-1992 does not specify the military standard or any
special preprocessing require- ments. Furthermore, use of
that document would have been inappropriate for an
international standard.</p>

<p>The specification of optimization has been subject to
changes through early proposals. At one time, -O and -N were
Booleans: optimize and do not optimize (with an unspecified
default). Some historical practice led this to be changed
to:</p>

<p>-O 0 No optimization.</p>

<p>-O 1 Some level of optimization.</p>

<p>-O n Other, unspecified levels of optimization.</p>

<p>It is not always clear whether &quot;good code
generation&quot; is the same thing as optimization. Simple
optimizations of local actions do not usually affect the
semantics of a program. The -O 0 option has been included to
accommodate the very particular nature of scientific
calculations in a highly optimized environment; compilers
make errors. Some degree of optimization is expected, even
if it is not documented here, and the ability to shut it off
completely could be important when porting an application.
An implementation may treat -O 0 as &quot;do less than
normal&quot; if it wishes, but this is only meaningful if
any of the operations it performs can affect the semantics
of a program. It is highly dependent on the implementation
whether doing less than normal is logical. It is not the
intent of the -O 0 option to ask for inefficient code
genera- tion, but rather to assure that any semantically
visible optimization is suppressed.</p>

<p>The specification of standard library access is
consistent with the C compiler specification.
Implementations are not required to have /usr/lib/libf.a, as
many historical implementations do, but if not they are
required to recognize f as a token.</p>

<p>External symbol size limits are in normative text;
conforming applica- tions need to know these limits.
However, the minimum maximum symbol length should be taken
as a constraint on a conforming application, not on an
implementation, and consequently the action taken for a
symbol exceeding the limit is unspecified. The minimum size
for the external symbol table was added for similar
reasons.</p>

<p>The CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS section clearly specifies the
behavior of the compiler when compilation or link-edit
errors occur. The behavior of several historical
implementations was examined, and the choice was made to be
silent on the status of the executable, or a.out, file in
the face of compiler or linker errors. If a linker writes
the exe- cutable file, then links it on disk with lseek()s
and write()s, the partially linked executable file can be
left on disk and its execute bits turned off if the link
edit fails. However, if the linker links the image in memory
before writing the file to disk, it need not touch the
executable file (if it already exists) because the link edit
fails. Since both approaches are historical practice, a
conforming application shall rely on the exit status of
fort77, rather than on the existence or mode of the
executable file.</p>

<p>The -g and -s options are not specified as
mutually-exclusive. Histor- ically these two options have
been mutually-exclusive, but because both are so loosely
specified, it seemed appropriate to leave their interac-
tion unspecified.</p>

<p>The requirement that conforming applications specify
compiler options separately is to reserve the
multi-character option name space for ven- dor-specific
compiler options, which are known to exist in many histor-
ical implementations. Implementations are not required to
recognize, for example, -gc as if it were -g -c; nor are
they forbidden from doing so. The SYNOPSIS shows all of the
options separately to highlight this requirement on
applications.</p>

<p>Echoing filenames to standard error is considered a
diagnostic message because it would otherwise be difficult
to associate an error message with the erring file. They are
described with &quot;may&quot; to allow implemen- tations to
use other methods of identifying files and to parallel the
description in c99.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS A compilation system based on the
ISO/IEC 1539:1990 standard (For- tran-90) may be considered
for a future version; it may have a differ- ent utility name
from fort77.</p>
