<p>NAME setroubleshootd - setroubleshoot daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS setroubleshootd [- [-h] [-c config]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the
setroubleshootd program.</p>

<p>setroubleshootd is the dbus service in the
setroubleshoot system. setroubleshoot is used to diagnose
SELinux denials and attempts to pro- vide user friendly
explanations for a SELinux denial (e.g. AVC) and
recommendations for how one might adjust the system to
prevent the denial in the future.</p>

<p>In a standard configuration setroubleshoot is composed
of two compo- nents, sealert and setroubleshootd.</p>

<p>setroubleshootd is a system daemon which runs with root
privileges and listens for audit events emitted from the
kernel related to SELinux. When the setroubleshootd daemon
sees an SELinux AVC denial it runs a series of analysis
plugins which examines the audit data related to the AVC. It
records the results of the analysis and signals any clients
which have attached to the setroubleshootd daemon that a new
alert has been seen.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f --nofork Do not fork the daemon</p>

<p>-h --help Show this message</p>

<p>-c --config section.option=value set a configuration
value</p>
