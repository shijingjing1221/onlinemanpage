<p>PSNUP(1) PSNUP(1)</p>

<p>NAME psnup - multiple pages per sheet</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS psnup [ -wwidth ] [ -hheight ] [ -ppaper ] [
-Wwidth ] [ -Hheight ] [ -Ppaper ] [ -l ] [ -r ] [ -f ] [ -c
] [ -mmargin ] [ -bborder ] [ -dlwidth ] [ -sscale ] [ -nup
] [ -q ] [ infile [ outfile ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Psnup puts multiple logical pages onto each
physical sheet of paper. The input PostScript file should
follow the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions.</p>

<p>The -w option gives the paper width, and the -h option
gives the paper height, normally specified in cm or in to
convert PostScripts points (1/72 of an inch) to centimeters
or inches. The -p option can be used as an alternative, to
set the paper size to a3, a4, a5, b5, letter, legal,
tabloid, statement, executive, folio, quarto, 10x14 or
_glibc, where latter one means the format of the current
locale. The default paper size is _glibc. The -W, -H, and -P
options set the input paper size, if it is different from
the output size. This makes it easy to impose pages of one
size on a different size of paper.</p>

<p>The -l option should be used for pages which are in
landscape orienta- tion (rotated 90 degrees anticlockwise).
The -r option should be used for pages which are in seascape
orientation (rotated 90 degrees clock- wise), and the -f
option should be used for pages which have the width and
height interchanged, but are not rotated.</p>

<p>Psnup normally uses row-major layout, where adjacent
pages are placed in rows across the paper. The -c option
changes the order to column- major , where successive pages
are placed in columns down the paper.</p>

<p>A margin to leave around the whole page can be specified
with the -m option. This is useful for sheets of thumbnail
pages, because the normal page margins are reduced by
putting multiple pages on a single sheet.</p>

<p>The -b option is used to specify an additional margin
around each page on a sheet.</p>

<p>The -d option draws a line around the border of each
page, of the spec- ified width. If the lwidth parameter is
omitted, a default linewidth of 1 point is assumed. The
linewidth is relative to the original page dimensions, i.e.
it is scaled down with the rest of the page.</p>

<p>The scale chosen by psnup can be overridden with the -s
option. This is useful to merge pages which are already
reduced.</p>

<p>The -nup option selects the number of logical pages to
put on each sheet of paper. This can be any whole number;
psnup tries to optimise the layout so that the minimum
amount of space is wasted. If psnup can- not find a layout
within its tolerance limit, it will abort with an error
message. The alternative form i nup can also be used, for
compat- ibility with other n-up programs.</p>

<p>Psnup normally prints the page numbers of the pages
re-arranged; the -q option suppresses this.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The potential use of this utility is varied but
one particular use is in conjunction with psbook(1). For
example, using groff to create a PostScript document and lpr
as the UNIX print spooler a typical command line might look
like this:</p>

<p>groff -Tps -ms file | psbook | psnup -2 | lpr</p>

<p>Where file is a 4 page document this command will result
in a two page document printing two pages of file per page
and rearranges the page order to match the input pages 4 and
1 on the first output page and pages 2 then 3 of the input
document on the second output page.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES LC_ALL, LC_PAPER These variables
are specifying the papertype when used paper is _glibc. For
details see the locale(7) manpage.</p>
