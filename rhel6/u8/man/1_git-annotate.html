<p>GIT-ANNOTATE(1) Git Manual GIT-ANNOTATE(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-annotate - Annotate file lines with commit
information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git annotate [options] file [revision]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Annotates each line in the given file with
information from the commit which introduced the line.
Optionally annotates from a given revision.</p>

<p>The only difference between this command and
git-blame(1) is that they use slightly different output
formats, and this command exists only for backward
compatibility to support existing scripts, and provide a
more familiar command name for people coming from other SCM
systems.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b Show blank SHA-1 for boundary commits. This
can also be controlled via the blame.blankboundary config
option.</p>

<p>--root Do not treat root commits as boundaries. This can
also be controlled via the blame.showroot config option.</p>

<p>--show-stats Include additional statistics at the end of
blame output.</p>

<p>-L &lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt; Annotate only the given
line range. &lt;start&gt; and &lt;end&gt; can take one of
these forms:</p>

<p>&middot; number</p>

<p>If &lt;start&gt; or &lt;end&gt; is a number, it
specifies an absolute line number (lines count from 1).</p>

<p>&middot; /regex/</p>

<p>This form will use the first line matching the given
POSIX regex. If &lt;end&gt; is a regex, it will search
starting at the line given by &lt;start&gt;.</p>

<p>&middot; +offset or -offset</p>

<p>This is only valid for &lt;end&gt; and will specify a
number of lines before or after the line given by
&lt;start&gt;.</p>

<p>-l Show long rev (Default: off).</p>

<p>-t Show raw timestamp (Default: off).</p>

<p>-S &lt;revs-file&gt; Use revisions from revs-file
instead of calling git-rev-list(1).</p>

<p>--reverse Walk history forward instead of backward.
Instead of showing the revision in which a line appeared,
this shows the last revision in which a line has existed.
This requires a range of revision like START..END where the
path to blame exists in START.</p>

<p>-p, --porcelain Show in a format designed for machine
consumption.</p>

<p>--incremental Show the result incrementally in a format
designed for machine consumption.</p>

<p>--encoding=&lt;encoding&gt; Specifies the encoding used
to output author names and commit summaries. Setting it to
none makes blame output unconverted data. For more
information see the discussion about encoding in the git-
log(1) manual page.</p>

<p>--contents &lt;file&gt; When &lt;rev&gt; is not
specified, the command annotates the changes starting
backwards from the working tree copy. This flag makes the
command pretend as if the working tree copy has the contents
of the named file (specify - to make the command read from
the standard input).</p>

<p>--date &lt;format&gt; The value is one of the following
alternatives: {relative,local,default,iso,rfc,short}. If
--date is not provided, the value of the blame.date config
variable is used. If the blame.date config variable is also
not set, the iso format is used. For more information, See
the discussion of the --date option at git-log(1).</p>

<p>-M|&lt;num&gt;| Detect moved or copied lines within a
file. When a commit moves or copies a block of lines (e.g.
the original file has A and then B, and the commit changes
it to B and then A), the traditional blame algorithm notices
only half of the movement and typically blames the lines
that were moved up (i.e. B) to the parent and assigns blame
to the lines that were moved down (i.e. A) to the child
commit. With this option, both groups of lines are blamed on
the parent by running extra passes of inspection.</p>

<p>&lt;num&gt; is optional but it is the lower bound on the
number of alphanumeric characters that git must detect as
moving within a file for it to associate those lines with
the parent commit.</p>

<p>-C|&lt;num&gt;| In addition to -M, detect lines moved or
copied from other files that were modified in the same
commit. This is useful when you reorganize your program and
move code around across files. When this option is given
twice, the command additionally looks for copies from other
files in the commit that creates the file. When this option
is given three times, the command additionally looks for
copies from other files in any commit.</p>

<p>&lt;num&gt; is optional but it is the lower bound on the
number of alphanumeric characters that git must detect as
moving between files for it to associate those lines with
the parent commit.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show help message.</p>
