<p>NAME pamlookup - map an image to a new image by using it
as indices into a table</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamlookup -lookupfile=lookupfile
-missingcolor=color [-fit] indexfile</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one. You may
separate an option name and its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamlookup takes a two dimensional array of indices and a
lookup table as input. For each position in the index array,
it looks up the index in the lookup table and places the
result of the lookup in the output image. The output thus
has the same width and height as the index image, and tuple
types determined by the lookup table.</p>

<p>An index is either a whole number or an ordered pair of
whole numbers. If the index image has a depth of one, each
index in it is a whole num- ber: the value of the one
sample. If the index image has a depth greater than one,
each index in it is an ordered pair of the first and second
samples in the relevant tuple.</p>

<p>The lookup table is a PAM or PNM image. If the index
image contains whole number indices, the lookup image is a
single row and the index is a column number. The lookup
result is the value of the tuple or pixel at the indicated
column in the one row in the lookup table. If the index
image contains ordered pair indices, the first element of
the ordered pair is a row number and the second element of
the ordered pair is a column number. The lookup result is
the value of the tuple or pixel at the indicated row and
column in the lookup table.</p>

<p>For example: Consider an index image consisting of a
3x2x1 PAM as fol- lows:</p>

<p>0 1 0 2 2 2</p>

<p>and a lookup table consisting of a 3x1 PPM image as
follows:</p>

<p>red yellow beige</p>

<p>The lookup table above says Index 0 corresponds to the
color red, Index 1 corresponds to yellow, and Index 2
corresponds to beige. The output of pamlookup is the
following PPM image:</p>

<p>red yellow red beige beige beige</p>

<p>Now lets look at an example of the more complex case
where the indices are ordered pairs of whole numbers instead
of whole numbers. Our index image will be this 3x2x2 PAM
image:</p>

<p>(0,0) (0,1) (0,0) (1,1) (1,0) (0,0)</p>

<p>Our lookup table for the example will be this two
dimensional PPM:</p>

<p>red yellow green black</p>

<p>This lookup table says Index (0,0) corresponds to the
color red, Index (0,1) corresponds to yellow, Index (1,0)
corresponds to green, and Index (1,1) corresponds to black.
The output of pamlookup is the fol- lowing PPM image:</p>

<p>red yellow red black green red</p>

<p>If an index specifies a row or column that exceeds the
dimensions of the lookup table image, pamlookup uses the
value from the top left cor- ner of the lookup image, or the
value you specify with the -missing- color option.</p>

<p>The indexfile argument identifies the file containing
the index PAM or PNM image. - means Standard Input. The
mandatory -lookupfile option identifies the file containing
the lookup table image. Again, - means Standard Input. It
won t work if both the index image file and lookup table
file are Standard Input. The output image goes to Standard
Out- put.</p>

<p>You can use ppmmake and pnmcat to create a lookup table
file.</p>

<p>If you want to use two separate 1-plane images as
indices (so that your output reflects the combination of
both inputs), use pamstack to com- bine the two into one
two-plane image (and use a 2-dimensional lookup table
image).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -lookupfile=lookupfile lookupfile names the file
that contains the PAM or PNM image that is the lookup table.
This option is mandatory.</p>

<p>-missingcolor=color This option is meaningful only if
the lookup image (and there- fore the output) is a PNM
image. color specifies the color that is to go in the output
wherever the index from the input is not present in the
lookup table (not present means the index exceeds the
dimensions of the lookup image -- e.g. index is 100 but the
lookup image is a 50 x 1 PPM).</p>

<p>If you don t specify this option of -fit, pamlookup uses
the value from the top left corner of the lookup image
whenever an index exceeds the dimensions of the lookup
image.</p>

<p>Specify the color (color) as described for the argument
of the ppm_parsecolor() library routine .</p>

<p>Another way to deal with a too-small lookup image is to
use the -fit option.</p>

<p>-fit This option says to shrink or expand the lookup
image as neces- sary to fit the indices present in the index
image, per the index images maxval. For example, if your
index image has a single plane and a maxval of 255 and your
lookup image is 1 row of 10 columns, pamlookup stretches
your lookup image to 255 columns before doing the lookups.
pamlookup does the stretching (or shrinking) with the
pamscale(1) program.</p>

<p>When you use -fit, pamlookup never fails or warns you
due to invalid lookup image dimensions, and the
-missingcolor option has no effect.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Example: rainfall map Say you have a set of
rainfall data in a single plane PAM image. The rows and
columns of the PAM indicate lattitude and longitude. The
sam- ple values are the annual rainfall in (whole)
centimeters. The highest rainfall value in the image is 199
centimeters. The image is in the file rainfall.pam.</p>

<p>You want to produce a PPM rainfall map with green for
the wettest places, red for the driest, and other colors in
between.</p>

<p>First, compose a lookup table image, probably with a
graphical editor and the image blown way up so you can work
with individual pixels. The image must have a single row and
200 columns. Make the leftmost pixel red and the rightmost
pixel green and choose appropriate colors in between. Call
it colorkey.ppm.</p>

<p>pamlookup rainfall.ppm -lookupfile=colorkey.ppm
&gt;rainfallmap.ppm</p>

<p>Now lets say youre too lazy to type in 200 color values
and nobody really cares about the places that have more than
99 centimeters of annual rainfall. In that case, just make
colorkey.ppm 100 columns wide and do this:</p>

<p>pamlookup rainfall.ppm -lookupfile=colorkey.ppm
-missingcolor=black &gt;rainfallmap.ppm</p>

<p>Now if there are areas that get more than 100
centimeters of rainfall, they will just show up black in the
output.</p>

<p>Example: graphical diff Say you want to compare two PBM
(black and white) images visually. Each consists of black
foreground pixels on a white background. You want to create
an image that contains background where both images con-
tain background and foreground where both images contain
foreground. But where Image 1 has a foreground pixel and
Image 2 does not, you want red in the output; where Image 2
has a foreground pixel and Image 1 does not, you want
green.</p>

<p>First, we create a single image that contains the
information from both input PBMs:</p>

<p>pamstack image1.pbm image2.pbm &gt;bothimages.pam</p>

<p>Note that this image has 1 of 4 possible tuple values at
each location: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), or (1,1).</p>

<p>Now, we create a lookup table that we can index with
those 4 values:</p>

<p>ppmmake white 1 1 &gt;white.ppm ppmmake black 1 1
&gt;black.ppm ppmmake red 1 1 &gt;red.ppm ppmmake green 1 1
&gt;green.ppm pnmcat -leftright black.ppm red.ppm
&gt;blackred.ppm pnmcat -leftright green.ppm white.ppm
&gt;greenwhite.ppm pnmcat -topbottom blackred.ppm
greenwhite.ppm &gt;lookup.ppm</p>

<p>Finally, we look up the indices from our index in our
lookup table and produce the output:</p>

<p>pamlookup bothimages.ppm -lookupfile=lookup.ppm
&gt;imagediff.ppm</p>
