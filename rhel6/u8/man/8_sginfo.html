<p>NAME sginfo - access mode page information for a SCSI
(or ATAPI) device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sginfo [OPTIONS] [DEVICE]
[REPLACEMENT_PARAMETERS]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sginfo is a port of the Linux scsiinfo
program by Eric Youngdale. It uses SCSI generic (sg)
devices; however in some cases the high level device name
(i.e. sd, sr, st, osst, or hd) can also be used. The pri-
mary role of this program is to access mode page
information. If per- mitted, mode page information can be
altered. In addition information from the INQUIRY and READ
DEFECTS commands are also available.</p>

<p>Those interested in SCSI mode pages may find the sdparm
utility easier use, especially for changing parameters. Also
the author considers this utility legacy so the mode pages
are not being updated as http://www.t10.org adds and
modifies mode page fields.</p>

<p>Four sets of values are maintained by a SCSI device for
each mode page: current (active), default (manufacturers
supplied values), saved (val- ues that are retained if the
SCSI device is powered down), and change- able (mask
indicating those values that can be changed). By default
when a mode page is displayed the current values are shown.
This can be overridden by &quot;-M&quot; (defaults),
&quot;-S&quot; (saved) or &quot;-m&quot; (modifiable (i.e.
changeable)).</p>

<p>Many mode pages are decoded: for disks (see SBC-2), for
CD/DVDs (see MMC-2/3/4/5), for tapes (see SSC-2) and for
enclosures (see SES-2). Some mode pages common to all SCSI
peripheral device types are defined in SPC-4 (primary
commands). A decoded mode page has its field names in the
first column and the corresponding value in the second
column. A &quot;hex&quot; mode page (and subpage) has its
byte position in the first column (in hex and starting at
0x2) and the corresponding hex value in the second column.
Decoded pages can be viewed with the -t option or with a
specific option (e.g. c for the caching mode page).
Naturally decoded pages must be supplied by the DEVICE and
recognised by this program. If supported by the device,
decoded pages may be modified. All mode pages (and subpages)
that the device supports can be viewed in hex (and
potentially modified) via the &quot;-u&quot; option</p>

<p>If no options are given that will cause mode page(s) or
INQUIRY data to be printed out, then a brief INQUIRY
response is output. This includes the vendor, product and
revision level of the device.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -6 Perform 6 byte MODE SENSE and MODE SELECT
commands; by default the 10 byte variants are used.</p>

<p>-a Display some INQUIRY data and the unit serial number
followed by all mode pages reported by the device. It is
similar to the -t 0x3f option. If the mode page is known
then it is output in decoded form otherwise it is output in
hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-A Display some INQUIRY data and the unit serial number
followed by all mode pages and all mode subpages reported by
the device. It is similar to the -t 0x3f,0xff option. If a
mode (sub)page is known then it is output in decoded form
otherwise it is output in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-c Access information in the Caching mode page.</p>

<p>-C Access information in the Control mode Page.</p>

<p>-d Display defect lists (default format: index).</p>

<p>-D Access information in the Disconnect-Reconnect mode
page.</p>

<p>-e Access information in the Error Recovery mode
page.</p>

<p>-E Access information in the Control Extension mode
page.</p>

<p>-f Access information in the Format Device mode
page.</p>

<p>-Farg Format of the defect lists: -Flogical - logical
block addresses (32 bit) -Flba64 - logical block addresses
(64 bit) -Fphysical - physical blocks -Findex - defect bytes
from index -Fhead - sort by head Used in conjunction with
&quot;-d&quot; or &quot;-G&quot;. If a format is not given
&quot;index&quot; is assumed.</p>

<p>-g Access information in the Rigid Disk Drive Geometry
mode page.</p>

<p>-G Display grown defect list (default format:
index).</p>

<p>-i Display the response to a standard INQUIRY
command.</p>

<p>-I Access the Informational Exceptions mode page.</p>

<p>-l List known SCSI devices on the system.</p>

<p>-n Access information in the Notch and Partition mode
page.</p>

<p>-N Negate (i.e. stop) mode page changes being placed in
the &quot;saved&quot; page (by default changes go to the
current and the saved page). Only active when used together
with -R.</p>

<p>-P Access information in the Power Condition mode
page.</p>

<p>-r Display all raw (or primary) SCSI device names
visible in the /dev directory. Examples are /dev/sda,
/dev/st1 and /dev/scd2. Does not list sg device names so
devices such as a SCSI enclo- sure which only have an sg
device name are not listed.</p>

<p>-s Display information in the unit serial number page
which is a INQUIRY command variant.</p>

<p>-t PN[,SPN] Display information from mode page number PN
(and optionally sub page number SPN) in decoded format (if
known, otherwise in hex form). PN is a mode page number in a
decimal number from 0 to 63 inclusive. SPN is the mode
subpage number and is assumed to be 0 if not given. SPN is a
decimal number from 1 to 255 inclu- sive. A page number of
63 returns all pages supported by the device in ascending
order except for page 0 which, if present, is last. Page 0
is vendor specific and not necessarily in mode page format.
Alternatively hex values can be given for both PN and SPN
(both prefixed by 0x).</p>

<p>-t Trace commands (for debugging). When used once SCSI
commands are shown (in hex) and any errors from these SCSI
commands are spelt out (i.e. with a decoded and raw sense
buffer). When used twice, the additional data sent with mode
select and the response from mode sense are shown (in
hex).</p>

<p>-u PN[,SPN] Display information from mode page number PN
(and optionally SPN) in hex form. PNis a mode page number in
a decimal number from 0 to 63 inclusive. SPN is the mode
subpage number and is assumed to be 0 if not given. SPN is a
decimal number from 1 to 255 inclusive. A page number of 63
returns all pages supported by the device in ascending order
except for page 0 which, if present, is last. Page 0 is
vendor specific and not necessarily in mode page format.
Alternatively hex values can be given for both PN and SPN
(both prefixed by 0x). For example 63 and 0x3f are
equivalent.</p>

<p>-v Display version string then exit. [N.B. This option
increases verbosity for most other utilities in this package
as outlined in man 8 sg3_utils . This odd usage is for
backward compati- bility with the scsiinfo utility.]</p>

<p>-V Access information in the Verify Error Recovery mode
page. [N.B. This option prints the version string then exits
in most other utilities in this package as outlined in man 8
sg3_utils. This odd usage is for backward compatibility with
the scsiinfo util- ity.]</p>

<p>-z do a single fetch for mode pages (over-estimating the
expected length of the returned response). The default
action is to do a double fetch, the first fetch is to find
the response length that could be returned. Devices that
closely adhere to SCSI standards should not require this
option, some real world devices do require it.</p>

<p>ADVANCED OPTIONS Only one of the following three options
can be specified. None of these three implies the current
values are returned.</p>

<p>-m Display modifiable fields instead of current
values</p>

<p>-M Display manufacturers defaults instead of current
values</p>

<p>-S Display saved defaults instead of current values</p>

<p>The following are advanced options, not generally suited
for most users:</p>

<p>-X Display output values in a list. Make them suitable
for editing and being given back to the -R (replace
command).</p>

<p>-R Replace parameters - best used with -X (expert use
only)</p>

<p>CHANGING MODE PAGE PARAMETERS Firstly you should know
what you are doing before changing existing parameters.
Taking the control page as an example, first list it out
normally (e.g. &quot;sginfo -C /dev/sda&quot;) and decide
which parameter is to be changed (note its position relative
to the other lines output). Then execute the same sginfo
command with the &quot;-X&quot; option added; this will
output the parameter values in a single row in the same
relative posi- tions as the previous command. Now execute
&quot;sginfo -CXR /dev/sda ...&quot; with the
&quot;...&quot; replaced by the single row of values output
by the pre- vious command, with the relevant parameter
changed. Here is a simpli- fied example:</p>

<p>$ sginfo -C /dev/sda Control mode page (0xa)
----------------------- TST 0 D_SENSE 0 GLTSD 1 RLEC 0</p>

<p>[Actually the Control page has more parameters that
shown above.] Next output those parameters in single line
form:</p>

<p>$ sginfo -CX /dev/sda 0 0 1 0</p>

<p>Let us assume that the GLTSD bit is to be cleared. The
command that will clear it is:</p>

<p>$ sginfo -CXR /dev/sda 0 0 0 0</p>

<p>The same number of parameters output by the
&quot;-CX&quot; command needs to be placed at the end of the
&quot;-CXR&quot; command line (after the device name). Now
check that the change took effect:</p>

<p>$ sginfo -C /dev/sda Control mode page (0xa)
----------------------- TST 0 D_SENSE 0 GLTSD 0 RLEC 0</p>

<p>When a mode page is &quot;replaced&quot; the default
action is to change both the current page and the saved
page. [For some reason versions of sginfo and scsiinfo prior
to 2.0 did not change the &quot;saved&quot; page.] To change
only the current mode page but not the corresponding saved
page use the &quot;-N&quot; option.</p>

<p>GENERATING SCRIPT FILES AND HEX PAGES The
&quot;-aX&quot; or &quot;-AX&quot; option generates output
suitable for a script file. Mode pages are output in list
format (after the INQUIRY and serial num- ber) one page per
line. To facilitate running the output as (part of) a script
file to assert chosen mode page values, each line is
prefixed by &quot;sginfo -t PN[,SPN] -XR &quot;. When such a
script file is run, it will have the effect of re-asserting
the mode page values to what they were when the
&quot;-aX&quot; generated the output.</p>

<p>All mode pages (and subpages) supported by the device
can be accessed via the -t and -u options. To see all mode
pages supported by the device use &quot;-u 63&quot;. [To see
all mode pages and all subpages use &quot;-u 63,255&quot;.]
To list the control mode page in hex (mode page index in the
first column and the corresponding byte value in the second
column) use &quot;-u 0xa&quot;. Mode pages (subpage code ==
0) start at index position 2 while subpages start at index
position 4. If the &quot;-Xu ...&quot; option is used then a
list a hex values each value prefixed by &quot;@&quot; is
output. Mode (sub)page values can then be modified with with
the &quot;-RXu ...&quot; option.</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS The SCSI MODE SENSE command yields block
descriptors as well as a mode page(s). This utility ignores
block descriptors and does not display them. The
&quot;disable block descriptor&quot; switch (DBD) in the
MODE SENSE command is not set since some devices yield
errors when it is set. When mode page values are being
changed (the &quot;-R&quot; option), the same block
descriptor obtained by reading the mode page (i.e. via a
MODE SENSE command) is sent back when the mode page is
written (i.e. via a MODE SELECT command).</p>

<p>HISTORY scsiinfo version 1.0 was released by Eric
Youngdale on 1st November 1993. The most recent version of
scsiinfo is version 1.7 with the last patches by Michael
Weller. sginfo is derived from scsiinfo and uses the sg
interface to get around the 4 KB buffer limit in scsiinfo
that cramped the display of defect lists especially. sginfo
was written by Douglas Gilbert with patches from Kurt
Garloff. This manpage corre- sponds with version 2.25 of
sginfo.</p>
