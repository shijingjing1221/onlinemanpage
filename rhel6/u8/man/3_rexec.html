<p>REXEC(3) Linux Programmer s Manual REXEC(3)</p>

<p>NAME rexec - return stream to a remote command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int rexec(char **ahost, int inport, char *user,
char *passwd, char *cmd, int *fd2p);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This interface is obsoleted by rcmd(3).</p>

<p>The rexec() function looks up the host *ahost using
gethostbyname(3), returning -1 if the host does not exist.
Otherwise *ahost is set to the standard name of the host. If
a username and password are both specified, then these are
used to authenticate to the foreign host; otherwise the
environment and then the users .netrc file in his home
directory are searched for appropriate information. If all
this fails, the user is prompted for the information.</p>

<p>The port inport specifies which well-known DARPA
Internet port to use for the connection; the call
getservbyname(&quot;exec&quot;, &quot;tcp&quot;) (see
getser- vent(3)) will return a pointer to a structure that
contains the neces- sary port. The protocol for connection
is described in detail in rex- ecd(8).</p>

<p>If the connection succeeds, a socket in the Internet
domain of type SOCK_STREAM is returned to the caller, and
given to the remote command as stdin and stdout. If fd2p is
non-zero, then an auxiliary channel to a control process
will be setup, and a descriptor for it will be placed in
*fd2p. The control process will return diagnostic output
from the command (unit 2) on this channel, and will also
accept bytes on this channel as being Unix signal numbers,
to be forwarded to the process group of the command. The
diagnostic information returned does not include remote
authorization failure, as the secondary connection is set up
after authorization has been verified. If fd2p is 0, then
the stderr (unit 2 of the remote command) will be made the
same as the std- out and no provision is made for sending
arbitrary signals to the remote process, although you may be
able to get its attention by using out-of-band data.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO Not in POSIX.1-2001. Present on the BSDs,
Solaris, and many other sys- tems. The rexec() function
appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>BUGS The rexec() function sends the unencrypted password
across the network.</p>

<p>The underlying service is considered a big security hole
and therefore not enabled on many sites, see rexecd(8) for
explanations.</p>
