<p>NAME runlevel - event signalling change of system
runlevel</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS runlevel RUNLEVEL=RUNLEVEL PREVLEVEL=PREVLEVEL
[ENV]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This page describes the runlevel Upstart
event, and the general imple- mentation of runlevels in the
Upstart system. For the runlevel tool, see runlevel(8)</p>

<p>The runlevel event The runlevel event signals a change
of system runlevel. The new system runlevel is given in the
RUNLEVEL argument, and the previous system runlevel in the
PREVLEVEL argument (which may be empty).</p>

<p>Additional environment may follow these depending on the
runlevel, and the tool that emitted the event. The
shutdown(8) tool will supply an INIT_HALT variable set to
either HALT or POWEROFF when called with -H or -P
respectively.</p>

<p>Runlevels Runlevels are a concept from UNIX&reg; System
V used by the init(8) daemon or other system initialisation
system to define modes of system opera- tion.</p>

<p>Eight runlevels are permitted, the first seven are
numbered 0-6 and the eighth is named S or s (both are
permitted).</p>

<p>Services and other system components are said to exist
in one or more runlevels. When switching from one runlevel
to another, the services that should not exist in the new
runlevel are stopped and the services that only exist in the
new runlevel are started.</p>

<p>This is performed by the /etc/init.d/rc script executed
on a change of runlevel (by jobs run on the runlevel event
in the Upstart system). This script examines symlinks in the
/etc/rc?.d directories, symlinks beginning K are services to
be stopped and symlinks beginning S are services to be
started.</p>

<p>The authorative documentation for this process can be
found in the Sys- tem run levels and init.d scripts section
of the Debian Policy Manual. This may be currently found at
&lt;http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-pol-
icy/ch-opersys.html#s-sysvinit&gt;</p>

<p>Runlevels 0, 1 and 6 are reserved. Runlevel 0 is used to
halt the sys- tem and 6 to reboot the system. Runlevel 1 is
used to bring the system back down into single-user mode,
after which the runlevel will be S.</p>

<p>System V initialisation in Upstart The compatible
implementation of runlevels permits Upstart jobs to be run
on the runlevel event that perform the same functionality as
the original System V init(8) daemon.</p>

<p>The /etc/init/rc.conf job is run on the runlevel event,
thus receiving the RUNLEVEL and PREVLEVEL environment
variables. Its sole job is to execute the /etc/init.d/rc
script, passing the new runlevel as an argu- ment.</p>

<p>Initial system startup is provided by the
/etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf job. This is run on the startup(7)
event, and is primarily responsible for running the
/etc/init.d/rc script with the special S argument and
calling telinit(8) to switch into the default runlevel when
done. This also handles the -b, emergency, -s and single
kernel command-line options as well as specifying an
alternate runlevel on the kernel com- mand-line.</p>

<p>Finally the /etc/init/rcS.conf job handles the special
case of entering the single-user runlevel and providing a
login shell. Once that shell terminates, this restarts the
rc-sysinit job to re-enter the default runlevel.</p>

<p>Implementation of runlevels in Upstart The Upstart
init(8) daemon has no native concepts of runlevel, and
unlike the System V daemon, makes no attempt to keep track
of the cur- rent runlevel.</p>

<p>Instead a compatible implementation is provided by the
runlevel(8), telinit(8) and shutdown(8) tools supplied with
Upstart.</p>

<p>The telinit(8) and shutdown(8) tools are used by system
administrators to change the runlevel, thus they both
generate this runlevel event obtaining the value for the
PREVLEVEL environment variable from their own environment
(the RUNLEVEL variable) or the /var/run/utmp file.</p>

<p>Additionally they update the /var/run/utmp file with the
new runlevel, and append a log entry to the /var/log/wtmp
file.</p>

<p>The runlevel(8) tool may be used by system
administrators to obtain the current runlevel, this reads
the RUNLEVEL and PREVLEVEL variables from its own
environment or reads the current and previous runlevel from
/var/run/utmp.</p>

<p>The who(1) -r command may also be used to read the
current runlevel from /var/run/utmp.</p>

<p>This provides full compatibility with System V.</p>

<p>During the boot scripts, where the /var/run/utmp file
may not yet be writable, the RUNLEVEL and PREVLEVEL
environment variables will be available so telinit(8) will
still provide the correct values.</p>

<p>Once the boot scripts have finished, while the
environment variables may no longer be available, the
/var/run/utmp file will be and the most recent telinit(8)
invocation should have successfully written to it.</p>

<p>Boot time records The telinit(8) tool also takes care of
writing the boot time record to both /var/run/utmp and
/var/log/wtmp.</p>

<p>This is written if the previous runlevel in these files
does not match the previous runlevel obtained from its
environment. In general this occurs when switching from
runlevel S to the default runlevel, at which point the
/var/run/utmp and /var/log/wtmp files are both writable, and
the telinit(8) invocation to do the switch has RUNLEVEL=S in
its envi- ronment.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE A service running in the typical multi-user
runlevels might use:</p>

<p>start on runlevel [2345] stop on runlevel [!2345]</p>
