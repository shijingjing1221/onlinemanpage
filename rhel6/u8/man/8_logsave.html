<p>NAME logsave - save the output of a command in a
logfile</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS logsave [ -asv ] logfile cmd_prog [ ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The logsave program will execute cmd_prog
with the specified argu- ment(s), and save a copy of its
output to logfile. If the containing directory for logfile
does not exist, logsave will accumulate the out- put in
memory until it can be written out. A copy of the output
will also be written to standard output.</p>

<p>If cmd_prog is a single hyphen ( - ), then instead of
executing a pro- gram, logsave will take its input from
standard input and save it in logfile</p>

<p>logsave is useful for saving the output of initial boot
scripts until the /var partition is mounted, so the output
can be written to /var/log.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a This option will cause the output to be
appended to logfile, instead of replacing its current
contents.</p>

<p>-s This option will cause logsave to skip writing to the
log file text which is bracketed with a control-A (ASCII 001
or Start of Header) and control-B (ASCII 002 or Start of
Text). This allows progress bar information to be visible to
the user on the con- sole, while not being written to the
log file.</p>

<p>-v This option will make logsave to be more verbose in
its output to the user.</p>
