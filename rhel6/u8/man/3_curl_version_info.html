<p>curl_version_info(3) libcurl Manual
curl_version_info(3)</p>

<p>NAME curl_version_info - returns run-time libcurl
version info</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>curl_version_info_data *curl_version_info( CURLversion
type);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Returns a pointer to a filled in struct with
information about various run-time features in libcurl. type
should be set to the version of this functionality by the
time you write your program. This way, libcurl will always
return a proper struct that your program understands, while
programs in the future might get a different struct.
CURLVERSION_NOW will be the most recent one for the library
you have installed:</p>

<p>data = curl_version_info(CURLVERSION_NOW);</p>

<p>Applications should use this information to judge if
things are possi- ble to do or not, instead of using
compile-time checks, as dynamic/DLL libraries can be changed
independent of applications.</p>

<p>The curl_version_info_data struct looks like this</p>

<p>typedef struct { CURLversion age; /* see description
below */</p>

<p>/* when age is 0 or higher, the members below also
exist: */ const char *version; /* human readable string */
unsigned int version_num; /* numeric representation */ const
char *host; /* human readable string */ int features; /*
bitmask, see below */ char *ssl_version; /* human readable
string */ long ssl_version_num; /* not used, always zero */
const char *libz_version; /* human readable string */ const
char **protocols; /* list of protocols */</p>

<p>/* when age is 1 or higher, the members below also
exist: */ const char *ares; /* human readable string */ int
ares_num; /* number */</p>

<p>/* when age is 2 or higher, the member below also
exists: */ const char *libidn; /* human readable string
*/</p>

<p>/* when age is 3 or higher, the members below also
exist: */ int iconv_ver_num; /* _libiconv_version if iconv
support enabled */</p>

<p>const char *libssh_version; /* human readable string
*/</p>

<p>} curl_version_info_data;</p>

<p>age describes what the age of this struct is. The number
depends on how new the libcurl you re using is. You are
however guaranteed to get a struct that you have a matching
struct for in the header, as you tell libcurl your
&quot;age&quot; with the input argument.</p>

<p>version is just an ascii string for the libcurl
version.</p>

<p>version_num is a 24 bit number created like this: &lt;8
bits major number&gt; | &lt;8 bits minor number&gt; | &lt;8
bits patch number&gt;. Version 7.9.8 is therefore returned
as 0x070908.</p>

<p>host is an ascii string showing what host information
that this libcurl was built for. As discovered by a
configure script or set by the build environment.</p>

<p>features can have none, one or more bits set, and the
currently defined bits are:</p>

<p>CURL_VERSION_IPV6 supports IPv6</p>

<p>CURL_VERSION_KERBEROS4 supports kerberos4 (when using
FTP)</p>

<p>CURL_VERSION_SSL supports SSL (HTTPS/FTPS) (Added in
7.10)</p>

<p>CURL_VERSION_LIBZ supports HTTP deflate using libz
(Added in 7.10)</p>

<p>CURL_VERSION_NTLM supports HTTP NTLM (added in
7.10.6)</p>

<p>CURL_VERSION_GSSNEGOTIATE supports HTTP GSS-Negotiate
(added in 7.10.6)</p>

<p>CURL_VERSION_DEBUG libcurl was built with debug
capabilities (added in 7.10.6)</p>

<p>CURL_VERSION_CURLDEBUG libcurl was built with memory
tracking debug capabili- ties. This is mainly of interest
for libcurl hackers. (added in 7.19.6)</p>

<p>CURL_VERSION_ASYNCHDNS libcurl was built with support
for asynchronous name lookups, which allows more exact
timeouts (even on Win- dows) and less blocking when using
the multi interface. (added in 7.10.7)</p>

<p>CURL_VERSION_SPNEGO libcurl was built with support for
SPNEGO authentication (Simple and Protected GSS-API
Negotiation Mechanism, defined in RFC 2478.) (added in
7.10.8)</p>

<p>CURL_VERSION_LARGEFILE libcurl was built with support
for large files. (Added in 7.11.1)</p>

<p>CURL_VERSION_IDN libcurl was built with support for
IDNA, domain names with international letters. (Added in
7.12.0)</p>

<p>CURL_VERSION_SSPI libcurl was built with support for
SSPI. This is only available on Windows and makes libcurl
use Windows-pro- vided functions for NTLM authentication. It
also allows libcurl to use the current user and the current
users password without the app having to pass them on.
(Added in 7.13.2)</p>

<p>CURL_VERSION_CONV libcurl was built with support for
character conversions, as provided by the CURLOPT_CONV_*
callbacks. (Added in 7.15.4) ssl_version is an ASCII string
for the OpenSSL version used. If libcurl has no SSL support,
this is NULL.</p>

<p>ssl_version_num is the numerical OpenSSL version value
as defined by the OpenSSL project. If libcurl has no SSL
support, this is 0.</p>

<p>libz_version is an ASCII string (there is no numerical
version). If libcurl has no libz support, this is NULL.</p>

<p>protocols is a pointer to an array of char * pointers,
containing the names protocols that libcurl supports (using
lowercase letters). The protocol names are the same as would
be used in URLs. The array is ter- minated by a NULL
entry.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE A pointer to a curl_version_info_data
struct.</p>
