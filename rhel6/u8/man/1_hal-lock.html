<p>NAME hal-lock - lock an interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS hal-lock [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION hal-lock can be used to acquire a lock on a
given interface either on a given device or globally. For
more information about both the big pic- ture and the
semantics of HAL locks, refer to the HAL spec which can be
found in /usr/share/doc/hal-0.5.14/spec/hal-spec.html
depending on the distribution.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>--interface The name of the interface to lock.</p>

<p>--run Program to run if the lock was acquired.</p>

<p>--udi The UDI (Unique Device Identifier) of the device
object. If this is ommitted, the global lock will be
tried.</p>

<p>--exclusive Whether the lock can be held by others.</p>

<p>--exit-with-lock Kill the program if the acquired lock
is lost. This only makes sense if you pass a specific UDI
due to the semantics of HAL locks.</p>

<p>--exit-with-dev Kill the program if the device is
removed. This only makes sense if you pass a specific UDI
due to the semantics of HAL locks.</p>

<p>--help Print out usage.</p>

<p>--version Print the version.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE This program will attempt to grab a lock on
a given interface. Unless, a specific UDI is given, the
global lock will be tried. If the lock was succesfully
acquired the program specified by the option --run will be
run and upon termination this program will exit with exit
code 0. If the lock wasn t acquired or an error occured
while taking the lock, this program will exit with a
non-zero exit code and the given program will not be
run.</p>

<p>NOTES This program is only useful for launching software
that doesnt use HAL at all (since such software launched
using hal-lock would be locked out itself); for example a
partition table editor part-foo may use wrapper script like
this</p>

<p>hal-lock --interface org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.Storage
--exclusive --run /path/to/part-foo-program</p>

<p>BUGS Please send bug reports to either the distribution
or the HAL mailing list, see
http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/hal on how to
subscribe.</p>
