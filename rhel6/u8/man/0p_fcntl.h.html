<p>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;(0P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
&lt;fcntl.h&gt;(0P)</p>

<p>NAME fcntl.h - file control options</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &lt;fcntl.h&gt; header shall define the
following requests and arguments for use by the functions
fcntl() and open().</p>

<p>Values for cmd used by fcntl() (the following values are
unique) are as follows:</p>

<p>F_DUPFD Duplicate file descriptor.</p>

<p>F_GETFD Get file descriptor flags.</p>

<p>F_SETFD Set file descriptor flags.</p>

<p>F_GETFL Get file status flags and file access modes.</p>

<p>F_SETFL Set file status flags.</p>

<p>F_GETLK Get record locking information.</p>

<p>F_SETLK Set record locking information.</p>

<p>F_SETLKW Set record locking information; wait if
blocked.</p>

<p>F_GETOWN Get process or process group ID to receive
SIGURG signals.</p>

<p>F_SETOWN Set process or process group ID to receive
SIGURG signals.</p>

<p>File descriptor flags used for fcntl() are as
follows:</p>

<p>FD_CLOEXEC Close the file descriptor upon execution of
an exec family func- tion.</p>

<p>Values for l_type used for record locking with fcntl()
(the following values are unique) are as follows:</p>

<p>F_RDLCK Shared or read lock.</p>

<p>F_UNLCK Unlock.</p>

<p>F_WRLCK Exclusive or write lock.</p>

<p>The values used for l_whence, SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, and
SEEK_END shall be defined as described in &lt;unistd.h&gt;
.</p>

<p>The following values are file creation flags and are
used in the oflag value to open(). They shall be
bitwise-distinct.</p>

<p>O_CREAT Create file if it does not exist.</p>

<p>O_EXCL Exclusive use flag.</p>

<p>O_NOCTTY Do not assign controlling terminal.</p>

<p>O_TRUNC Truncate flag.</p>

<p>File status flags used for open() and fcntl() are as
follows:</p>

<p>O_APPEND Set append mode.</p>

<p>O_DSYNC Write according to synchronized I/O data
integrity completion.</p>

<p>O_NONBLOCK Non-blocking mode.</p>

<p>O_RSYNC Synchronized read I/O operations.</p>

<p>O_SYNC Write according to synchronized I/O file
integrity completion.</p>

<p>Mask for use with file access modes is as follows:</p>

<p>O_ACCMODE Mask for file access modes.</p>

<p>File access modes used for open() and fcntl() are as
follows:</p>

<p>O_RDONLY Open for reading only.</p>

<p>O_RDWR Open for reading and writing.</p>

<p>O_WRONLY Open for writing only.</p>

<p>The symbolic names for file modes for use as values of
mode_t shall be defined as described in &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
.</p>

<p>Values for advice used by posix_fadvise() are as
follows:</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_NORMAL</p>

<p>The application has no advice to give on its behavior
with respect to the specified data. It is the default
characteristic if no advice is given for an open file.</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL</p>

<p>The application expects to access the specified data
sequentially from lower offsets to higher offsets.</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_RANDOM</p>

<p>The application expects to access the specified data in
a random order.</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED</p>

<p>The application expects to access the specified data in
the near future.</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED</p>

<p>The application expects that it will not access the
specified data in the near future.</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE</p>

<p>The application expects to access the specified data
once and then not reuse it thereafter.</p>

<p>The structure flock describes a file lock. It shall
include the follow- ing members:</p>

<p>short l_type Type of lock; F_RDLCK, F_WRLCK, F_UNLCK.
short l_whence Flag for starting offset. off_t l_start
Relative offset in bytes. off_t l_len Size; if 0 then until
EOF. pid_t l_pid Process ID of the process holding the lock;
returned with F_GETLK.</p>

<p>The mode_t, off_t, and pid_t types shall be defined as
described in &lt;sys/types.h&gt; .</p>

<p>The following shall be declared as functions and may
also be defined as macros. Function prototypes shall be
provided.</p>

<p>int creat(const char *, mode_t); int fcntl(int, int,
...); int open(const char *, int, ...);</p>

<p>int posix_fadvise(int, off_t, size_t, int); int
posix_fallocate(int, off_t, size_t);</p>

<p>Inclusion of the &lt;fcntl.h&gt; header may also make
visible all symbols from &lt;sys/stat.h&gt; and
&lt;unistd.h&gt;.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
