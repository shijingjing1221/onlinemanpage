<p>TRACEPATH(8) System Manager s Manual: iputils
TRACEPATH(8)</p>

<p>NAME tracepath, tracepath6 - traces path to a network
host discovering MTU along this path</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tracepath [ -n] [ -l pktlen] destination [
port]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION It traces path to destination discovering
MTU along this path. It uses UDP port port or some random
port. It is similar to traceroute, only does not not require
superuser privileges and has no fancy options.</p>

<p>tracepath6 is good replacement for traceroute6 and
classic example of application of Linux error queues. The
situation with tracepath is worse, because commercial IP
routers do not return enough information in icmp error
messages. Probably, it will change, when they will be
updated. For now it uses Van Jacobsons trick, sweeping a
range of UDP ports to maintain trace history.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -n Do not look up host names. Only print IP
addresses numerically.</p>

<p>-l Sets the initial packet length to pktlen instead of
65536 for tracepath or 128000 for tracepath6.</p>

<p>OUTPUT root@mops:~ # tracepath6 3ffe:2400:0:109::2 1?:
[LOCALHOST] pmtu 1500 1: dust.inr.ac.ru 0.411ms 2:
dust.inr.ac.ru asymm 1 0.390ms pmtu 1480 2:
3ffe:2400:0:109::2 463.514ms reached Resume: pmtu 1480 hops
2 back 2</p>

<p>The first column shows TTL of the probe, followed by
colon. Usually value of TTL is obtained from reply from
network, but sometimes reply does not contain necessary
information and we have to guess it. In this case the number
is followed by ?.</p>

<p>The second column shows the network hop, which replied
to the probe. It is either address of router or word
[LOCALHOST], if the probe was not sent to the network.</p>

<p>The rest of line shows miscellaneous information about
path to the cor- respinding hetwork hop. As rule it contains
value of RTT. Addition- ally, it can show Path MTU, when it
changes. If the path is asymmetric or the probe finishes
before it reach prescribed hop, difference between number of
hops in forward and backward direction is shown fol- loing
keyword async. This information is not reliable. F.e. the
third line shows asymmetry of 1, it is because the first
probe with TTL of 2 was rejected at the first hop due to
Path MTU Discovery.</p>

<p>The last line summarizes information about all the path
to the destina- tion, it shows detected Path MTU, amount of
hops to the destination and our guess about amount of hops
from the destination to us, which can be different when the
path is asymmetric.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO traceroute(8), traceroute6(8), ping(8).</p>

<p>AUTHOR tracepath was written by Alexey Kuznetsov
&lt;kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru&gt;.</p>

<p>SECURITY No security issues.</p>

<p>This lapidary deserves to be elaborated. tracepath is
not a privileged program, unlike traceroute, ping and other
beasts of this kind. tra- cepath may be executed by everyone
who has some access to network, enough to send UDP datagrams
to investigated destination using given port.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY tracepath is part of iputils package and
the latest versions are available in source form at
http://www.skbuff.net/iputils/iputils-cur- rent.tar.bz2.</p>
