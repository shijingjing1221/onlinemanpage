<p>QALTER(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual QALTER(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME qalter - alter batch job</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS qalter [-a date_time][-A account_string][-c
interval][-e path_name] [-h hold_list][-j join_list][-k
keep_list][-l resource_list] [-m mail_options][-M
mail_list][-N name][-o path_name] [-p priority][-r y|n][-S
path_name_list][-u user_list] job_identifier ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The attributes of a batch job are altered by
a request to the batch server that manages the batch job.
The qalter utility is a user-acces- sible batch client that
requests the alteration of the attributes of one or more
batch jobs.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall alter the attributes of those
batch jobs, and only those batch jobs, for which a batch
job_identifier is presented to the utility.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall alter the attributes of batch
jobs in the order in which the batch job_identifiers are
presented to the utility.</p>

<p>If the qalter utility fails to process a batch
job_identifier success- fully, the utility shall proceed to
process the remaining batch job_identifiers, if any.</p>

<p>For each batch job_identifier for which the qalter
utility succeeds, each attribute of the identified batch job
shall be altered as indi- cated by all the options presented
to the utility.</p>

<p>For each identified batch job for which the qalter
utility fails, the utility shall not alter any attribute of
the batch job.</p>

<p>For each batch job that the qalter utility processes,
the utility shall not modify any attribute other than those
required by the options and option-arguments presented to
the utility.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall alter batch jobs by sending a
Modify Job Request to the batch server that manages each
batch job. At the time the qalter utility exits, it shall
have modified the batch job corre- sponding to each
successfully processed batch job_identifier. An attempt to
alter the attributes of a batch job in the RUNNING state is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The qalter utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported by the
implementation:</p>

<p>-a date_time Redefine the time at which the batch job
becomes eligible for execution.</p>

<p>The date_time argument shall be in the same form and
represent the same time as for the touch utility. The time
so represented shall be set into the Execution_Time
attribute of the batch job. If the time speci- fied is
earlier than the current time, the -a option shall have no
effect.</p>

<p>-A account_string</p>

<p>Redefine the account to which the resource consumption
of the batch job should be charged.</p>

<p>The syntax of the account_string option-argument is
unspecified.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall set the Account_Name attribute
of the batch job to the value of the account_string
option-argument.</p>

<p>-c interval Redefine whether the batch job should be
checkpointed, and if so, how often.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall accept a value for the interval
option-argu- ment that is one of the following:</p>

<p>n No checkpointing is to be performed on the batch job
(NO_CHECK- POINT).</p>

<p>s Checkpointing is to be performed only when the batch
server is shut down (CHECKPOINT_AT_SHUTDOWN).</p>

<p>c Automatic periodic checkpointing is to be performed at
the Mini- mum_Cpu_Interval attribute of the batch queue, in
units of CPU minutes (CHECKPOINT_AT_MIN_CPU_INTERVAL).</p>

<p>c=minutes Automatic periodic checkpointing is to be
performed every min- utes of CPU time, or every
Minimum_Cpu_Interval minutes, whichever is greater. The
minutes argument shall conform to the syntax for unsigned
integers and shall be greater than zero.</p>

<p>An implementation may define other checkpoint intervals.
The confor- mance document for an implementation shall
describe any alternative checkpoint intervals, how they are
specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect the
behavior of the utility.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall set the Checkpoint attribute of
the batch job to the value of the interval
option-argument.</p>

<p>-e path_name Redefine the path to be used for the
standard error stream of the batch job.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall accept a path_name
option-argument that con- forms to the syntax of the
path_name element defined in the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, which can be preceded by a host name
element of the form hostname:.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument constitutes an absolute
pathname, the qalter utility shall set the Error_Path
attribute of the batch job to the value of the path_name
option-argument, including the host name element, if
present.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument constitutes a relative
pathname and no host name element is specified, the qalter
utility shall set the Error_Path attribute of the batch job
to the value of the absolute pathname derived by expanding
the path_name option-argument relative to the current
directory of the process that executes the qalter
utility.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument constitutes a relative
pathname and a host name element is specified, the qalter
utility shall set the Error_Path attribute of the batch job
to the value of the option-argu- ment without expansion.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument does not include a host
name element, the qalter utility shall prefix the pathname
in the Error_Path attribute with hostname:, where hostname
is the name of the host upon which the qalter utility is
being executed.</p>

<p>-h hold_list Redefine the types of holds, if any, on the
batch job. The qal- ter -h option shall accept a value for
the hold_list option- argument that is a string of
alphanumeric characters in the portable character set.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall accept a value for the
hold_list option-argu- ment that is a string of one or more
of the characters , s , or , or the single charactern. For
each unique character in the hold_list option-argument, the
qalter utility shall add a value to the Hold_Types attribute
of the batch job as follows, each representing a different
hold type:</p>

<p>u USER</p>

<p>s SYSTEM</p>

<p>o OPERATOR</p>

<p>If any of these characters are duplicated in the
hold_list option-argu- ment, the duplicates shall be
ignored. An existing Hold_Types attribute can be cleared by
the hold type:</p>

<p>n NO_HOLD</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall consider it an error if any
hold type other than nis combined with hold typen . Strictly
conforming applica- tions shall not repeat any of the
characters , , , or n within the hold_list option-argument.
The qalter utility shall permit the repetition of
characters, but shall not assign additional meaning to the
repeated characters. An implementation may define other hold
types. The conformance document for an implementation shall
describe any additional hold types, how they are specified,
their internal behavior, and how they affect the behavior of
the utility.</p>

<p>-j join_list Redefine which streams of the batch job are
to be merged. The qalter -j option shall accept a value for
the join_list option- argument that is a string of
alphanumeric characters in the portable character set.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall accept a join_list
option-argument that con- sists of one or more of the
characterseand, or the single char- actern.</p>

<p>All of the other batch job output streams specified
shall be merged into the output stream represented by the
character listed first in the join_list option-argument.</p>

<p>For each unique character in the join_list
option-argument, the qalter utility shall add a value to the
Join_Path attribute of the batch job as follows, each
representing a different batch job stream to join:</p>

<p>e The standard error of the batch job
(JOIN_STD_ERROR).</p>

<p>o The standard output of the batch job
(JOIN_STD_OUTPUT).</p>

<p>An existing Join_Path attribute can be cleared by the
join type:</p>

<p>n NO_JOIN</p>

<p>Ifnis specified, then no files are joined. The qalter
utility shall consider it an error if any join type other
thannis combined with join typen.</p>

<p>Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of
the characters e , , ornwithin the join_list
option-argument. The qalter util- ity shall permit the
repetition of characters, but shall not assign additional
meaning to the repeated characters.</p>

<p>An implementation may define other join types. The
conformance document for an implementation shall describe
any additional batch job streams, how they are specified,
their internal behavior, and how they affect the behavior of
the utility.</p>

<p>-k keep_list Redefine which output of the batch job to
retain on the execu- tion host.</p>

<p>The qalter -k option shall accept a value for the
keep_list option- argument that is a string of alphanumeric
characters in the portable character set.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall accept a keep_list
option-argument that con- sists of one or more of the
characterseand, or the single char- actern.</p>

<p>For each unique character in the keep_list
option-argument, the qalter utility shall add a value to the
Keep_Files attribute of the batch job as follows, each
representing a different batch job stream to keep:</p>

<p>e The standard error of the batch job
(KEEP_STD_ERROR).</p>

<p>o The standard output of the batch job
(KEEP_STD_OUTPUT).</p>

<p>If botheand o are specified, then both files are
retained. An existing Keep_Files attribute can be cleared by
the keep type:</p>

<p>n NO_KEEP</p>

<p>If n is specified, then no files are retained. The
qalter utility shall consider it an error if any keep type
other thannis combined with keep typen.</p>

<p>Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of
the characters e , , ornwithin the keep_list
option-argument. The qalter util- ity shall permit the
repetition of characters, but shall not assign additional
meaning to the repeated characters. An implementation may
define other keep types. The conformance document for an
implementation shall describe any additional keep types, how
they are specified, their internal behavior, and how they
affect the behavior of the utility.</p>

<p>-l resource_list</p>

<p>Redefine the resources that are allowed or required by
the batch job.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall accept a resource_list
option-argument that conforms to the following syntax:</p>

<p>resource=value[,,resource=value,,...]</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall set one entry in the value of
the Resource_List attribute of the batch job for each
resource listed in the resource_list option-argument.</p>

<p>Because the list of supported resource names might vary
by batch server, the qalter utility shall rely on the batch
server to validate the resource names and associated values.
See Multiple Keyword-Value Pairs for a means of removing
keyword= value (and value@ keyword) pairs and other general
rules for list-oriented batch job attributes.</p>

<p>-m mail_options</p>

<p>Redefine the points in the execution of the batch job at
which the batch server is to send mail about a change in the
state of the batch job.</p>

<p>The qalter -m option shall accept a value for the
mail_options option- argument that is a string of
alphanumeric characters in the portable character set.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall accept a value for the
mail_options option- argument that is a string of one or
more of the characters , , and, or the single charactern.
For each unique character in the mail_options
option-argument, the qalter utility shall add a value to the
Mail_Users attribute of the batch job as follows, each
representing a different time during the life of a batch job
at which to send mail:</p>

<p>e MAIL_AT_EXIT</p>

<p>b MAIL_AT_BEGINNING</p>

<p>a MAIL_AT_ABORT</p>

<p>If any of these characters are duplicated in the
mail_options option- argument, the duplicates shall be
ignored.</p>

<p>An existing Mail_Points attribute can be cleared by the
mail type:</p>

<p>n NO_MAIL</p>

<p>If n is specified, then mail is not sent. The qalter
utility shall consider it an error if any mail type other
thannis combined with mail type n. Strictly conforming
applications shall not repeat any of the characters,,,
ornwithin the mail_options option- argument. The qalter
utility shall permit the repetition of characters but shall
not assign additional meaning to the repeated
characters.</p>

<p>An implementation may define other mail types. The
conformance document for an implementation shall describe
any additional mail types, how they are specified, their
internal behavior, and how they affect the behavior of the
utility.</p>

<p>-M mail_list Redefine the list of users to which the
batch server that exe- cutes the batch job is to send mail,
if the batch server sends mail about the batch job.</p>

<p>The syntax of the mail_list option-argument is
unspecified. If the implementation of the qalter utility
uses a name service to locate users, the utility shall
accept the syntax used by the name service.</p>

<p>If the implementation of the qalter utility does not use
a name service to locate users, the implementation shall
accept the following syntax for user names:</p>

<p>mail_address[,,mail_address,,...]</p>

<p>The interpretation of mail_address is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall set the Mail_Users attribute of
the batch job to the value of the mail_list
option-argument.</p>

<p>-N name Redefine the name of the batch job.</p>

<p>The qalter -N option shall accept a value for the name
option-argument that is a string of up to 15 alphanumeric
characters in the portable character set where the first
character is alphabetic.</p>

<p>The syntax of the name option-argument is
unspecified.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall set the Job_Name attribute of
the batch job to the value of the name option-argument.</p>

<p>-o path_name Redefine the path for the standard output
of the batch job.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall accept a path_name
option-argument that con- forms to the syntax of the
path_name element defined in the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, which can be preceded by a host name
element of the form hostname:.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument constitutes an absolute
pathname, the qalter utility shall set the Output_Path
attribute of the batch job to the value of the path_name
option-argument.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument constitutes a relative
pathname and no host name element is specified, the qalter
utility shall set the Out- put_Path attribute of the batch
job to the absolute pathname derived by expanding the
path_name option-argument relative to the current direc-
tory of the process that executes the qalter utility.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument constitutes a relative
pathname and a host name element is specified, the qalter
utility shall set the Output_Path attribute of the batch job
to the value of the path_name option-argument without any
expansion of the pathname.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument does not include a host
name element, the qalter utility shall prefix the pathname
in the Output_Path attribute with hostname:, where hostname
is the name of the host upon which the qalter utility is
being executed.</p>

<p>-p priority Redefine the priority of the batch job.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall accept a value for the priority
option-argu- ment that conforms to the syntax for signed
decimal integers, and which is not less than -1024 and not
greater than 1023.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall set the Priority attribute of
the batch job to the value of the priority
option-argument.</p>

<p>-r y|n Redefine whether the batch job is rerunnable.</p>

<p>If the value of the option-argument is, the qalter
utility shall set the Rerunable attribute of the batch job
to TRUE.</p>

<p>If the value of the option-argument is n , the qalter
utility shall set the Rerunable attribute of the batch job
to FALSE.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall consider it an error if any
character other thanyornis specified in the
option-argument.</p>

<p>-S path_name_list</p>

<p>Redefine the shell that interprets the script at the
destination system.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall accept a path_name_list
option-argument that conforms to the following syntax:</p>

<p>pathname[@host][,pathname[@host],...]</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall accept only one pathname that
is missing a corresponding host name. The qalter utility
shall allow only one path- name per named host.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall add a value to the
Shell_Path_List attribute of the batch job for each entry in
the path_name_list option-argument. See Multiple
Keyword-Value Pairs for a means of removing keyword= value
(and value@ keyword) pairs and other general rules for
list-oriented batch job attributes.</p>

<p>-u user_list Redefine the user name under which the
batch job is to run at the destination system.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall accept a user_list
option-argument that con- forms to the following syntax:</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall accept only one user name that
is missing a corresponding host name. The qalter utility
shall accept only one user name per named host.</p>

<p>The qalter utility shall add a value to the User_List
attribute of the batch job for each entry in the user_list
option-argument. See Multiple Keyword-Value Pairs for a
means of removing keyword= value (and value@ keyword) pairs
and other general rules for list-oriented batch job
attributes.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The qalter utility shall accept one or more
operands that conform to the syntax for a batch
job_identifier (see Batch Job Identifier ).</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of qal- ter:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>LOGNAME Determine the login name of the user.</p>

<p>TZ Determine the timezone used to interpret the
date-time option- argument. If TZ is unset or null, an
unspecified default time- zone shall be used.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT None.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS In addition to the default
behavior, the qalter utility shall not be required to write
a diagnostic message to standard error when the error reply
received from a batch server indicates that the batch
job_identi- fier does not exist on the server. Whether or
not the qalter utility attempts to locate the batch job on
other batch servers is implementa- tion-defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The qalter utility allows users to change the
attributes of a batch job.</p>

<p>As a means of altering a queued job, the qalter utility
is superior to deleting and requeuing the batch job insofar
as an altered job retains its place in the queue with some
traditional selection algorithms. In addition, the qalter
utility is both shorter and simpler than a sequence of qdel
and qsub utilities.</p>

<p>The result of an attempt on the part of a user to alter
a batch job in a RUNNING state is implementation-defined
because a batch job in the RUNNING state will already have
opened its output files and otherwise performed any actions
indicated by the options in effect at the time the batch job
began execution.</p>

<p>The options processed by the qalter utility are
identical to those of the qsub utility, with a few
exceptions: -V, -v, and -q. The -V and -v are inappropriate
for the qalter utility, since they capture poten- tially
transient environment information from the submitting
process. The -q option would specify a new queue, which
would largely negate the previously stated advantage of
using qalter; furthermore, the qmove utility provides a
superior means of moving jobs.</p>

<p>Each of the following paragraphs provides the rationale
for a qalter option.</p>

<p>Additional rationale concerning these options can be
found in the rationale for the qsub utility.</p>

<p>The -a option allows users to alter the date and time at
which a batch job becomes eligible to run.</p>

<p>The -A option allows users to change the account that
will be charged for the resources consumed by the batch job.
Support for the -A option is mandatory for conforming
implementations of qalter, even though sup- port of
accounting is optional for servers. Whether or not to
support accounting is left to the implementor of the server,
but mandatory sup- port of the -A option assures users of a
consistent interface and allows them to control accounting
on servers that support accounting.</p>

<p>The -c option allows users to alter the checkpointing
interval of a batch job. A checkpointing system, which is
not defined by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, allows recovery of a
batch job at the most recent checkpoint in the event of a
crash. Checkpointing is typically used for jobs that consume
expensive computing time or must meet a critical schedule.
Users should be allowed to make the tradeoff between the
overhead of checkpointing and the risk to the timely
completion of the batch job; therefore, this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 provides the checkpointing interval option.
Support for checkpointing is optional for servers.</p>

<p>The -e option allows users to alter the name and
location of the stan- dard error stream written by a batch
job. However, the path of the standard error stream is
meaningless if the value of the Join_Path attribute of the
batch job is TRUE.</p>

<p>The -h option allows users to set the hold type in the
Hold_Types attribute of a batch job. The qhold and qrls
utilities add or remove hold types to the Hold_Types
attribute, respectively. The -h option has been modified to
allow for implementation-defined hold types.</p>

<p>The -j option allows users to alter the decision to join
(merge) the standard error stream of the batch job with the
standard output stream of the batch job.</p>

<p>The -l option allows users to change the resource limits
imposed on a batch job.</p>

<p>The -m option allows users to modify the list of points
in the life of a batch job at which the designated users
will receive mail notifica- tion.</p>

<p>The -M option allows users to alter the list of users
who will receive notification about events in the life of a
batch job.</p>

<p>The -N option allows users to change the name of a batch
job.</p>

<p>The -o option allows users to alter the name and path to
which the standard output stream of the batch job will be
written.</p>

<p>The -P option allows users to modify the priority of a
batch job. Sup- port for priority is optional for batch
servers.</p>

<p>The -r option allows users to alter the rerunability
status of a batch job.</p>

<p>The -S option allows users to change the name and
location of the shell image that will be invoked to
interpret the script of the batch job. This option has been
modified to allow a list of shell name and loca- tions
associated with different hosts.</p>

<p>The -u option allows users to change the user identifier
under which the batch job will execute.</p>

<p>The job_identifier operand syntax is provided so that
the user can dif- ferentiate between the originating and
destination (or executing) batch server. These may or may
not be the same. The . server_name portion identifies the
originating batch server, while the @ server portion
identifies the destination batch server.</p>

<p>Historically, the qalter utility has been a component of
the Network Queuing System (NQS), the existing practice from
which this utility has been derived.</p>
