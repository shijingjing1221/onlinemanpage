<p>PROCMAILRC(5) PROCMAILRC(5)</p>

<p>NAME procmailrc - procmail rcfile</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $HOME/.procmailrc</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For a quick start, see NOTES at the end of
the procmail(1) man page.</p>

<p>The rcfile can contain a mixture of environment variable
assignments (some of which have special meanings to
procmail), and recipes. In their most simple appearance, the
recipes are simply one line regular expressions that are
searched for in the header of the arriving mail. The first
recipe that matches is used to determine where the mail has
to go (usually a file). If processing falls off the end of
the rcfile, procmail will deliver the mail to $DEFAULT.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of recipes: delivering and
non-delivering recipes. If a delivering recipe is found to
match, procmail considers the mail (you guessed it)
delivered and will cease processing the rcfile after having
successfully executed the action line of the recipe. If a
non- delivering recipe is found to match, processing of the
rcfile will con- tinue after the action line of this recipe
has been executed.</p>

<p>Delivering recipes are those that cause header and/or
body of the mail to be: written into a file, absorbed by a
program or forwarded to a mailaddress.</p>

<p>Non-delivering recipes are: those that cause the output
of a program or filter to be captured back by procmail or
those that start a nesting block.</p>

<p>You can tell procmail to treat a delivering recipe as if
it were a non- delivering recipe by specifying the c flag on
such a recipe. This will make procmail generate a carbon
copy of the mail by delivering it to this recipe, yet
continue processing the rcfile.</p>

<p>By using any number of recipes you can presort your mail
extremely straightforward into several mailfolders. Bear in
mind though that the mail can arrive concurrently in these
mailfolders (if several procmail programs happen to run at
the same time, not unlikely if a lot of mail arrives). To
make sure this does not result in a mess, proper use of
lockfiles is highly recommended.</p>

<p>The environment variable assignments and recipes can be
freely inter- mixed in the rcfile. If any environment
variable has a special meaning to procmail, it will be used
appropriately the moment it is parsed (i.e., you can change
the current directory whenever you want by speci- fying a
new MAILDIR, switch lockfiles by specifying a new LOCKFILE,
change the umask at any time, etc., the possibilities are
endless :-).</p>

<p>The assignments and substitutions of these environment
variables are handled exactly like in sh(1) (that includes
all possible quotes and escapes), with the added bonus that
blanks around the = sign are ignored and that, if an
environment variable appears without a trailing =, it will
be removed from the environment. Any program in back- quotes
started by procmail will have the entire mail at its
stdin.</p>

<p>Comments A word beginning with # and all the following
characters up to a NEW- LINE are ignored. This does not
apply to condition lines, which cannot be commented.</p>

<p>Recipes A line starting with : marks the beginning of a
recipe. It has the following format:</p>

<p>:0 [flags] [ : [locallockfile] ] &lt;zero or more
conditions (one per line)&gt; &lt;exactly one action
line&gt;</p>

<p>Conditions start with a leading *, everything after that
character is passed on to the internal egrep literally,
except for leading and trailing whitespace. These regular
expressions are completely compati- ble to the normal
egrep(1) extended regular expressions. See also Extended
regular expressions.</p>

<p>Conditions are anded; if there are no conditions the
result will be true by default.</p>

<p>Flags can be any of the following:</p>

<p>H Egrep the header (default).</p>

<p>B Egrep the body.</p>

<p>D Tell the internal egrep to distinguish between upper
and lower case (contrary to the default which is to ignore
case).</p>

<p>A This recipe will not be executed unless the conditions
on the last preceding recipe (on the current block-nesting
level) without the A or a flag matched as well. This allows
you to chain actions that depend on a common condition.</p>

<p>a Has the same meaning as the A flag, with the
additional condi- tion that the immediately preceding recipe
must have been success- fully completed before this recipe
is executed.</p>

<p>E This recipe only executes if the immediately preceding
recipe was not executed. Execution of this recipe also
disables any immedi- ately following recipes with the E
flag. This allows you to specify else if actions.</p>

<p>e This recipe only executes if the immediately preceding
recipe failed (i.e., the action line was attempted, but
resulted in an error).</p>

<p>h Feed the header to the pipe, file or mail destination
(default).</p>

<p>b Feed the body to the pipe, file or mail destination
(default).</p>

<p>f Consider the pipe as a filter.</p>

<p>c Generate a carbon copy of this mail. This only makes
sense on delivering recipes. The only non-delivering recipe
this flag has an effect on is on a nesting block, in order
to generate a carbon copy this will clone the running
procmail process (lockfiles will not be inherited), whereby
the clone will proceed as usual and the parent will jump
across the block.</p>

<p>w Wait for the filter or program to finish and check its
exitcode (normally ignored); if the filter is unsuccessful,
then the text will not have been filtered.</p>

<p>W Has the same meaning as the w flag, but will suppress
any Pro- gram failure message.</p>

<p>i Ignore any write errors on this recipe (i.e., usually
due to an early closed pipe).</p>

<p>r Raw mode, do not try to ensure the mail ends with an
empty line, write it out as is.</p>

<p>There are some special conditions you can use that are
not straight regular expressions. To select them, the
condition must start with:</p>

<p>! Invert the condition.</p>

<p>$ Evaluate the remainder of this condition according to
sh(1) sub- stitution rules inside double quotes, skip
leading whitespace, then reparse it.</p>

<p>? Use the exitcode of the specified program.</p>

<p>&lt; Check if the total length of the mail is shorter
than the speci- fied (in decimal) number of bytes.</p>

<p>&gt; Analogous to &lt;.</p>

<p>variablename ?? Match the remainder of this condition
against the value of this environment variable (which cannot
be a pseudo variable). A spe- cial case is if variablename
is equal to B, H, HB or BH; this merely overrides the
default header/body search area defined by the initial flags
on this recipe.</p>

<p>To quote any of the above at the start of the line.</p>

<p>Local lockfile If you put a second (trailing) : on the
first recipe line, then proc- mail will use a locallockfile
(for this recipe only). You can option- ally specify the
locallockfile to use; if you don t however, procmail will
use the destination filename (or the filename following the
first &gt;&gt;) and will append $LOCKEXT to it.</p>

<p>Recipe action line The action line can start with the
following characters:</p>

<p>! Forwards to all the specified mail addresses.</p>

<p>| Starts the specified program, possibly in $SHELL if
any of the characters $SHELLMETAS are spotted. You can
optionally prepend this pipe symbol with variable=, which
will cause stdout of the program to be captured in the
environment variable (procmail will not terminate processing
the rcfile at this point). If you specify just this pipe
symbol, without any program, then proc- mail will pipe the
mail to stdout.</p>

<p>{ Followed by at least one space, tab or newline will
mark the start of a nesting block. Everything up till the
next closing brace will depend on the conditions specified
for this recipe. Unlimited nesting is permitted. The closing
brace exists merely to delimit the block, it will not cause
procmail to terminate in any way. If the end of a block is
reached processing will con- tinue as usual after the block.
On a nesting block, the flags H and B only affect the
conditions leading up to the block, the flags h and b have
no effect whatsoever.</p>

<p>Anything else will be taken as a mailbox name (either a
filename or a directory, absolute or relative to the current
directory (see MAILDIR)). If it is a (possibly yet
nonexistent) filename, the mail will be appended to it.</p>

<p>If it is a directory, the mail will be delivered to a
newly created, guaranteed to be unique file named
$MSGPREFIX* in the specified direc- tory. If the mailbox
name ends in &quot;/.&quot;, then this directory is pre-
sumed to be an MH folder; i.e., procmail will use the next
number it finds available. If the mailbox name ends in
&quot;/&quot;, then this directory is presumed to be a
maildir folder; i.e., procmail will deliver the message to a
file in a subdirectory named &quot;tmp&quot; and rename it
to be inside a subdirectory named &quot;new&quot;. If the
mailbox is specified to be an MH folder or maildir folder,
procmail will create the necessary directories if they dont
exist, rather than treat the mailbox as a non-existent
filename. When procmail is delivering to directories, you
can specify multiple directories to deliver to (procmail
will do so utilising hardlinks).</p>

<p>Environment variable defaults LOGNAME, HOME and SHELL
Your (the recipients) defaults</p>

<p>PATH $HOME/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin
:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin (Except during the processing
of an /etc/procmailrc file, when it will be set to
/bin:/usr/bin.)</p>

<p>SHELLMETAS &amp;|&lt;&gt;~;?*[</p>

<p>SHELLFLAGS -c</p>

<p>ORGMAIL /var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME (Unless -m has been
specified, in which case it is unset)</p>

<p>MAILDIR $HOME (Unless the name of the first successfully
opened rcfile starts with ./ or if -m has been speci- fied,
in which case it defaults to . )</p>

<p>DEFAULT $ORGMAIL</p>

<p>MSGPREFIX msg.</p>

<p>SENDMAIL /usr/sbin/sendmail</p>

<p>SENDMAILFLAGS -oi</p>

<p>HOST The current hostname</p>

<p>COMSAT no (If an rcfile is specified on the command
line)</p>

<p>PROCMAIL_VERSION 3.22</p>

<p>LOCKEXT .lock</p>

<p>Other cleared or preset environment variables are IFS,
ENV and PWD.</p>

<p>For security reasons, upon startup procmail will wipe
out all environ- ment variables that are suspected of
modifying the behavior of the run- time linker.</p>

<p>Environment Before you get lost in the multitude of
environment variables, keep in mind that all of them have
reasonable defaults.</p>

<p>MAILDIR Current directory while procmail is executing
(that means that all paths are relative to $MAILDIR).</p>

<p>DEFAULT Default mailbox file (if not told otherwise,
procmail will dump mail in this mailbox). Procmail will
automatically use $DEFAULT$LOCKEXT as lockfile prior to
writing to this mailbox. You do not need to set this
variable, since it already points to the standard system
mailbox.</p>

<p>LOGFILE This file will also contain any error or
diagnostic mes- sages from procmail (normally none :-) or
any other pro- grams started by procmail. If this file is
not specified, any diagnostics or error messages will be
mailed back to the sender. See also LOGABSTRACT.</p>

<p>VERBOSE You can turn on extended diagnostics by setting
this vari- able to yes or on, to turn it off again set it to
no or off.</p>

<p>LOGABSTRACT Just before procmail exits it logs an
abstract of the delivered message in $LOGFILE showing the
From and Sub- ject: fields of the header, what folder it
finally went to and how long (in bytes) the message was. By
setting this variable to no , generation of this abstract is
sup- pressed. If you set it to all , procmail will log an
abstract for every successful delivering recipe it pro-
cesses.</p>

<p>LOG Anything assigned to this variable will be appended
to $LOGFILE.</p>

<p>ORGMAIL Usually the system mailbox (ORiGinal MAILbox).
If, for some obscure reason (like filesystem full) the mail
could not be delivered, then this mailbox will be the last
resort. If procmail fails to save the mail in here (deep,
deep trouble :-), then the mail will bounce back to the
sender.</p>

<p>LOCKFILE Global semaphore file. If this file already
exists, proc- mail will wait until it has gone before
proceeding, and will create it itself (cleaning it up when
ready, of course). If more than one lockfile are specified,
then the previous one will be removed before trying to
create the new one. The use of a global lockfile is
discouraged, whenever possible use locallockfiles (on a per
recipe basis) instead.</p>

<p>LOCKEXT Default extension that is appended to a
destination file to determine what local lockfile to use
(only if turned on, on a per-recipe basis).</p>

<p>LOCKSLEEP Number of seconds procmail will sleep before
retrying on a lockfile (if it already existed); if not
specified, it defaults to 8 seconds.</p>

<p>LOCKTIMEOUT Number of seconds that have to have passed
since a lockfile was last modified/created before procmail
decides that this must be an erroneously leftover lockfile
that can be removed by force now. If zero, then no timeout
will be used and procmail will wait forever until the
lockfile is removed; if not specified, it defaults to 1024
seconds. This variable is useful to prevent indefinite
hangups of sendmail/procmail. Procmail is immune to clock
skew across machines.</p>

<p>TIMEOUT Number of seconds that have to have passed
before procmail decides that some child it started must be
hanging. The offending program will receive a TERMINATE
signal from procmail, and processing of the rcfile will
continue. If zero, then no timeout will be used and procmail
will wait forever until the child has terminated; if not
specified, it defaults to 960 seconds.</p>

<p>MSGPREFIX Filename prefix that is used when delivering
to a directory (not used when delivering to a maildir or an
MH directory).</p>

<p>HOST If this is not the hostname of the machine,
processing of the current rcfile will immediately cease. If
other rcfiles were specified on the command line, processing
will con- tinue with the next one. If all rcfiles are
exhausted, the program will terminate, but will not generate
an error (i.e., to the mailer it will seem that the mail has
been delivered).</p>

<p>UMASK The name says it all (if it doesnt, then forget
about this one :-). Anything assigned to UMASK is taken as
an octal number. If not specified, the umask defaults to
077. If the umask permits o+x, all the mailboxes procmail
delivers to directly will receive an o+x mode change. This
can be used to check if new mail arrived.</p>

<p>SHELLMETAS If any of the characters in SHELLMETAS
appears in the line specifying a filter or program, the line
will be fed to $SHELL instead of being executed
directly.</p>

<p>SHELLFLAGS Any invocation of $SHELL will be like:
&quot;$SHELL&quot; &quot;$SHELLFLAGS&quot;
&quot;$*&quot;;</p>

<p>SENDMAIL If youre not using the forwarding facility dont
worry about this one. It specifies the program being called
to forward any mail. It gets invoked as:
&quot;$SENDMAIL&quot; $SENDMAILFLAGS &quot;$@&quot;;</p>

<p>NORESRETRY Number of retries that are to be made if any
process table full, file table full, out of memory or out of
swap space error should occur. If this number is negative,
then procmail will retry indefinitely; if not specified, it
defaults to 4 times. The retries occur with a $SUSPEND
second interval. The idea behind this is that if, e.g., the
swap space has been exhausted or the process table is full,
usually several other programs will either detect this as
well and abort or crash 8-), thereby freeing valu- able
resources for procmail.</p>

<p>SUSPEND Number of seconds that procmail will pause if it
has to wait for something that is currently unavailable
(memory, fork, etc.); if not specified, it will default to
16 sec- onds. See also: LOCKSLEEP.</p>

<p>LINEBUF Length of the internal line buffers, cannot be
set smaller than 128. All lines read from the rcfile should
not exceed $LINEBUF characters before and after expansion.
If not specified, it defaults to 2048. This limit, of
course, does not apply to the mail itself, which can have
arbitrary line lengths, or could be a binary file for that
matter. See also PROCMAIL_OVERFLOW.</p>

<p>DELIVERED If set to yes procmail will pretend (to the
mail agent) the mail has been delivered. If mail cannot be
delivered after having met this assignment (set to yes), the
mail will be lost (i.e., it will not bounce).</p>

<p>TRAP When procmail terminates of its own accord and not
because it received a signal, it will execute the contents
of this variable. A copy of the mail can be read from stdin.
Any output produced by this command will be appended to
$LOG- FILE. Possible uses for TRAP are: removal of temporary
files, logging customised abstracts, etc. See also EXIT-
CODE and LOGABSTRACT.</p>

<p>EXITCODE By default, procmail returns an exitcode of
zero (success) if it successfully delivered the message or
if the HOST variable was misset and there were no more
rcfiles on the command line; otherwise it returns failure.
Before doing so, procmail examines the value of this
variable. If it is set to a positive numeric value, procmail
will instead use that value as its exitcode. If this
variable is set but empty and TRAP is set, procmail will set
the exitcode to whatever the TRAP program returns. If this
variable is not set, procmail will set it shortly before
calling up the TRAP program.</p>

<p>LASTFOLDER This variable is assigned to by procmail
whenever it is delivering to a folder or program. It always
contains the name of the last file (or program) procmail
delivered to. If the last delivery was to several directory
folders together then $LASTFOLDER will contain the
hardlinked file- names as a space separated list.</p>

<p>MATCH This variable is assigned to by procmail whenever
it is told to extract text from a matching regular
expression. It will contain all text matching the regular
expression past th/ token.</p>

<p>SHIFT Assigning a positive value to this variable has
the same effect as the shift command in sh(1). This command
is most useful to extract extra arguments passed to procmail
when acting as a generic mailfilter.</p>

<p>INCLUDERC Names an rcfile (relative to the current
directory) which will be included here as if it were part of
the current rcfile. Nesting is permitted and only limited by
systems resources (memory and file descriptors). As no
checking is done on the permissions or ownership of the
rcfile, users of INCLUDERC should make sure that only
trusted users have write access to the included rcfile or
the directory it is in. Command line assignments to
INCLUDERC have no effect.</p>

<p>SWITCHRC Names an rcfile (relative to the current
directory) to which processing will be switched. If the
named rcfile doesn t exist or is not a normal file or
/dev/null then an error will be logged and processing will
continue in the current rcfile. Otherwise, processing of the
current rcfile will be aborted and the named rcfile started.
Unsetting SWITCHRC aborts processing of the current rcfile
as if it had ended at the assignment. As with INCLUDERC, no
checking is done on the permissions or ownership of the
rcfile and command line assignments have no effect.</p>

<p>PROCMAIL_VERSION The version number of the running
procmail binary.</p>

<p>PROCMAIL_OVERFLOW This variable will be set to a
non-empty value if procmail detects a buffer overflow. See
the BUGS section below for other details of operation when
overflow occurs.</p>

<p>COMSAT Comsat(8)/biff(1) notification is on by default,
it can be turned off by setting this variable to no .
Alternatively the biff-service can be customised by setting
it to either service@, @hostname , or service@hostname .
When not specified it defaults to biff@localhost.</p>

<p>DROPPRIVS If set to yes procmail will drop all
privileges it might have had (suid or sgid). This is only
useful if you want to guarantee that the bottom half of the
/etc/procmailrc file is executed on behalf of the
recipient.</p>

<p>Extended regular expressions The following tokens are
known to both the procmail internal egrep and the standard
egrep(1) (beware that some egrep implementations include
other non-standard extensions):</p>

<p>^ Start of a line.</p>

<p>$ End of a line.</p>

<p>. Any character except a newline.</p>

<p>a* Any sequence of zero or more as.</p>

<p>a+ Any sequence of one or more as.</p>

<p>a? Either zero or one a.</p>

<p>[^-a-d] Any character which is not either a dash, a, b,
c, d or new- line.</p>

<p>de|abc Either the sequence de or abc.</p>

<p>(abc)* Zero or more times the sequence abc.</p>

<p>. Matches a single dot; use to quote any of the magic
charac- ters to get rid of their special meaning. See also $
vari- able substitution.</p>

<p>These were only samples, of course, any more complex
combination is valid as well.</p>

<p>The following token meanings are special procmail
extensions:</p>

<p>^ or $ Match a newline (for multiline matches).</p>

<p>^^ Anchor the expression at the very start of the search
area, or if encountered at the end of the expression, anchor
it at the very end of the search area.</p>

<p>&lt; or &gt; Match the character before or after a word.
They are merely a shorthand for [^a-zA-Z0-9_] , but can also
match newlines. Since they match actual characters, they are
only suitable to delimit words, not to delimit inter-word
space.</p>

<p>/ Splits the expression in two parts. Everything
matching the right part will be assigned to the MATCH
environment vari- able.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Look in the procmailex(5) man page.</p>

<p>CAVEATS Continued lines in an action line that specifies
a program always have to end in a backslash, even if the
underlying shell would not need or want the backslash to
indicate continuation. This is due to the two pass parsing
process needed (first procmail, then the shell (or not,
depending on SHELLMETAS)).</p>

<p>Don t put comments on the regular expression condition
lines in a recipe, these lines are fed to the internal egrep
literally (except for continuation backslashes at the end of
a line).</p>

<p>Leading whitespace on continued regular expression
condition lines is usually ignored (so that they can be
indented), but not on continued condition lines that are
evaluated according to the sh(1) substitution rules inside
double quotes.</p>

<p>Watch out for deadlocks when doing unhealthy things like
forwarding mail to your own account. Deadlocks can be broken
by proper use of LOCKTIMEOUT.</p>

<p>Any default values that procmail has for some
environment variables will always override the ones that
were already defined. If you really want to override the
defaults, you either have to put them in the rcfile or on
the command line as arguments.</p>

<p>The /etc/procmailrc file cannot change the PATH setting
seen by user rcfiles as the value is reset when procmail
finishes the /etc/proc- mailrc file. While future
enhancements are expected in this area, recompiling procmail
with the desired value is currently the only cor- rect
solution.</p>

<p>Environment variables set inside the shell-interpreted-|
action part of a recipe will not retain their value after
the recipe has finished since they are set in a subshell of
procmail. To make sure the value of an environment variable
is retained you have to put the assignment to the variable
before the leading | of a recipe, so that it can cap- ture
stdout of the program.</p>

<p>If you specify only a h or a b flag on a delivering
recipe, and the recipe matches, then, unless the c flag is
present as well, the body respectively the header of the
mail will be silently lost.</p>

<p>BUGS The only substitutions of environment variables
that can be handled by procmail itself are of the type
$name, ${name}, ${name:-text}, ${name:+text}, ${name-text},
${name+text}, $0me, $#, $n, $$, $?, $_, $- and $=; whereby
$0me will be substituted by the all-magic-regular-
expression-characters-disarmed equivalent of $name, $_ by
the name of the current rcfile, $- by $LASTFOLDER and $=
will contain the score of the last recipe. Furthermore, the
result of $0me substitution will never be split on
whitespace. When the -a or -m options are used, $# will
expand to the number of arguments so specified and
&quot;$@&quot; (the quotes are required) will expand to the
specified arguments. However, &quot;$@&quot; will only be
expanded when used in the argument list to a program, and
then only one such occurrence will be expanded.</p>

<p>Unquoted variable expansions performed by procmail are
always split on space, tab, and newline characters; the IFS
variable is not used inter- nally.</p>

<p>Procmail does not support the expansion of ~.</p>

<p>A line buffer of length $LINEBUF is used when processing
the rcfile, any expansions that dont fit within this limit
will be truncated and PROCMAIL_OVERFLOW will be set. If the
overflowing line is a condition or an action line, then it
will be considered failed and procmail will continue
processing. If it is a variable assignment or recipe start
line then procmail will abort the entire rcfile.</p>

<p>If the global lockfile has a relative path, and the
current directory is not the same as when the global
lockfile was created, then the glob- al lockfile will not be
removed if procmail exits at that point (reme- dy: use
absolute paths to specify global lockfiles).</p>

<p>If an rcfile has a relative path and when the rcfile is
first opened MAILDIR contains a relative path, and if at one
point procmail is in- structed to clone itself and the
current directory has changed since the rcfile was opened,
then procmail will not be able to clone itself (remedy: use
an absolute path to reference the rcfile or make sure
MAILDIR contains an absolute path as the rcfile is
opened).</p>

<p>A locallockfile on the recipe that marks the start of a
non-forking nested block does not work as expected.</p>

<p>When capturing stdout from a recipe into an environment
variable, ex- actly one trailing newline will be
stripped.</p>

<p>Some non-optimal and non-obvious regexps set MATCH to an
incorrect val- ue. The regexp can be made to work by
removing one or more unneeded *, +, or ? operator on the
left-hand side of the token.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS If the regular expression contains ^TO_ it
will be substituted by
(^((Original-)?(Resent-)?(To|Cc|Bcc)|(X-Envelope
|Apparently(-Resent)?)-To):(.*[^-a-zA-Z0-9_.])?) , which
should catch all destination specifications containing a
specific address.</p>

<p>If the regular expression contains ^TO it will be
substituted by
(^((Original-)?(Resent-)?(To|Cc|Bcc)|(X-Envelope
|Apparently(-Resent)?)-To):(.*[^a-zA-Z])?) , which should
catch all destination specifications containing a specific
word.</p>

<p>If the regular expression contains ^FROM_DAEMON it will
be substitut- ed by
(^(Mailing-List:|Precedence:.*(junk|bulk|list)|To: Multiple
recipients of
|(((Resent-)?(From|Sender)|X-Envelope-From):|&gt;?From
)([^&gt;]*[^(.%@a-z0-9])?(Post(ma?(st(e?r)?|n)|office)|(send)?Mail(er)?
|daemon|m(mdf|ajordomo)|n?uucp|LIST(SERV|proc)|NETSERV|o(wner|ps)
|r(e(quest|sponse)|oot)|b(ounce|b.smtp)|echo|mirror|s(erv(ices?|er)
|mtp(error)?|ystem)|A(dmin(istrator)?|MMGR|utoanswer))(([^).!:a-
z0-9][-_a-z0-9]*)?[%@t ][^&lt;)]*(.).*)?)?$([^&gt;]|$))) ,
which should catch mails coming from most daemons (how s
that for a regular expression :-).</p>

<p>If the regular expression contains ^FROM_MAILER it will
be substitut- ed by
(^(((Resent-)?(From|Sender)|X-Envelope-From):|&gt;?From
)([^&gt;]*[^(.%@a-z0-9])?(Post(ma(st(er)?|n)|office)|(send)?Mail(er)?
|daemon|mmdf|n?uucp|ops|r(esponse|oot)|(bb.)?smtp(error)?|s(erv(ices?
|er)|ystem)|A(dmin(istrator)?|MMGR))(([^).!:a-z0-9][-_a-z0-9]*)?[%@t
][^&lt;)]*(.).*)?)?$([^&gt;]|$)) (a stripped down version of
^FROM_DAEMON), which should catch mails coming from most
mailer- daemons.</p>

<p>When assigning boolean values to variables like VERBOSE,
DELIVERED or COMSAT, procmail accepts as true every string
starting with: a non-zero value, on , y, t or e. False is
every string starting with: a zero value, off, n, f or
d.</p>

<p>If the action line of a recipe specifies a program, a
sole backslash- newline pair in it on an otherwise empty
line will be converted into a newline.</p>

<p>The regular expression engine built into procmail does
not support named character classes.</p>

<p>NOTES Since unquoted leading whitespace is generally
ignored in the rcfile you can indent everything to
taste.</p>

<p>The leading | on the action line to specify a program or
filter is stripped before checking for $SHELLMETAS.</p>

<p>Files included with the INCLUDERC directive containing
only environment variable assignments can be shared with
sh.</p>

<p>The current behavior of assignments on the command line
to INCLUDERC and SWITCHRC is not guaranteed, has been
changed once already, and may be changed again or removed in
future releases.</p>

<p>For really complicated processing you can even consider
calling proc- mail recursively.</p>

<p>In the old days, the :0 that marks the beginning of a
recipe, had to be changed to :n, whereby n denotes the
number of conditions that follow.</p>
