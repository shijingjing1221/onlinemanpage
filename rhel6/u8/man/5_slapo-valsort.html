<p>SLAPO-VALSORT(5) SLAPO-VALSORT(5)</p>

<p>NAME slapo-valsort - Value Sorting overlay to slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Value Sorting overlay can be used with a
backend database to sort the values of specific multi-valued
attributes within a subtree. The sorting occurs whenever the
attributes are returned in a search response.</p>

<p>Sorting can be specified in ascending or descending
order, using either numeric or alphanumeric sort methods.
Additionally, a &quot;weighted&quot; sort can be specified,
which uses a numeric weight prepended to the attribute
values. The weighted sort is always performed in ascending
order, but may be combined with the other methods for values
that all have equal weights. The weight is specified by
prepending an integer weight {&lt;weight&gt;} in front of
each value of the attribute for which weighted sorting is
desired. This weighting factor is stripped off and not
returned in search results unless the valsort control is
specified (1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.5.14).</p>

<p>The valsort control requires a value consisting of a
Sequence that con- tains a boolean flag. The weighting
factor is only returned if the boolean value is TRUE. In
lber-encode(3) format, the required value must conform to
&quot;{b}&quot; syntax.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION These slapd.conf options apply to the
Value Sorting overlay. They should appear after the overlay
directive.</p>

<p>valsort-attr &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;baseDN&gt;
(&lt;sort-method&gt; | weighted [&lt;sort- method&gt;])
Configure a sorting method for the specified attribute in
the subtree rooted at baseDN. The sort-method may be one of
alpha-ascend, alpha-descend, numeric-ascend, or
numeric-descend. If the special weighted method is
specified, a secondary sort- method may also be specified.
It is an error to specify an alphanumeric sort-method for an
attribute with Integer or Numer- icString syntax, and it is
an error to specify a numeric sort- method for an attribute
with a syntax other than Integer or NumericString.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES database bdb suffix dc=example,dc=com ...
overlay valsort valsort-attr member
ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com alpha-ascend</p>

<p>To invoke ldapsearch(1) with the valsort control, the
control value must be set appropriately. The following
octets represent the desired &quot;{b}&quot; encoding:</p>

<p>0x30 0x03 0x01 0x01 0xff</p>

<p>The control can be sent from the command-line using the
base64 encoding of the value:</p>

<p>ldapsearch -E 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.5.14=::MAMBAf8=</p>
