<p>NAME startup - event signalling system startup</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS startup [ENV]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The startup event is generated by the
Upstart init(8) daemon after it has completed its own
initialisation and is the signal that the rest of the system
may be started.</p>

<p>Typically this will involve checking and mounting the
partitions and drives that form the filesystem, loading
drivers for connected devices and starting the X windowing
system or other login environment.</p>

<p>In the default Upstart configuration, the primary task
run on the startup event is the /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf
job responsible for gen- erating the System V compatible
runlevel(7) event. See that page for a more detailed
explanation of this process.</p>

<p>Paradoxically there is currently no corresponding
Upstart-native event signifying that the system is to be
shutdown, only the System V compat- ible runlevel 0 and
runlevel 6 events provide this functionality.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE A service with no other dependencies run on
startup might use:</p>

<p>start on startup</p>

<p>SEE ALSO runlevel(7) init(8)</p>
