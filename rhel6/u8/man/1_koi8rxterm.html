<p>NAME koi8rxterm - X terminal emulator for KOI8-R
environments</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS koi8rxterm [ xterm-options ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION koi8rxterm is a wrapper around the xterm(1)
program that invokes the latter program with the KOI8RXTerm
X resource class set. All argu- ments to koi8rxterm are
passed to xterm without processing; the -class and -k8
options should not be specified because they are used by the
wrapper. See the xterm manual page for more information on
xterm- options.</p>

<p>The environment s locale settings (see ENVIRONMENT
below) are used to discern the locales character set. If no
current locale can be deter- mined, the locale ru_RU.KOI8-R
(the Russian language as used in the territory of Russia,
with the KOI8-R character set) is assumed. The locale(1)
utility is used to determine whether the system supports the
selected locale. If it does not, koi8rxterm will exit with
an error and report the output of locale.</p>

<p>Note: koi8rxterm may produce unexpected results if the
current locale is set to one in which the KOI8-R character
encoding is not supported, or if fonts using that encoding
are not available. In the Debian sys- tem, the
xfonts-cyrillic package provides the fonts that koi8rxterm
uses by default. To change the fonts koi8rxterm uses, edit
the /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/KOI8RXTerm file.</p>

<p>A similar wrapper, uxterm(1), is available for Unicode
UTF-8 environ- ments.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG The values of these
variables are checked, in order, to deter- mine the
character set used by the current locale.</p>

<p>AUTHOR koi8rxterm was written by Branden Robinson and is
very heavily based on uxterm, by Thomas Dickey. The
assistance of Jurij Smakov was invalu- able in
sanity-checking its operation.</p>
