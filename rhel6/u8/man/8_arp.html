<p>ARP(8) Linux Programmer s Manual ARP(8)</p>

<p>NAME arp - manipulate the system ARP cache</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS arp [-evn] [-H type] [-i if] -a [hostname]</p>

<p>arp [-v] [-i if] -d hostname [pub]</p>

<p>arp [-v] [-H type] [-i if] -s hostname hw_addr
[temp]</p>

<p>arp [-v] [-H type] [-i if] -s hostname hw_addr [netmask
nm] pub</p>

<p>arp [-v] [-H type] [-i if] -Ds hostname ifa [netmask nm]
pub</p>

<p>arp [-vnD] [-H type] [-i if] -f [filename]</p>

<p>NOTE This program is obsolete. For replacement check ip
neighbor.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Arp manipulates the kernels ARP cache in
various ways. The primary options are clearing an address
mapping entry and manually setting up one. For debugging
purposes, the arp program also allows a complete dump of the
ARP cache.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v, --verbose Tell the user what is going on by
being verbose.</p>

<p>-n, --numeric shows numerical addresses instead of
trying to determine sym- bolic host, port or user names.</p>

<p>-H type, --hw-type type, -t type When setting or reading
the ARP cache, this optional parameter tells arp which class
of entries it should check for. The default value of this
parameter is ether (i.e. hardware code 0x01 for IEEE 802.3
10Mbps Ethernet). Other values might include network
technologies such as ARCnet (arcnet) , PROnet (pronet) ,
AX.25 (ax25) and NET/ROM (netrom).</p>

<p>-a [hostname], --all [hostname] Shows the entries of the
specified hosts. If the hostname parameter is not used, all
entries will be displayed. The entries will be displayed in
alternate (BSD) style.</p>

<p>-d hostname, --delete hostname Remove any entry for the
specified host. This can be used if the indicated host is
brought down, for example.</p>

<p>-D, --use-device Use the interface ifas hardware
address.</p>

<p>-e Shows the entries in default (Linux) style.</p>

<p>-i If, --device If Select an interface. When dumping the
ARP cache only entries matching the specified interface will
be printed. When setting a permanent or temp ARP entry this
interface will be associated with the entry; if this option
is not used, the kernel will guess based on the routing
table. For pub entries the specified interface is the
interface on which ARP requests will be answered.</p>

<p>NOTE: This has to be different from the interface to
which the IP datagrams will be routed.</p>

<p>-s hostname hw_addr, --set hostname Manually create an
ARP address mapping entry for host hostname with hardware
address set to hw_addr class, but for most classes one can
assume that the usual presentation can be used. For the
Ethernet class, this is 6 bytes in hexadecimal, separated by
colons. When adding proxy arp entries (that is those with
the publish flag set a netmask may be specified to proxy arp
for entire subnets. This is not good practice, but is
supported by older kernels because it can be useful. If the
temp flag is not supplied entries will be permanent stored
into the ARP cache. NOTE: As of kernel 2.2.0 it is no longer
possible to set an ARP entry for an entire subnet. Linux
instead does automagic proxy arp when a route exists and it
is forwarding. See arp(7) for details.</p>

<p>-f filename, --file filename Similar to the -s option,
only this time the address info is taken from file filename
set up. The name of the data file is very often /etc/ethers,
but this is not official. If no filename is specified
/etc/ethers is used as default.</p>

<p>The format of the file is simple; it only contains ASCII
text lines with a hardware address and a hostname separated
by whitespace. Additionally the pub, temp and netmask flags
can be used.</p>

<p>In all places where a hostname is expected, one can also
enter an IP address in dotted-decimal notation.</p>

<p>As a special case for compatibility the order of the
hostname and the hardware address can be exchanged.</p>

<p>Each complete entry in the ARP cache will be marked with
the C flag. Permanent entries are marked with M and
published entries have the P flag.</p>

<p>FILES /proc/net/arp, /etc/networks /etc/hosts
/etc/ethers</p>
