<p>NAME XmClipboardInquirePendingItems A clipboard function
that returns a list of data ID/private ID pairs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardInquirePendingItems (display, window,
format_name, item_list, count) Display * display; Window
window; char * format_name; XmClipboardPendingList *
item_list; unsigned long * count; (void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardInquirePendingItems returns a
list of data ID/private ID pairs for the specified format
name. A data item is considered pending if the application
originally passed it by name, the application has not yet
copied the data, and the item has not been deleted from the
clipboard. The application is responsible for freeing the
memory pro- vided by this function to store the list. To
free the memory, call XtFree.</p>

<p>This function is used by an application when exiting, to
determine if the data that is passed by name should be sent
to the clipboard.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window ID of a widget that relates
the applica- tion window to the clipboard. The widgets
window ID can be obtained through XtWindow. The same
application instance should pass the same window ID to each
of the clipboard func- tions that it calls.</p>

<p>format_name Specifies a string that contains the name of
the format for which the list of data ID/private ID pairs is
to be obtained.</p>

<p>item_list Specifies the address of the array of data
ID/private ID pairs for the specified format name. This
argument is a type XmClipboardPendingList. The application
is responsible for freeing the memory provided by this
function for storing the list.</p>

<p>count Specifies the number of items returned in the
list. If there is no data for the specified format name, or
if there is no item on the clipboard, this argument equals 0
(zero).</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardSuccess The function was
successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>
