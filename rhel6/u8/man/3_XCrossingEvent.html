<p>NAME XCrossingEvent - EnterNotify and LeaveNotify event
structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structure for EnterNotify and LeaveNotify
events contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* EnterNotify or LeaveNotify
*/ unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a
SendEvent request */ Display *display; /* Display the event
was read from */ Window window; /* event window reported
relative to */ Window root; /* root window that the event
occurred on */ Window subwindow; /* child window */ Time
time; /* milliseconds */ int x, y; /* pointer x, y
coordinates in event window */ int x_root, y_root; /*
coordinates relative to root */ int mode; /* NotifyNormal,
NotifyGrab, NotifyUngrab */ int detail; /* * NotifyAncestor,
NotifyVirtual, NotifyInferior, *
NotifyNonlinear,NotifyNonlinearVirtual */ Bool same_screen;
/* same screen flag */ Bool focus; /* boolean focus */
unsigned int state; /* key or button mask */ }
XCrossingEvent; typedef XCrossingEvent XEnterWindowEvent;
typedef XCrossingEvent XLeaveWindowEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive these events, the structure members are
set as fol- lows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>The window member is set to the window on which the
EnterNotify or LeaveNotify event was generated and is
referred to as the event window. This is the window used by
the X server to report the event, and is relative to the
root window on which the event occurred. The root mem- ber
is set to the root window of the screen on which the event
occurred.</p>

<p>For a LeaveNotify event, if a child of the event window
contains the initial position of the pointer, the subwindow
component is set to that child. Otherwise, the X server sets
the subwindow member to None. For an EnterNotify event, if a
child of the event window contains the final pointer
position, the subwindow component is set to that child or
None.</p>

<p>The time member is set to the time when the event was
generated and is expressed in milliseconds. The x and y
members are set to the coordi- nates of the pointer position
in the event window. This position is always the pointer s
final position, not its initial position. If the event
window is on the same screen as the root window, x and y are
the pointer coordinates relative to the event windows
origin. Otherwise, x and y are set to zero. The x_root and
y_root members are set to the pointers coordinates relative
to the root window s origin at the time of the event.</p>

<p>The same_screen member is set to indicate whether the
event window is on the same screen as the root window and
can be either True or False. If True, the event and root
windows are on the same screen. If False, the event and root
windows are not on the same screen.</p>

<p>The focus member is set to indicate whether the event
window is the focus window or an inferior of the focus
window. The X server can set this member to either True or
False. If True, the event window is the focus window or an
inferior of the focus window. If False, the event window is
not the focus window or an inferior of the focus window.</p>

<p>The state member is set to indicate the state of the
pointer buttons and modifier keys just prior to the event.
The X server can set this member to the bitwise inclusive OR
of one or more of the button or mod- ifier key masks:
Button1Mask, Button2Mask, Button3Mask, Button4Mask,
Button5Mask, ShiftMask, LockMask, ControlMask, Mod1Mask,
Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask.</p>

<p>The mode member is set to indicate whether the events
are normal events, pseudo-motion events when a grab
activates, or pseudo-motion events when a grab deactivates.
The X server can set this member to NotifyNormal,
NotifyGrab, or NotifyUngrab.</p>

<p>The detail member is set to indicate the notify detail
and can be Noti- fyAncestor, NotifyVirtual, NotifyInferior,
NotifyNonlinear, or Noti- fyNonlinearVirtual.</p>
