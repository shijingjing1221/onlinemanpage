<p>NAME dosfsck - check and repair MS-DOS file systems</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dosfsck|fsck.msdos|fsck.vfat [-aAflnrtvVwy] [-d
path -d ...] [-u path -u ...] device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dosfsck verifies the consistency of MS-DOS
file systems and optionally tries to repair them. The
following file system problems can be cor- rected (in this
order):</p>

<p>- FAT contains invalid cluster numbers. Cluster is
changed to EOF. - Files cluster chain contains a loop. The
loop is broken. - Bad clusters (read errors). The clusters
are marked bad and they are removed from files owning them.
This check is optional. - Directories with a large number of
bad entries (probably cor- rupt). The directory can be
deleted. - Files . and .. are non-directories. They can be
deleted or renamed. - Directories . and .. in root
directory. They are deleted. - Bad file names. They can be
renamed. - Duplicate directory entries. They can be deleted
or renamed. - Directories with non-zero size field. Size is
set to zero. - Directory . does not point to parent
directory. The start pointer is adjusted. - Directory ..
does not point to parent of parent directory. The start
pointer is adjusted. - Start cluster number of a file is
invalid. The file is trun- cated. - File contains bad or
free clusters. The file is truncated. - Files cluster chain
is longer than indicated by the size fields. The file is
truncated. - Two or more files share the same cluster(s).
All but one of the files are truncated. If the file being
truncated is a directory file that has already been read,
the file system check is restarted after truncation. - Files
cluster chain is shorter than indicated by the size fields.
The file is truncated. - Clusters are marked as used but are
not owned by a file. They are marked as free.</p>

<p>Additionally, the following problems are detected, but
not repaired:</p>

<p>- Invalid parameters in boot sector. - Absence of . and
.. entries in non-root directories</p>

<p>When dosfsck checks a file system, it accumulates all
changes in memory and performs them only after all checks
are complete. This can be dis- abled with the -w option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Automatically repair the file system. No user
intervention is necessary. Whenever there is more than one
method to solve a problem, the least destructive approach is
used.</p>

<p>-A Use Atari variation of the MS-DOS filesystem. This is
default if dosfsck is run on an Atari, then this option
turns off Atari format. There are some minor differences in
Atari format: Some boot sector fields are interpreted
slightly different, and the special FAT entries for
end-of-file and bad cluster can be dif- ferent. Under MS-DOS
0xfff8 is used for EOF and Atari employs 0xffff by default,
but both systems recognize all values from 0xfff8...0xffff
as end-of-file. MS-DOS uses only 0xfff7 for bad clusters,
where on Atari values 0xfff0...0xfff7 are for this purpose
(but the standard value is still 0xfff7).</p>

<p>-d Delete the specified file. If more that one file with
that name exists, the first one is deleted.</p>

<p>-f Salvage unused cluster chains to files. By default,
unused clus- ters are added to the free disk space except in
auto mode (-a).</p>

<p>-l List path names of files being processed.</p>

<p>-n No-operation mode: non-interactively check for
errors, but dont write anything to the filesystem.</p>

<p>-r Interactively repair the file system. The user is
asked for advice whenever there is more than one approach to
fix an incon- sistency.</p>

<p>-t Mark unreadable clusters as bad.</p>

<p>-u Try to undelete the specified file. dosfsck tries to
allocate a chain of contiguous unallocated clusters
beginning with the start cluster of the undeleted file.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode. Generates slightly more output.</p>

<p>-V Perform a verification pass. The file system check is
repeated after the first run. The second pass should never
report any fixable errors. It may take considerably longer
than the first pass, because the first pass may have
generated long list of modifications that have to be scanned
for each disk read.</p>

<p>-w Write changes to disk immediately.</p>

<p>-y Same as -a (automatically repair filesystem) for
compatibility with other fsck tools.</p>

<p>If -a and -r are absent, the file system is only
checked, but not repaired.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 No recoverable errors have been
detected.</p>

<p>1 Recoverable errors have been detected or dosfsck has
discovered an internal inconsistency.</p>

<p>2 Usage error. dosfsck did not access the file
system.</p>

<p>FILES fsck0000.rec, fsck0001.rec, ... When recovering
from a corrupted file system, dosfsck dumps recovered data
into files named fsckNNNN.rec in the top level directory of
the file system.</p>

<p>BUGS Does not create . and .. files where necessary.
Does not remove entirely empty directories. Should give more
diagnostic messages. Undeleting files should use a more
sophisticated algorithm.</p>
