<p>FMTMSG(3) Linux Programmer s Manual FMTMSG(3)</p>

<p>NAME fmtmsg - print formatted error messages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;fmtmsg.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fmtmsg(long classification, const char *label, int
severity, const char *text, const char *action, const char
*tag);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function displays a message described
by its arguments on the device(s) specified in the
classification argument. For messages writ- ten to stderr,
the format depends on the MSGVERB environment variable.</p>

<p>The label argument identifies the source of the message.
The string must consist of two colon separated parts where
the first part has not more than 10 and the second part not
more than 14 characters.</p>

<p>The text argument describes the condition of the
error.</p>

<p>The action argument describes possible steps to recover
from the error. If it is printed, it is prefixed by &quot;TO
FIX: &quot;.</p>

<p>The tag argument is a reference to the online
documentation where more information can be found. It should
contain the label value and a unique identification
number.</p>

<p>Dummy arguments Each of the arguments can have a dummy
value. The dummy classification value MM_NULLMC (0L) does
not specify any output, so nothing is printed. The dummy
severity value NO_SEV (0) says that no severity is supplied.
The values MM_NULLLBL, MM_NULLTXT, MM_NULLACT, MM_NULLTAG
are synonyms for ((char *) 0), the empty string, and
MM_NULLSEV is a synonym for NO_SEV.</p>

<p>The classification argument The classification argument
is the sum of values describing 4 types of information.</p>

<p>The first value defines the output channel.</p>

<p>MM_PRINT Output to stderr.</p>

<p>MM_CONSOLE Output to the system console.</p>

<p>MM_PRINT | MM_CONSOLE Output to both.</p>

<p>The second value is the source of the error:</p>

<p>MM_HARD A hardware error occurred.</p>

<p>MM_FIRM A firmware error occurred.</p>

<p>MM_SOFT A software error occurred.</p>

<p>The third value encodes the detector of the problem:</p>

<p>MM_APPL It is detected by an application.</p>

<p>MM_UTIL It is detected by a utility.</p>

<p>MM_OPSYS It is detected by the operating system.</p>

<p>The fourth value shows the severity of the incident:</p>

<p>MM_RECOVER It is a recoverable error.</p>

<p>MM_NRECOV It is a non-recoverable error.</p>

<p>The severity argument The severity argument can take one
of the following values:</p>

<p>MM_NOSEV No severity is printed.</p>

<p>MM_HALT This value is printed as HALT.</p>

<p>MM_ERROR This value is printed as ERROR.</p>

<p>MM_WARNING This value is printed as WARNING.</p>

<p>MM_INFO This value is printed as INFO.</p>

<p>The numeric values are between 0 and 4. Using
addseverity(3) or the environment variable SEV_LEVEL you can
add more levels and strings to print.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The function can return 4 values:</p>

<p>MM_OK Everything went smooth.</p>

<p>MM_NOTOK Complete failure.</p>

<p>MM_NOMSG Error writing to stderr.</p>

<p>MM_NOCON Error writing to the console.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variable MSGVERB
(&quot;message verbosity&quot;) can be used to suppress
parts of the output to stderr. (It does not influence output
to the console.) When this variable is defined, is non-NULL,
and is a colon-separated list of valid keywords, then only
the parts of the mes- sage corresponding to these keywords
is printed. Valid keywords are &quot;label&quot;,
&quot;severity&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, &quot;action&quot;
and &quot;tag&quot;.</p>

<p>The environment variable SEV_LEVEL can be used to
introduce new sever- ity levels. By default, only the five
severity levels described above are available. Any other
numeric value would make fmtmsg() print noth- ing. If the
user puts SEV_LEVEL with a format like</p>

<p>SEV_LEVEL=[description[:description[:...]]]</p>

<p>in the environment of the process before the first call
to fmtmsg(), where each description is of the form</p>

<p>severity-keyword,level,printstring</p>

<p>then fmtmsg() will also accept the indicated values for
the level (in addition to the standard levels 0-4), and use
the indicated printstring when such a level occurs.</p>

<p>The severity-keyword part is not used by fmtmsg() but it
has to be present. The level part is a string representation
of a number. The numeric value must be a number greater than
4. This value must be used in the severity argument of
fmtmsg() to select this class. It is not possible to
overwrite any of the predefined classes. The printstring is
the string printed when a message of this class is processed
by fmtmsg().</p>

<p>VERSIONS fmtmsg() is provided in glibc since version
2.1.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The functions fmtmsg() and addseverity(3),
and environment variables MSGVERB and SEV_LEVEL come from
System V. The function fmtmsg() and the environment variable
MSGVERB are described in POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES System V and Unixware man pages tell us that these
functions have been replaced by &quot;pfmt() and
addsev()&quot; or by &quot;pfmt(), vpfmt(), lfmt(), and
vlfmt()&quot;, and will be removed later.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;fmtmsg.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(void) { long class = MM_PRINT | MM_SOFT |
MM_OPSYS | MM_RECOVER; int err;</p>

<p>err = fmtmsg(class, &quot;util-linux:mount&quot;,
MM_ERROR, &quot;unknown mount option&quot;, &quot;See
mount(8).&quot;, &quot;util-linux:mount:017&quot;); switch
(err) { case MM_OK: break; case MM_NOTOK:
printf(&quot;Nothing printed0); break; case MM_NOMSG:
printf(&quot;Nothing printed to stderr0); break; case
MM_NOCON: printf(&quot;No console output0); break; default:
printf(&quot;Unknown error from fmtmsg()0); }
exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>

<p>The output should be:</p>

<p>util-linux:mount: ERROR: unknown mount option TO FIX:
See mount(8). util-linux:mount:017</p>

<p>and after</p>

<p>MSGVERB=text:action; export MSGVERB</p>

<p>the output becomes:</p>

<p>unknown mount option TO FIX: See mount(8).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO addseverity(3), perror(3)</p>

man-pages project. A description of the project, and
