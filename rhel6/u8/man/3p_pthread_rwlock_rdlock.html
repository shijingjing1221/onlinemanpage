<p>PTHREAD_RWLOCK_RDLOCK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_RWLOCK_RDLOCK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_rwlock_rdlock, pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock -
lock a read-write lock object for reading</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_rwlock_rdlock(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock); int
pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_rwlock_rdlock() function shall
apply a read lock to the read-write lock referenced by
rwlock. The calling thread acquires the read lock if a
writer does not hold the lock and there are no writers
blocked on the lock.</p>

<p>If the Thread Execution Scheduling option is supported,
and the threads involved in the lock are executing with the
scheduling policies SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR, the calling
thread shall not acquire the lock if a writer holds the lock
or if writers of higher or equal priority are blocked on the
lock; otherwise, the calling thread shall acquire the
lock.</p>

<p>If the Threads Execution Scheduling option is supported,
and the threads involved in the lock are executing with the
SCHED_SPORADIC scheduling policy, the calling thread shall
not acquire the lock if a writer holds the lock or if
writers of higher or equal priority are blocked on the lock;
otherwise, the calling thread shall acquire the lock.</p>

<p>If the Thread Execution Scheduling option is not
supported, it is implementation-defined whether the calling
thread acquires the lock when a writer does not hold the
lock and there are writers blocked on the lock. If a writer
holds the lock, the calling thread shall not acquire the
read lock. If the read lock is not acquired, the calling
thread shall block until it can acquire the lock. The
calling thread may deadlock if at the time the call is made
it holds a write lock.</p>

<p>A thread may hold multiple concurrent read locks on
rwlock (that is, successfully call the
pthread_rwlock_rdlock() function n times). If so, the
application shall ensure that the thread performs matching
unlocks (that is, it calls the pthread_rwlock_unlock()
function n times).</p>

<p>The maximum number of simultaneous read locks that an
implementation guarantees can be applied to a read-write
lock shall be implementation- defined. The
pthread_rwlock_rdlock() function may fail if this maximum
would be exceeded.</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock() function shall apply a
read lock as in the pthread_rwlock_rdlock() function, with
the exception that the func- tion shall fail if the
equivalent pthread_rwlock_rdlock() call would have blocked
the calling thread. In no case shall the
pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock() function ever block; it always
either acquires the lock or fails and returns
immediately.</p>

<p>Results are undefined if any of these functions are
called with an uninitialized read-write lock.</p>

<p>If a signal is delivered to a thread waiting for a
read-write lock for reading, upon return from the signal
handler the thread resumes waiting for the read-write lock
for reading as if it was not interrupted.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the pthread_rwlock_rdlock()
function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall
be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock() function shall return
zero if the lock for reading on the read-write lock object
referenced by rwlock is acquired. Otherwise, an error number
shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock() function shall
fail if:</p>

<p>EBUSY The read-write lock could not be acquired for
reading because a writer holds the lock or a writer with the
appropriate priority was blocked on it.</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlock_rdlock() and
pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock() functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by rwlock does not refer to
an initialized read-write lock object.</p>

<p>EAGAIN The read lock could not be acquired because the
maximum number of read locks for rwlock has been
exceeded.</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlock_rdlock() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EDEADLK The current thread already owns the read-write
lock for writing.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Applications using these functions may
be subject to priority inver- sion, as discussed in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.285,
Priority Inversion.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
