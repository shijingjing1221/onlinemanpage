<p>TOWUPPER(3) Linux Programmer s Manual TOWUPPER(3)</p>

<p>NAME towupper - convert a wide character to
uppercase</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;</p>

<p>wint_t towupper(wint_t wc);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The towupper() function is the
wide-character equivalent of the toup- per(3) function. If
wc is a wide character, it is converted to upper- case.
Characters which do not have case are returned unchanged. If
wc is WEOF, WEOF is returned.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The towupper() function returns the
uppercase equivalent of wc, or WEOF if wc is WEOF.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of towupper() depends on the LC_CTYPE
category of the cur- rent locale.</p>

<p>This function is not very appropriate for dealing with
Unicode charac- ters, because Unicode knows about three
cases: upper, lower and title case.</p>
