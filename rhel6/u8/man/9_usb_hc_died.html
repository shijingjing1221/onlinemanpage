<p>NAME usb_hc_died - report abnormal shutdown of a host
controller (bus glue)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void usb_hc_died(struct usb_hcd * hcd);</p>

controller</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is called by bus glue to report a USB
host controller that died while operations may still have
been pending. It&acute;s called automatically by the PCI
glue, so only glue for non-PCI busses should need to call
it.</p>

<p>Only call this function with the primary HCD.</p>
