<p>NAME tevent_events - Chapter 2: Tevent events</p>

<p>Tevent events Ok, after reading previous chapter we can
start doing something useful. So, the way of creating events
is similar for all types - signals, file descriptors, time
or immediate events. At the beginning it is good to know
about some typedefs which are set in tevent library and
which specify the arguments for each callback. These
callbacks are:</p>

<p>&middot; tevent_timer_handler_t()</p>

<p>&middot; tevent_immediate_handler_t()</p>

<p>&middot; tevent_signal_handler_t()</p>

<p>&middot; tevent_fd_handler_t()</p>

<p>According their names it is obvious that for creating
callback for e.g. time event, tevent_timer_handler_t will be
used.</p>

<p>The best way how to introduce registering an event and
setting up a callback would be example, so examples
describing all the types of events follow.</p>

<p>Time event This example shows how to set up an event
which will be repeated for a minute with interval of 2
seconds (will be triggered 30 times). After exceeding this
limit, the event loop will finish and all the memory
resources will be freed. This is just example describing
repeated activity, nothing usefull is done within foo
function</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;tevent.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct state { struct timeval endtime; int counter;
TALLOC_CTX *ctx; };</p>

<p>static void callback(struct tevent_context *ev, struct
tevent_timer *tim, struct timeval current_time, void
*private_data) { struct state *data =
talloc_get_type_abort(private_data, struct state); struct
tevent_timer *time_event; struct timeval schedule;</p>

<p>printf(Data value: %d0, data-&gt;counter);
data-&gt;counter += 1; // increase counter</p>

<p>// if time has not reached its limit, set another event
if (tevent_timeval_compare(&amp;current_time,
&amp;(data-&gt;endtime)) &lt; 0) { // do something // set
repeat with delay 2 seconds schedule =
tevent_timeval_current_ofs(2, 0); time_event =
tevent_add_timer(ev, data-&gt;ctx, schedule, callback,
data); if (time_event == NULL) { // error ...
fprintf(stderr, MEMORY PROBLEM0); return; } } else { // time
limit exceeded } }</p>

<p>int main(void) { struct tevent_context *event_ctx;
TALLOC_CTX *mem_ctx; struct tevent_timer *time_event; struct
timeval schedule;</p>

<p>mem_ctx = talloc_new(NULL); // parent event_ctx =
tevent_context_init(mem_ctx);</p>

<p>struct state *data = talloc(mem_ctx, struct state);</p>

<p>schedule = tevent_timeval_current_ofs(2, 0); // +2
second time value data-&gt;endtime =
tevent_timeval_add(&amp;schedule, 60, 0); // one minute time
limit data-&gt;ctx = mem_ctx; data-&gt;counter = 0;</p>

<p>// add time event time_event =
tevent_add_timer(event_ctx, mem_ctx, schedule, callback,
data); if (time_event == NULL) { fprintf(stderr, FAILED0);
return EXIT_FAILURE; }</p>

<p>tevent_loop_wait(event_ctx); talloc_free(mem_ctx);
return EXIT_SUCCESS; }</p>

<p>Variable counter is only used for counting the number of
triggered functions. List of all available functions which
tevent offers for working with time are listed here together
with their description. More detailed view at these
functions is unnecessary because their purpose and usage is
quite simple and clear.</p>

<p>Immediate event These events are, as their name
indicates, activated and performed immediately. It means
that this kind of events have priority over others (except
signal events). So if there is a bulk of events registered
and after that a tevent loop is launched, then all the
immediate events will be triggered before the other events.
Except other immediate events (and signal events) because
they are also processed sequentially - according the order
they were scheduled. Signals have the highest priority and
therefore they are processed preferentially. Therefore the
expression immediate may not correspond exactly to the
dictionary definition of something without delay but rather
as soon as possible after all preceding immediate
events.</p>

<p>For creating an immediate event there is a small
different which lies in the fact that the creation of such
event is done in 2 steps. One represents the creation
(memory allocation), the second one represents registering
as the event within some tevent context.</p>

<p>struct tevent_immediate *run(TALLOC_CTX* mem_ctx, struct
tevent_context event_ctx, void * data) { struct
tevent_immediate *im;</p>

<p>im = tevent_create_immediate(mem_ctx); if (im == NULL) {
return NULL; } tevent_schedule_immediate(im, event_ctx, foo,
data);</p>

<p>return im; }</p>

<p>Example which may be compiled and run representing the
creation of immediate event.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;tevent.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct info_struct { int counter; };</p>

<p>static void foo(struct tevent_context *ev, struct
tevent_immediate *im, void *private_data) { struct
info_struct *data = talloc_get_type_abort(private_data,
struct info_struct); printf(Data value: %d0,
data-&gt;counter); }</p>

<p>int main (void) { struct tevent_context *event_ctx;
TALLOC_CTX *mem_ctx; struct tevent_immediate *im;</p>

<p>printf(INIT0);</p>

<p>mem_ctx = talloc_new(NULL); event_ctx =
tevent_context_init(mem_ctx);</p>

<p>struct info_struct *data = talloc(mem_ctx, struct
info_struct);</p>

<p>// setting up private data data-&gt;counter = 1;</p>

<p>// first immediate event im =
tevent_create_immediate(mem_ctx); if (im == NULL) {
fprintf(stderr, FAILED0); return EXIT_FAILURE; }
tevent_schedule_immediate(im, event_ctx, foo, data);</p>

<p>tevent_loop_wait(event_ctx); talloc_free(mem_ctx);</p>

<p>return 0; }</p>

<p>Signal event This is an alternative to standard C
library functions signal() or sigaction(). The main
difference that distinguishes these ways of treating signals
is their setting up of handlers for different time intervals
of the running program.</p>

<p>While standard C library methods for dealing with
signals offer sufficient tools for most cases, they are
inadequate for handling signals within the tevent loop. It
could be necessary to finish certain tevent requests within
the tevent loop without interruption. If a signal was sent
to a program at a moment when the tevent loop is in
progress, a standard signal handler would not return
processing to the application at the very same place and it
would quit the tevent loop for ever. In such cases, tevent
signal handlers offer the possibility of dealing with these
signals by masking them from the rest of application and not
quitting the loop, so the other events can still be
processed.</p>

<p>Tevent offers also a control function, which enables us
to verify whether it is possible to handle signals via
tevent, is defined within tevent library and it returns a
boolean value revealing the result of the verification.</p>

<p>bool tevent_signal_support (struct tevent_context
*ev)</p>

<p>Checking for signal support is not necessary, but if it
is not guaranteed, this is a good and easy control to
prevent unexpected behaviour or failure of the program
occurring. Such a test of course does not have to be run
every single time you wish to create a signal handler, but
simply at the beginning - during the initialization
procedures of the program. Afterthat, simply adapt to each
situation that arises.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;tevent.h&gt;
#include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>static void handler(struct tevent_context *ev, struct
tevent_signal *se, int signum, int count, void *siginfo,
void *private_data) {</p>

<p>// Do something usefull</p>

<p>printf(handling signal...0); exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>

<p>int main (void) { struct tevent_context *event_ctx;
TALLOC_CTX *mem_ctx; struct tevent_signal *sig;</p>

<p>mem_ctx = talloc_new(NULL); //parent if (mem_ctx ==
NULL) { fprintf(stderr, FAILED0); return EXIT_FAILURE; }</p>

<p>event_ctx = tevent_context_init(mem_ctx); if (event_ctx
== NULL) { fprintf(stderr, FAILED0); return EXIT_FAILURE;
}</p>

<p>if (tevent_signal_support(event_ctx)) { // create signal
event sig = tevent_add_signal(event_ctx, mem_ctx, SIGINT, 0,
handler, NULL); if (sig == NULL) { fprintf(stderr, FAILED0);
return EXIT_FAILURE; } tevent_loop_wait(event_ctx); }</p>

<p>talloc_free(mem_ctx); return EXIT_SUCCESS; }</p>

<p>File descriptor event Support of events on file
descriptors is mainly useful for socket communication but it
certainly works flawlessly with standard streams (stdin,
stdout, stderr) as well. Working asynchronously with file
descriptors enables switching within processing I/O
operations. This ability may rise with a greater number of
I/O operations and such overlapping leads to enhancement of
the throughput.</p>

<p>There are several other functions included in tevent API
related to handling file descriptors (there are too many
functions defined within tevent therefore just some of them
are fully described within this thesis. The declaration of
the rest can be easily found on the library s website or
directly from the source code):</p>

<p>&middot; tevent_fd_set_close_fn() - can add another
function to be called at the moment when a structure tevent
fd is freed. &middot; tevent_fd_set_auto_close() - calling
this function can simplify the maintenance of file
descriptors, because it instructs tevent to close the
appropriate file descriptor when the tevent fd structure is
about to be freed. &middot; tevent_fd_get_flags() - returns
flags which are set on the file descriptor connected with
this tevent fd structure. &middot; tevent_fd_set_flags() -
sets specified flags on the events file descriptor. static
void close_fd(struct tevent_context *ev, struct tevent_fd
*fd_event, int fd, void *private_data) { // processing when
fd_event is freed }</p>

<p>struct static void handler(struct tevent_context *ev,
struct tevent_fd *fde, uint16_t flags, void *private_data) {
// handling event; reading from a file descriptor
tevent_fd_set_close_fn (fd_event, close_fd); }</p>

<p>int run(TALLOC_CTX *mem_ctx, struct tevent_context
*event_ctx, int fd, uint16_t flags, char *buffer) { struct
tevent_fd* fd_event = NULL;</p>

<p>if (flags &amp; TEVENT_FD_READ) { fd_event =
tevent_add_fd(event_ctx, mem_ctx, fd, flags, handler,
buffer); } if (fd_event == NULL) { // error handling }
return tevent_loop_once(); }</p>
