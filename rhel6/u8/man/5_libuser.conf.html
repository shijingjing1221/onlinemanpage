<p>NAME libuser.conf - configuration for libuser and
libuser utilities</p>

<p>FILE FORMAT libuser.conf is a text file. Leading and
trailing white space on each line is ignored. Lines starting
with # are ignored.</p>

<p>The file defines variables grouped into sections. Each
section starts with a section header: [section name] A
single section header can appear more than once in the
file.</p>

<p>The lines following a section header define variables
from that sec- tion: variable = value The value can be
empty.</p>

<p>A variable can have more than one value, specified by
using more than one line defining that variable. All
currently defined variables accept only the first value and
ignore the others, if any.</p>

<p>[defaults] create_modules A list of module names to use
when creating user or group entries, unless the application
specifies a different list. The module names in the list can
be separated using space, tab or comma. Default value is
files shadow.</p>

<p>crypt_style The algorithm to use for password encryption
when creating new passwords. The current algorithm may be
retained when changing a password of an existing user,
depending on the application.</p>

<p>Possible values are des, md5, blowfish, sha256 and
sha512, all case-insensitive. Unrecognized values are
treated as des. Default value is des.</p>

<p>hash_rounds_min, hash_rounds_max These variables specify
an inclusive range of hash rounds used when crypt_style is
sha256 or sha512. A number of hash rounds is chosen from
this interval randomly. A larger number of rounds makes
password checking, and brute-force attempts to guess the
password by reversing the hash, more CPU-intensive. The
number of rounds is restricted to the interval [1000,
999999999].</p>

<p>If only one of the above variables is specified, the
number of rounds used is specified by the other variable. If
neither variable is specified, the number of rounds is
chosen by libc.</p>

<p>mailspooldir The directory containing users mail spool
files. Default value is /var/mail.</p>

<p>moduledir The directory containing libuser modules.
Default value uses the modules installed with libuser,
corresponding to the architecture of the libuser library,
e.g. /usr/lib/libuser or /usr/lib64/libuser (assuming
libuser was configured with --pre- fix=/usr).</p>

<p>modules A list of module names to use when not creating
user or group entries, unless the application specifies a
different list. The module names in the list can be
separated using space, tab or comma. Default value is files
shadow.</p>

<p>skeleton The directory containing files to copy to newly
created home directories. Default value is /etc/skel.</p>

<p>[import] login_defs A path to the login.defs file from
shadow. If this variable is defined, the variables from the
named file are used in place of some libuser variables.
Variables explicitly defined in libuser.conf are not
affected by contents of login.defs.</p>

<p>The following variables are imported: | Variable |
Imported as
---------------------+-------------------------------
ENCRYPT_METHOD | defaults/crypt_style GID_MIN |
groupdefaults/LU_GIDNUMBER MAIL_DIR | defaults/mailspooldir
MD5_CRYPT_ENAB | defaults/crypt_style PASS_MAX_DAYS |
userdefaults/LU_SHADOWMAX PASS_MIN_DAYS |
userdefaults/LU_SHADOWMIN PASS_WARN_AGE |
userdefaults/LU_SHADOWWARNING SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS |
defaults/hash_rounds_min SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS |
defaults/hash_rounds_max UID_MIN |
userdefaults/LU_UIDNUMBER</p>

<p>The following variables are not imported: CREATE_HOME,
GID_MAX, MAIL_FILE, SYSLOG_SG_ENAB, UID_MAX, UMASK,
USERDEL_CMD, USER- GROUPS_ENAB</p>

<p>default_useradd A path to the default/useradd file from
useradd in shadow. If this variable is defined, the
variables from the named file are used in place of some
libuser variables. Variables explicitly defined in
libuser.conf are not affected by contents of
default/useradd.</p>

<p>The following variables are imported: | Variable |
Imported as ---------+--------------------------------
EXPIRE | userdefaults/LU_SHADOWEXPIRE GROUP |
userdefaults/LU_GIDNUMBER HOME |
userdefaults/LU_HOMEDIRECTORY INACTIVE |
userdefaults/LU_SHADOWINACTIVE SHELL |
userdefaults/LU_LOGINSHELL SKEL | defaults/skeleton</p>

<p>The HOME variable value has /%n appended to it before
importing.</p>

<p>[userdefaults] This section defines attribute values of
newly created user entities. There is one special
variable:</p>

<p>LU_UIDNUMBER A decimal number, the first allowed UID
value for regular users (not system users). Default value is
500.</p>

<p>All other variables have the same names as the attribute
names from &lt;libuser/entity.h&gt; and define attribute
values. Either the macro name (e.g. LU_GECOS) or the macro
content (e.g. pw_gecos) can be used; if both are used, the
one appearing later in the configuration file is used.</p>

<p>The % character in the value of the variable introduces
an escape sequence: %n is replaced by the user name, %d is
replaced by current date in days since the epoch, %u is
replaced by the users UID. There is no way to escape the %
character and avoid this substitution.</p>

<p>After the userdefaults section is processed, modules may
define addi- tional attributes or even override the
attributes defined in this sec- tion.</p>

<p>[groupdefaults] The groupdefaults section is similar to
userdefaults. There is one special variable:</p>

<p>LU_GIDNUMBER A decimal number, the first allowed GID
value for regular groups (not system groups). Default value
is 500.</p>

<p>The other variables follow the same rules as in the
userdefaults sec- tion, except that %n and %u are replaced
by the group name and groups GID, respectively.</p>

<p>After the groupdefaults section is processed, modules
may define addi- tional attributes or even override the
attributes defined in this sec- tion.</p>

<p>[files] Configures the files module, which manages
/etc/group and /etc/passwd. The configuration variables are
probably useful only for libuser devel- opment.</p>

<p>directory The directory containing the group and passwd
files. Default value is /etc.</p>

<p>nonroot Allow module initialization when not invoked as
the root user if the value is yes.</p>

<p>[shadow] Configures the files module, which manages
/etc/gshadow and /etc/shadow. The configuration variables
are probably useful only for libuser development.</p>

<p>directory The directory containing the gshadow and
shadow files. Default value is /etc.</p>

<p>nonroot Allow module initialization when not invoked as
the root user if the value is yes.</p>

<p>[ldap] Configures the ldap module, which manages an user
database accessible using LDAP.</p>

<p>userBranch The LDAP suffix for user entities. Default
value is ou=People.</p>

<p>groupBranch The LDAP suffix for group entities. Default
value is ou=Group.</p>

<p>server A domain name or an URI of the LDAP server. The
URI can use the ldap or the ldaps protocol. When a simple
domain name is used, the connection fails if TLS can not be
used; an URI using the ldap protocol allows connection
without TLS. Default value is ldap.</p>

<p>basedn The base DN of the server. Default value is
dc=example,dc=com.</p>

<p>binddn A DN for binding to the server. If the value is
empty or bind- ing using this DN fails, a DN of
uid=user,userBranch,basedn is used, where userBranch and
basedn are variables from this sec- tion and user is the
user name of the invoking user, unless overridden by the
user variable from this section. Default value is
cn=manager,dc=example,dc=com.</p>

<p>user The SASLv2 identity for authenticating to the LDAP
server, also overrides the user name for generating a bind
DN. Default value is the name of the invoking user.</p>

<p>password The password used for a simple bind by default.
If not speci- fied, there is no default and the user must
supply the password each time.</p>

<p>authuser The SASLv2 authorization user, if non-empty.
Default value is empty.</p>

<p>bindtype The list of bind types to use, separated by
commas. Allowed bind types are simple, sasl, and
sasl/mechanism, where mechanism is a SASL mechanism. The
bind types (but not necessarily mecha- nism) are
case-insensitive. If more than one bind type is spec- ified,
their relative order is ignored. Default value is sim-
ple,sasl.</p>

<p>[sasl] Configures the sasl module, which manages a
SASLv2 user database.</p>

<p>appname Name of the SASLv2 application. Default value is
empty.</p>

<p>domain Domain used by libuser for the SASLv2
authentication object. Default value is empty.</p>

<p>BUGS Invalid lines in the configuration file (or the
imported shadow config- uration files) are silently
ignored.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/libuser.conf The default location of the
configuration file. Can be overrid- den by the LIBUSER_CONF
environment variable, except in set-uid or set-gid
programs.</p>
