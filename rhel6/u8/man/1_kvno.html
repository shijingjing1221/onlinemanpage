<p>NAME kvno - print key version numbers of Kerberos
principals</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kvno [-q] [-h] [-c ccache] [-e etype] service1
service2 ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Kvno acquires a service ticket for the
specified Kerberos principals and prints out the key version
numbers of each.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c ccache specifies the name of a credentials
cache to use (if not the default)</p>

<p>-e etype specifies the enctype which will be requested
for the session key of all the services named on the command
line. This is use- ful in certain backward compatibility
situations.</p>

<p>-q suppress printing</p>

<p>-h prints a usage statement and exits</p>

<p>-P specifies that the service1 service2 ... arguments
are to be treated as services for which credentials should
be acquired using constrained delegation. This option is
only valid when used in conjunction with protocol
transition.</p>

<p>-S sname specifies that krb5_sname_to_principal() will
be used to build principal names. If this flag is specified,
the service1 ser- vice2 ... arguments are interpreted as
hostnames (rather than principal names), and sname is
interpreted as the service name.</p>

<p>-U for_user specifies that protocol transition
(S4U2Self) is to be used to acquire a ticket on behalf of
for_user. If constrained delega- tion is not requested, the
service name must match the creden- tials cache client
principal.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Kvno uses the following environment
variable:</p>

<p>KRB5CCNAME Location of the credentials (ticket)
cache.</p>

<p>FILES /tmp/krb5cc_[uid] default location of the
credentials cache ([uid] is the decimal UID of the
user).</p>
