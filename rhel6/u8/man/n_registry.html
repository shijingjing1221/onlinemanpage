<p>NAME registry - Manipulate the Windows registry</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS package require registry 1.1</p>

<p>registry option keyName ?arg arg ...?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The registry package provides a general set
of operations for manipu- lating the Windows registry. The
package implements the registry Tcl command. This command is
only supported on the Windows platform. Warning: this
command should be used with caution as a corrupted reg-
istry can leave your system in an unusable state.</p>

<p>KeyName is the name of a registry key. Registry keys
must be one of the following forms:</p>

<p>hostnamrootnamkeypath</p>

<p>rootnamkeypath</p>

<p>rootname</p>

<p>Hostname specifies the name of any valid Windows host
that exports its registry. The rootname component must be
one of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_USERS, HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT,
HKEY_CURRENT_USER, HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG,
HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA, or HKEY_DYN_DATA. The keypath can be
one or more registry key names separated by backslash (
characters.</p>

<p>Option indicates what to do with the registry key name.
Any unique abbreviation for option is acceptable. The valid
options are:</p>

<p>registry broadcast keyName ?-timeout milliseconds? Sends
a broadcast message to the system and running programs to
notify them of certain updates. This is necessary to
propagate changes to key registry keys like Environment. The
timeout specifies the amount of time, in milliseconds, to
wait for applications to respond to the broadcast message.
It defaults to 3000. The following example demonstrates how
to add a path to the global Environment and notify
applications of the change without requiring a logoff/logon
step (assumes admin privi- leges):</p>

<p>set regPath [join { HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE SYSTEM
CurrentControlSet Control {Session Manager} Environment }
&quot;\&quot;] set curPath [registry get $regPath
&quot;Path&quot;] registry set $regPath &quot;Path&quot;
&quot;$curPath;$addPath&quot; registry broadcast
&quot;Environment&quot;</p>

<p>registry delete keyName ?valueName? If the optional
valueName argument is present, the specified value under
keyName will be deleted from the registry. If the optional
valueName is omitted, the specified key and any subkeys or
values beneath it in the registry hierarchy will be deleted.
If the key could not be deleted then an error is generated.
If the key did not exist, the command has no effect.</p>

<p>registry get keyName valueName Returns the data
associated with the value valueName under the key keyName.
If either the key or the value does not exist, then an error
is generated. For more details on the format of the returned
data, see SUPPORTED TYPES, below.</p>

<p>registry keys keyName ?pattern? If pattern is not
specified, returns a list of names of all the subkeys of
keyName. If pattern is specified, only those names matching
pattern are returned. Matching is determined using the same
rules as for string match. If the specified keyName does not
exist, then an error is generated.</p>

<p>registry set keyName ?valueName data ?type?? If
valueName is not specified, creates the key keyName if it
does not already exist. If valueName is specified, creates
the key keyName and value valueName if necessary. The
contents of valueName are set to data with the type
indicated by type. If type is not specified, the type sz is
assumed. For more details on the data and type arguments,
see SUPPORTED TYPES below.</p>

<p>registry type keyName valueName Returns the type of the
value valueName in the key keyName. For more information on
the possible types, see SUPPORTED TYPES, below.</p>

<p>registry values keyName ?pattern? If pattern is not
specified, returns a list of names of all the values of
keyName. If pattern is specified, only those names matching
pattern are returned. Matching is determined using the same
rules as for string match.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED TYPES Each value under a key in the registry
contains some data of a particu- lar type in a type-specific
representation. The registry command con- verts between this
internal representation and one that can be manipu- lated by
Tcl scripts. In most cases, the data is simply returned as a
Tcl string. The type indicates the intended use for the
data, but does not actually change the representation. For
some types, the registry command returns the data in a
different form to make it easier to manipulate. The
following types are recognized by the registry com-
mand:</p>

<p>binary The registry value contains arbitrary binary
data. The data is represented exactly in Tcl, including any
embedded nulls.</p>

<p>none The registry value contains arbitrary binary data
with no defined type. The data is represented exactly in
Tcl, including any embedded nulls.</p>

<p>sz The registry value contains a null-terminated string.
The data is represented in Tcl as a string.</p>

<p>expand_sz The registry value contains a null-terminated
string that contains unexpanded references to environment
variables in the normal Windows style (for example, %PATH%).
The data is represented in Tcl as a string.</p>

<p>dword The registry value contains a little-endian 32-bit
number. The data is represented in Tcl as a decimal
string.</p>

<p>dword_big_endian The registry value contains a
big-endian 32-bit num- ber. The data is represented in Tcl
as a decimal string.</p>

<p>link The registry value contains a symbolic link. The
data is represented exactly in Tcl, including any embedded
nulls.</p>

<p>multi_sz The registry value contains an array of
null-termi- nated strings. The data is represented in Tcl as
a list of strings.</p>

<p>resource_list The registry value contains a
device-driver resource list. The data is represented exactly
in Tcl, includ- ing any embedded nulls.</p>

<p>In addition to the symbolically named types listed
above, unknown types are identified using a 32-bit integer
that corresponds to the type code returned by the system
interfaces. In this case, the data is repre- sented exactly
in Tcl, including any embedded nulls.</p>

<p>PORTABILITY ISSUES The registry command is only
available on Windows.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Print out how double-clicking on a Tcl script
file will invoke a Tcl interpreter:</p>

<p>package require registry set ext .tcl</p>

<p># Read the type name set type [registry get
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\$ext {}] # Work out where to look for the
command set path HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\$type\Shell\Open\command
# Read the command! set command [registry get $path {}]</p>

<p>puts &quot;$ext opens with $command&quot;</p>
