<p>WAIT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual WAIT(2)</p>

<p>NAME wait, waitpid, waitid - wait for process to change
state</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</p>

<p>pid_t wait(int *status);</p>

<p>pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options);</p>

<p>int waitid(idtype_t idtype, id_t id, siginfo_t *infop,
int options);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>waitid(): _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION All of these system calls are used to wait
for state changes in a child of the calling process, and
obtain information about the child whose state has changed.
A state change is considered to be: the child ter- minated;
the child was stopped by a signal; or the child was resumed
by a signal. In the case of a terminated child, performing a
wait allows the system to release the resources associated
with the child; if a wait is not performed, then the
terminated child remains in a &quot;zombie&quot; state (see
NOTES below).</p>

<p>If a child has already changed state, then these calls
return immedi- ately. Otherwise they block until either a
child changes state or a signal handler interrupts the call
(assuming that system calls are not automatically restarted
using the SA_RESTART flag of sigaction(2)). In the remainder
of this page, a child whose state has changed and which has
not yet been waited upon by one of these system calls is
termed waitable.</p>

<p>wait() and waitpid() The wait() system call suspends
execution of the calling process until one of its children
terminates. The call wait(&amp;status) is equivalent to:</p>

<p>waitpid(-1, &amp;status, 0);</p>

<p>The waitpid() system call suspends execution of the
calling process until a child specified by pid argument has
changed state. By default, waitpid() waits only for
terminated children, but this behavior is mod- ifiable via
the options argument, as described below.</p>

<p>The value of pid can be:</p>

<p>&lt; -1 meaning wait for any child process whose process
group ID is equal to the absolute value of pid.</p>

<p>-1 meaning wait for any child process.</p>

<p>0 meaning wait for any child process whose process group
ID is equal to that of the calling process.</p>

<p>&gt; 0 meaning wait for the child whose process ID is
equal to the value of pid.</p>

<p>The value of options is an OR of zero or more of the
following con- stants:</p>

<p>WNOHANG return immediately if no child has exited.</p>

<p>WUNTRACED also return if a child has stopped (but not
traced via ptrace(2)). Status for traced children which have
stopped is provided even if this option is not
specified.</p>

<p>WCONTINUED (since Linux 2.6.10) also return if a stopped
child has been resumed by delivery of SIGCONT.</p>

<p>(For Linux-only options, see below.)</p>

<p>If status is not NULL, wait() and waitpid() store status
information in the int to which it points. This integer can
be inspected with the following macros (which take the
integer itself as an argument, not a pointer to it, as is
done in wait() and waitpid()!):</p>

<p>WIFEXITED(status) returns true if the child terminated
normally, that is, by call- ing exit(3) or _exit(2), or by
returning from main().</p>

<p>WEXITSTATUS(status) returns the exit status of the
child. This consists of the least significant 8 bits of the
status argument that the child specified in a call to
exit(3) or _exit(2) or as the argument for a return
statement in main(). This macro should only be employed if
WIFEXITED returned true.</p>

<p>WIFSIGNALED(status) returns true if the child process
was terminated by a signal.</p>

<p>WTERMSIG(status) returns the number of the signal that
caused the child process to terminate. This macro should
only be employed if WIFSIGNALED returned true.</p>

<p>WCOREDUMP(status) returns true if the child produced a
core dump. This macro should only be employed if WIFSIGNALED
returned true. This macro is not specified in POSIX.1-2001
and is not available on some Unix implementations (e.g.,
AIX, SunOS). Only use this enclosed in #ifdef WCOREDUMP ...
#endif.</p>

<p>WIFSTOPPED(status) returns true if the child process was
stopped by delivery of a signal; this is only possible if
the call was done using WUN- TRACED or when the child is
being traced (see ptrace(2)).</p>

<p>WSTOPSIG(status) returns the number of the signal which
caused the child to stop. This macro should only be employed
if WIFSTOPPED returned true.</p>

<p>WIFCONTINUED(status) (since Linux 2.6.10) returns true
if the child process was resumed by delivery of SIGCONT.</p>

<p>waitid() The waitid() system call (available since Linux
2.6.9) provides more precise control over which child state
changes to wait for.</p>

<p>The idtype and id arguments select the child(ren) to
wait for, as fol- lows:</p>

<p>idtype == P_PID Wait for the child whose process ID
matches id.</p>

<p>idtype == P_PGID Wait for any child whose process group
ID matches id.</p>

<p>idtype == P_ALL Wait for any child; id is ignored.</p>

<p>The child state changes to wait for are specified by
ORing one or more of the following flags in options:</p>

<p>WEXITED Wait for children that have terminated.</p>

<p>WSTOPPED Wait for children that have been stopped by
delivery of a signal.</p>

<p>WCONTINUED Wait for (previously stopped) children that
have been resumed by delivery of SIGCONT.</p>

<p>The following flags may additionally be ORed in
options:</p>

<p>WNOHANG As for waitpid().</p>

<p>WNOWAIT Leave the child in a waitable state; a later
wait call can be used to again retrieve the child status
information.</p>

<p>Upon successful return, waitid() fills in the following
fields of the siginfo_t structure pointed to by infop:</p>

<p>si_pid The process ID of the child.</p>

<p>si_uid The real user ID of the child. (This field is not
set on most other implementations.)</p>

<p>si_signo Always set to SIGCHLD.</p>

<p>si_status Either the exit status of the child, as given
to _exit(2) (or exit(3)), or the signal that caused the
child to termi- nate, stop, or continue. The si_code field
can be used to determine how to interpret this field.</p>

<p>si_code Set to one of: CLD_EXITED (child called
_exit(2)); CLD_KILLED (child killed by signal); CLD_DUMPED
(child killed by signal, and dumped core); CLD_STOPPED
(child stopped by signal); CLD_TRAPPED (traced child has
trapped); or CLD_CONTINUED (child continued by SIGCONT).</p>

<p>If WNOHANG was specified in options and there were no
children in a waitable state, then waitid() returns 0
immediately and the state of the siginfo_t structure pointed
to by infop is unspecified. To distin- guish this case from
that where a child was in a waitable state, zero out the
si_pid field before the call and check for a non-zero value
in this field after the call returns.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE wait(): on success, returns the process ID
of the terminated child; on error, -1 is returned.</p>

<p>waitpid(): on success, returns the process ID of the
child whose state has changed; if WNOHANG was specified and
one or more child(ren) speci- fied by pid exist, but have
not yet changed state, then 0 is returned. On error, -1 is
returned.</p>

<p>waitid(): returns 0 on success or if WNOHANG was
specified and no child(ren) specified by id has yet changed
state; on error, -1 is returned. Each of these calls sets
errno to an appropriate value in the case of an error.</p>

<p>ERRORS ECHILD (for wait()) The calling process does not
have any unwaited-for children.</p>

<p>ECHILD (for waitpid() or waitid()) The process specified
by pid (wait- pid()) or idtype and id (waitid()) does not
exist or is not a child of the calling process. (This can
happen for ones own child if the action for SIGCHLD is set
to SIG_IGN. See also the Linux Notes section about
threads.)</p>

<p>EINTR WNOHANG was not set and an unblocked signal or a
SIGCHLD was caught; see signal(7).</p>

<p>EINVAL The options argument was invalid.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES A child that terminates, but has not been waited
for becomes a &quot;zom- bie&quot;. The kernel maintains a
minimal set of information about the zom- bie process (PID,
termination status, resource usage information) in order to
allow the parent to later perform a wait to obtain
information about the child. As long as a zombie is not
removed from the system via a wait, it will consume a slot
in the kernel process table, and if this table fills, it
will not be possible to create further processes. If a
parent process terminates, then its &quot;zombie&quot;
children (if any) are adopted by init(8), which
automatically performs a wait to remove the zombies.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 specifies that if the disposition of
SIGCHLD is set to SIG_IGN or the SA_NOCLDWAIT flag is set
for SIGCHLD (see sigaction(2)), then children that terminate
do not become zombies and a call to wait() or waitpid() will
block until all children have terminated, and then fail with
errno set to ECHILD. (The original POSIX standard left the
behavior of setting SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN unspecified. Note
that even though the default disposition of SIGCHLD is
&quot;ignore&quot;, explicitly set- ting the disposition to
SIG_IGN results in different treatment of zom- bie process
children.) Linux 2.6 conforms to this specification. How-
ever, Linux 2.4 (and earlier) does not: if a wait() or
waitpid() call is made while SIGCHLD is being ignored, the
call behaves just as though SIGCHLD were not being ignored,
that is, the call blocks until the next child terminates and
then returns the process ID and status of that child.</p>

<p>Linux Notes In the Linux kernel, a kernel-scheduled
thread is not a distinct con- struct from a process.
Instead, a thread is simply a process that is created using
the Linux-unique clone(2) system call; other routines such
as the portable pthread_create(3) call are implemented using
clone(2). Before Linux 2.4, a thread was just a special case
of a pro- cess, and as a consequence one thread could not
wait on the children of another thread, even when the latter
belongs to the same thread group. However, POSIX prescribes
such functionality, and since Linux 2.4 a thread can, and by
default will, wait on children of other threads in the same
thread group.</p>

<p>The following Linux-specific options are for use with
children created using clone(2); they cannot be used with
waitid():</p>

<p>__WCLONE Wait for &quot;clone&quot; children only. If
omitted then wait for &quot;non- clone&quot; children only.
(A &quot;clone&quot; child is one which delivers no signal,
or a signal other than SIGCHLD to its parent upon termi-
nation.) This option is ignored if __WALL is also
specified.</p>

<p>__WALL (since Linux 2.4) Wait for all children,
regardless of type (&quot;clone&quot; or &quot;non-
clone&quot;).</p>

<p>__WNOTHREAD (since Linux 2.4) Do not wait for children
of other threads in the same thread group. This was the
default before Linux 2.4.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following program demonstrates the use of
fork(2) and waitpid(). The program creates a child process.
If no command-line argument is supplied to the program, then
the child suspends its execution using pause(2), to allow
the user to send signals to the child. Otherwise, if a
command-line argument is supplied, then the child exits
immedi- ately, using the integer supplied on the command
line as the exit sta- tus. The parent process executes a
loop that monitors the child using waitpid(), and uses the
W*() macros described above to analyze the wait status
value.</p>

<p>The following shell session demonstrates the use of the
program:</p>

<p>$ ./a.out &amp; Child PID is 32360 [1] 32359 $ kill
-STOP 32360 stopped by signal 19 $ kill -CONT 32360
continued $ kill -TERM 32360 killed by signal 15 [1]+ Done
./a.out $</p>

status;</p>

<p>cpid = fork(); if (cpid == -1) {

<p>if (cpid == 0) { /* Code executed by child */
printf(&quot;Child PID is %ld0, (long) getpid()); if (argc
== 1) pause(); /* Wait for signals */
_exit(atoi(argv[1]));</p>

<p>} else { /* Code executed by parent */ do { w =
waitpid(cpid, &amp;status, WUNTRACED | WCONTINUED); if (w ==
-1) { perror(&quot;waitpid&quot;); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>if (WIFEXITED(status)) { printf(&quot;exited,
status=%d0, WEXITSTATUS(status)); } else if
(WIFSIGNALED(status)) { printf(&quot;killed by signal %d0,
WTERMSIG(status)); } else if (WIFSTOPPED(status)) {
printf(&quot;stopped by signal %d0, WSTOPSIG(status)); }
else if (WIFCONTINUED(status)) { printf(&quot;continued0); }
} while (!WIFEXITED(status) &amp;&amp;
!WIFSIGNALED(status)); exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); } }</p>
