<p>ENV(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ENV(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME env - set the environment for command
invocation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS env [-i][name=value]... [utility
[argument...]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The env utility shall obtain the current
environment, modify it accord- ing to its arguments, then
invoke the utility named by the utility operand with the
modified environment.</p>

<p>Optional arguments shall be passed to utility.</p>

<p>If no utility operand is specified, the resulting
environment shall be written to the standard output, with
one name= value pair per line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The env utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-i Invoke utility with exactly the environment specified
by the arguments; the inherited environment shall be ignored
com- pletely.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>name=value Arguments of the form name= value shall
modify the execution environment, and shall be placed into
the inherited environment before the utility is invoked.</p>

<p>utility The name of the utility to be invoked. If the
utility operand names any of the special built-in utilities
in Special Built-In Utilities, the results are
undefined.</p>

<p>argument A string to pass as an argument for the invoked
utility.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of env:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>PATH Determine the location of the utility, as described
in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Chapter 8, Environ- ment Variables. If PATH is specified as
a name= value operand to env, the value given shall be used
in the search for utility.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If no utility operand is specified, each name=
value pair in the resulting environment shall be written in
the form:</p>

<p>&quot;%s=%n&quot;, &lt;name&gt;, &lt;value&gt;</p>

<p>If the utility operand is specified, the env utility
shall not write to standard output.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS If utility is invoked, the exit status of
env shall be the exit status of utility; otherwise, the env
utility shall exit with one of the fol- lowing values:</p>

<p>0 The env utility completed successfully.</p>

<p>1-125 An error occurred in the env utility.</p>

<p>126 The utility specified by utility was found but could
not be invoked.</p>

<p>127 The utility specified by utility could not be
found.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The command, env, nice, nohup, time,
and xargs utilities have been specified to use exit code 127
if an error occurs so that applications can distinguish
&quot;failure to find a utility&quot; from &quot;invoked
utility exited with an error indication&quot;. The value 127
was chosen because it is not commonly used for other
meanings; most utilities use small val- ues for &quot;normal
error conditions&quot; and the values above 128 can be con-
fused with termination due to receipt of a signal. The value
126 was chosen in a similar manner to indicate that the
utility could be found, but not invoked. Some scripts
produce meaningful error messages differ- entiating the 126
and 127 cases. The distinction between exit codes 126 and
127 is based on KornShell practice that uses 127 when all
attempts to exec the utility fail with [ENOENT], and uses
126 when any attempt to exec the utility fails for any other
reason.</p>

<p>Historical implementations of the env utility use the
execvp() or exe- clp() functions defined in the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 to invoke the
specified utility; this provides better performance and
keeps users from having to escape characters with special
meaning to the shell. Therefore, shell functions, special
built-ins, and built-ins that are only provided by the shell
are not found.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following command:</p>

<p>env -i PATH=/mybin mygrep xyz myfile</p>

<p>invokes the command mygrep with a new PATH value as the
only entry in its environment. In this case, PATH is used to
locate mygrep, which then must reside in /mybin.</p>

<p>RATIONALE As with all other utilities that invoke other
utilities, this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 only
specifies what env does with standard input, standard
output, standard error, input files, and output files. If a
utility is executed, it is not constrained by the
specification of input and output by env.</p>

<p>The -i option was added to allow the functionality of
the withdrawn - option in a manner compatible with the
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>Some have suggested that env is redundant since the same
effect is achieved by:</p>

<p>name=value ... utility [ argument ... ]</p>

<p>The example is equivalent to env when an environment
variable is being added to the environment of the command,
but not when the environment is being set to the given
value. The env utility also writes out the current
environment if invoked without arguments. There is
sufficient functionality beyond what the example provides to
justify inclusion of env.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
