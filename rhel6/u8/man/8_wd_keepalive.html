<p>NAME wd_keepalive - a simplified software watchdog
daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS wd_keepalive [-c filename|--config-file
filename]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is a simplified version of the watchdog
daemon. It only opens /dev/watchdog, and keeps writing to it
often enough to keep the kernel from resetting, at least
once per minute. Each write delays the reboot time another
minute. After a minute of inactivity the watchdog hardware
will cause a reset. In the case of the software watchdog the
ability to reboot will depend on the state of the machines
and interrupts.</p>

<p>The wd_keepalive daemon can be stopped without causing a
reboot if the device /dev/watchdog is closed correctly,
unless your kernel is com- piled with the
CONFIG_WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT option enabled.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Available command line options are the
following:</p>

<p>-c config-file, --config-file config-file Use
config-file as the configuration file instead of the default
/etc/watchdog.conf.</p>

<p>FILES /dev/watchdog The watchdog device.</p>

<p>/var/run/wd_keepalive.pid The pid file of the running
wd_keepalive.</p>
