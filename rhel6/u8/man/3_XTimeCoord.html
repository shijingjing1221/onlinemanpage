<p>XSendEvent(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XSendEvent(3)</p>

<p>NAME XSendEvent, XDisplayMotionBufferSize,
XGetMotionEvents, XTimeCoord - send events and pointer
motion history structure</p>

<p>SYNTAX Status XSendEvent(Display *display, Window w,
Bool propagate, long event_mask, XEvent *event_send);</p>

<p>unsigned long XDisplayMotionBufferSize(Display
*display);</p>

<p>XTimeCoord *XGetMotionEvents(Display *display, Window w,
Time start, Time stop, int *nevents_return);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>event_mask Specifies the event mask.</p>

<p>event_send Specifies the event that is to be sent.</p>

<p>nevents_return Returns the number of events from the
motion history buffer.</p>

<p>propagate Specifies a Boolean value.</p>

<p>start stop Specify the time interval in which the events
are returned from the motion history buffer. You can pass a
timestamp or CurrentTime. PointerWindow, or InputFocus.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window the window the event is to be
sent to,.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSendEvent function identifies the
destination window, determines which clients should receive
the specified events, and ignores any active grabs. This
function requires you to pass an event mask. For a
discussion of the valid event mask names, see section 10.3.
This func- tion uses the w argument to identify the
destination window as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; If w is PointerWindow, the destination window
is the window that contains the pointer.</p>

<p>&middot; If w is InputFocus and if the focus window
contains the pointer, the destination window is the window
that contains the pointer; otherwise, the destination window
is the focus window.</p>

<p>To determine which clients should receive the specified
events, XSendE- vent uses the propagate argument as
follows:</p>

<p>&middot; If event_mask is the empty set, the event is
sent to the client that created the destination window. If
that client no longer exists, no event is sent.</p>

<p>&middot; If propagate is False, the event is sent to
every client selecting on destination any of the event types
in the event_mask argument.</p>

<p>&middot; If propagate is True and no clients have
selected on destination any of the event types in
event-mask, the destination is replaced with the closest
ancestor of destination for which some client has selected a
type in event-mask and for which no intervening window has
that type in its do-not-propagate-mask. If no such window
exists or if the window is an ancestor of the focus window
and InputFocus was originally specified as the destination,
the event is not sent to any clients. Otherwise, the event
is reported to every client selecting on the final
destination any of the types specified in event_mask.</p>

<p>The event in the XEvent structure must be one of the
core events or one of the events defined by an extension (or
a BadValue error results) so that the X server can correctly
byte-swap the contents as necessary. The contents of the
event are otherwise unaltered and unchecked by the X server
except to force send_event to True in the forwarded event
and to set the serial number in the event correctly;
therefore these fields and the display field are ignored by
XSendEvent.</p>

<p>XSendEvent returns zero if the conversion to wire
protocol format failed and returns nonzero otherwise.
XSendEvent can generate BadValue and BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>The server may retain the recent history of the pointer
motion and do so to a finer granularity than is reported by
MotionNotify events. The XGetMotionEvents function makes
this history available.</p>

<p>The XGetMotionEvents function returns all events in the
motion history buffer that fall between the specified start
and stop times, inclusive, and that have coordinates that
lie within the specified window (includ- ing its borders) at
its present placement. If the server does not sup- port
motion history, if the start time is later than the stop
time, or if the start time is in the future, no events are
returned; XGetMotion- Events returns NULL. If the stop time
is in the future, it is equiva- lent to specifying
CurrentTime. XGetMotionEvents can generate a Bad- Window
error.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The XTimeCoord structure contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { Time time; short x, y; }
XTimeCoord;</p>

<p>The time member is set to the time, in milliseconds. The
x and y mem- bers are set to the coordinates of the pointer
and are reported rela- tive to the origin of the specified
window.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadValue Some numeric value falls outside
the range of values accepted by the request. Unless a
specific range is specified for an argument, the full range
defined by the argument s type is accepted. Any argument
defined as a set of alternatives can generate this
error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
