TRACEHOOK_REPORT_SYS(9)</p>

<p>NAME tracehook_report_syscall_exit - task has just
finished a system call</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void tracehook_report_syscall_exit(struct
pt_regs * regs, int step);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS regs user register state of current task</p>

<p>step nonzero if simulating single-step or block-step</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This will be called if TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE has
been set, when the current task has just finished an
attempted system call. Full user register state is available
here. It is safe to block here, preventing signals from
being processed.</p>

<p>If step is nonzero, this report is also in lieu of the
normal trap that would follow the system call instruction
because user_enable_block_step or user_enable_single_step
was used. In this case, TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE might not be
set.</p>

<p>Called without locks, just before checking for pending
signals.</p>
