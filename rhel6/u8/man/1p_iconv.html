<p>ICONV(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ICONV(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME iconv - codeset conversion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS iconv [-cs] -f frommap -t tomap [file ...]</p>

<p>iconv -f fromcode [-cs] [-t tocode [file ...]</p>

<p>iconv -t tocode [-cs] [-f fromcode] [file ...]</p>

<p>iconv -l</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The iconv utility shall convert the encoding
of characters in file from one codeset to another and write
the results to standard output.</p>

<p>When the options indicate that charmap files are used to
specify the codesets (see OPTIONS), the codeset conversion
shall be accomplished by performing a logical join on the
symbolic character names in the two charmaps. The
implementation need not support the use of charmap files for
codeset conversion unless the POSIX2_LOCALEDEF symbol is
defined on the system.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The iconv utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-c Omit any characters that are invalid in the codeset
of the input file from the output. When -c is not used, the
results of encountering invalid characters in the input
stream (either those that are not characters in the codeset
of the input file or that have no corresponding character in
the codeset of the output file) shall be specified in the
system documentation. The presence or absence of -c shall
not affect the exit status of iconv.</p>

<p>-f fromcodeset</p>

<p>Identify the codeset of the input file. The
implementation shall recognize the following two forms of
the fromcodeset option- argument:</p>

<p>fromcode The fromcode option-argument must not contain a
slash character. It shall be interpreted as the name of one
of the codeset descriptions provided by the implementation
in an unspecified format. Valid values of fromcode are
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>frommap The frommap option-argument must contain a slash
character. It shall be interpreted as the pathname of a
charmap file as defined in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 6.4, Character Set Description
File. If the pathname does not represent a valid, readable
charmap file, the results are undefined.</p>

<p>If this option is omitted, the codeset of the current
locale shall be used.</p>

<p>-l Write all supported fromcode and tocode values to
standard out- put in an unspecified format.</p>

<p>-s Suppress any messages written to standard error
concerning invalid characters. When -s is not used, the
results of encoun- tering invalid characters in the input
stream (either those that are not valid characters in the
codeset of the input file or that have no corresponding
character in the codeset of the out- put file) shall be
specified in the system documentation. The presence or
absence of -s shall not affect the exit status of iconv.</p>

<p>-t tocodeset Identify the codeset to be used for the
output file. The imple- mentation shall recognize the
following two forms of the tocode- set option-argument:</p>

<p>tocode The semantics shall be equivalent to the -f
fromcode option.</p>

<p>tomap The semantics shall be equivalent to the tomap
option.</p>

<p>If this option is omitted, the codeset of the current
locale shall be used.</p>

<p>If either -f or -t represents a charmap file, but the
other does not (or is omitted), or both -f and -t are
omitted, the results are unde- fined.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of an input file. If no file operands
are specified, or if a file operand is, the standard input
shall be used.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied, or if a file operand is-.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input file shall be a text file.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of iconv:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments). During transla- tion of the file, this variable
is superseded by the use of the fromcode
option-argument.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT When the -l option is used, the standard output
shall contain all sup- ported fromcode and tocode values,
written in an unspecified format.</p>

<p>When the -l option is not used, the standard output
shall contain the sequence of characters read from the input
files, translated to the specified codeset. Nothing else
shall be written to the standard out- put.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The user must ensure that both charmap
files use the same symbolic names for characters the two
codesets have in common.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following example converts the contents of
file mail.x400 from the ISO/IEC 6937:1994 standard codeset
to the ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998 standard codeset, and stores the
results in file mail.local:</p>

<p>iconv -f IS6937 -t IS8859 mail.x400 &gt; mail.local</p>

<p>RATIONALE The iconv utility can be used portably only
when the user provides two charmap files as
option-arguments. This is because a single charmap provided
by the user cannot reliably be joined with the names in a
system-provided character set description. The valid values
for from- code and tocode are implementation-defined and do
not have to have any relation to the charmap mechanisms. As
an aid to interactive users, the -l option was adopted from
the Plan 9 operating system. It writes information
concerning these implementation-defined values. The format
is unspecified because there are many possible useful
formats that could be chosen, such as a matrix of valid
combinations of fromcode and tocode. The -l option is not
intended for shell script usage; conform- ing applications
will have to use charmaps.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
