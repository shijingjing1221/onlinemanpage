<p>SPI_REGISTER_MASTER(9) Serial Peripheral Interface (S
SPI_REGISTER_MASTER(9)</p>

<p>NAME spi_register_master - register SPI master
controller</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int spi_register_master(struct spi_master *
master);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS master initialized master, originally from
spi_alloc_master</p>

<p>CONTEXT can sleep</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SPI master controllers connect to their
drivers using some non-SPI bus, such as the platform bus.
The final stage of probe in that code includes calling
spi_register_master to hook up to this SPI bus glue.</p>

<p>SPI controllers use board specific (often SOC specific)
bus numbers, and board-specific addressing for SPI devices
combines those numbers with chip select numbers. Since SPI
does not directly support dynamic device identification,
boards need configuration tables telling which chip is at
which address.</p>

<p>This must be called from context that can sleep. It
returns zero on success, else a negative error code
(dropping the master&acute;s refcount). After a successful
return, the caller is responsible for calling
spi_unregister_master.</p>
