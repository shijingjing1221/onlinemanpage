<p>PAM_WHEEL(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_WHEEL(8)</p>

<p>NAME pam_wheel - Only permit root access to members of
group wheel</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_wheel.so [debug] [deny] [group=name]
[root_only] [trust] [use_uid]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_wheel PAM module is used to enforce
the so-called wheel group. By default it permits root access
to the system if the applicant user is a member of the wheel
group. If no group with this name exist, the module is using
the group with the group-ID 0.</p>

<p>OPTIONS debug Print debug information.</p>

<p>deny Reverse the sense of the auth operation: if the
user is trying to get UID 0 access and is a member of the
wheel group (or the group of the group option), deny access.
Conversely, if the user is not in the group, return
PAM_IGNORE (unless trust was also specified, in which case
we return PAM_SUCCESS).</p>

<p>group=name Instead of checking the wheel or GID 0
groups, use the name group to perform the
authentication.</p>

<p>root_only The check for wheel membership is done
only.</p>

<p>trust The pam_wheel module will return PAM_SUCCESS
instead of PAM_IGNORE if the user is a member of the wheel
group (thus with a little play stacking the modules the
wheel members may be able to su to root without being
prompted for a passwd).</p>

<p>use_uid The check for wheel membership will be done
against the current uid instead of the original one (useful
when jumping with su from one account to another for
example).</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED The auth and account module types
are provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_AUTH_ERR Authentication failure.</p>

<p>PAM_BUF_ERR Memory buffer error.</p>

<p>PAM_IGNORE The return value should be ignored by PAM
dispatch.</p>

<p>PAM_PERM_DENY Permission denied.</p>

<p>PAM_SERVICE_ERR Cannot determine the user name.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS Success.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN User not known.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The root account gains access by default
(rootok), only wheel members can become root (wheel) but
Unix authenticate non-root applicants.</p>

<p>su auth sufficient pam_rootok.so su auth required
pam_wheel.so su auth required pam_unix.so</p>
