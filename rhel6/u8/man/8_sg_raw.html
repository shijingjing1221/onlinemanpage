<p>NAME sg_raw - sends an arbitrary SCSI command to a
device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_raw [OPTIONS] DEVICE CDB0 CDB1 ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This utility sends an arbitrary SCSI command
(between 6 and 256 bytes) to the DEVICE. There may be no
associated data transfer; or data may be read from a file
and sent to the DEVICE; or data may be received from the
DEVICE and then displayed or written to a file.</p>

<p>The SCSI command may be between 6 and 256 bytes long.
Each command byte is specified in plain hex format (00..FF)
without a prefix or suffix. See EXAMPLES section below.</p>

<p>The commands pass through a generic SCSI interface which
is implemented for several operating systems including
Linux, FreeBSD and Windows.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-b, --binary Dump data in binary form, even when writing
to stdout.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display usage information and exit.</p>

<p>-i, --infile=IFILE Read data from IFILE instead of
stdin. This option is ignored if --send is not
specified.</p>

<p>-k, --skip=LEN Skip the first LEN bytes of the input
file or stream. This option is ignored if --send is not
specified.</p>

<p>-n, --nosense Dont display SCSI Sense information.</p>

<p>-o, --outfile=OFILE Write data received from the DEVICE
to OFILE. The data is writ- ten in binary. By default, data
is dumped in hex format to std- out. If OFILE is - then data
is dumped in binary to stdout. This option is ignored if
--request is not specified.</p>

<p>-r, --request=RLEN Expect to receive up to RLEN bytes of
data from the DEVICE. RLEN may be suffixed with k to use
kilobytes (1024 bytes) instead of bytes. This option and
--send are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>-s, --send=SLEN Read SLEN bytes of data, either from
stdin or from a file, and send them to the DEVICE. This
option and --request are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>-t, --timeout=SEC Wait up to SEC seconds for command
completion (default: 20). Note that if a command times out
the operating system may start by aborting the command and
if that is unsuccessful it may attempt to reset the
device.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Increase level of verbosity. Can be used
multiple times.</p>

<p>-V, --version Display version and license information
and exit.</p>

<p>NOTES The sg_inq utility can be used to send an INQUIRY
command to a device to determine its peripheral device type
(e.g. 1 for a streaming device (tape drive)) which
determines which SCSI command sets a device should support
(e.g. SPC and SSC). The sg_vpd utility probes the Vital
Product Pages of a devices which may contain useful
information.</p>

<p>The ability to send more than a 16 byte CDB (in some
cases 12 byte CDB) may be restricted by the pass-through
interface, the low level driver or the transport.
Bidirectional data commands are no yet supported.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES sg_raw /dev/scd0 1b 00 00 00 02 00 Eject the
medium in CD drive /dev/scd0.</p>

<p>sg_raw -r 1k /dev/sg0 12 00 00 00 60 00 Perform an
INQUIRY on /dev/sg0 and dump the response data (up to 1024
bytes) to stdout.</p>

<p>sg_raw -s 512 -i i512.bin /dev/sda 3b 02 00 00 00 00 00
02 00 00 Showing an example of writing 512 bytes to a sector
on a disk is a little dangerous. Instead this example will
read i512.bin (assumed to be 512 bytes long) and use the
SCSI WRITE BUFFER command to send it to the &quot;data&quot;
buffer (that is mode 2). This is a safe operation.</p>

<p>sg_raw -r 512 -o o512.bin /dev/sda 3c 02 00 00 00 00 00
02 00 00 This will use the SCSI READ BUFFER command to read
512 bytes from the &quot;data&quot; buffer (i.e. mode 2)
then write it to the o512.bin file. When used in conjunction
with the previous exam- ple, if both commands work then cmp
i512.bin o512.bin should show a match.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_raw is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
