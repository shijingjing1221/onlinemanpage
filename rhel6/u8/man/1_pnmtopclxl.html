<p>NAME pnmtopclxl - convert a PNM image to an HP LaserJet
PCL XL printer stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmtopclxl [-dpi N] [-xoffs N] [-yoffs N]
[-center] [-duplex {verti- cal|horizontal}] [-format
paperformat] [-feeder N] [-copies N] [-col- orok]
[-rendergray] [-jobsetup=filename] pnmfile1 pnmfile2 ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmtopclxl reads one or more PNM input streams, each
containing one or more PNM images, and generates a sequence
of output pages in the HP PCL-XL (formerly named PCL 6)
printer control language. You can send this stream to a
PCL-XL printer to print the images.</p>

<p>If the input is PPM, the output is a color printer
stream (the PCL color space is RGB). Otherwise, the output
is grayscale (the PCL color space is grayscale). If you want
a grayscale output from a color input, run your input
through ppmtopgm(1).Seethe -colorok option for more
information about choosing between color and grayscale.</p>

<p>The output goes to Standard Output. All of the pages go
to one file, concatenated in the same order as the input
images.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -dpi N This option selects the resolution of the
image (not the printer!). N is the resolution in dots per
inch, from 1 to 65535. The default is 300.</p>

<p>-xoffs N This option and -yoffs determine the location
on the page of the upper left corner of each image. Note
that the image may have built in borders tool, which would
make the main image within more left and down that what you
specify here.</p>

<p>-xoffs and -yoffs specify the distance from the left of
the page and from the top of the page, respectively, in
inches, of the upper left corner of the image. The default
for each is zero.</p>

<p>These options are meaningless if you specify
-center.</p>

<p>-yoffs N See -xoffs.</p>

<p>-center This option tells pnmtopclxl to center each
image on the page. If you don t specify this option, the
position of an image on the page is determined by -xoffs and
-yoffs (or their defaults).</p>

<p>-duplex {vertical|horizontal} This option causes
pnmtopclxl to create a printer stream that prints pages on
boths sides of the sheet of paper. vertical means to print
them so that the left edge of both pages is on the same edge
of the sheet, while horizontal means the more usual
duplexing where the top of both pages is on the same edge of
the sheet.</p>

<p>-format paperformat This option selects the media (e.g.
paper size) that the printer control stream specifies.
paperformat is one of the following self-explanatory
keywords:</p>

<p>&middot; letter</p>

<p>&middot; legal</p>

<p>&middot; a3</p>

<p>&middot; a4</p>

<p>&middot; a5</p>

<p>&middot; a6</p>

<p>&middot; jb4</p>

<p>&middot; jb5</p>

<p>&middot; jb6</p>

<p>&middot; exec</p>

<p>&middot; ledger</p>

<p>&middot; b5envelope</p>

<p>&middot; c5envelope</p>

<p>&middot; com10envelope</p>

<p>&middot; monarchenvelope</p>

<p>&middot; dlenvelope</p>

<p>&middot; jpostcard</p>

<p>&middot; jdoublepostcard</p>

<p>The default is &quot;letter&quot;.</p>

<p>-feeder N This options selects the media source (e.g.
paper tray) that the printer control stream specifies.</p>

<p>-copies N This option specifies the number of copies
that the printer con- trol stream tells the printer to
print.</p>

<p>-colorok This option simply tells pnmtopclxl not to warn
you if you sup- ply a color input and therefore get color
output. By default, pnmtopclxl issues a warning any time it
produces a color printer stream because it is usually a
mistake. Its a mistake because PCL XL is mainly used for
laser printers, and laser printers are mainly black and
white. If you send a color print stream to a black and white
printer, it typically refuses to print anything, and even if
it manages to convert it to black and white and print it, it
takes 3 times as long to transmit a color stream to the
printer than to transmit the grayscale image that gives the
same result.</p>

<p>-rendergray This option causes pnmtopclxl to include in
the output stream a command to set the RENDERMODE
environment variable to GRAYSCALE, which typically causes
the printer to print in grayscale regard- less of the colors
in the input, and may cause it to run much faster even if
the image is grayscale anyway.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.29 (August 2005).</p>

<p>-jobsetup=filename This option causes pnmtopclxl to
include arbitary job setup PJL commands at the beginning of
the output stream. It reads them from the named file.</p>

<p>pnmtopclxl does not inspect these commands in any way,
but it does expect them to be job setup commands. If you
have garbage in your file, you will hear from the
printer.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.29 (August 2005).</p>

<p>HISTORY pnmtopclxl was added to Netpbm in Release 10.6
(July 2002). It was contributed by Jochen Karrer.</p>
