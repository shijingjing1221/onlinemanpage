<p>NAME ldns-walk - Retrieve the contents of a DNSSEC
signed zone</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ldns-walk [ OPTION ] ZONE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ldns-walk is used to retrieve the contents
of a DNSSEC signed zone. It does this through NSEC-walking
(following the chain of NSEC records) and guessing the next
non-existent owner name for each NSEC.</p>

<p>Note that it might get stuck on some wildcard records
when used through a caching forwarder. This problem can be
circumvented by querying the authoritative nameserver
directly (with the @ argument).</p>

<p>Of course the nameserver that is used must be
DNSSEC-aware.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -4 Use only IPv4.</p>

<p>-6 Use only IPv6.</p>

<p>-f Do a full zone walk; by default, ldns-walk will only
show the names, and types present at those names. If this
option is given, all resource records will be printed.</p>

<p>-s name Start the walk with this owner name. Useful when
continuing the walk for a large zone.</p>

<p>-v verbosity Verbosity level [1-5].</p>

<p>@ nameserver Send the queries to this nameserver.</p>

<p>BUGS The full zone walk function is not complete yet, it
does not correctly print delegation records</p>
