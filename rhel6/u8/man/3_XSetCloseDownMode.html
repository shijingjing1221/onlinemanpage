<p>XSetCloseDownMode(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XSetCloseDownMode(3)</p>

<p>NAME XSetCloseDownMode, XKillClient - control
clients</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XSetCloseDownMode(Display *display, int
close_mode);</p>

<p>int XKillClient(Display *display, XID resource);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS close_mode Specifies the client close-down
mode. You can pass Destroy- All, RetainPermanent, or
RetainTemporary.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>resource Specifies any resource associated with the
client that you want to destroy or AllTemporary.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSetCloseDownMode defines what will
happen to the clients resources at connection close. A
connection starts in DestroyAll mode. For information on
what happens to the client s resources when the close_mode
argument is RetainPermanent or RetainTemporary, see section
2.6.</p>

<p>XSetCloseDownMode can generate a BadValue error.</p>

<p>The XKillClient function forces a close down of the
client that created the resource if a valid resource is
specified. If the client has already terminated in either
RetainPermanent or RetainTemporary mode, all of the client s
resources are destroyed. If AllTemporary is speci- fied, the
resources of all clients that have terminated in
RetainTempo- rary are destroyed (see section 2.5). This
permits implementation of window manager facilities that aid
debugging. A client can set its close-down mode to
RetainTemporary. If the client then crashes, its windows
would not be destroyed. The programmer can then inspect the
application s window tree and use the window manager to
destroy the zombie windows.</p>

<p>XKillClient can generate a BadValue error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadValue Some numeric value falls outside
the range of values accepted by the request. Unless a
specific range is specified for an argument, the full range
defined by the argument s type is accepted. Any argument
defined as a set of alternatives can generate this
error.</p>
