<p>NAME glutDestroyWindow - Destroy a window and associated
subwindows</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>void glutDestroyWindow(int windowID);</p>

<p>PARAMETERS windowID Window identifier</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION After this function is invoked, the only
further event that may be deliv- ered for your window is the
one for its destruction. All other events should be
discarded.</p>

<p>Once a window has been destroyed, further attempts to
use the window named by windowID are undefined. OpenGLUT
generally tries to be sensi- ble, and should not recycle the
dead windowID, but you should treat a destroyed window much
like a pointer to deallocated memory and try not to use
it.</p>
