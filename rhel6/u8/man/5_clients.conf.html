<p>clients.conf(5) FreeRADIUS client configuration
clients.conf(5)</p>

<p>NAME clients.conf - FreeRADIUS client configuration</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The clients.conf file contains definitions
of RADIUS clients.</p>

<p>The information in this file overrides any information
provided in the deprecated clients(5) and naslist(5)
files.</p>

<p>The file format is the same as that used for
radiusd.conf. See radiusd.conf(5) for more details.</p>

<p>Each RADIUS client entry has the following basic
form:</p>

<p>client &lt;short-name&gt; { &lt;attribute&gt; =
&lt;value&gt; }</p>

<p>ATTRIBUTES The attributes that can appear in a client
section are listed below. Required attributes are labelled
as such. All other attributes are optional.</p>

<p>ipaddr [Required] The IP address of the client. For
IPv6, use &quot;ipv6addr&quot;</p>

<p>secret [Required] The RADIUS shared secret used for
communication between the client/NAS and the RADIUS
server.</p>

<p>shortname [optional] A short alias that can be used in
place of the IP address or fully qualified hostname provided
in the first line of the section.</p>

<p>nastype The nastype attribute is used to tell the
checkrad.pl script which NAS-specific method it should use
when checking simultaneous use.</p>

<p>The following values are currently recognized: cisco
computone livingston max40xx multitech netserver pathras
patton portslave tc usrhiper other</p>

<p>login Reserved for future use.</p>

<p>password Reserved for future use.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES client localhost { ipaddr = 127.0.0.1 secret =
testing123 shortname = localhost nastype = other }</p>

<p>This adds a client for the loopback address. This is
useful in testing the server locally, for example with
radclient(1).</p>

<p>client private-network-1 { ipaddr = 192.168.0.0 netmask
= 24 secret = testing123-1 shortname = private-network-1
}</p>

<p>This entry represents any client from the 192.168.0.0/24
network.</p>

<p>The old-style format from 1.x is still accepted by the
server, but that form is deprecated.</p>
