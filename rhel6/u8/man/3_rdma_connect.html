<p>RDMA_CONNECT(3) Librdmacm Programmer s Manual
RDMA_CONNECT(3)</p>

<p>NAME rdma_connect - Initiate an active connection
request.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;rdma/rdma_cma.h&gt;</p>

<p>int rdma_connect (struct rdma_cm_id *id, struct
rdma_conn_param *conn_param);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS id RDMA identifier.</p>

<p>conn_param connection parameters. See CONNECTION
PROPERTIES below for details.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For an rdma_cm_id of type RDMA_PS_TCP, this
call initiates a connection request to a remote destination.
For an rdma_cm_id of type RDMA_PS_UDP, it initiates a lookup
of the remote QP providing the data- gram service.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error. If an
error occurs, errno will be set to indicate the failure
reason.</p>

<p>NOTES Users must have resolved a route to the
destination address by having called rdma_resolve_route or
rdma_create_ep before calling this rou- tine.</p>

<p>CONNECTION PROPERTIES The following properties are used
to configure the communication and specified by the
conn_param parameter when connecting or establishing
datagram communication.</p>

<p>private_data References a user-controlled data buffer.
The contents of the buffer are copied and transparently
passed to the remote side as part of the communication
request. May be NULL if private_data is not required.</p>

<p>private_data_len Specifies the size of the
user-controlled data buffer. Note that the actual amount of
data transferred to the remote side is transport dependent
and may be larger than that requested.</p>

<p>responder_resources The maximum number of outstanding
RDMA read and atomic opera- tions that the local side will
accept from the remote side. Applies only to RDMA_PS_TCP.
This value must be less than or equal to the local RDMA
device attribute max_qp_rd_atom and remote RDMA device
attribute max_qp_init_rd_atom. The remote endpoint can
adjust this value when accepting the connection.</p>

<p>initiator_depth The maximum number of outstanding RDMA
read and atomic opera- tions that the local side will have
to the remote side. Applies only to RDMA_PS_TCP. This value
must be less than or equal to the local RDMA device
attribute max_qp_init_rd_atom and remote RDMA device
attribute max_qp_rd_atom. The remote endpoint can adjust
this value when accepting the connection.</p>

<p>flow_control Specifies if hardware flow control is
available. This value is exchanged with the remote peer and
is not used to configure the QP. Applies only to
RDMA_PS_TCP.</p>

<p>retry_count The maximum number of times that a data
transfer operation should be retried on the connection when
an error occurs. This setting controls the number of times
to retry send, RDMA, and atomic operations when timeouts
occur. Applies only to RDMA_PS_TCP.</p>

<p>rnr_retry_count The maximum number of times that a send
operation from the remote peer should be retried on a
connection after receiving a receiver not ready (RNR) error.
RNR errors are generated when a send request arrives before
a buffer has been posted to receive the incoming data.
Applies only to RDMA_PS_TCP.</p>

<p>srq Specifies if the QP associated with the connection
is using a shared receive queue. This field is ignored by
the library if a QP has been created on the rdma_cm_id.
Applies only to RDMA_PS_TCP.</p>

<p>qp_num Specifies the QP number associated with the
connection. This field is ignored by the library if a QP has
been created on the rdma_cm_id. Applies only to
RDMA_PS_TCP.</p>

<p>INFINIBAND SPECIFIC In addition to the connection
properties defined above, InfiniBand QPs are configured with
minimum RNR NAK timer and local ACK timeout values. The
minimum RNR NAK timer value is set to 0, for a delay of 655
ms. The local ACK timeout is calculated based on the packet
lifetime and local HCA ACK delay. The packet lifetime is
determined by the Infini- Band Subnet Administrator and is
part of the resolved route (path record) information. The
HCA ACK delay is a property of the locally used HCA.</p>

<p>Retry count and RNR retry count values are 3-bit
values.</p>

<p>The length of the private data provided by the user is
limited to 56 bytes for RDMA_PS_TCP, or 180 bytes for
RDMA_PS_UDP.</p>

<p>IWARP SPECIFIC Connections established over iWarp RDMA
devices currently require that the active side of the
connection send the first message.</p>
