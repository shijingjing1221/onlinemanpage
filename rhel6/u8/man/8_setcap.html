<p>NAME setcap - set file capabilities</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS setcap [-q] [-v] (capabilities|-|-r) filename [
... capabilitiesN fileN ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In the absence of the -v (verify) option
setcap sets the capabilities of each specified filename to
the capabilities specified. The -v option is used to verify
that the specified capabilities are currently associated
with the file.</p>

<p>The capabilities are specified in the form described in
cap_from_text(3).</p>

<p>The special capability string,, can be used to indicate
that capa- bilities are read from the standard input. In
such cases, the capabil- ity set is terminated with a blank
line.</p>

<p>The special capability string, -, is used to remove a
capability set from a file.</p>

<p>The -q flag is used to make the program less verbose in
its output.</p>

code if successful. On fail- ure, the exit code is 1.</p>
