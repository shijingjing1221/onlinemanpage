<p>READOM(1) Schily&acute;s USER COMMANDS READOM(1)</p>

<p>NAME readom - read or write data Compact Discs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS readom dev=device [ options ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Readom is used to read or write Compact
Discs.</p>

<p>The device refers to a device location similar to the
one used in the wodim command. Refer to its manpage for
details.</p>

<p>Also note that this version of readom uses a modified
libusal library which has a different behaviour compared to
the one distributed by its original author.</p>

<p>OPTIONS If no options except the dev= option have been
specified, readom goes into interactive mode. Select a
primary function and then follow the instructions.</p>

<p>-version Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>dev=target Sets the SCSI target for the drive, see notes
above. A typical device specification is dev=6,0 . If a
filename must be pro- vided together with the numerical
target specification, the filename is implementation
specific. The correct filename in this case can be found in
the system specific manuals of the target operating system.
On a FreeBSD system without CAM sup- port, you need to use
the control device (e.g. /dev/rcd0.ctl). A correct device
specification in this case may be dev=/dev/rcd0.ctl:@ .</p>

<p>On Linux, drives connected to a parallel port adapter
are mapped to a virtual SCSI bus. Different adapters are
mapped to differ- ent targets on this virtual SCSI bus.</p>

<p>If no dev option is present, readom will try to get the
device from the CDR_DEVICE environment.</p>

<p>If the argument to the dev= option does not contain the
charac- ters ,, /, @ or :, it is interpreted as an label
name that may be found in the file /etc/wodim.conf (see
FILES sec- tion).</p>

<p>timeout=# Set the default SCSI command timeout value to
# seconds. The default SCSI command timeout is the minimum
timeout used for sending SCSI commands. If a SCSI command
fails due to a time- out, you may try to raise the default
SCSI command timeout above the timeout value of the failed
command. If the command runs correctly with a raised command
timeout, please report the bet- ter timeout value and the
corresponding command to the author of the program. If no
timeout option is present, a default timeout of 40 seconds
is used.</p>

<p>debug=#, -d Set the misc debug value to # (with debug=#)
or increment the misc debug level by one (with -d). If you
specify -dd, this equals to debug=2. This may help to find
problems while opening a driver for libusal. as well as with
sector sizes and sector types. Using -debug slows down the
process and may be the rea- son for a buffer underrun.</p>

<p>kdebug=#, kd=# Tell the usal-driver to modify the kernel
debug value while SCSI commands are running.</p>

<p>-silent, -s Do not print out a status report for failed
SCSI commands.</p>

<p>-v Increment the level of general verbosity by one. This
is used e.g. to display the progress of the process.</p>

<p>-V Increment the verbose level with respect of SCSI
command trans- port by one. This helps to debug problems
during the process, that occur in the CD-Recorder. If you
get incomprehensible error messages you should use this flag
to get more detailed output. -VV will show data buffer
content in addition. Using -V or -VV slows down the
process.</p>

<p>f=file Specify the filename where the output should be
written or the input should be taken from. Using - as
filename will cause readom to use stdout resp. stdin.</p>

<p>-w Switch to write mode. If this option is not present,
readom reads from the specified device.</p>

<p>-c2scan Scans the whole CD or the range specified by the
sectors=range for C2 errors. C2 errors are errors that are
uncorrectable after the second stage of the 24/28 + 28/32
Reed Solomon correction system at audio level (2352 bytes
sector size). If an audio CD has C2 errors, interpolation is
needed to hide the errors. If a data CD has C2 errors, these
errors are in most cases corrected by the ECC/EDC code that
makes 2352 bytes out of 2048 data bytes. The ECC/EDC code
should be able to correct about 100 C2 error bytes per
sector.</p>

<p>If you find C2 errors you may want to reduce the speed
using the speed= option as C2 errors may be a result of
dynamic unbalance on the medium.</p>

<p>-scanbus Scan all SCSI devices on all SCSI busses and
print the inquiry strings. This option may be used to find
SCSI address of the devices on a system. The numbers printed
out as labels are com- puted by: bus * 100 + target</p>

<p>sectors=range Specify a sector range that should be
read. The range is speci- fied by the starting sector
number, a minus sign and the ending sector number. The end
sector is not included in the list, so sectors=0-0 will not
read anything and may be used to check for a CD in the
drive.</p>

<p>speed=# Set the speed factor of the read or write
process to #. # is an integer, representing a multiple of
the audio speed. This is about 150 KB/s for CD-ROM and about
172 KB/s for CD-Audio. If no speed option is present, readom
will use maximum speed. Only MMC compliant drives will
benefit from this option. The speed of non MMC drives is not
changed.</p>

<p>Using a lower speed may increase the readability of a CD
or DVD.</p>

<p>ts=# Set the maximum transfer size for a single SCSI
command to #. The syntax for the ts= option is the same as
for wodim fs=# or sdd bs=#.</p>

<p>If no ts= option has been specified, readom defaults to
a trans- fer size of 256 kB. If libusal gets lower values
from the oper- ating system, the value is reduced to the
maximum value that is possible with the current operating
system. Sometimes, it may help to further reduce the
transfer size or to enhance it, but note that it may take a
long time to find a better value by experimenting with the
ts= option.</p>

<p>-notrunc Do not truncate the output file when opening
it.</p>

<p>-fulltoc Retrieve a full TOC from the current disk and
print it in hex.</p>

<p>-clone Do a clone read. Read the CD with all sub-channel
data and a full TOC. The full TOC data will be put into a
file with simi- lar name as with the f= option but the
suffix .toc added.</p>

<p>-noerror Do not abort if the high level error checking
in readom found an uncorrectable error in the data
stream.</p>

<p>-nocorr Switch the drive into a mode where it ignores
read errors in data sectors that are a result of
uncorrectable ECC/EDC errors before reading. If readom
completes, the error recovery mode of the drive is switched
back to the remembered old mode.</p>

<p>retries=# Set the retry count for high level retries in
readom to #. The default is to do 128 retries which may be
too much if you like to read a CD with many unreadable
sectors.</p>

<p>-overhead Meter the SCSI command overhead time. This is
done by executing several commands 1000 times and printing
the total time used. If you divide the displayed times by
1000, you get the average overhead time for a single
command.</p>

<p>meshpoints=# Print read-speed at # locations. The
purpose of this option is to create a list of read speed
values suitable for e.g. gnu- plot. The speed values are
calculated assuming that 1000 bytes are one kilobyte as
documented in the SCSI standard. The output data created for
this purpose is written to stdout.</p>

<p>-factor Output the speed values for meshpoints=# as
factor based on sin- gle speed of the current medium. This
only works if readom is able to determine the current medium
type.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES For all examples below, it will be assumed that
the drive is connected to the primary SCSI bus of the
machine. The SCSI target id is set to 2.</p>

<p>To read the complete media from a CD-ROM writing the
data to the file cdimage.raw:</p>

<p>readom dev=2,0 f=cdimage.raw</p>

<p>To read sectors from range 150 ... 10000 from a CD-ROM
writing the data to the file cdimage.raw:</p>

<p>readom dev=2,0 sectors=150-10000 f=cdimage.raw</p>

<p>To write the data from the file cdimage.raw (e.g. a
filesystem image from genisoimage) to a DVD-RAM, call:</p>

<p>readom dev=2,0 -w f=cdimage.raw</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT RSH If the RSH environment is present, the
remote connection will not be created via rcmd(3) but by
calling the program pointed to by RSH. Use e.g.
RSH=/usr/bin/ssh to create a secure shell connection.</p>

<p>Note that this forces wodim to create a pipe to the
rsh(1) pro- gram and disallows wodim to directly access the
network socket to the remote server. This makes it
impossible to set up per- formance parameters and slows down
the connection compared to a root initiated rcmd(3)
connection.</p>

<p>RSCSI If the RSCSI environment is present, the remote
SCSI server will not be the program /opt/schily/sbin/rscsi
but the program pointed to by RSCSI. Note that the remote
SCSI server program name will be ignored if you log in using
an account that has been created with a remote SCSI server
program as login shell.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO wodim(1), genisoimage(1), rcmd(3), ssh(1).</p>

<p>NOTES Unless you want to risk getting problems, readom
should be run as root. If you don t want to allow users to
become root on your system, readom may safely be installed
suid root. For more information see the addi- tional notes
of your system/program distribution or README.suidroot which
is part of the Cdrkit source.</p>

<p>Documentation of the wodim program contains more
technical details which could also apply to readom.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS A typical error message for a SCSI command
looks like:</p>

<p>readom: I/O error. test unit ready: scsi sendcmd: no
error CDB: 00 20 00 00 00 00 status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION)
Sense Bytes: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 25 00 00 00
00 00 Sense Key: 0x5 Illegal Request, Segment 0 Sense Code:
0x25 Qual 0x00 (logical unit not supported) Fru 0x0 Sense
flags: Blk 0 (not valid) cmd finished after 0.002s timeout
40s</p>

<p>The first line gives information about the transport of
the command. The text after the first colon gives the error
text for the system call from the view of the kernel. It
usually is: I/O error unless other problems happen. The next
words contain a short description for the SCSI command that
fails. The rest of the line tells you if there were any
problems for the transport of the command over the SCSI bus.
fatal error means that it was not possible to transport the
command (i.e. no device present at the requested SCSI
address).</p>

<p>The second line prints the SCSI command descriptor block
for the failed command.</p>

<p>The third line gives information on the SCSI status code
returned by the command, if the transport of the command
succeeds. This is error information from the SCSI
device.</p>

<p>The fourth line is a hex dump of the auto request sense
information for the command.</p>

<p>The fifth line is the error text for the sense key if
available, followed by the segment number that is only valid
if the command was a copy command. If the error message is
not directly related to the cur- rent command, the text
deferred error is appended.</p>

<p>The sixth line is the error text for the sense code and
the sense qual- ifier if available. If the type of the
device is known, the sense data is decoded from tables in
scsierrs.c . The text is followed by the error value for a
field replaceable unit.</p>

<p>The seventh line prints the block number that is related
to the failed command and text for several error flags. The
block number may not be valid.</p>

<p>The eight line reports the timeout set up for this
command and the time that the command really needed to
complete.</p>

<p>BUGS The readom program described here is the Cdrkit
spinoff from the origi- nal readcd application (see AUTHOR
section for details). It may contain bugs not present in the
original implementation.</p>

<p>It is definitely less portable than the original
implementation.</p>

<p>For platform specific bugs, see the corresponding
README.platform file in the Cdrkit documentation (eg.
README.linux).</p>
