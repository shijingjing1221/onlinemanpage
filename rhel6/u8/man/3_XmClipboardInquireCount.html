<p>NAME XmClipboardInquireCount A clipboard function that
returns the number of data item formats</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardInquireCount (display, window, count,
max_format_name_length) Display * display; Window window;
int * count; unsigned long * max_format_name_length;
(void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardInquireCount returns the number
of data item formats avail- able for the data item in the
clipboard. This function also returns the maximum
name-length for all formats in which the data item is
stored.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window ID of a widget that relates
the applica- tion window to the clipboard. The widgets
window ID can be obtained through XtWindow. The same
application instance should pass the same window ID to each
of the clipboard func- tions that it calls.</p>

<p>count Returns the number of data item formats available
for the data item in the clipboard. If no formats are
available, this argument equals 0 (zero). The count includes
the formats that were passed by name.</p>

<p>max_format_name_length Specifies the maximum length of
all format names for the data item in the clipboard.</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardSuccess The function was
successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>

<p>XmClipboardNoData The function could not find data on
the clipboard correspond- ing to the format requested. This
could occur because the clipboard is empty; there is data on
the clipboard, but not in the requested format; or the data
in the requested format was passed by name and is no longer
available.</p>
