<p>PAM_SETCRED(3) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_SETCRED(3)</p>

<p>NAME pam_setcred - establish / delete user
credentials</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pam_setcred(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_setcred function is used to
establish, maintain and delete the credentials of a user. It
should be called to set the credentials after a user has
been authenticated and before a session is opened for the
user (with pam_open_session(3)). The credentials should be
deleted after the session has been closed (with
pam_close_session(3)).</p>

<p>A credential is something that the user possesses. It is
some property, such as a Kerberos ticket, or a supplementary
group membership that make up the uniqueness of a given
user. On a Linux system the user&acute;s UID and GID&acute;s
are credentials too. However, it has been decided that these
properties (along with the default supplementary groups of
which the user is a member) are credentials that should be
set directly by the application and not by PAM. Such
credentials should be established, by the application, prior
to a call to this function. For example, initgroups(2) (or
equivalent) should have been performed.</p>

<p>Valid flags, any one of which, may be logically
OR&acute;d with PAM_SILENT, are:</p>

<p>PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED Initialize the credentials for the
user.</p>

<p>PAM_DELETE_CRED Delete the user&acute;s credentials.</p>

<p>PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED Fully reinitialize the
user&acute;s credentials.</p>

<p>PAM_REFRESH_CRED Extend the lifetime of the existing
credentials.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_BUF_ERR Memory buffer error.</p>

<p>PAM_CRED_ERR Failed to set user credentials.</p>

<p>PAM_CRED_EXPIRED User credentials are expired.</p>

<p>PAM_CRED_UNAVAIL Failed to retrieve user
credentials.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS Data was successful stored.</p>

<p>PAM_SYSTEM_ERR A NULL pointer was submitted as PAM
handle, the function was called by a module or another
system error occured.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN User is not known to an authentication
module.</p>
