<p>SGMLDIFF(1) SGMLDIFF(1)</p>

<p>NAME sgmldiff - Find differences in the markup of two
SGML files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sgmldiff [ options ... ] file1 file2 [ -a |
--attributes | -c [ attributes | nesting | textpos ] |
--context [ attributes | nesting | textpos ] | -s |
--statistics | -h | --help | -v | --version ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This perl script allows to determine the
structural differences between two SGML files. It compares
the files, regardless of what is in between the tags, to
only focus on the markup. Its output is similar to
diff(1).</p>

<p>The typical use of sgmldiff is to compare an SGML file
with its trans- lation into another language. If the
translation was done cleanly, sgmldiff returns without
finding any difference in the markup.</p>

<p>An example of a typical call to sgmldiff is:</p>

<p>sgmldiff english.sgml italiano.sgml</p>

<p>If there are differences in markup between both files,
sgmldiff will output a series of differences reports
summarized with lines of the form:</p>

<p>169a164 At line 169 of the first file, line 164 of the
second file has been added.</p>

<p>8a12,15 At line 8 of the first file, lines 12 to 15 of
the second file have been added.</p>

<p>41d28 Line 41 of the first file has been destroyed, to
obtain line 28 of the second file.</p>

<p>63,66d61 Lines 63 to 66 of the first file have been
destroyed. to obtain line 61 of the second file.</p>

<p>52c51 Line 52 of the first file has been changed into
line 51 of the second file.</p>

<p>5,7c8,10 Lines 5 to 7 of the first file have been
changed into lines 8 to 10 of the second line. In addition
to those summaries, the lines of the first file are shown
preceeded by &lt; and the lines of the second file are shown
preceeded by &gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Here is the list of actions that can be
requested to sgmldiff:</p>

<p>[ -a | --attributes ] Include the attribute values in
the difference tests. Dont set this value if the attributes
are likely to be translated. Set this value if the
attributes value shouldnt change between both files. Default
is to dont include the attributes in the differ- ence
tests.</p>

<p>[ -c [ attributes | nesting | textpos ] | --context [
attributes | nesting | textpos ] ] Add more context to the
difference. Since every test between the tags is removed
before testing the differences, sgmldiff is likely to
resynchronize itself at the wrong place, by thinking the
location in both files correspond, while its not true. By
adding more context to the compared area, such risk is
dismin- ished.</p>

<p>The allowed values for the --context option are:</p>

<p>attributes Take into account the attribute names. The
attribute val- ues are controlled by the attributes
option.</p>

<p>nesting Take into account the nesting level of all the
compared tags.</p>

<p>textpos Take into account the position in the text.</p>

<p>[ -s | --statistics ] Print some SGML information at the
end.</p>

<p>[ -h | --help ] Print a short help message and exit</p>

<p>[ -v | --version ] Print the version identifier and
exit</p>
