<p>MrmFetchSetValues(library call)

<p>NAME MrmFetchSetValues Fetches the values to be set from
literals stored in UID files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Mrm/MrmPublic.h&gt; Cardinal
MrmFetchSetValues( MrmHierarchy hierarchy_id, Widget widget,
ArgList args, Cardinal num_args);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The MrmFetchSetValues function is similar to
XtSetValues, except that the values to be set are defined by
the UIL named values that are stored in the UID hierarchy.
MrmFetchSetValues fetches the values to be set from literals
stored in UID files.</p>

<p>hierarchy_id Specifies the ID of the UID hierarchy that
contains the spec- ified literal. The value of hierarchy_id
was returned in a previous call to
MrmOpenHierarchyPerDisplay.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the widget that is modified.</p>

<p>args Specifies an argument list that identifies the
widget argu- ments to be modified as well as the index (UIL
name) of the literal that defines the value for that
argument. The name part of each argument (args[n].name) must
begin with the string XmN followed by the name that uniquely
identifies this attribute tag. For example, XmNwidth is the
attribute name associated with the core argument width. The
value part (args[n].value) must be a string that gives the
index (UIL name) of the literal. You must define all
literals in UIL as exported values.</p>

<p>num_args Specifies the number of entries in args.</p>

<p>This function sets the values on a widget, evaluating
the values as public literal resource references resolvable
from a UID hierarchy. Each literal is fetched from the
hierarchy, and its value is modified and converted as
required. This value is then placed in the argument list and
used as the actual value for an XtSetValues call. MrmFetch-
SetValues allows a widget to be modified after creation
using UID file values the same way creation values are used
in MrmFetchWidget.</p>

<p>As in MrmFetchWidget, each argument whose value can be
evaluated from the UID hierarchy is set in the widget.
Values that are not found or values in which conversion
errors occur are not modified.</p>

<p>Each entry in the argument list identifies an argument
to be modified in the widget. The name part identifies the
tag, which begins with XmN. The value part must be a string
whose value is the index of the literal. Thus, the following
code would modify the label resource of the widget to have
the value of the literal accessed by the index
OK_button_label in the hierarchy:</p>

<p>args[n].name = XmNlabel; args[n].value =
&quot;OK_button_label&quot;;</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE This function returns one of the following
status return constants:</p>

<p>MrmSUCCESS The function executed successfully.</p>

<p>MrmPARTIAL_SUCCESS At least one literal was successfully
fetched.</p>

<p>MrmBAD_HIERARCHY The hierarchy ID was invalid.</p>

<p>MrmFAILURE The function failed.</p>

<p>RELATED MrmOpenHierarchyPerDisplay(3),
XtSetValues(3).</p>
