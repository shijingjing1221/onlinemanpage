<p>NAME kdecmake - Reference of available CMake custom
modules.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &quot;cmake&quot; executable is the
CMake command-line interface. It may be used to configure
projects in scripts. Project configuration settings may be
specified on the command line with the -D option. The -i
option will cause cmake to interactively prompt for such
settings.</p>

<p>CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.
Projects specify their build process with
platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each
directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build
system for a native tool on their platform.</p>

<p>CUSTOM MODULES The following modules are also available
for CMake. They can be used with INCLUDE(ModuleName).</p>

<p>Custom CMake Modules - Additional Modules for CMake.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for additional modules and
scripts for CMake. Using these modules you can check the
computer system for installed software packages, features of
the compiler and the existence of head- ers to name just a
few.</p>

<p>The following variable is provided, but seem to be
unused:</p>

<p>LIBS_HTML_INSTALL_DIR /share/doc/HTML CACHE STRING
&quot;Is this still used ?&quot;)</p>

<p>The following user adjustable options are provided:</p>

<p>KDE4_ENABLE_FINAL - enable KDE-style enable-final
all-in-one-compilation KDE4_BUILD_TESTS - enable this to
build the testcases KDE4_ENABLE_FPIE - enable it to use gcc
Position Independent Executables feature
KDE4_USE_COMMON_CMAKE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_DIR - only present for
CMake &gt;= 2.6.3, defaults to TRUE If enabled, the package
should install its &lt;package&gt;Config.cmake file to
lib/cmake/&lt;package&gt;/ instead to
lib/&lt;package&gt;/cmake</p>

<p>It also adds the following macros and functions (from
KDE4Macros.cmake)</p>

<p>KDE4_ADD_UI_FILES (SRCS_VAR file1.ui ... fileN.ui) Use
this to add Qt designer ui files to your
application/library.</p>

<p>KDE4_ADD_UI3_FILES (SRCS_VAR file1.ui ... fileN.ui) Use
this to add Qt designer ui files from Qt version 3 to your
application/library.</p>

<p>KDE4_ADD_KCFG_FILES (SRCS_VAR [GENERATE_MOC] file1.kcfgc
... fileN.kcfgc) Use this to add KDE config compiler files
to your application/library. Use optional GENERATE_MOC to
generate moc if you use signals in your kcfg files.</p>

<p>KDE4_ADD_WIDGET_FILES (SRCS_VAR file1.widgets ...
fileN.widgets) Use this to add widget description files for
the makekdewidgets4 code generator for Qt Designer
plugins.</p>

<p>KDE4_CREATE_FINAL_FILES (filename_CXX filename_C file1
... fileN) This macro is intended mainly for internal uses.
It is used for enable-final. It will generate two source
files, one for the C files and one for the C++ files. These
files will have the names given in filename_CXX and
filename_C.</p>

<p>KDE4_ADD_PLUGIN ( name [WITH_PREFIX] file1 ... fileN )
Create a KDE plugin (KPart, kioslave, etc.) from the given
source files. It supports KDE4_ENABLE_FINAL. If WITH_PREFIX
is given, the resulting plugin will have the prefix
&quot;lib&quot;, otherwise it wont.</p>

<p>KDE4_ADD_KDEINIT_EXECUTABLE (name [NOGUI]
[RUN_UNINSTALLED] file1 ... fileN) Create a KDE application
in the form of a module loadable via kdeinit. A library
named kdeinit_&lt;name&gt; will be created and a small
executable which links to it. It supports KDE4_ENABLE_FINAL
If the executable doesnt have a GUI, use the option NOGUI.
By default on OS X application bundles are created, with the
NOGUI option no bundles but simple executables are created.
Under Windows this flag is also necessary to separate
between applications with GUI and without. On other UNIX
systems this flag has no effect. RUN_UNINSTALLED is
deprecated and is ignored, for details see the documentation
for KDE4_ADD_EXECUTABLE().</p>

<p>KDE4_ADD_EXECUTABLE (name [NOGUI] [TEST]
[RUN_UNINSTALLED] file1 ... fileN) Equivalent to
ADD_EXECUTABLE(), but additionally adds some more features:
-support for KDE4_ENABLE_FINAL -support for automoc
-automatic RPATH handling If the executable doesnt have a
GUI, use the option NOGUI. By default on OS X application
bundles are created, with the NOGUI option no bundles but
simple executables are created. Under Windows this flag is
also necessary to separate between applications with GUI and
without. On other UNIX systems this flag has no effect. The
option TEST is for internal use only. The option
RUN_UNINSTALLED is ignored. It was necessary with KDE 4.0
and 4.1 if the executable had to be run from the build tree.
Since KDE 4.2 all executables can be always run uninstalled
(the RPATH of executables which are not yet installed points
since then into the buildtree and is changed to the proper
location when installing, so RUN_UNINSTALLED is not
necessary anymore).</p>

<p>KDE4_ADD_LIBRARY (name [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE ] file1
... fileN) Equivalent to ADD_LIBRARY(), but additionally it
supports KDE4_ENABLE_FINAL and under Windows it adds a
-DMAKE_&lt;name&gt;_LIB definition to the compilation.</p>

<p>KDE4_ADD_UNIT_TEST (testname [TESTNAME targetname] file1
... fileN) add a unit test, which is executed when running
make test it will be built with RPATH poiting to the build
dir The targets are always created, but only built for the
&quot;all&quot; target if the option KDE4_BUILD_TESTS is
enabled. Otherwise the rules for the target are created but
not built by default. You can build them by manually
building the target. The name of the target can be specified
using TESTNAME &lt;targetname&gt;, if it is not given the
macro will default to the &lt;testname&gt; KDESRCDIR is set
to the source directory of the test, this can be used with
KGlobal::dirs()-&gt;addResourceDir( &quot;data&quot;,
KDESRCDIR )</p>

<p>KDE4_UPDATE_ICONCACHE() Notifies the icon cache that new
icons have been installed by updating mtime of
${ICON_INSTALL_DIR}/hicolor directory.</p>

<p>KDE4_INSTALL_ICONS( path theme) Installs all png and
svgz files in the current directory to the icon directoy
given in path, in the subdirectory for the given icon
theme.</p>

<p>KDE4_CREATE_HANDBOOK( docbookfile [INSTALL_DESTINATION
installdest] [SUBDIR subdir]) Create the handbook from the
docbookfile (using meinproc4) The resulting handbook will be
installed to &lt;installdest&gt; when using
INSTALL_DESTINATION &lt;installdest&gt;, or to
&lt;installdest&gt;/&lt;subdir&gt; if SUBDIR &lt;subdir&gt;
is specified.</p>

<p>KDE4_CREATE_MANPAGE( docbookfile section ) Create the
manpage for the specified section from the docbookfile
(using meinproc4) The resulting manpage will be installed to
&lt;installdest&gt; when using INSTALL_DESTINATION
&lt;installdest&gt;, or to
&lt;installdest&gt;/&lt;subdir&gt; if SUBDIR &lt;subdir&gt;
is specified.</p>

<p>A note on the possible values for CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE and
how KDE handles the flags for those buildtypes.
FindKDE4Internal supports the values Debug, Release,
RelWithDebInfo, Profile and Debugfull:</p>

<p>Release optimised for speed, qDebug/kDebug turned off,
no debug symbols RelWithDebInfo (Release with debug info)
optimised for speed, debugging symbols on (-g) Debug
optimised but debuggable, debugging on (-g)
(-fno-reorder-blocks -fno-schedule-insns -fno-inline)
DebugFull no optimisation, full debugging on (-g3) Profile
DebugFull + -ftest-coverage -fprofile-arcs</p>

<p>It is expected that the &quot;Debug&quot; build type be
still debuggable with gdb without going all over the place,
but still produce better performance. Its also important to
note that gcc cannot detect all warning conditions unless
the optimiser is active.</p>

<p>This module allows to depend on a particular minimum
version of kdelibs. To acomplish that one should use the
apropriate cmake syntax for find_package. For example to
depend on kdelibs &gt;= 4.1.0 one should use</p>

<p>find_package(KDE4 4.1.0 REQUIRED)</p>

<p>In earlier versions of KDE you could use the variable
KDE_MIN_VERSION to have such a dependency. This variable is
deprecated with KDE 4.2.0, but will still work to make the
module backwards-compatible.</p>

<p>FindPkgConfig a pkg-config module for CMake</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules(&lt;PREFIX&gt; [REQUIRED] [QUIET]
&lt;MODULE&gt; [&lt;MODULE&gt;]*) checks for all the given
modules</p>

<p>pkg_search_module(&lt;PREFIX&gt; [REQUIRED]
&lt;MODULE&gt; [&lt;MODULE&gt;]*) checks for given modules
and uses the first working one</p>

<p>When the REQUIRED argument was set, macros will fail
with an error when module(s) could not be found</p>

<p>When the QUIET argument is set, no error message will be
out- put if the package was not found.</p>

<p>It sets the following variables:</p>

<p>PKG_CONFIG_FOUND ... true if pkg-config works on the
system PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE ... pathname of the pkg-config
program &lt;PREFIX&gt;_FOUND ... set to 1 if module(s)
exist</p>

<p>For the following variables two sets of values exist;
first one is the common one and has the given PREFIX. The
second set con- tains flags which are given out when
pkgconfig was called with the --static option.</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LIBRARIES ... only the libraries (w/o
the -l) &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LIBRARY_DIRS ... the paths of the
libraries (w/o the -L) &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LDFLAGS ... all
required linker flags &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LDFLAGS_OTHER ... all
other linker flags &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_INCLUDE_DIRS ... the -I
preprocessor flags (w/o the -I) &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_CFLAGS ...
all required cflags &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_CFLAGS_OTHER ... the
other compiler flags</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt; for common case
&lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt;_STATIC for static
linking</p>

<p>There are some special variables whose prefix depends on
the count of given modules. When there is only one module,
&lt;PREFIX&gt; stays unchanged. When there are multiple
modules, the prefix will be changed to
&lt;PREFIX&gt;_&lt;MODNAME&gt;:</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_VERSION ... version of the module
&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_PREFIX ... prefix-directory of the module
&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_INCLUDEDIR ... include-dir of the module
&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LIBDIR ... lib-dir of the module</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt; when |MODULES| == 1,
else &lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt;_&lt;MODNAME&gt;</p>

<p>A &lt;MODULE&gt; parameter can have the following
formats:</p>

<p>{MODNAME} ... matches any version
{MODNAME}&gt;={VERSION} ... at least version &lt;VERSION&gt;
is required {MODNAME}={VERSION} ... exactly version
&lt;VERSION&gt; is required {MODNAME}&lt;={VERSION} ...
modules must not be newer than &lt;VERSION&gt;</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules (GLIB2 glib-2.0)</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules (GLIB2 glib-2.0&gt;=2.10) requires at
least version 2.10 of glib2 and defines e.g.

<p>FindQt4 Find QT 4</p>

<p>This module can be used to find Qt4. The most important
issue is that the Qt4 qmake is available via the system
path. This qmake is then used to detect basically everything
else. This module defines a number of key variables and
macros. First is QT_USE_FILE which is the path to a CMake
file that can be included to compile Qt 4 applications and
libraries. By default, the QtCore and QtGui libraries are
loaded. This behav- ior can be changed by setting one or
more of the following variables to true before doing
INCLUDE(${QT_USE_FILE}):</p>

<p>QT_DONT_USE_QTCORE QT_DONT_USE_QTGUI QT_USE_QT3SUPPORT
QT_USE_QTASSISTANT QT_USE_QTDESIGNER QT_USE_QTMOTIF
QT_USE_QTMAIN QT_USE_QTNETWORK QT_USE_QTNSPLUGIN
QT_USE_QTOPENGL QT_USE_QTSQL QT_USE_QTXML QT_USE_QTSVG
QT_USE_QTTEST QT_USE_QTUITOOLS QT_USE_QTDBUS QT_USE_QTSCRIPT
QT_USE_QTASSISTANTCLIENT QT_USE_QTHELP QT_USE_QTWEBKIT
QT_USE_QTXMLPATTERNS QT_USE_PHONON</p>

<p>The file pointed to by QT_USE_FILE will set up your
compile environment by adding include directories,
preprocessor defines, and populate a QT_LIBRARIES variable
containing all the Qt libraries and their dependencies. Add
the QT_LIBRARIES variable to your TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES.</p>

<p>Typical usage could be something like:</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4) SET(QT_USE_QTXML 1)
INCLUDE(${QT_USE_FILE}) ADD_EXECUTABLE(myexe main.cpp)
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(myexe ${QT_LIBRARIES})</p>

<p>There are also some files that need processing by some
Qt tools such as moc and uic. Listed below are macros that
may be used to process those files.</p>

<p>macro QT4_WRAP_CPP(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
create moc code from a list of files containing Qt class
with the Q_OBJECT declaration. Options may be given to moc,
such as those found when executing &quot;moc -help&quot;</p>

<p>macro QT4_WRAP_UI(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
create code from a list of Qt designer ui files. Options may
be given to uic, such as those found when executing
&quot;uic -help&quot;</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS
...) create code from a list of Qt resource files. Options
may be given to rcc, such as those found when executing

<p>macro QT4_GENERATE_MOC(inputfile outputfile ) creates a
rule to run moc on infile and create outfile. Use this if
for some reason QT4_WRAP_CPP() isnt appropriate, e.g.
because you need a custom filename for the moc file or
something similar.</p>

<p>macro QT4_AUTOMOC(sourcefile1 sourcefile2 ... ) This
macro is still experimental. It can be used to have moc
automatically handled. So if you have the files foo.h and
foo.cpp, and in foo.h a a class uses the Q_OBJECT macro, moc
has to run on it. If you dont want to use QT4_WRAP_CPP()
(which is reliable and mature), you can insert #include
&quot;foo.moc&quot; in foo.cpp and then give foo.cpp as
argument to QT4_AUTOMOC(). This will the scan all listed
files at cmake-time for such included moc files and if it
finds them cause a rule to be generated to run moc at build
time on the accompanying header file foo.h. If a source file
has the SKIP_AUTOMOC property set it will be ignored by this
macro.</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE(outfiles interface
basename) create a the interface header and implementation
files with the given basename from the given interface xml
file and add it to the list of sources. To disable
generating a namespace header, set the source file property
NO_NAMESPACE to TRUE on the interface file. To include a
header in the interface header, set the source file property
INCLUDE to the name of the header. To specify a class name
to use, set the source file property CLASSNAME to the name
of the class.</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACES(outfiles inputfile ... )
create the interface header and implementation files for all
listed interface xml files the name will be automatically
determined from the name of the xml file To disable
generating namespace headers, set the source file property
NO_NAMESPACE to TRUE for these inputfiles. To include a
header in the interface header, set the source file property
INCLUDE to the name of the header. To specify a class name
to use, set the source file property CLASSNAME to the name
of the class.</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_ADAPTOR(outfiles xmlfile parentheader
parentclassname [basename] [classname]) create a dbus
adaptor (header and implementation file) from the xml file
describing the interface, and add it to the list of sources.
The adaptor forwards the calls to a parent class, defined in
parentheader and named parentclassname. The name of the
generated files will be &lt;basename&gt;adaptor.{cpp,h}
where basename defaults to the basename of the xml file. If
&lt;classname&gt; is provided, then it will be used as the
classname of the adaptor itself.</p>

<p>macro QT4_GENERATE_DBUS_INTERFACE( header
[interfacename] OPTIONS ...) generate the xml interface file
from the given header. If the optional argument
interfacename is omitted, the name of the interface file is
constructed from the basename of the header with the suffix
.xml appended. Options may be given to qdbuscpp2xml, such as
those found when executing &quot;qdbuscpp2xml
--help&quot;</p>

<p>MACRO_OPTIONAL_FIND_PACKAGE( &lt;name&gt; [QUIT] )</p>

<p>MacroAppendIf</p>

<p>MACRO_APPEND_IF(CONDITION VAR VALUE1...VALUEN ) This
convenience macro appends the values VALUE1 up to VALUEN to
the list given in VAR, but only if the variable CONDITION is
TRUE:</p>

<p>usage example: IF(SOMELIB_FOUND)</p>

<p>SET(my_sources ${my_sources} somefile.c
someotherfile.c)</p>

<p>ENDIF(SOMELIB_FOUND)</p>

<p>becomes: MACRO_APPEND_IF(SOMELIB_FOUND my_sources
somefile.c someotherfile.c)</p>

<p>MacroBoolTo01</p>

<p>MACRO_BOOL_TO_01( VAR RESULT0 ... RESULTN ) This macro
evaluates its first argument and sets all the given vaiables
either to 0 or 1 depending on the value of the first one</p>

<p>MacroEnsureOutOfSourceBuild
MACRO_ENSURE_OUT_OF_SOURCE_BUILD(&lt;errorMessage&gt;)</p>


<p>MACRO_ENSURE_OUT_OF_SOURCE_BUILD(&lt;errorMessage&gt;)</p>

<p>Call this macro in your project if you want to enforce
out-of-source builds. If an in-source build is detected, it
will abort with the given error message. This macro works in
any of the CMakeLists.txt of your project, but the
recommended location to call this is close to the beginning
of the top level CMakeLists.txt</p>

<p>MacroEnsureVersion</p>

<p>This file defines the following macros for developers to
use in ensuring that installed software is of the right
version:</p>

<p>MACRO_ENSURE_VERSION - test that a version number is
greater than</p>

<p>or equal to some minimum</p>

<p>MACRO_ENSURE_VERSION_RANGE - test that a version number
is greater than</p>

<p>or equal to some minimum and less than some maximum</p>

<p>MACRO_ENSURE_VERSION2 - deprecated, do not use in new
code</p>

<p>MacroLibrary include MacroLibrary offers a collection of
macros which extend the built-in cmake commands</p>

<p>MacroLogFeature</p>

<p>This file defines the Feature Logging macros.</p>

<p>MACRO_LOG_FEATURE(VAR FEATURE DESCRIPTION URL [REQUIRED
[MIN_VERSION [COMMENTS]]])</p>

<p>Logs the information so that it can be displayed at the
end of the configure run VAR : TRUE or FALSE, indicating
whether the feature is supported FEATURE: name of the
feature, e.g. &quot;libjpeg&quot; DESCRIPTION: description
what this feature provides URL: home page REQUIRED: TRUE or
FALSE, indicating whether the featue is required
MIN_VERSION: minimum version number. empty string if
unneeded COMMENTS: More info you may want to provide. empty
string if unnecessary</p>

<p>MACRO_DISPLAY_FEATURE_LOG()</p>

<p>Call this to display the collected results. Exits CMake
with a FATAL error message if a required feature is
missing</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>INCLUDE(MacroLogFeature)</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE(JPEG) MACRO_LOG_FEATURE(JPEG_FOUND
&quot;libjpeg&quot; &quot;Sup- port JPEG images&quot;
&quot;http://www.ijg.org&quot; TRUE &quot;3.2a&quot;
&quot;&quot;) ... MACRO_DISPLAY_FEATURE_LOG()</p>

<p>MacroOptionalAddSubdirectory
MACRO_OPTIONAL_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY() combines
ADD_SUBDIRECTORY() with an OPTION()</p>

<p>MACRO_OPTIONAL_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY( &lt;dir&gt; ) If you
use MACRO_OPTIONAL_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY() instead of
ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(), this will have two effects 1 - CMake
will not complain if the directory doesnt exist</p>

<p>This makes sense if you want to distribute just one of
the subdirs in a source package, e.g. just one of the
subdirs in kdeextragear.</p>

<p>2 - If the directory exists, it will offer an option to
skip the</p>

<p>subdirectory. This is useful if you want to compile only
a subset of all directories.</p>

<p>If the CMake variable
DISABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL_SUBDIRECTORIES is set to TRUE for the
first CMake run on the project, all optional subdirectories
will be disabled by default (but can of course be enabled
via the respective options). E.g. the following will disable
all optional subdirectories except the one named
&quot;kcalc&quot;:</p>

<p>$ cmake -DDISABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL_SUBDIRECTORIES=TRUE
-DBUILD_kcalc=TRUE &lt;srcdir&gt;</p>

<p>MacroOptionalDependPackage</p>

<p>Search if cmake module is installed in computer cmake
will not fail but signal that we must install depend package
before. add as previously name of cmake module
&quot;_name&quot; and define package needed
&quot;_module_needed&quot; if return
DEPEND_PACKAGE_${_name}</p>

<p>MacroOptionalFindPackage MACRO_OPTIONAL_FIND_PACKAGE()
combines FIND_PACKAGE() with an OPTION()</p>

<p>MACRO_OPTIONAL_FIND_PACKAGE( &lt;name&gt; [QUIT] ) This
macro is a combination of OPTION() and FIND_PACKAGE(), it
works like FIND_PACKAGE(), but additionally it automatically
creates an option name WITH_&lt;name&gt;, which can be
disabled via the cmake GUI. or via -DWITH_&lt;name&gt;=OFF
The standard &lt;name&gt;_FOUND vari- ables can be used in
the same way as when using the normal FIND_PACKAGE()</p>

<p>MacroPushRequiredVars</p>

<p>this module defines two macros:
MACRO_PUSH_REQUIRED_VARS() and MACRO_POP_REQUIRED_VARS() use
these if you call cmake macros which use any of the
CMAKE_REQUIRED_XXX variables</p>

<p>Usage: MACRO_PUSH_REQUIRED_VARS()
SET(CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS ${CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS}
-DSOME_MORE_DEF) CHECK_FUNC- TION_EXISTS(...)
MACRO_POP_REQUIRED_VARS()</p>

<p>MacroWriteBasicCMakeVersionFile</p>

<p>MACRO_WRITE_BASIC_CMAKE_VERSION_FILE( _filename _major
_minor _patch) Writes a file for use as
&lt;package&gt;ConfigVersion.cmake file to
&lt;_filename&gt;. See the documentation of FIND_PACKAGE()
for details on this. _filename is the output filename, it
should be in the build tree. _major is the major version
number of the project to be installed _minor is the minor
version number of the project to be installed _patch is the
patch version number of the project to be installed</p>

<p>NepomukMacros</p>

<p>This file defines the following macros:</p>

<p>ADD_SIP_PYTHON_MODULE (MODULE_NAME MODULE_SIP [library1,
libaray2, ...])</p>

<p>Specifies a SIP file to be built into a Python module
and installed. MODULE_NAME is the name of Python module
including any path name. (e.g. os.sys, Foo.bar etc).
MODULE_SIP the path and filename of the .sip file to process
and compile. libraryN are libraries that the Python module,
which is typically a shared library, should be linked to.
The built module will also be install into Python s
site-packages directory.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the ADD_SIP_PYTHON_MODULE macro can be
con- trolled by a number of variables:</p>

<p>SIP_INCLUDES - List of directories which SIP will scan
through when looking</p>

<p>for included .sip files. (Corresponds to the -I option
for SIP.)</p>

<p>SIP_TAGS - List of tags to define when running SIP.
(Corresponds to the -t</p>

<p>option for SIP.)</p>

<p>SIP_CONCAT_PARTS - An integer which defines the number
of parts the C++ code</p>

<p>of each module should be split into. Defaults to 8.
(Corresponds to the -j option for SIP.)</p>

<p>SIP_DISABLE_FEATURES - List of feature names which
should be disabled</p>

<p>running SIP. (Corresponds to the -x option for SIP.)</p>

<p>SIP_EXTRA_OPTIONS - Extra command line options which
should be passed on to</p>

<p>SIP.</p>

<p>Win32Macros</p>

<p>win32 macros</p>

<p>ADDEXPLORERWRAPPER(project)</p>

<p>Exists only under Win32 !</p>

<p>addExplorerWrapper creates batch files for fast access
to the build environment from the win32 explorer.</p>

<p>For mingw and nmake projects it opens a command shell,
for Visual Studio IDEs (at least tested with VS 8 2005) it
opens the related .sln file with paths setting specified at
configure time.</p>

<p>create_exe_symlink</p>

<p>Create an executable symlink to a Python script. This
also sets the target scripts permission bits.</p>
