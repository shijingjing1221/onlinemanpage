<p>TRUNCATE_INODE_PAGES(9) Memory Management in Linux
TRUNCATE_INODE_PAGES(9)</p>

<p>NAME truncate_inode_pages_range - truncate range of
pages specified by start &amp; end byte offsets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void truncate_inode_pages_range(struct
address_space * mapping, loff_t lstart, loff_t lend);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS mapping mapping to truncate</p>

<p>lstart offset from which to truncate</p>

<p>lend offset to which to truncate</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Truncate the page cache, removing the pages
that are between specified offsets (and zeroing out partial
page (if lstart is not page aligned)).</p>

<p>Truncate takes two passes - the first pass is
nonblocking. It will not block on page locks and it will not
block on writeback. The second pass will wait. This is to
prevent as much IO as possible in the affected region. The
first pass will remove most pages, so the search cost of the
second pass is low.</p>

<p>We pass down the cache-hot hint to the page freeing
code. Even if the mapping is large, it is probably the case
that the final pages are the most recently touched, and
freeing happens in ascending file offset order.</p>
