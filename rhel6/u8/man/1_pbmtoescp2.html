<p>NAME pbmtoescp2 - convert a PBM image to a ESC/P2
printer file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmtoescp2</p>

<p>[-compress=compressionmode] [-resolution=dpi]
[pbmfile]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate
an option. You may use either white space or equals signs
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pbmtoescp2 reads a PBM image as input. It produces an
ESC/P2 raster graphic printer control stream as output.</p>

<p>This program creates an output that is printable on
Epson printers that understand the ESC/P2 printer control
language (e.g. the Stylus models). For older Epson 9-pin dot
matrix printers, which use the ESC/P protocol, see
pbmtoepson.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Input is read from file pbmfile if specified,
otherwise from stdin. Output is written to stdout.</p>

<p>-compress=compressionmode This determines the
compression mode that pbmtoescp2 uses in its output. Valid
values for compressionmode are 0 and 1. -com- press=0
results in a printer control stream with uncompressed raster
graphic data. -compress=1 results in a printer control
stream with RLE compressed raster graphic data (RLE means
Run Length Encoding). The default is -compress=1.</p>

<p>-resolution=dpi This determines the horizontal and the
vertical print resolution set in the printer control stream.
Another way of looking at it is a declaration of what the
resolution of the input image is (PBM images don t have
inherent resolution). Valid values for dpi are 180 and 360.
See hints for more information on this.</p>

<p>The default is -resolution=360.</p>

<p>HINTS RLE compresses very well bitmaps of line drawings,
preferably horizon- tal oriented contents like texts, sheets
of music, etc. However, bitmaps derived from photographs are
not ideal for RLE. In extreme cases, when no byte
repetitions occur in the input, the result will be even
slightly bigger than the input. To avoid this, use
compression mode 0 to switch off RLE.</p>

<p>Each pixel in the input PBM image becomes one dot in the
printed out- put. Therefore, you must make sure the width
and height of the input are appropriate for the print
resolution you choose and the print area you want. E.g. if
you print at 180 dpi and want the image to print as 8 inches
by 10, you must supply a PBM that is 1440 pixels wide by
1800 pixels high. You can adjust the size of the input with
pamscale, pam- stretch, pbmreduce, or pamenlarge.</p>
