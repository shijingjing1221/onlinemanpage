<p>NAME gnutls_handshake_set_private_extensions - Used to
enable the private cipher suites</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>void
gnutls_handshake_set_private_extensions(gnutls_session_t
session, int allow);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a gnutls_session_t
structure.</p>

<p>int allow is an integer (0 or 1)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function will enable or disable the use
of private cipher suites (the ones that start with 0xFF). By
default or if allow is 0 then these cipher suites will not
be advertized nor used.</p>

<p>Unless this function is called with the option to allow
(1), then no compression algorithms, like LZO. That is
because these algorithms are not yet defined in any RFC or
even internet draft.</p>

<p>Enabling the private ciphersuites when talking to other
than gnutls servers and clients may cause interoperability
problems.</p>
