<p>SNMPCMD(1) Net-SNMP SNMPCMD(1)</p>

<p>NAME snmpcmd - options and behaviour common to most of
the Net-SNMP command- line tools</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS snmpcmd [OPTIONS] AGENT [PARAMETERS]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the common
options for the SNMP commands: snmpbulkget, snmpbulkwalk,
snmpdelta, snmpget, snmpgetnext, snmpnet- stat, snmpset,
snmpstatus, snmptable, snmptest, snmptrap, snmpdf, snm- pusm
, snmpwalk . The command line applications use the SNMP
protocol to communicate with an SNMP capable network entity,
an agent. Individ- ual applications typically (but not
necessarily) take additional param- eters that are given
after the agent specification. These parameters are
documented in the manual pages for each application.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -3[MmKk] 0xHEXKEY Sets the keys to be used for
SNMPv3 transactions. These options allow you to set the
master authentication and encryption keys (-3m and -3M
respectively) or set the localized authentication and
encryption keys (-3k and -3K respectively). SNMPv3 keys can
be either passed in by hand using these flags, or by the use
of keys generated from passwords using the -A and -X flags
dis- cussed below. For further details on SNMPv3 and its
usage of keying information, see the Net-SNMP tutorial web
site ( http://www.Net-SNMP.org/tutorial-5/commands/ ).
Overrides the defAuthMasterKey (-3m), defPrivMasterKey
(-3M), defAuthLocal- izedKey (-3k) or defPrivLocalizedKey
(-3K) tokens, respectively, in the snmp.conf file, see
snmp.conf(5).</p>

<p>-a authProtocol Set the authentication protocol (MD5 or
SHA) used for authenti- cated SNMPv3 messages. Overrides the
defAuthType token in the snmp.conf file.</p>

<p>-A authPassword Set the authentication pass phrase used
for authenticated SNMPv3 messages. Overrides the
defAuthPassphrase token in the snmp.conf file. It is
insecure to specify pass phrases on the command line, see
snmp.conf(5).</p>

<p>-c community Set the community string for SNMPv1/v2c
transactions. Overrides the defCommunity token in the
snmp.conf file.</p>

<p>-d Dump (in hexadecimal) the raw SNMP packets sent and
received.</p>

<p>-D TOKEN[,...] Turn on debugging output for the given
TOKEN(s). Try ALL for extremely verbose output.</p>

<p>-e engineID Set the authoritative (security) engineID
used for SNMPv3 REQUEST messages. It is typically not
necessary to specify this, as it will usually be discovered
automatically.</p>

<p>-E engineID Set the context engineID used for SNMPv3
REQUEST messages scope- dPdu. If not specified, this will
default to the authoritative engineID.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display a brief usage message and then
exit.</p>

<p>-H Display a list of configuration file directives
understood by the command and then exit.</p>

<p>-I [brRhu] Specifies input parsing options. See INPUT
OPTIONS below.</p>

<p>-l secLevel Set the securityLevel used for SNMPv3
messages (noAuthNo- Priv|authNoPriv|authPriv). Appropriate
pass phrase(s) must pro- vided when using any level higher
than noAuthNoPriv. Overrides the defSecurityLevel token in
the snmp.conf file.</p>

<p>-L [eEfFoOsS] Specifies output logging options. See
LOGGING OPTIONS below.</p>

<p>-m MIBLIST Specifies a colon separated list of MIB
modules (not files) to load for this application. This
overrides (or augments) the environment variable MIBS, the
snmp.conf directive mibs, and the list of MIBs hardcoded
into the Net-SNMP library.</p>

<p>If MIBLIST has a leading - or + character, then the MIB
mod- ules listed are loaded in addition to the default list,
coming before or after this list respectively. Otherwise,
the speci- fied MIBs are loaded instead of this default
list.</p>

<p>The special keyword ALL is used to load all MIB modules
in the MIB directory search list. Every file whose name does
not begin with &quot;.&quot; will be parsed as if it were a
MIB file.</p>

<p>-M DIRLIST Specifies a colon separated list of
directories to search for MIBs. This overrides (or augments)
the environment variable MIBDIRS, the snmp.conf directive
mibdirs, and the default direc- tory hardcoded into the
Net-SNMP library (/usr/share/snmp/mibs).</p>

<p>If DIRLIST has a leading - or + character, then the
given directories are added to the default list, being
searched before or after the directories on this list
respectively. Otherwise, the specified directories are
searched instead of this default list.</p>

<p>Note that the directories appearing later in the list
have have precedence over earlier ones. To avoid searching
any MIB direc- tories, set the MIBDIRS environment variable
to the empty string (&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p>Note that MIBs specified using the -m option or the mibs
config- uration directive will be loaded from one of the
directories listed by the -M option (or equivalents). The
mibfile directive takes a full path to the specified MIB
file, so this does not need to be in the MIB directory
search list.</p>

<p>-n contextName Set the contextName used for SNMPv3
messages. The default con- textName is the empty string
&quot;&quot;. Overrides the defContext token in the
snmp.conf file.</p>

<p>-O [abeEfnqQsStTuUvxX] Specifies output printing
options. See OUTPUT OPTIONS below.</p>

<p>-P [cdeRuwW] Specifies MIB parsing options. See MIB
PARSING OPTIONS below.</p>

<p>-r retries Specifies the number of retries to be used in
the requests. The default is 5.</p>

<p>-t timeout Specifies the timeout in seconds between
retries. The default is 1. Floating point numbers can be
used to specify fractions of seconds.</p>

<p>-u secName Set the securityName used for authenticated
SNMPv3 messages. Overrides the defSecurityName token in the
snmp.conf file.</p>

<p>-v 1 | 2c | 3 Specifies the protocol version to use: 1
(RFCs 1155-1157), 2c (RFCs 1901-1908), or 3 (RFCs
2571-2574). The default is typi- cally version 3. Overrides
the defVersion token in the snmp.conf file.</p>

<p>-V, --version Display version information for the
application and then exit.</p>

<p>-x privProtocol Set the privacy protocol (DES or AES)
used for encrypted SNMPv3 messages. Overrides the
defPrivType token in the snmp.conf file. This option is only
valid if the Net-SNMP software was build to use OpenSSL.</p>

<p>-X privPassword Set the privacy pass phrase used for
encrypted SNMPv3 messages. Overrides the defPrivPassphrase
token in the snmp.conf file. It is insecure to specify pass
phrases on the command line, see snmp.conf(5).</p>

<p>-Z boots,time Set the engineBoots and engineTime used
for authenticated SNMPv3 messages. This will initialize the
local notion of the agents boots/time with an authenticated
value stored in the LCD. It is typically not necessary to
specify this option, as these values will usually be
discovered automatically.</p>

<p>-Yname=&quot;value&quot;</p>

<p>--name=&quot;value&quot; Allows to specify any token
(&quot;name&quot;) supported in the snmp.conf file and sets
its value to &quot;value&quot;. Overrides the corresponding
token in the snmp.conf file. See snmp.conf(5) for the full
list of tokens.</p>

<p>AGENT SPECIFICATION The string AGENT in the SYNOPSIS
above specifies the remote SNMP entity with which to
communicate. This specification takes the form:</p>


<p>[&lt;transport-specifier&gt;:]&lt;transport-address&gt;</p>

<p>At its simplest, the AGENT specification may consist of
a hostname, or an IPv4 address in the standard &quot;dotted
quad&quot; notation. In this case, communication will be
attempted using UDP/IPv4 to port 161 of the given host.
Otherwise, the &lt;transport-address&gt; part of the
specification is parsed according to the following
table:</p>

<p>&lt;transport-specifier&gt; &lt;transport-address&gt;
format</p>

<p>udp hostname[:port] or IPv4-address[:port]</p>

<p>tcp hostname[:port] or IPv4-address[:port]</p>

<p>unix pathname</p>

<p>ipx [network]:node[/port]</p>

<p>aal5pvc or pvc [interface.][VPI.]VCI</p>

<p>udp6 or udpv6 or udpipv6 hostname[:port] or
IPv6-address:port or [IPv6-address][:port]</p>

<p>tcp6 or tcpv6 or tcpipv6 hostname[:port] or
IPv6-address:port or [IPv6-address][:port]</p>

<p>Note that &lt;transport-specifier&gt; strings are
case-insensitive so that, for example, &quot;tcp&quot; and
&quot;TCP&quot; are equivalent. Here are some examples,
along with their interpretation:</p>

<p>hostname:161 perform query using UDP/IPv4 datagrams to
host- name on port 161. The &quot;:161&quot; is redundant
here since that is the default SNMP port in any case.</p>

<p>udp:hostname identical to the previous specification.
The &quot;udp:&quot; is redundant here since UDP/IPv4 is the
default transport.</p>

<p>TCP:hostname:1161 connect to hostname on port 1161 using
TCP/IPv4 and perform query over that connection.</p>

<p>ipx::00D0B7AAE308 perform query using IPX datagrams to
node num- ber 00D0B7AAE308 on the default network, and using
the default IPX port of 36879 (900F hex- adecimal), as
suggested in RFC 1906.</p>

<p>ipx:0AE43409:00D0B721C6C0/1161 perform query using IPX
datagrams to port 1161 on node number 00D0B721C6C0 on
network number 0AE43409.</p>

<p>unix:/tmp/local-agent connect to the Unix domain socket
/tmp/local- agent, and perform the query over that connec-
tion.</p>

<p>/tmp/local-agent identical to the previous
specification, since the Unix domain is the default
transport iff the first character of the
&lt;transport-address&gt; is a /.</p>

<p>alias:myname perform a connection to the myname alias
which needs to be defined in the snmp.conf file using a line
like &quot; alias myname udp:127.0.0.1:9161 &quot;. Any type
of transport definition can be used as the alias expansion
parameter. Aliases are particularly useful for using
repeated com- plex transport strings.</p>

<p>AAL5PVC:100 perform the query using AAL5 PDUs sent on
the permanent virtual circuit with VPI=0 and VCI=100
(decimal) on the first ATM adapter in the machine.</p>

<p>PVC:1.10.32 perform the query using AAL5 PDUs sent on
the permanent virtual circuit with VPI=10 (decimal) and
VCI=32 (decimal) on the second ATM adapter in the machine.
Note that &quot;PVC&quot; is a synonym for
&quot;AAL5PVC&quot;.</p>

<p>udp6:hostname:10161 perform the query using UDP/IPv6
datagrams to port 10161 on hostname (which will be looked up
as an AAAA record).</p>

<p>UDP6:[fe80::2d0:b7ff:fe21:c6c0] perform the query using
UDP/IPv6 datagrams to port 161 at address
fe80::2d0:b7ff:fe21:c6c0.</p>

<p>tcpipv6:[::1]:1611 connect to port 1611 on the local
host (::1 in IPv6 parlance) using TCP/IPv6 and perform query
over that connection.</p>

<p>dtlsudp:hostname:9161 Connects using SNMP over DTLS/UDP
as documented by the ISMS working group (RFCs not yet pub-
lished as of this date). This will require that the TSM
security model is in use (--defSe- curityModel=tsm) and that
the defX509ServerCerts, defX509ClientPriv, and
defX509ClientPub configuration tokens have been set.</p>

<p>ssh:hostname:22 Connects using SNMP over SSH as
documented by the ISMS working group (RFCs not yet published
as of this date). This will require that the TSM security
model is in use (--defSecurity- Model=tsm).</p>

<p>Note that not all the transport domains listed above
will always be available; for instance, hosts with no IPv6
support will not be able to use udp6 transport addresses,
and attempts to do so will result in the error &quot;Unknown
host&quot;. Likewise, since AAL5 PVC support is only cur-
rently available on Linux, it will fail with the same error
on other platforms.</p>

<p>MIB PARSING OPTIONS The Net-SNMP MIB parser mostly
adheres to the Structure of Management Information (SMI). As
that specification has changed through time, and in
recognition of the (ahem) diversity in compliance expressed
in MIB files, additional options provide more flexibility in
reading MIB files.</p>

<p>-Pc Toggles whether ASN.1 comments should extend to the
end of the MIB source line. Strictly speaking, a second
appearance of &quot;--&quot; should terminate the comment,
but this breaks some MIB files. The default behaviour (to
interpret comments correctly) can also be set with the
configuration token commentToEOL.</p>

<p>-Pd Disables the loading of MIB object DESCRIPTIONs when
parsing MIB files. This reduces the amount of memory used by
the running application.</p>

<p>-Pe Toggles whether to show errors encountered when
parsing MIB files. These include references to IMPORTed
modules and MIB objects that cannot be located in the MIB
directory search list. The default behaviour can also be set
with the configuration token showMibErrors.</p>

<p>-PR If the same MIB object (parent name and
sub-identifier) appears multiple times in the list of MIB
definitions loaded, use the last version to be read in. By
default, the first version will be used, and any duplicates
discarded. This behaviour can also be set with the
configuration token mibReplaceWithLatest.</p>

<p>Such ordering is normally only relevant if there are two
MIB files with conflicting object definitions for the same
OID (or different revisions of the same basic MIB
object).</p>

<p>-Pu Toggles whether to allow the underline character in
MIB object names and other symbols. Strictly speaking, this
is not valid SMI syntax, but some vendor MIB files define
such names. The default behaviour can also be set with the
configuration token mibAllowUnderline.</p>

<p>-Pw Show various warning messages in parsing MIB files
and building the overall OID tree. This can also be set with
the configura- tion directive mibWarningLevel 1</p>

<p>-PW Show some additional warning messages, mostly
relating to pars- ing individual MIB objects. This can also
be set with the con- figuration directive mibWarningLevel
2</p>

<p>OUTPUT OPTIONS The format of the output from SNMP
commands can be controlled using various parameters of the
-O flag. The effects of these sub-options can be seen by
comparison with the following default output (unless
otherwise specified): $ snmpget -c public -v 1 localhost
sysUpTime.0 SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (14096763)
1 day, 15:09:27.63</p>

<p>-Oa Display string values as ASCII strings (unless there
is a DIS- PLAY-HINT defined for the corresponding MIB
object). By default, the library attempts to determine
whether the value is a printable or binary string, and
displays it accordingly.</p>

<p>This option does not affect objects that do have a
Display Hint.</p>

<p>-Ob Display table indexes numerically, rather than
trying to inter- pret the instance subidentifiers as string
or OID values: $ snmpgetnext -c public -v 1 localhost
vacmSecurityModel
SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmSecurityModel.0.&quot;wes&quot;
= xxx $ snmpgetnext -c public -v 1 -Ob localhost
vacmSecurityModel
SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmSecurityModel.0.3.119.101.115 =
xxx</p>

<p>-Oe Removes the symbolic labels from enumeration values:
$ snmpget -c public -v 1 localhost ipForwarding.0
IP-MIB::ipForwarding.0 = INTEGER: forwarding(1) $ snmpget -c
public -v 1 -Oe localhost ipForwarding.0
IP-MIB::ipForwarding.0 = INTEGER: 1</p>

<p>-OE Modifies index strings to escape the quote
characters: $ snmpgetnext -c public -v 1 localhost
vacmSecurityModel
SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmSecurityModel.0.&quot;wes&quot;
= xxx $ snmpgetnext -c public -v 1 -OE localhost
vacmSecurityModel
SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmSecurityModel.0.</p>

<p>This allows the output to be reused in shell
commands.</p>

<p>-Of Include the full list of MIB objects when displaying
an OID: .iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system.sysUpTime.0
= Timeticks: (14096763) 1 day, 15:09:27.63</p>

<p>-On Displays the OID numerically: .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 =
Timeticks: (14096763) 1 day, 15:09:27.63</p>

<p>-Oq Removes the equal sign and type information when
displaying varbind values: SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0
1:15:09:27.63</p>

<p>-OQ Removes the type information when displaying varbind
values: SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0 = 1:15:09:27.63</p>

<p>-Os Display the MIB object name (plus any instance or
other subiden- tifiers): sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (14096763)
1 day, 15:09:27.63</p>

<p>-OS Display the name of the MIB, as well as the object
name: SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (14096763) 1 day,
15:09:27.63</p>

<p>This is the default OID output format.</p>

<p>-Ot Display TimeTicks values as raw numbers:
SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0 = 14096763</p>

<p>-OT If values are printed as Hex strings, display a
printable ver- sion as well.</p>

<p>-Ou Display the OID in the traditional UCD-style
(inherited from the original CMU code). That means removing
a series of &quot;standard&quot; prefixes from the OID, and
displaying the remaining list of MIB object names (plus any
other subidentifiers): system.sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks:
(14096763) 1 day, 15:09:27.63</p>

<p>-OU Do not print the UNITS suffix at the end of the
value.</p>

<p>-Ov Display the varbind value only, not the OID: $
snmpget -c public -v 1 -Oe localhost ipForwarding.0 INTEGER:
forwarding(1)</p>

<p>-Ox Display string values as Hex strings (unless there
is a DISPLAY- HINT defined for the corresponding MIB
object). By default, the library attempts to determine
whether the value is a printable or binary string, and
displays it accordingly.</p>

<p>This option does not affect objects that do have a
Display Hint.</p>

<p>-OX Display table indexes in a more &quot;program
like&quot; output, imitating a traditional array-style index
format: $ snmpgetnext -c public -v 1 localhost
ipv6RouteTable
IPv6-MIB::ipv6RouteIfIndex.63.254.1.0.255.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.64.1
= INTEGER: 2 $ snmpgetnext -c public -v 1 -OE localhost
ipv6RouteTable
IPv6-MIB::ipv6RouteIfIndex[3ffe:100:ff00:0:0:0:0:0][64][1] =
INTEGER: 2</p>

<p>Most of these options can also be configured via
configuration tokens. See the snmp.conf(5) manual page for
details.</p>

<p>LOGGING OPTIONS The mechanism and destination to use for
logging of warning and error messages can be controlled by
passing various parameters to the -L flag.</p>

<p>-Le Log messages to the standard error stream.</p>

<p>-Lf FILE Log messages to the specified file.</p>

<p>-Lo Log messages to the standard output stream.</p>

<p>-Ls FACILITY Log messages via syslog, using the
specified facility (d for LOG_DAEMON, u for LOG_USER, or 0-7
for LOG_LOCAL0 through LOG_LOCAL7).</p>

<p>There are also &quot;upper case&quot; versions of each
of these options, which allow the corresponding logging
mechanism to be restricted to certain priorities of message.
Using standard error logging as an example:</p>

<p>-LE pri will log messages of priority pri and above to
standard error.</p>

<p>-LE p1-p2 will log messages with priority between p1 and
p2 (inclu- sive) to standard error.</p>

<p>For -LF and -LS the priority specification comes before
the file or facility token. The priorities recognised
are:</p>

<p>0 or ! for LOG_EMERG, 1 or a for LOG_ALERT, 2 or c for
LOG_CRIT, 3 or e for LOG_ERR, 4 or w for LOG_WARNING, 5 or n
for LOG_NOTICE, 6 or i for LOG_INFO, and 7 or d for
LOG_DEBUG.</p>

<p>Normal output is (or will be!) logged at a priority
level of LOG_NOTICE</p>

<p>INPUT OPTIONS The interpretation of input object names
and the values to be assigned can be controlled using
various parameters of the -I flag. The default behaviour
will be described at the end of this section.</p>

<p>-Ib specifies that the given name should be regarded as
a regular expression, to match (case-insensitively) against
object names in the MIB tree. The &quot;best&quot; match
will be used - calculated as the one that matches the
closest to the beginning of the node name and the highest in
the tree. For example, the MIB object vacmSecurityModel
could be matched by the expression vacmsecuri- tymodel (full
name, but different case), or vacm.*model (regexp
pattern).</p>

<p>Note that . is a special character in regular expression
pat- terns, so the expression cannot specify instance
subidentifiers or more than one object name. A &quot;best
match&quot; expression will only be applied against single
MIB object names. For example, the expression sys*ontact.0
would not match the instance sysCon- tact.0 (although
sys*ontact would match sysContact). Similarly, specifying a
MIB module name will not succeed (so SNMPv2-MIB::sys.*ontact
would not match either).</p>

<p>-Ih disables the use of DISPLAY-HINT information when
assigning val- ues. This would then require providing the
raw value: snmpset ... HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSystemDate.0 x
&quot;07 D2 0C 0A 02 04 06 08&quot; instead of a formatted
version: snmpset ... HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSystemDate.0 =
2002-12-10,2:4:6.8</p>

<p>-Ir disables checking table indexes and the value to be
assigned against the relevant MIB definitions. This will
(hopefully) result in the remote agent reporting an invalid
request, rather than checking (and rejecting) this before it
is sent to the remote agent.</p>

<p>Local checks are more efficient (and the diagnostics
provided also tend to be more precise), but disabling this
behaviour is particularly useful when testing the remote
agent.</p>

<p>-IR enables &quot;random access&quot; lookup of MIB
names. Rather than pro- viding a full OID path to the
desired MIB object (or qualifying this object with an
explicit MIB module name), the MIB tree will be searched for
the matching object name. Thus
.iso.org.dod.internet.mib-2.system.sysDescr.0 (or
SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0) can be specified simply as
sysDescr.0.</p>

<p>Warning: Since MIB object names are not globally unique,
this approach may return a different MIB object depending on
which MIB files have been loaded.</p>

<p>The MIB-MODULE::objectName syntax has the advantage of
uniquely identifying a particular MIB object, as well as
being slightly more efficient (and automatically loading the
necessary MIB file if necessary).</p>

<p>-Is SUFFIX adds the specified suffix to each textual OID
given on the com- mand line. This can be used to retrieve
multiple objects from the same row of a table, by specifying
a common index value.</p>

<p>-IS PREFIX adds the specified prefix to each textual OID
given on the com- mand line. This can be used to specify an
explicit MIB module name for all objects being retrieved (or
for incurably lazy typ- ists).</p>

<p>-Iu enables the traditional UCD-style approach to
interpreting input OIDs. This assumes that OIDs are rooted
at the mib-2 point in the tree (unless they start with an
explicit . or include a MIB module name). So the sysDescr
instance above would be ref- erenced as
system.sysDescr.0.</p>

<p>Object names specified with a leading . are always
interpreted as &quot;fully qualified&quot; OIDs, listing the
sequence of MIB objects from the root of the MIB tree. Such
objects and those qualified by an explicit MIB module name
are unaffected by the -Ib, -IR and -Iu flags.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if none of the above input options are
specified, the default behaviour for a &quot;relative&quot;
OID is to try and interpret it as an (implicitly) fully
qualified OID, then apply &quot;random access&quot; lookup
(-IR), followed by &quot;best match&quot; pattern matching
(-Ib).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES PREFIX The standard prefix for
object identifiers (when using UCD-style output). Defaults
to .iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2</p>

<p>MIBS The list of MIBs to load. Defaults to
SNMPv2-TC:SNMPv2-MIB:IF-
MIB:IP-MIB:TCP-MIB:UDP-MIB:SNMP-VACM-MIB. Overridden by the
-m option.</p>

<p>MIBDIRS The list of directories to search for MIBs.
Defaults to /usr/share/snmp/mibs. Overridden by the -M
option.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf Agent configuration file. See
snmpd.conf(5).</p>
