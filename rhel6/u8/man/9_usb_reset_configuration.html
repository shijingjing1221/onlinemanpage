USB_RESET_CONFIGURAT(9)</p>

<p>NAME usb_reset_configuration - lightweight device
reset</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int usb_reset_configuration(struct usb_device *
dev);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dev the device whose configuration is being
reset</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This issues a standard SET_CONFIGURATION
request to the device using the current configuration. The
effect is to reset most USB-related state in the device,
including interface altsettings (reset to zero), endpoint
halts (cleared), and endpoint state (only for bulk and
interrupt endpoints). Other usbcore state is unchanged,
including bindings of usb device drivers to interfaces.</p>

<p>Because this affects multiple interfaces, avoid using
this with composite (multi-interface) devices. Instead, the
driver for each interface may use usb_set_interface on the
interfaces it claims. Be careful though; some devices
don&acute;t support the SET_INTERFACE request, and others
won&acute;t reset all the interface state (notably endpoint
state). Resetting the whole configuration would affect other
drivers&acute; interfaces.</p>

<p>The caller must own the device lock.</p>

<p>Returns zero on success, else a negative error code.</p>
