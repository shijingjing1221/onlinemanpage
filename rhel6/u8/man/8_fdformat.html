<p>NAME fdformat - Low-level formats a floppy disk</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fdformat [-n] device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fdformat does a low level format on a floppy
disk. device is usually one of the following (for floppy
devices, the major = 2, and the minor is shown for
informational purposes only):</p>

<p>/dev/fd0d360 (minor = 4) /dev/fd0h1200 (minor = 8)
/dev/fd0D360 (minor = 12) /dev/fd0H360 (minor = 12)
/dev/fd0D720 (minor = 16) /dev/fd0H720 (minor = 16)
/dev/fd0h360 (minor = 20) /dev/fd0h720 (minor = 24)
/dev/fd0H1440 (minor = 28)</p>

<p>/dev/fd1d360 (minor = 5) /dev/fd1h1200 (minor = 9)
/dev/fd1D360 (minor = 13) /dev/fd1H360 (minor = 13)
/dev/fd1D720 (minor = 17) /dev/fd1H720 (minor = 17)
/dev/fd1h360 (minor = 21) /dev/fd1h720 (minor = 25)
/dev/fd1H1440 (minor = 29)</p>

<p>The generic floppy devices, /dev/fd0 and /dev/fd1, will
fail to work with fdformat when a non-standard format is
being used, or if the for- mat has not been autodetected
earlier. In this case, use setfdprm(8) to load the disk
parameters.</p>

<p>For ATAPI IDE floppy driver (also known as LS-120 drives
or &quot;Superdisk&quot; drives) you have to use the
floppy(8).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -n No verify. This option will disable the
verification that is performed after the format.</p>
