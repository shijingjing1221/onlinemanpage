<p>SETSOCKOPT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SETSOCKOPT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME setsockopt - set the socket options</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setsockopt(int socket, int level, int option_name,
const void *option_value, socklen_t option_len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The setsockopt() function shall set the
option specified by the option_name argument, at the
protocol level specified by the level argument, to the value
pointed to by the option_value argument for the socket
associated with the file descriptor specified by the socket
argument.</p>

<p>The level argument specifies the protocol level at which
the option resides. To set options at the socket level,
specify the level argument as SOL_SOCKET. To set options at
other levels, supply the appropriate level identifier for
the protocol controlling the option. For example, to
indicate that an option is interpreted by the TCP (Transport
Control Protocol), set level to IPPROTO_TCP as defined in
the &lt;netinet/in.h&gt; header.</p>

<p>The option_name argument specifies a single option to
set. The option_name argument and any specified options are
passed uninterpreted to the appropriate protocol module for
interpretations. The &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; header defines the
socket-level options. The options are as follows:</p>

<p>SO_DEBUG Turns on recording of debugging information.
This option enables or disables debugging in the underlying
protocol modules. This option takes an int value. This is a
Boolean option.</p>

<p>SO_BROADCAST Permits sending of broadcast messages, if
this is supported by the protocol. This option takes an int
value. This is a Boolean option.</p>

<p>SO_REUSEADDR Specifies that the rules used in validating
addresses supplied to bind() should allow reuse of local
addresses, if this is sup- ported by the protocol. This
option takes an int value. This is a Boolean option.</p>

<p>SO_KEEPALIVE Keeps connections active by enabling the
periodic transmission of messages, if this is supported by
the protocol. This option takes an int value.</p>

<p>If the connected socket fails to respond to these
messages, the connec- tion is broken and threads writing to
that socket are notified with a SIGPIPE signal. This is a
Boolean option.</p>

<p>SO_LINGER Lingers on a close() if data is present. This
option controls the action taken when unsent messages queue
on a socket and close() is performed. If SO_LINGER is set,
the system shall block the process during close() until it
can transmit the data or until the time expires. If
SO_LINGER is not specified, and close() is issued, the
system handles the call in a way that allows the process to
continue as quickly as possible. This option takes a linger
structure, as defined in the &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; header, to
specify the state of the option and linger interval.</p>

<p>SO_OOBINLINE Leaves received out-of-band data (data
marked urgent) inline. This option takes an int value. This
is a Boolean option.</p>

<p>SO_SNDBUF Sets send buffer size. This option takes an
int value.</p>

<p>SO_RCVBUF Sets receive buffer size. This option takes an
int value.</p>

<p>SO_DONTROUTE Requests that outgoing messages bypass the
standard routing facilities. The destination shall be on a
directly-connected network, and messages are directed to the
appropriate network interface according to the destination
address. The effect, if any, of this option depends on what
protocol is in use. This option takes an int value. This is
a Boolean option.</p>

<p>SO_RCVLOWAT Sets the minimum number of bytes to process
for socket input operations. The default value for
SO_RCVLOWAT is 1. If SO_RCVLOWAT is set to a larger value,
blocking receive calls normally wait until they have
received the smaller of the low water mark value or the
requested amount. (They may return less than the low water
mark if an error occurs, a signal is caught, or the type of
data next in the receive queue is different from that
returned; for example, out-of-band data.) This option takes
an int value. Note that not all implementations allow this
option to be set.</p>

<p>SO_RCVTIMEO Sets the timeout value that specifies the
maximum amount of time an input function waits until it
completes. It accepts a timeval structure with the number of
seconds and microseconds specifying the limit on how long to
wait for an input operation to com- plete. If a receive
operation has blocked for this much time without receiving
additional data, it shall return with a par- tial count or
errno set to [EAGAIN] or [EWOULDBLOCK] if no data is
received. The default for this option is zero, which indi-
cates that a receive operation shall not time out. This
option takes a timeval structure. Note that not all
implementations allow this option to be set.</p>

<p>SO_SNDLOWAT Sets the minimum number of bytes to process
for socket output operations. Non-blocking output operations
shall process no data if flow control does not allow the
smaller of the send low water mark value or the entire
request to be processed. This option takes an int value.
Note that not all implementations allow this option to be
set.</p>

<p>SO_SNDTIMEO Sets the timeout value specifying the amount
of time that an output function blocks because flow control
prevents data from being sent. If a send operation has
blocked for this time, it shall return with a partial count
or with errno set to [EAGAIN] or [EWOULDBLOCK] if no data is
sent. The default for this option is zero, which indicates
that a send operation shall not time out. This option stores
a timeval structure. Note that not all implementations allow
this option to be set.</p>

<p>For Boolean options, 0 indicates that the option is
disabled and 1 indicates that the option is enabled.</p>

<p>Options at other protocol levels vary in format and
name.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, setsockopt()
shall return 0. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno
set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The setsockopt() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EDOM The send and receive timeout values are too big to
fit into the timeout fields in the socket structure.</p>

<p>EINVAL The specified option is invalid at the specified
socket level or the socket has been shut down.</p>

<p>EISCONN The socket is already connected, and a specified
option cannot be set while the socket is connected.</p>

<p>ENOPROTOOPT</p>

<p>The option is not supported by the protocol.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a
socket.</p>

<p>The setsockopt() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM There was insufficient memory available for the
operation to complete.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS Insufficient resources are available in the
system to complete the call.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The setsockopt() function provides an
application program with the means to control socket
behavior. An application program can use set- sockopt() to
allocate buffer space, control timeouts, or permit socket
data broadcasts. The &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; header defines the
socket-level options available to setsockopt().</p>

<p>Options may exist at multiple protocol levels. The SO_
options are always present at the uppermost socket
level.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
