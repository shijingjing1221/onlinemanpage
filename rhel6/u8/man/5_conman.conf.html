<p>CONMAN.CONF(5) ConMan: The Console Manager
CONMAN.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME conman.conf - ConMan daemon configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The conman.conf configuration file is used
to specify the consoles being managed by conmand.</p>

<p>Comments are introduced by a hash sign (#), and continue
until the end of the line. Blank lines and white-space are
ignored. Directives are terminated by a newline, but may
span multiple lines by escaping it (i.e., immediately
preceding the newline with a backslash). Strings may be
either single-quoted or double-quoted, but they may not
contain newlines. Keywords are case-insensitive.</p>

<p>SERVER DIRECTIVES These directives begin with the SERVER
keyword followed by one of the following key/value
pairs:</p>

<p>coredump = (on|off) Specifies whether the daemon should
generate a core dump file. This file will be created in the
current working directory (or / when running in the
background) unless you also set core- dumpdir. The default
is off.</p>

<p>coredumpdir = &quot;directory&quot; Specifies the
directory where the daemon tries to write core dump files.
The default is empty, meaning the current working directory
(or / when running in the background) will be used.</p>

<p>execpath = &quot;dir1:dir2:dir3...&quot; Specifies a
colon-separated list of directories in which to search for
external process-based console executables that are not
defined by an absolute or relative pathname. The default is
empty.</p>

<p>keepalive = (on|off) Specifies whether the daemon will
use TCP keep-alives for detecting dead connections. The
default is on.</p>

<p>logdir = &quot;directory&quot; Specifies a directory
prefix for log files that are not defined via an absolute
pathname. This affects the server logfile, global log, and
console log directives.</p>

<p>logfile = &quot;file[,priority]&quot; Specifies the file
to which log messages are appended if the daemon is not
running in the foreground. This string undergoes conversion
specifier expansion (cf., CONVERSION SPECIFICATIONS) each
time the file is opened. If an absolute pathname is not
given, the files location is relative to either logdir (if
defined) or the current working directory. Intermediate
direc- tories will be created as needed. The filename may
optionally be followed by a comma and a minimum priority at
which messages will be logged. Refer to syslog.conf(5) for a
list of priori- ties. The default priority is info. If this
keyword is used in conjunction with the syslog keyword,
messages will be sent to both locations.</p>

<p>loopback = (on|off) Specifies whether the daemon will
bind its socket to the loop- back address, thereby only
accepting local client connections directed to that address
(127.0.0.1). The default is off.</p>

<p>pidfile = &quot;file&quot; Specifies the file to which
the daemons PID is written. Inter- mediate directories will
be created as needed. The use of a pidfile is recommended if
you want to use the daemons -k, -q, or -r options.</p>

<p>port = integer Specifies the port on which the daemon
will listen for client connections.</p>

<p>resetcmd = &quot;string&quot; Specifies a command string
to be invoked by a subshell upon receipt of the client s
&quot;reset&quot; escape. Multiple commands within a string
may be separated with semicolons. This string undergoes
conversion specifier expansion (cf., CONVERSION SPECI-
FICATIONS) and will be invoked multiple times if the client
is connected to multiple consoles.</p>

<p>syslog = &quot;facility&quot; Specifies that log
messages are to be sent to the system logger (syslogd) at
the given facility. Refer to syslog.conf(5) for a list of
facilities. If this keyword is used in conjunction with the
logfile keyword, messages will be sent to both
locations.</p>

<p>tcpwrappers = (on|off) Specifies whether the daemon will
use TCP-Wrappers when accept- ing client connections.
Support for this feature must be enabled at compile-time
(via configure s &quot;--with-tcp-wrappers&quot; option).
Refer to hosts_access(5) and hosts_options(5) for more
details. The default is off.</p>

<p>timestamp = integer (m|h|d) Specifies the interval
between timestamps written to the indi- vidual console log
files. The interval is an integer that may be followed by a
single-character modifier; m for minutes (the default), h
for hours, or d for days. The default is 0 (i.e., no
timestamps).</p>

<p>GLOBAL DIRECTIVES These directives begin with the GLOBAL
keyword followed by one of the following key/value
pairs:</p>

<p>log = &quot;file&quot; Specifies the default log file to
use for each console direc- tive. This string undergoes
conversion specifier expansion (cf., CONVERSION
SPECIFICATIONS) each time the file is opened; it must
contain either %N or %D. If an absolute pathname is not
given, the files location is relative to either logdir (if
defined) or the current working directory. Intermediate
direc- tories will be created as needed.</p>

<p>logopts =
&quot;(lock|nolock),(sanitize|nosanitize),(timestamp|notimestamp)&quot;
Specifies global options for the console log files. These
options can be overridden on a per-console basis by
specifying the CONSOLE logopts keyword. Note that options
affecting the output of the consoles logfile also affect the
output of the consoles log-replay escape. The valid logopts
include the fol- lowing:</p>

<p>lock or nolock - locked logs are protected with a write
lock.</p>

<p>sanitize or nosanitize - sanitized logs convert
non-printable characters into 7-bit printable
characters.</p>

<p>timestamp or notimestamp - timestamped logs prepend each
line of console output with a timestamp in &quot;YYYY-MM-DD
HH:MM:SS&quot; format. This timestamp is generated when the
first character following the line break is output.</p>

<p>The default is
&quot;lock,nosanitize,notimestamp&quot;.</p>

<p>seropts = &quot;bps[,databits[parity[stopbits]]]&quot;
Specifies global options for local serial devices. These
options can be overridden on a per-console basis by
specifying the CONSOLE seropts keyword.</p>

<p>bps is an integer specifying the baud rate in
bits-per-second. If this exact value is not supported by the
system, it will be rounded down to the next supported
value.</p>

<p>databits is an integer from 5-8.</p>

<p>parity is a single case-insensitive character: n for
none, o for odd, and e for even.</p>

<p>stopbits is an integer from 1-2.</p>

<p>The default is &quot;9600,8n1&quot; for 9600 bps, 8 data
bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit.</p>

<p>ipmiopts =
&quot;U:str,P:str,K:str,C:int,L:str,W:flag&quot; Specifies
global options for IPMI Serial-Over-LAN devices. These
options can be overridden on a per-console basis by speci-
fying the CONSOLE IPMIOPTS keyword. This directive is only
available if configured using the
&quot;--with-freeipmi&quot; option.</p>

<p>The IPMIOPTS string is parsed into comma-delimited
substrings where each substring is of the form
&quot;X:VALUE&quot;. &quot;X&quot; is a single- character
case-insensitive key specifying the option type, and
&quot;VALUE&quot; is its corresponding value. The IPMI
default will be used if either &quot;VALUE&quot; is omitted
from the substring (&quot;X:&quot;) or the substring is
omitted altogether. Note that since the IPMIOPTS string is
delimited by commas, substring values cannot contain
commas.</p>

<p>The valid IPMIOPTS substrings include the following (in
any order):</p>

<p>U:username - a string of at most 16 bytes for the
username with which to authenticate to the BMCs serving the
remote consoles.</p>

<p>P:password - a string of at most 20 bytes for the
password with which to authenticate to the BMCs serving the
remote consoles.</p>

<p>K:K_g - a string of at most 20 bytes for the K_g key
with which to authenticate to the BMCs serving the remote
consoles.</p>

<p>C:cipher_suite - an integer for the IPMI cipher suite
ID. Refer to ipmiconsole(8) for a list of currently
supported IDs.</p>

<p>L:privilege_level - the string &quot;user&quot;,
&quot;op&quot;, or &quot;admin&quot;.</p>

<p>W:workaround_flag - a string or integer for an IPMI
workaround. Refer to ipmiconsole(8) for a list of currently
supported flags. This substring may be repeated to specify
multiple workaround flags.</p>

<p>Both the password and K_g values can be specified in
either ASCII or hexadecimal; in the latter case, the string
should begin with &quot;0x&quot; and contain at most 40
hexadecimal digits. A K_g key entered in hexadecimal may
contain embedded null charac- ters, but any characters
following the first null character in the password key will
be ignored.</p>

<p>CONSOLE DIRECTIVES This directive defines an individual
console being managed by the dae- mon. The CONSOLE keyword
is followed by one or more of the following key/value
pairs:</p>

<p>name = &quot;string&quot; Specifies the name used by
clients to refer to the console. This keyword is
required.</p>

<p>dev = &quot;string&quot; Specifies the type and location
of the device. This keyword is required.</p>

<p>A local serial port connection is defined by the
pathname of the character device file.</p>

<p>A remote terminal server connection using the telnet
protocol is defined by the &quot;host:port&quot; format
(where host is the remote hostname or IPv4 address, and port
is the remote port number).</p>

<p>An external process-based connection is defined by the
&quot;path args&quot; format (where path is the pathname to
an executable file/script, and any additional args are
space-delimited); the /usr/lib/conman/exec directory
contains scripts for various con- sole types.</p>

<p>A local Unix domain socket connection is defined by the
&quot;unix:path&quot; format (where &quot;unix:&quot; is the
literal character string prefix and path is the pathname of
the local socket).</p>

<p>An IPMI Serial-Over-LAN connection is defined by the
&quot;ipmi:host&quot; format (where &quot;ipmi:&quot; is the
literal string and host is a host- name or IPv4
address).</p>

<p>The %N character sequence will be replaced by the
console name.</p>

<p>log = &quot;file&quot; Specifies the file where console
output is logged. This string undergoes conversion specifier
expansion (cf., CONVERSION SPECI- FICATIONS) each time the
file is opened. If an absolute path- name is not given, the
file s location is relative to either logdir (if defined) or
the current working directory. Interme- diate directories
will be created as needed. An empty log string (i.e.,
log=&quot;&quot;) disables logging, overriding the global
log name.</p>

<p>logopts = &quot;string&quot; This keyword is optional
(cf., GLOBAL DIRECTIVES).</p>

<p>seropts = &quot;string&quot; This keyword is optional
(cf., GLOBAL DIRECTIVES).</p>

<p>ipmiopts = &quot;string&quot; This keyword is optional
(cf., GLOBAL DIRECTIVES).</p>

<p>CONVERSION SPECIFICATIONS A conversion specifier is a
two-character sequence beginning with a % character. The
second character in the sequence specifies the type of
conversion to be applied. The following specifiers are
supported:</p>

<p>%N The console name (from the name string).</p>

<p>%D The console device basename (from the dev string),
with leading directory components removed.</p>

<p>%P The daemons process identifier.</p>

<p>%Y The year as a 4-digit number with the century.</p>

<p>%y The year as a 2-digit number without the century.</p>

<p>%m The month as a 2-digit number (01-12).</p>

<p>%d The day of the month as a 2-digit number (01-31).</p>

<p>%H The hour as a 2-digit number using a 24-hour clock
(00-23).</p>

<p>%M The minute as a 2-digit number (00-59).</p>

<p>%S The seconds as a 2-digit number (00-61).</p>

<p>%s The number of seconds since the Epoch.</p>

<p>%% A literal % character.</p>

<p>The console name (%N) and device (%D) specifiers are
&quot;sanitized&quot; in that non-printable characters and
the forward-slash (/) character are replaced with
underscores.</p>
