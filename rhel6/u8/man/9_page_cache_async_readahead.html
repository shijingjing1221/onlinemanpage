<p>NAME page_cache_async_readahead - file readahead for
marked pages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void page_cache_async_readahead(struct
address_space * mapping, struct file_ra_state * ra, struct
file * filp, struct page * page, pgoff_t offset, unsigned
long req_size);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS mapping address_space which holds the
pagecache and I/O vectors</p>

<p>ra file_ra_state which holds the readahead state</p>

<p>filp passed on to -&gt;readpage and -&gt;readpages</p>

<p>page the page at offset which has the PG_readahead flag
set</p>

<p>offset start offset into mapping, in pagecache
page-sized units</p>

<p>req_size hint: total size of the read which the caller
is performing in pagecache pages</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION page_cache_async_ondemand should be called
when a page is used which has the PG_readahead flag; this is
a marker to suggest that the application has used up enough
of the readahead window that we should start pulling in more
pages.</p>
