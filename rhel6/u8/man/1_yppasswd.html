<p>yppasswd(1) yppasswd(1)</p>

<p>NAME yppasswd, ypchfn, ypchsh - change your password in
the NIS database</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS yppasswd [-f] [-l] [-p] [user] ypchfn [user]
ypchsh [user]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In the old days, the standard passwd(1),
chfn(1) and chsh(1) tools could not be used under Linux to
change the users NIS password, shell and GECOS information.
For changing the NIS information, they were replaced by
their NIS counterparts, yppasswd, ypchfn and ypchsh.</p>

<p>Today, this versions are deprecated and should not be
used any longer.</p>

<p>Using the command line switches, you can choose whether
to update your password -p, your login shell -l, or your
GECOS field -f, or a combina- tion of them. yppasswd implies
the -p option, if no other option is given. If you use the
-f or -l option, you also need to add the -p flag. ypchfn
implies the -f option, and ypchsh -l.</p>

<p>When invoked without the user argument, the account
information for the invoking user will be updated, otherwise
that of user will be updated. This option is only available
to the super-user. If the yppasswdd dae- mon on the server
supports it, you can give the root password of the server
instead of the users [old] password.</p>

<p>All tools will first prompt the user for the current NIS
password needed for authentication with the yppasswdd(8)
daemon. Subsequently, the program prompts for the updated
information:</p>

<p>If we use shadowing passwords using passwd.adjunct,
SHA-512 will be used for hashing a new password by default.
If we want to use MD5, SHA_256 or older DES, we need to set
the environment variable YP_PASSWD_HASH. Possible values are
&quot;DES&quot;, &quot;MD5&quot;, &quot;SHA-256&quot; and
&quot;SHA-512&quot; (value is case-insensitive).</p>

<p>yppasswd or -p Change the users NIS password. The user
is prompted for the new password. While typing the password,
echoing is turned off, so the password does not appear on
the screen. An empty password is rejected, as are passwords
shorter than six characters. The user will then be requested
to retype the password to make sure it wasnt misspelled the
first time.</p>

<p>ypchsh or -l Change the users login shell. The user is
prompted for a new shell, offering the old one as
default:</p>

<p>Login shell [/bin/sh]: _</p>

<p>To accept the default, simply press return. To clear the
shell field in your passwd(5) file entry (so that the
systems default shell is selected), enter the string
none.</p>

<p>ypchfn or -f Change the user s full name and related
information. Tradition- ally, some applications expect the
GECOS field (field 4) of the passwd(5) file to contain the
user s real name (as opposed to the login name) plus some
additional information like the office phone number. This
information is displayed by finger(1) and probably some
other tools, too.</p>

<p>When setting the full name, ypchfn displays the
following prompts, with the defaults in brackets:</p>

<p>Name [Joe Doe]: Location [2nd floor, bldg 34]: Office
Phone [12345]: Home Phone []:</p>

<p>To accept a default, simply press return. To clear a
field, enter the string none.</p>
