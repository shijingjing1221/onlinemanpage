<p>SIGNAL(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SIGNAL(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME signal - signal management</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>void (*signal(int sig, void (*func)(int)))(int);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Use of this function is unspecified in a
multi-threaded process.</p>

<p>The signal() function chooses one of three ways in which
receipt of the signal number sig is to be subsequently
handled. If the value of func is SIG_DFL, default handling
for that signal shall occur. If the value of func is
SIG_IGN, the signal shall be ignored. Otherwise, the appli-
cation shall ensure that func points to a function to be
called when that signal occurs. An invocation of such a
function because of a sig- nal, or (recursively) of any
further functions called by that invoca- tion (other than
functions in the standard library), is called a &quot;sig-
nal handler&quot;.</p>

<p>When a signal occurs, and func points to a function, it
is implementa- tion-defined whether the equivalent of a:</p>

<p>signal(sig, SIG_DFL);</p>

<p>is executed or the implementation prevents some
implementation-defined set of signals (at least including
sig) from occurring until the cur- rent signal handling has
completed. (If the value of sig is SIGILL, the
implementation may alternatively define that no action is
taken.) Next the equivalent of:</p>

<p>(*func)(sig);</p>

<p>is executed. If and when the function returns, if the
value of sig was SIGFPE, SIGILL, or SIGSEGV or any other
implementation-defined value corresponding to a
computational exception, the behavior is undefined.
Otherwise, the program shall resume execution at the point
it was interrupted. If the signal occurs as the result of
calling the abort(), raise(), kill(), pthread_kill(), or
sigqueue() function, the signal handler shall not call the
raise() function.</p>

<p>If the signal occurs other than as the result of calling
abort(), raise(), kill(), pthread_kill(), or sigqueue(), the
behavior is undefined if the signal handler refers to any
object with static stor- age duration other than by
assigning a value to an object declared as volatile
sig_atomic_t, or if the signal handler calls any function in
the standard library other than one of the functions listed
in Signal Concepts . Furthermore, if such a call fails, the
value of errno is unspecified.</p>

<p>At program start-up, the equivalent of:</p>

<p>signal(sig, SIG_IGN);</p>

<p>is executed for some signals, and the equivalent of:</p>

<p>signal(sig, SIG_DFL);</p>

<p>is executed for all other signals (see exec).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the request can be honored, signal()
shall return the value of func for the most recent call to
signal() for the specified signal sig. Oth- erwise, SIG_ERR
shall be returned and a positive value shall be stored in
errno.</p>

<p>ERRORS The signal() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The sig argument is not a valid signal number or
an attempt is made to catch a signal that cannot be caught
or ignore a signal that cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>The signal() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL An attempt was made to set the action to SIG_DFL
for a signal that cannot be caught or ignored (or both).</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The sigaction() function provides a
more comprehensive and reliable mechanism for controlling
signals; new applications should use sigac- tion() rather
than signal().</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
