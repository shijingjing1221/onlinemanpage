<p>ECVT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ECVT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ecvt, fcvt, gcvt - convert a floating-point number
to a string (LEGACY)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *ecvt(double value, int ndigit, int *restrict
decpt, int *restrict sign); char *fcvt(double value, int
ndigit, int *restrict decpt, int *restrict sign); char
*gcvt(double value, int ndigit, char *buf);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ecvt(), fcvt(), and gcvt() functions
shall convert floating-point numbers to null-terminated
strings.</p>

<p>The ecvt() function shall convert value to a
null-terminated string of ndigit digits (where ndigit is
reduced to an unspecified limit deter- mined by the
precision of a double) and return a pointer to the string.
The high-order digit shall be non-zero, unless the value is
0. The low- order digit shall be rounded in an
implementation-defined manner. The position of the radix
character relative to the beginning of the string shall be
stored in the integer pointed to by decpt (negative means to
the left of the returned digits). If value is zero, it is
unspecified whether the integer pointed to by decpt would be
0 or 1. The radix character shall not be included in the
returned string. If the sign of the result is negative, the
integer pointed to by sign shall be non- zero; otherwise, it
shall be 0.</p>

<p>If the converted value is out of range or is not
representable, the contents of the returned string are
unspecified.</p>

<p>The fcvt() function shall be equivalent to ecvt(),
except that ndigit specifies the number of digits desired
after the radix character. The total number of digits in the
result string is restricted to an unspec- ified limit as
determined by the precision of a double.</p>

<p>The gcvt() function shall convert value to a
null-terminated string (similar to that of the %g conversion
specification format of printf()) in the array pointed to by
buf and shall return buf. It shall produce ndigit
significant digits (limited to an unspecified value
determined by the precision of a double) in the %f
conversion specification format of printf() if possible, or
the %e conversion specification format of printf()
(scientific notation) otherwise. A minus sign shall be
included in the returned string if value is less than 0. A
radix char- acter shall be included in the returned string
if value is not a whole number. Trailing zeros shall be
suppressed where value is not a whole number. The radix
character is determined by the current locale. If
setlocale() has not been called successfully, the default
locale, POSIX, is used. The default locale specifies a
period (. ) as the radix character. The LC_NUMERIC category
determines the value of the radix character within the
current locale.</p>

<p>These functions need not be reentrant. A function that
is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The ecvt() and fcvt() functions shall
return a pointer to a null-termi- nated string of
digits.</p>

<p>The gcvt() function shall return buf.</p>

<p>The return values from ecvt() and fcvt() may point to
static data which may be overwritten by subsequent calls to
these functions.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The sprintf() function is preferred
over this function.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS These functions may be withdrawn in a
future version.</p>
