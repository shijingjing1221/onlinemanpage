<p>NAME pamfunc - Apply a simple monadic arithmetic
function to a Netpbm image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamfunc { -multiplier=realnum |
-divisor=realnum | -adder=integer | -subtractor=integer |
-min=wholenum | -max=wholenum -andmask=hexmask
-ormask=hexmask -xormask=hexmask -not -shiftleft=count
-shiftright=count } [filespec]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one. You may
separate an option name and its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamfunc reads a Netpbm image as input and produces a
Netpbm image as output, with the same format, maxval, and
dimensions as the input. pamfunc applies a simple transfer
function to each sample in the input to generate the
corresponding sample in the output. The options deter- mine
what function.</p>

<p>pamarith is the same thing for binary functions -- it
takes two images as input and applies a specified simple
arithmetic function (e.g. addi- tion) on pairs of samples
from the two to produce the single output image.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -multiplier=realnum</p>

<p>This option makes the transfer function that of
multiplying by realnum. realnum must be nonnegative. If the
result is greater than the image maxval, it is clipped to
the max- val.</p>

<p>Where the input is a PGM or PPM image, this has the
effect of dimming or brightening it. For a different kind of
bright- ening, see ppmbrighten(1)and ppmflash(1)</p>

<p>Also, see ppmdim(1),whichdoesthe same thing as pamfunc
-multiplier on a PPM image with a multiplier between 0 and
1, except it uses integer arithmetic, so it may be
faster.</p>

<p>And ppmfade(1)cangenerateawhole sequence of images of
brightness declining to black or increasing to white, if
thats what you want.</p>

<p>-divisor=realnum</p>

<p>This option makes the transfer function that of dividing
by realnum. realnum must be nonnegative. If the result is
greater than the image maxval, it is clipped to the max-
val.</p>

<p>This is the same function as you would get with
-multiplier, specifying the multiplicative inverse of
realnum.</p>

<p>-adder=integer</p>

<p>This option makes the transfer function that of adding
wholenum. If the result is greater than the image maxval, it
is clipped to the maxval. If it is less than zero, it is
clipped to zero.</p>

<p>Note that in mathematics, this entity is called an
addend, and an adder is a snake. We use adder because it
makes more sense.</p>

<p>-subtractor=integer</p>

<p>This option makes the transfer function that of
subtracting wholenum. If the result is greater than the
image maxval, it is clipped to the maxval. If it is less
than zero, it is clipped to zero.</p>

<p>Note that in mathematics, this entity is called a
subtrahend rather than a subtractor. We use subtractor
because it makes more sense.</p>

<p>This is the same function as you would get with -adder,
specifying the negative of integer.</p>

<p>-min=wholenum</p>

<p>This option makes the transfer function that of taking
the maximum of the argument and wholenum. I.e the minimum
value in the output will be wholenum.</p>

<p>If wholenum is greater than the maxval, though, every
sam- ple in the output will be maxval.</p>

<p>-max=wholenum</p>

<p>This option makes the transfer function that of taking
the minimum of the argument and wholenum. I.e the maximum
value in the output will be wholenum.</p>

<p>If wholenum is greater than the maxval, the function is
idempotent -- the output is identical to the input.</p>

<p>-andmask=hexmask</p>

<p>This option makes the transfer function that of bitwise
anding with hexmask.</p>

<p>hexmask is in hexadecimal. Example: 0f</p>

<p>See section Maxval for the special meaning of maxval
with respect to bit string operations such as this.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.40 (September
2007).</p>

<p>-ormask=hexmask</p>

<p>This option makes the transfer function that of bitwise
inclusive oring with hexmask.</p>

<p>This is analogous to -andmask.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.40 (September
2007).</p>

<p>-xormask=hexmask</p>

<p>This option makes the transfer function that of bitwise
exclusive oring with hexmask.</p>

<p>This is analogous to -andmask.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.40 (September
2007).</p>

<p>-not</p>

<p>This option makes the transfer function that of bitwise
logical inversion (e.g. sample value 0xAA becomes 0x55).</p>

<p>See section Maxval for the special meaning of maxval
with respect to bit string operations such as this.</p>

<p>pnminvert does the same thing for a bilevel visual image
which has maxval 1 or is of PBM type.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.40 (September
2007).</p>

<p>-shiftleft=count</p>

<p>This option makes the transfer function that of bitwise
shifting left by count bits.</p>

<p>See section Maxval for the special meaning of maxval
with respect to bit string operations such as this.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.40 (September
2007).</p>

<p>-shiftright=count</p>

<p>This option makes the transfer function that of bitwise
shifting right by count bits.</p>

<p>This is analogous to -shiftleft.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.40 (September
2007).</p>

<p>MAXVAL For the arithmetic functions, the maxval has no
meaning. The function applies to the sample value as an
integer. (Note that this differs from the usual
interpretation of PAM samples as being a fraction of a
maxval, but does produce more intuitive result: 2 times 5 is
10.</p>

<p>But with the bit string operations, the maxval has a
special meaning. The functions in question are: -andmask,
-ormask, -xormask, -not, -shiftleft, and -shiftright.</p>

<p>With these, each sample value the input image, and in
the output image, represents a bit string, not a number. The
maxval tells how wide the bit string is. The maxval must be
a full binary count (a power of two minus one, such as 0xff)
and the number of ones in it is the width of the bit
string.</p>

<p>For a masking function, the mask value you specify must
not have more significant bits than the width indicated by
the maxval.</p>

<p>For a shifting operation, the shift count you specify
must not be greater than the width indicated by the
maxval.</p>

<p>The maxval of the output image is the same as that of
the input image.</p>
