<p>INTRODUCTION This man page presents an overview of Tcl
objects and how they are used. It also describes generic
procedures for managing Tcl objects. These procedures are
used to create and copy objects, and increment and decrement
the count of references (pointers) to objects. The proce-
dures are used in conjunction with ones that operate on
specific types of objects such as Tcl_GetIntFromObj and
Tcl_ListObjAppendElement. The individual procedures are
described along with the data structures they
manipulate.</p>

<p>Tcl s dual-ported objects provide a general-purpose
mechanism for stor- ing and exchanging Tcl values. They
largely replace the use of strings in Tcl. For example, they
are used to store variable values, command arguments,
command results, and scripts. Tcl objects behave like
strings but also hold an internal representation that can be
manipu- lated more efficiently. For example, a Tcl list is
now represented as an object that holds the lists string
representation as well as an array of pointers to the
objects for each list element. Dual-ported objects avoid
most runtime type conversions. They also improve the speed
of many operations since an appropriate representation is
immedi- ately available. The compiler itself uses Tcl
objects to cache the instruction bytecodes resulting from
compiling scripts.</p>

<p>The two representations are a cache of each other and
are computed lazily. That is, each representation is only
computed when necessary, it is computed from the other
representation, and, once computed, it is saved. In
addition, a change in one representation invalidates the
other one. As an example, a Tcl program doing integer
calculations can operate directly on a variables internal
machine integer representa- tion without having to
constantly convert between integers and strings. Only when
it needs a string representing the variable s value, say to
print it, will the program regenerate the string
representation from the integer. Although objects contain an
internal representation, their semantics are defined in
terms of strings: an up-to-date string can always be
obtained, and any change to the object will be reflected in
that string when the objects string representation is
fetched. Because of this representation invalidation and
regeneration, it is dangerous for extension writers to
access Tcl_Obj fields directly. It is better to access
Tcl_Obj information using procedures like Tcl_Get-
StringFromObj and Tcl_GetString.</p>

<p>Objects are allocated on the heap and are referenced
using a pointer to their Tcl_Obj structure. Objects are
shared as much as possible. This significantly reduces
storage requirements because some objects such as long lists
are very large. Also, most Tcl values are only read and
never modified. This is especially true for procedure
arguments, which can be shared between the caller and the
called procedure. Assignment and argument binding is done by
simply assigning a pointer to the value. Reference counting
is used to determine when it is safe to reclaim an objects
storage.</p>

<p>Tcl objects are typed. An object s internal
representation is con- trolled by its type. Several types
are predefined in the Tcl core including integer, double,
list, and bytecode. Extension writers can extend the set of
types by defining their own Tcl_ObjType structs.</p>

<p>THE TCL_OBJ STRUCTURE Each Tcl object is represented by
a Tcl_Obj structure which is defined as follows. typedef
struct Tcl_Obj { int refCount; char *bytes; int length;
Tcl_ObjType *typePtr; union { long longValue; double
doubleValue; void *otherValuePtr; Tcl_WideInt wideValue;
struct { void *ptr1; void *ptr2; } twoPtrValue; struct {
void *ptr; unsigned long value; } ptrAndLongRep; }
internalRep; } Tcl_Obj; The bytes and the length members
together hold an object s UTF-8 string representation, which
is a counted string not containing null bytes (UTF-8 null
characters should be encoded as a two byte sequence: 192,
128.) bytes points to the first byte of the string
representation. The length member gives the number of bytes.
The byte array must always have a null byte after the last
data byte, at offset length; this allows string
representations to be treated as conventional null-
terminated C strings. C programs use Tcl_GetStringFromObj
and Tcl_Get- String to get an objects string representation.
If bytes is NULL, the string representation is invalid.</p>

<p>An objects type manages its internal representation. The
member type- Ptr points to the Tcl_ObjType structure that
describes the type. If typePtr is NULL, the internal
representation is invalid.</p>

<p>The internalRep union member holds an objects internal
representation. This is either a (long) integer, a
double-precision floating-point num- ber, a pointer to a
value containing additional information needed by the
objects type to represent the object, a Tcl_WideInt integer,
two arbitrary pointers, or a pair made up of an unsigned
long integer and a pointer.</p>

<p>The refCount member is used to tell when it is safe to
free an objects storage. It holds the count of active
references to the object. Main- taining the correct
reference count is a key responsibility of exten- sion
writers. Reference counting is discussed below in the
section STORAGE MANAGEMENT OF OBJECTS.</p>

<p>Although extension writers can directly access the
members of a Tcl_Obj structure, it is much better to use the
appropriate procedures and macros. For example, extension
writers should never read or update refCount directly; they
should use macros such as Tcl_IncrRefCount and Tcl_IsShared
instead.</p>

<p>A key property of Tcl objects is that they hold two
representations. An object typically starts out containing
only a string representation: it is untyped and has a NULL
typePtr. An object containing an empty string or a copy of a
specified string is created using Tcl_NewObj or
Tcl_NewStringObj respectively. An objects string value is
gotten with Tcl_GetStringFromObj or Tcl_GetString and
changed with Tcl_Set- StringObj. If the object is later
passed to a procedure like Tcl_Get- IntFromObj that requires
a specific internal representation, the proce- dure will
create one and set the object s typePtr. The internal repre-
sentation is computed from the string representation. An
objects two representations are duals of each other: changes
made to one are reflected in the other. For example,
Tcl_ListObjReplace will modify an objects internal
representation and the next call to Tcl_GetStringFro- mObj
or Tcl_GetString will reflect that change.</p>

<p>Representations are recomputed lazily for efficiency. A
change to one representation made by a procedure such as
Tcl_ListObjReplace is not reflected immediately in the other
representation. Instead, the other representation is marked
invalid so that it is only regenerated if it is needed
later. Most C programmers never have to be concerned with
how this is done and simply use procedures such as
Tcl_GetBooleanFro- mObj or Tcl_ListObjIndex. Programmers
that implement their own object types must check for invalid
representations and mark representations invalid when
necessary. The procedure Tcl_InvalidateStringRep is used to
mark an objects string representation invalid and to free
any stor- age associated with the old string
representation.</p>

<p>Objects usually remain one type over their life, but
occasionally an object must be converted from one type to
another. For example, a C program might build up a string in
an object with repeated calls to Tcl_AppendToObj, and then
call Tcl_ListObjIndex to extract a list ele- ment from the
object. The same object holding the same string value can
have several different internal representations at different
times. Extension writers can also force an object to be
converted from one type to another using the
Tcl_ConvertToType procedure. Only program- mers that create
new object types need to be concerned about how this is
done. A procedure defined as part of the object type s
implementa- tion creates a new internal representation for
an object and changes its typePtr. See the man page for
Tcl_RegisterObjType to see how to create a new object
type.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE OF THE LIFETIME OF AN OBJECT As an example of
the lifetime of an object, consider the following sequence
of commands: set x 123 This assigns to x an untyped object
whose bytes member points to 123 and length member contains
3. The objects typePtr member is NULL. puts &quot;x is
$x&quot; xs string representation is valid (since bytes is
non-NULL) and is fetched for the command. incr x The incr
command first gets an integer from xs object by calling
Tcl_GetIntFromObj. This procedure checks whether the object
is already an integer object. Since it is not, it converts
the object by setting the objects internalRep.longValue
member to the integer 123 and set- ting the object s typePtr
to point to the integer Tcl_ObjType struc- ture. Both
representations are now valid. incr increments the object s
integer internal representation then invalidates its string
representation (by calling Tcl_InvalidateStringRep) since
the string representation no longer corresponds to the
internal representation. puts &quot;x is now $x&quot; The
string representation of xs object is needed and is
recomputed. The string representation is now 124 and both
representations are again valid.</p>

<p>STORAGE MANAGEMENT OF OBJECTS Tcl objects are allocated
on the heap and are shared as much as possi- ble to reduce
storage requirements. Reference counting is used to
determine when an object is no longer needed and can safely
be freed. An object just created by Tcl_NewObj or
Tcl_NewStringObj has refCount 0. The macro Tcl_IncrRefCount
increments the reference count when a new reference to the
object is created. The macro Tcl_DecrRefCount decrements the
count when a reference is no longer needed and, if the
object s reference count drops to zero, frees its storage.
An object shared by different code or data structures has
refCount greater than 1. Incrementing an objects reference
count ensures that it will not be freed too early or have
its value change accidentally.</p>

<p>As an example, the bytecode interpreter shares argument
objects between calling and called Tcl procedures to avoid
having to copy objects. It assigns the call s argument
objects to the procedures formal parameter variables. In
doing so, it calls Tcl_IncrRefCount to increment the
reference count of each argument since there is now a new
reference to it from the formal parameter. When the called
procedure returns, the interpreter calls Tcl_DecrRefCount to
decrement each arguments refer- ence count. When an objects
reference count drops less than or equal to zero,
Tcl_DecrRefCount reclaims its storage. Most command proce-
dures do not have to be concerned about reference counting
since they use an object s value immediately and do not
retain a pointer to the object after they return. However,
if they do retain a pointer to an object in a data
structure, they must be careful to increment its ref- erence
count since the retained pointer is a new reference.</p>

<p>Command procedures that directly modify objects such as
those for lap- pend and linsert must be careful to copy a
shared object before chang- ing it. They must first check
whether the object is shared by calling Tcl_IsShared. If the
object is shared they must copy the object by using
Tcl_DuplicateObj; this returns a new duplicate of the
original object that has refCount 0. If the object is not
shared, the command procedure owns the object and can safely
modify it directly. For example, the following code appears
in the command procedure that implements linsert. This
procedure modifies the list object passed to it in objv[1]
by inserting objc-3 new elements before index.</p>

<p>listPtr = objv[1]; if (Tcl_IsShared(listPtr)) { listPtr
= Tcl_DuplicateObj(listPtr); } result =
Tcl_ListObjReplace(interp, listPtr, index, 0, (objc-3),
&amp;(objv[3]));</p>

<p>As another example, incrs command procedure must check
whether the variable s object is shared before incrementing
the integer in its internal representation. If it is shared,
it needs to duplicate the object in order to avoid
accidentally changing values in other data structures.</p>
