<p>chrony.conf(5) Configuration Files chrony.conf(5)</p>

<p>NAME chrony.conf - chronyd configuration file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/chrony.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION chrony is a pair of programs for maintaining
the accuracy of computer clocks. chronyd is a background
daemon program that can be started at boot time.</p>

<p>Assuming that you have found some servers, you need to
set up a config- uration file to run chrony. The
(compiled-in) default location for this file is
/etc/chrony.conf. Assuming that your NTP servers are called
foo.example.net , bar.example.net and baz.example.net, your
chrony.conf file could contain as a minimum</p>

<p>server foo.example.net server bar.example.net server
baz.example.net</p>

<p>However, you will probably want to include some of the
other directives described in detail in the documentation
supplied with the distribution (chrony.txt and chrony.texi).
The following directives may be particu- larly useful :
driftfile, makestep, rtcsync. Also, the iburst server option
is useful to speed up the initial synchronization. The
smallest useful configuration file would look something
like</p>

<p>server foo.example.net iburst server bar.example.net
iburst server baz.example.net iburst driftfile
/var/lib/chrony/drift makestep 10 3 rtcsync</p>

<p>When using a pool of NTP servers (one name is used for
multiple servers which may change over time), its better to
specify them with the pool directive instead of multiple
server directives. The configu- ration file could in this
case look like</p>

<p>pool pool.ntp.org iburst driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift
makestep 10 3 rtcsync</p>
