Tcl_RegExpRange, Tcl_GetRegExpFromObj, Tcl_RegExpMatchObj,
Tcl_RegExpExecObj, Tcl_Reg- ExpGetInfo - Pattern matching
with regular expressions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tcl_RegExpMatchObj(interp, textObj, patObj)</p>

<p>int Tcl_RegExpMatch(interp, text, pattern)</p>

<p>Tcl_RegExp Tcl_RegExpCompile(interp, pattern)</p>

<p>int Tcl_RegExpExec(interp, regexp, text, start)</p>

<p>void Tcl_RegExpRange(regexp, index, startPtr,
endPtr)</p>

<p>Tcl_RegExp Tcl_GetRegExpFromObj(interp, patObj,
cflags)</p>

<p>int Tcl_RegExpExecObj(interp, regexp, textObj, offset,
nmatches, eflags)</p>

<p>void Tcl_RegExpGetInfo(regexp, infoPtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Tcl interpreter to use
for error reporting. The interpreter may be NULL if no error
reporting is desired.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *textObj (in/out) Refers to the object from
which to get the text to search. The internal representation
of the object may be converted to a form that can be
efficiently searched.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *patObj (in/out) Refers to the object from which
to get a regular expression. The com- piled regular
expression is cached in the object.</p>

<p>char *text (in) Text to search for a match with a
regular expression.</p>

<p>const char *pattern (in) String in the form of a regular
expression pattern.</p>

<p>Tcl_RegExp regexp (in) Compiled regular expression. Must
have been returned previously by Tcl_GetRegExpFromObj or
Tcl_RegEx- pCompile.</p>

<p>char *start (in) If text is just a portion of some other
string, this argument iden- tifies the beginning of the
larger string. If it is not the same as text, then no ^
matches will be allowed.</p>

<p>int index (in) Specifies which range is desired: 0 means
the range of the entire match, 1 or greater means the range
that matched a parenthesized sub-expression.</p>

<p>const char **startPtr (out) The address of the first
character in the range is stored here, or NULL if there is
no such range.</p>

<p>const char **endPtr (out) The address of the character
just after the last one in the range is stored here, or NULL
if there is no such range.</p>

<p>int cflags (in) OR-ed combination of the compila- tion
flags TCL_REG_ADVANCED, TCL_REG_EXTENDED, TCL_REG_BASIC,
TCL_REG_EXPANDED, TCL_REG_QUOTE, TCL_REG_NOCASE,
TCL_REG_NEWLINE, TCL_REG_NLSTOP, TCL_REG_NLANCH,
TCL_REG_NOSUB, and TCL_REG_CAN- MATCH. See below for more
informa- tion.</p>

<p>int offset (in) The character offset into the text where
matching should begin. The value of the offset has no impact
on ^ matches. This behavior is controlled by eflags.</p>

<p>int nmatches (in) The number of matching subexpres-
sions that should be remembered for later use. If this value
is 0, then no subexpression match information will be
computed. If the value is -1, then all of the matching
subexpressions will be remembered. Any other value will be
taken as the maximum number of subexpressions to
remember.</p>

<p>int eflags (in) OR-ed combination of the execution flags
TCL_REG_NOTBOL and TCL_REG_NOTEOL. See below for more
information.</p>

<p>Tcl_RegExpInfo *infoPtr (out) The address of the
location where information about a previous match should be
stored by Tcl_RegExpGet- Info.

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_RegExpMatch determines whether its
pattern argument matches regexp, where regexp is interpreted
as a regular expression using the rules in the re_syntax
reference page. If there is a match then Tcl_RegExpMatch
returns 1. If there is no match then Tcl_RegExpMatch returns
0. If an error occurs in the matching process (e.g. pattern
is not a valid regular expression) then Tcl_RegExpMatch
returns -1 and leaves an error message in the interpreter
result. Tcl_RegExpMatchObj is similar to Tcl_RegExpMatch
except it operates on the Tcl objects textObj and patObj
instead of UTF strings. Tcl_RegExpMatchObj is generally more
efficient than Tcl_RegExpMatch, so it is the preferred
interface.</p>

<p>Tcl_RegExpCompile, Tcl_RegExpExec, and Tcl_RegExpRange
provide lower- level access to the regular expression
pattern matcher. Tcl_RegExpCom- pile compiles a regular
expression string into the internal form used for efficient
pattern matching. The return value is a token for this
compiled form, which can be used in subsequent calls to
Tcl_RegExpExec or Tcl_RegExpRange. If an error occurs while
compiling the regular expression then Tcl_RegExpCompile
returns NULL and leaves an error mes- sage in the
interpreter result. Note: the return value from Tcl_Reg-
ExpCompile is only valid up to the next call to
Tcl_RegExpCompile; it is not safe to retain these values for
long periods of time.</p>

<p>Tcl_RegExpExec executes the regular expression pattern
matcher. It returns 1 if text contains a range of characters
that match regexp, 0 if no match is found, and -1 if an
error occurs. In the case of an error, Tcl_RegExpExec leaves
an error message in the interpreter result. When searching a
string for multiple matches of a pattern, it is important to
distinguish between the start of the original string and the
start of the current search. For example, when searching for
the second occurrence of a match, the text argument might
point to the character just after the first match; however,
it is important for the pattern matcher to know that this is
not the start of the entire string, so that it does not
allow ^ atoms in the pattern to match. The start argument
provides this information by pointing to the start of the
overall string containing text. Start will be less than or
equal to text; if it is less than text then no ^ matches
will be allowed.</p>

<p>Tcl_RegExpRange may be invoked after Tcl_RegExpExec
returns; it pro- vides detailed information about what
ranges of the string matched what parts of the pattern.
Tcl_RegExpRange returns a pair of pointers in *startPtr and
*endPtr that identify a range of characters in the source
string for the most recent call to Tcl_RegExpExec. Index
indicates which of several ranges is desired: if index is 0,
information is returned about the overall range of
characters that matched the entire pattern; otherwise,
information is returned about the range of charac- ters that
matched the indexth parenthesized subexpression within the
pattern. If there is no range corresponding to index then
NULL is stored in *startPtr and *endPtr.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetRegExpFromObj, Tcl_RegExpExecObj, and
Tcl_RegExpGetInfo are object interfaces that provide the
most direct control of Henry Spencers regular expression
library. For users that need to modify compilation and
execution options directly, it is recommended that you use
these interfaces instead of calling the internal regexp
functions. These interfaces handle the details of UTF to
Unicode translations as well as providing improved
performance through caching in the pattern and string
objects.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetRegExpFromObj attempts to return a compiled
regular expression from the patObj. If the object does not
already contain a compiled regular expression it will
attempt to create one from the string in the object and
assign it to the internal representation of the patObj. The
return value of this function is of type Tcl_RegExp. The
return value is a token for this compiled form, which can be
used in subsequent calls to Tcl_RegExpExecObj or
Tcl_RegExpGetInfo. If an error occurs while compiling the
regular expression then Tcl_GetRegExpFromObj returns NULL
and leaves an error message in the interpreter result. The
regular expression token can be used as long as the internal
repre- sentation of patObj refers to the compiled form. The
cflags argument is a bit-wise OR of zero or more of the
following flags that control the compilation of patObj:</p>

<p>TCL_REG_ADVANCED Compile advanced regular expressions (
AREs). This mode cor- responds to the normal regular
expression syntax accepted by the Tcl regexp and regsub
commands.</p>

<p>TCL_REG_EXTENDED Compile extended regular expressions (
EREs). This mode cor- responds to the regular expression
syntax recognized by Tcl 8.0 and earlier versions.</p>

<p>TCL_REG_BASIC Compile basic regular expressions (BREs).
This mode corre- sponds to the regular expression syntax
recognized by common Unix utilities like sed and grep. This
is the default if no flags are specified.</p>

<p>TCL_REG_EXPANDED Compile the regular expression (basic,
extended, or advanced) using an expanded syntax that allows
comments and whitespace. This mode causes non-backslashed
non-bracket-expression white space and #-to-end-of-line
comments to be ignored.</p>

<p>TCL_REG_QUOTE Compile a literal string, with all
characters treated as ordi- nary characters.</p>

<p>TCL_REG_NOCASE Compile for matching that ignores
upper/lower case distinc- tions.</p>

<p>TCL_REG_NEWLINE Compile for newline-sensitive matching.
By default, newline is a completely ordinary character with
no special meaning in either regular expressions or strings.
With this flag, [^ bracket expressions and . never match
newline, ^ matches an empty string after any newline in
addition to its normal function, and $ matches an empty
string before any newline in addition to its normal
function. REG_NEWLINE is the bit- wise OR of REG_NLSTOP and
REG_NLANCH.</p>

<p>TCL_REG_NLSTOP Compile for partial newline-sensitive
matching, with the behavior of [^ bracket expressions and .
affected, but not the behavior of ^ and $. In this mode, [^
bracket expressions and . never match newline.</p>

<p>TCL_REG_NLANCH Compile for inverse partial
newline-sensitive matching, with the behavior of ^ and $
(the anchors) affected, but not the behavior of [^ bracket
expressions and .. In this mode ^ matches an empty string
after any newline in addition to its normal function, and $
matches an empty string before any newline in addition to
its normal function.</p>

<p>TCL_REG_NOSUB Compile for matching that reports only
success or failure, not what was matched. This reduces
compile overhead and may improve performance. Subsequent
calls to Tcl_RegExpGetInfo or Tcl_RegExpRange will not
report any match information.</p>

<p>TCL_REG_CANMATCH Compile for matching that reports the
potential to complete a partial match given more text (see
below).</p>

<p>Only one of TCL_REG_EXTENDED, TCL_REG_ADVANCED,
TCL_REG_BASIC, and TCL_REG_QUOTE may be specified.</p>

<p>Tcl_RegExpExecObj executes the regular expression
pattern matcher. It returns 1 if objPtr contains a range of
characters that match regexp, 0 if no match is found, and -1
if an error occurs. In the case of an error,
Tcl_RegExpExecObj leaves an error message in the interpreter
result. The nmatches value indicates to the matcher how many
subex- pressions are of interest. If nmatches is 0, then no
subexpression match information is recorded, which may allow
the matcher to make var- ious optimizations. If the value is
-1, then all of the subexpressions in the pattern are
remembered. If the value is a positive integer, then only
that number of subexpressions will be remembered. Matching
begins at the specified Unicode character index given by
offset. Unlike Tcl_RegExpExec, the behavior of anchors is
not affected by the offset value. Instead the behavior of
the anchors is explicitly con- trolled by the eflags
argument, which is a bit-wise OR of zero or more of the
following flags:</p>

<p>TCL_REG_NOTBOL The starting character will not be
treated as the beginning of a line or the beginning of the
string, so ^ will not match there. Note that this flag has
no effect on how0 TCL_REG_NOTEOL The last character in the
string will not be treated as the end of a line or the end
of the string, so $ will not match there. Note that this
flag has no effect on howZ matches. Tcl_RegExpGetInfo
retrieves information about the last match performed with a
given regular expression regexp. The infoPtr argument
contains a pointer to a structure that is defined as
follows:</p>

<p>typedef struct Tcl_RegExpInfo { int nsubs;
Tcl_RegExpIndices *matches; long extendStart; }
Tcl_RegExpInfo;</p>

<p>The nsubs field contains a count of the number of
parenthesized subex- pressions within the regular
expression. If the TCL_REG_NOSUB was used, then this value
will be zero. The matches field points to an array of nsubs
values that indicate the bounds of each subexpression
matched. The first element in the array refers to the range
matched by the entire regular expression, and subsequent
elements refer to the parenthesized subexpressions in the
order that they appear in the pat- tern. Each element is a
structure that is defined as follows:</p>

<p>typedef struct Tcl_RegExpIndices { long start; long end;
} Tcl_RegExpIndices;</p>

<p>The start and end values are Unicode character indices
relative to the offset location within objPtr where matching
began. The start index identifies the first character of the
matched subexpression. The end index identifies the first
character after the matched subexpression. If the
subexpression matched the empty string, then start and end
will be equal. If the subexpression did not participate in
the match, then start and end will be set to -1.</p>

<p>The extendStart field in Tcl_RegExpInfo is only set if
the TCL_REG_CAN- MATCH flag was used. It indicates the first
character in the string where a match could occur. If a
match was found, this will be the same as the beginning of
the current match. If no match was found, then it indicates
the earliest point at which a match might occur if
additional text is appended to the string. If it is no match
is possible even with further text, this field will be set
to -1.</p>
