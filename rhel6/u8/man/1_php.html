<p>PHP(1) Scripting Language PHP(1)</p>

<p>NAME php - PHP Command Line Interface CLI</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS php [options] [ -f ] file [[--] args...]</p>

<p>php [options] -r code [[--] args...]</p>

<p>php [options] [-B code] -R code [-E code] [[--]
args...]</p>

<p>php [options] [-B code] -F file [-E code] [[--]
args...]</p>

<p>php [options] -- [ args...]</p>

<p>php [options] -a</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION PHP is a widely-used general-purpose
scripting language that is espe- cially suited for Web
development and can be embedded into HTML. This is the
command line interface that enables you to do the
following:</p>

<p>You can parse and execute files by using parameter -f
followed by the name of the file to be executed.</p>

<p>Using parameter -r you can directly execute PHP code
simply as you would do inside a .php file when using the
eval() function.</p>

<p>It is also possible to process the standard input line
by line using either the parameter -R or -F. In this mode
each separate input line causes the code specified by -R or
the file specified by -F to be exe- cuted. You can access
the input line by $argn. While processing the input lines
$argi contains the number of the actual line being pro-
cessed. Further more the parameters -B and -E can be used to
execute code (see -r) before and after all input lines have
been processed respectively. Notice that the input is read
from STDIN and therefore reading from STDIN explicitly
changes the next input line or skips input lines.</p>

<p>If none of -r -f -B -R -F or -E is present but a single
parameter is given then this parameter is taken as the
filename to parse and execute (same as with -f). If no
parameter is present then the standard input is read and
executed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --interactive -a Run PHP interactively. This
lets you enter snippets of PHP code that directly get
executed. When readline sup- port is enabled you can edit
the lines and also have history support.</p>

<p>--bindpath address:port|port -b address:port|port Bind
Path for external FASTCGI Server mode (CGI only).</p>

<p>--no-chdir -C Do not chdir to the scripts directory (CGI
only).</p>

<p>--no-header -q Quiet-mode. Suppress HTTP header output
(CGI only).</p>

<p>--timing count -T count Measure execution time of script
repeated count times (CGI only).</p>

<p>--php-ini path|file -c path|file Look for php.ini file
in the directory path or use the specified file</p>

<p>--no-php-ini -n No php.ini file will be used</p>

<p>--define foo[=bar] -d foo[=bar] Define INI entry foo
with value bar</p>

<p>-e Generate extended information for
debugger/profiler</p>

<p>--file file -f file Parse and execute file</p>

<p>--global name -g name Make variable name global in
script.</p>

<p>--help -h This help</p>

<p>--hide-args -H Hide script name (file) and parameters
(args...) from external tools. For example you may want to
use this when a php script is started as a daemon and the
command line contains sensitive data such as passwords.</p>

<p>--info -i PHP information and configuration</p>

<p>--syntax-check -l Syntax check only (lint)</p>

<p>--modules -m Show compiled in modules</p>

<p>--run code -r code Run PHP code without using script
tags&lt;?..?&gt;</p>

<p>--process-begin code -B code Run PHP code before
processing input lines</p>

<p>--process-code code -R code Run PHP code for every input
line</p>

<p>--process-file file -F file Parse and execute file for
every input line</p>

<p>--process-end code -E code Run PHP code after processing
all input lines</p>

<p>--syntax-highlight -s Output HTML syntax highlighted
source</p>

<p>--version -v Version number</p>

<p>--stripped -w Output source with stripped comments and
whitespace</p>

<p>--zend-extension file -z file Load Zend extension
file</p>

<p>args... Arguments passed to script. Use--args when first
argument starts with-or script is read from stdin</p>

<p>--rfunction name --rf name Shows information about
function name</p>

<p>--rclass name --rc name Shows information about class
name</p>

<p>--rextension name --re name Shows information about
extension name</p>

<p>--rextinfo name --ri name Shows configuration for
extension name</p>

<p>--ini Show configuration file names</p>

<p>FILES php-cli.ini The configuration file for the CLI
version of PHP.</p>

<p>php.ini The standard configuration file will only be
used when php-cli.ini cannot be found.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES php -r echo &quot;Hello Worldn&quot;;_ This
command simply writes the text &quot;Hello World&quot; to
standard out.</p>

<p>php -r print_r(gd_info());_ This shows the configuration
of your gd extension. You can use this to easily check which
image formats you can use. If you have any dynamic modules
you may want to use the same ini file that php uses when
executed from your webserver. There are more extensions
which have such a function. For dba use: php -r
print_r(dba_handlers(1));_</p>

<p>php -R echo strip_tags($argn).&quot;n&quot;;_ This PHP
command strips off the HTML tags line by line and outputs
the result. To see how it works you can first look at the
follow- ing PHP command &acute;php -d html_errors=1
-i&acute; which uses PHP to output HTML formatted
configuration information. If you then combine those two
&acute;php ...|php ...&acute; youll see what happens.</p>

<p>php -E echo &quot;Lines: $argin&quot;;_ Using this PHP
command you can count the lines being input.</p>

<p>php -R @$l+=count(file($argn));_-E echo
&quot;Lines:$ln&quot;;_ In this example PHP expects each
input line being a file. It counts all lines of the files
specified by each input line and shows the summarized
result. You may combine this with tools like find and change
the php scriptlet.</p>

<p>php -R echo &quot;$argnn&quot;; fgets(STDIN);_ Since you
have access to STDIN from within -B -R -F and -E you can
skip certain input lines with your code. But note that in
such cases $argi only counts the lines being processed by
php itself. Having read this you will guess what the above
program does: skip- ping every second input line.</p>

<p>TIPS You can use a shebang line to automatically invoke
php from scripts. Only the CLI version of PHP will ignore
such a first line as shown below:</p>

<p>#!/bin/php &lt;?php // your script ?&gt;</p>
