<p>NAME gfs2_edit - Display, print or edit GFS2 or GFS
internal structures.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gfs2_edit [OPTION]... [DEVICE]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gfs2_edit command is a tool used to
examine, edit or display inter- nal data structures of a
GFS2 or GFS file system. The gfs2_edit com- mand can be run
interactively, as described below in INTERACTIVE MODE.</p>

<p>Caution: Several options of the gfs2_edit command alter
the file system metadata and can cause file system
corruption. These options should be used with great
care.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p [struct | block] [blocktype] [blockalloc
[val]] [blockbits] [blockrg] [find
sb|rg|rb|di|in|lf|jd|lh|ld|ea|ed|lb|13|qc] [field
&lt;field&gt; [val]] Print a gfs2 data structure in
human-readable format to stdout. You can enter either a
block number or a data structure name. Block numbers may be
specified in hex (e.g., 0x10) or decimal (e.g., 16).</p>

<p>You can specify the following well-known locations with
the -p option.</p>

<p>sb, superblock - Print the superblock.</p>

<p>root - Print the root directory.</p>

<p>master - Print the master system directory.</p>

<p>jindex - Print the journal index system directory.</p>

<p>per_node - Print the per_node system directory.</p>

<p>inum - Print the system inum file.</p>

<p>statfs - Print the system statfs file.</p>

<p>rindex, rgindex - Print the resource group index system
file.</p>

<p>rg X - Print the resource group information for RG X
(zero- based).</p>

<p>rgs - Print the resource group information.</p>

<p>quota - Print the contents of the system quota file.</p>

<p>identify - Identify a data block rather than print the
blocks contents.</p>

<p>size - Print the device size information.</p>

<p>journalX - Print the contents of journal X, where X is a
journal number from 0 to &lt;the number of journals in your
file system - 1&gt;. Only the journal headers and journal
descriptors are dumped. For journal descriptors, this option
prints out every file system block number logged in that
section of the journal. The actual journaled blocks are not
printed.</p>

<p>If you specify a block number rather than a structure
name, gfs2_edit will print out a breakdown of the structure
for that block. For example: gfs2_edit -p sb will print the
superblock, but so does gfs2_edit -p 0x10 and gfs2_edit -p
16.</p>

<p>If you specify -p without a block or structure name,
gfs2_edit prints the superblock.</p>

<p>You can specify more than one data structure with a
single -p option. For example, gfs2_edit -p inum statfs
/dev/sda1 prints the system inum file and the system statfs
file on /dev/sda1.</p>

<p>Optionally, you may specify the keyword blocktype to
print out the gfs2 block type for the specified block. Valid
gfs2 block types are: 0 (Clump), 1 (Superblock), 2 (Resource
Group Header), 3 (Resource Group Bitmap), 4 (Dinode), 5
(Indirect Block), 6 (Leaf), 7 (Journaled data), 8 (Log
Header), 9 (Log descriptor), 10 (Extended attribute), 11
(Eattr Data), 12 (Log Buffer), 13 (Invalid), and 14 (Quota
Change).</p>

<p>Optionally, you may specify the keyword blockalloc with
an optional value to assign. If no value is specified, the
block- alloc keyword will print the block allocation type
for the spec- ified block. Valid block allocation types are:
0 (Free block), 1 (Data block), 2 (Unlinked block), and 3
(Metadata block). If a value from 0 to 3 is specified, the
resource group bitmap will be changed to the new value. This
may be used, for example, to artificially free or allocate a
block in order to test fsck.gfs2s ability to detect and fix
the problem.</p>

<p>Optionally, you may specify the keyword blockbits. This
option will locate and print the block containing the bitmap
corre- sponding to the specified block.</p>

<p>Optionally, you may specify the keyword blockrg. This
option will locate and print the block number of the
resource group that holds information about the specified
block.</p>

<p>You may also use gfs2_edit to find the next occurrence
of a metadata block of a certain type. Valid metadata types
are: none (unused metadata clump block), sb (superblock), rg
(resource group), rb (rg bitmap), di (disk inode aka
dinode), in (indirect block list), lf (directory leaf), jd
(journaled data), lh (journal log header), ld (journal log
descriptor), ea (extended attribute), ed (ea data block), lb
(log buffer), 13 (unused block type 13), qc (quota change).
The block AFTER the one specified with -p is the starting
point for the search. For example, if you specify gfs2_edit
-p rg 12 find rg /dev/your/device, it will find the rg that
follows rg 12 (nor- mally, this would be rg 13). Note,
however, that since metadata often appears in the journals,
it could be a copy of a different RG, inside a journal. Also
note that gfs2_edit will only find allocated metadata blocks
unless the type specified is none, sb, rg or rb. In other
words, if you try to find a disk inode, it will only find an
allocated dinode, not a deallocated one.</p>

<p>Optionally, you may specify the keyword field followed
by a valid metadata field name. Right now, only the fields
in disk inodes and resource groups are allowed. If no value
is speci- fied after the field, the value of the field will
be printed to stdout. If a value is specified, the fields
value will be changed. This may be used, for example, to
artificially change the di_size field for an inode in order
to test fsck.gfs2s ability to detect and fix the
problem.</p>

<p>-s [structure | block] Specify a starting block for
interactive mode. Any of the well- known locations found in
the -p option may be specified. If you want to start on a
particular resource group, specify it in quotes, e.g. -s
&quot;rg 3&quot;</p>

<p>-h, -help, -usage Print help information.</p>

<p>-c [0 | 1] Use alternate color scheme for interactive
mode: 0=normal (dark colors on white background), or 1
(light colors on black back- ground).</p>

<p>-V Print program version information only.</p>

<p>-x Print in hex mode.</p>

<p>-z &lt;0-9&gt; Compress metadata with gzip compression
level 1 to 9 (default 9). 0 means no compression at all.</p>

<p>rg &lt;rg&gt; &lt;device&gt; Print the contents of
Resource Group &lt;rg&gt; on &lt;device&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;rg&gt; is a number from 0 to X - 1, where X is the
number of RGs.</p>

<p>rgcount &lt;device&gt; Print the number of Resource
Groups in the file system on &lt;device&gt;.</p>

<p>rgflags &lt;rg&gt; [new_value] &lt;device&gt; Print
and/or modify the rg_flags value of Resource Group
&lt;rg&gt; on &lt;device&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;rg&gt; is a number from 0 to X - 1, where X is the
number of RGs. If new_value is not specified, the current
rg_flags value will be printed but not modified. If
new_value is specified, the rg_flags field will be
overwritten with the new value.</p>

<p>printsavedmeta &lt;filename&gt; Print off a list of
blocks from &lt;filename&gt; that were saved with the
savemeta option.</p>

<p>savemeta &lt;device&gt; &lt;filename&gt; Save off the
GFS2 metadata (not user data) for the file system on the
specified device to a file given by &lt;filename&gt;. You
can use this option to analyze file system problems without
reveal- ing sensitive information that may be contained in
the files. This option works quickly by using the system
bitmap blocks in the resource groups to determine the
location of all the meta- data. If there is corruption in
the bitmaps, resource groups or rindex file, this method may
fail and you may need to use the savemetaslow option. The
destination file is compressed using gzip unless -z 0 is
specified.</p>

<p>savemetaslow &lt;device&gt; &lt;filename&gt; Save off
GFS2 metadata, as with the savemeta option, examining every
block in the file system for metadata. This option is less
prone to failure due to file system corruption than the
savemeta option, but it is extremely slow. The destination
file is compressed using gzip unless -z 0 is specified.</p>

<p>savergs &lt;device&gt; &lt;filename&gt; Save off only
the GFS2 resource group metadata for the file sys- tem on
the specified device to a file given by &lt;filename&gt;.
The destination file is compressed using gzip unless -z 0 is
speci- fied.</p>

<p>restoremeta &lt;filename&gt; &lt;dest device&gt; Take a
compressed or uncompressed file created with the savemeta
option and restores its contents on top of the specified
desti- nation device. WARNING: When you use this option, the
file sys- tem and all data on the destination device is
destroyed. Since only metadata (but no data) is restored,
every file in the resulting file system is likely to be
corrupt. The ONLY purpose of this option is to examine and
debug file system problems by restoring and examining the
state of the saved metadata. If the destination file system
is the same size or larger than the source file system where
the metadata was saved, the resulting file system will be
the same size as the source. If the desti- nation device is
smaller than the source file system, gfs2_edit will restore
as much as it can, then quit, leaving you with a file system
that probably will not mount, but from which you might still
be able to figure out what is wrong with the source file
system.</p>

<p>INTERACTIVE MODE If you specify a device on the
gfs2_edit command line and you specify no options other than
-c, gfs2_edit will act as an interactive GFS2 file system
editor for the file system you specify. There are three
display modes: hex mode, structure mode and pointers mode.
You use the m key to switch between the modes, as described
below. The modes are as follows:</p>

<p>Hex mode (default) Display or edit blocks of the file
system in hexadecimal and ascii.</p>

<p>Lines at the top indicate the currently displayed block
in both hex and decimal. If the block contains a GFS2 data
structure, the name of that structure will appear in the
upper right corner of the display. If the block is a
well-known block, such as the superblock or rindex, there
will be a line to indicate what it is.</p>

<p>In hex mode, you can edit blocks by pressing
&lt;enter&gt; and enter- ing hexadecimal digits to replace
the highlighted hex digits. Do NOT precede the numbers with
&quot;0x&quot;. For example, if you want to change the value
at offset 0x60 from a 0x12 to 0xef, position your cursor to
offset 0x60, so that the 12 is highlighted, then press
&lt;enter&gt; and type in &quot;ef&quot;. Press
&lt;escape&gt; or &lt;enter&gt; to exit edit mode.</p>

<p>In hex mode, different colors indicate different things.
For example, in the default color scheme, the GFS2 data
structure will be black, data offsets will be light blue,
and actual data (anything after the gfs2 data structure)
will be red.</p>

<p>Structure mode Decode the file system block into its
GFS2 structure and display the values of that structure.
This mode is most useful for jumping around the file system.
For example, you can use the arrow keys to position down to
a pointer and press J to jump to that block.</p>

<p>Pointers mode Display any additional information
appearing on the block. For example, if an inode has block
pointers, this will display them and allow you to scroll
through them. You can also position to one of them and press
J to jump to that block.</p>

<p>Interactive mode command keys: q or &lt;esc&gt; The q or
&lt;escape&gt; keys are used to exit gfs2_edit.</p>

<p>&lt;arrow/movement keys&gt; up, down, right, left,
pg-up, pg-down, home, end The arrow keys are used to
highlight an area of the display. The J key may be used to
jump to the block that is highlighted.</p>

<p>m - Mode switch The m key is used to switch between the
three display modes. The initial mode is hex mode. Pressing
the m key once switches to structure mode. Pressing it a
second time switches from structure mode to pointers mode.
Pressing it a third time takes you back to hex mode
again.</p>

<p>j - Jump to block The j key jumps to the block number
that is currently high- lighted. In hex mode, hitting J will
work when any byte of the pointer is highlighted.</p>

<p>g - Goto block The g key asks for a block number, then
jumps there. Note that in many cases, you can also arrow up
so that the current block number is highlighted, then press
&lt;enter&gt; to enter a block num- ber to jump to.</p>

<p>h - Help display The h key causes the interactive help
display to be shown.</p>

<p>e - Extended mode The e key causes gfs2_edit to switch
to extended (&quot;pointers&quot;) mode.</p>

<p>c - Color scheme The c key causes gfs2_edit to switch to
its alternate color scheme.</p>

<p>f - Forward block The f key causes you to scroll forward
one block. This does not affect the &quot;jump&quot; status.
In other words, if you use the f key to move forward several
blocks, pressing &lt;backspace&gt; will not roll you back
up.</p>

<p>&lt;enter&gt; - Edit value The &lt;enter&gt; key causes
you to go from display mode to edit mode. If you are in hex
mode and you hit enter, you can type new hex values at the
cursor s current location. Note: pressing &lt;enter&gt; in
structure mode allows you to enter a new value, with the
fol- lowing restrictions: For gfs2 disk inodes and resource
groups, it will actually change the value on disk. However,
inode numbers may not be changed. For all other structures,
the val- ues entered are ignored.</p>

<p>If you use the up arrow key to highlight the block
number, then press &lt;enter&gt;, you may then enter a new
block number, or any of the well-known block locations
listed above (e.g. sb, rindex, inum, rg 17, etc.) and
gfs2_edit will jump to the block speci- fied. If you specify
a slash character followed by a metadata type, gfs2_edit
will search for the next occurrence of that metadata block
type, and jump there. It will take you to block 0 if it does
not find any more blocks of the specified metadata type.</p>

<p>&lt;home&gt; If you are in pointers mode, this takes you
back to the starts of the pointers you are viewing.
Otherwise it takes you back to the superblock.</p>

<p>&lt;backspace&gt; This takes you back to the block you
were displaying before a jump.</p>

<p>&lt;space&gt; This takes you forward to the block you
were displaying when you hit &lt;backspace&gt;.</p>
