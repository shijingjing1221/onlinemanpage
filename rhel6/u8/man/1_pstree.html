<p>NAME pstree - display a tree of processes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pstree [-a] [-c] [-h|-Hpid] [-l] [-n] [-p] [-u]
[-Z] [-A|-G|-U] [pid|user] pstree -V</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pstree shows running processes as a tree.
The tree is rooted at either pid or init if pid is omitted.
If a user name is specified, all process trees rooted at
processes owned by that user are shown.</p>

<p>pstree visually merges identical branches by putting
them in square brackets and prefixing them with the
repetition count, e.g.</p>

<p>init-+-getty |-getty |-getty -getty</p>

<p>becomes</p>

<p>init---4*[getty]</p>

<p>Child threads of a process are found under the parent
process and are shown with the process name in curly braces,
e.g.</p>

<p>icecast2---13*[{icecast2}]</p>

<p>If pstree is called as pstree.x11 then it will prompt
the user at the end of the line to press return and will not
return until that has hap- pened. This is useful for when
pstree is run in a xterminal.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Show command line arguments. If the command
line of a process is swapped out, that process is shown in
parentheses. -a implicitly disables compaction.</p>

<p>-A Use ASCII characters to draw the tree.</p>

<p>-c Disable compaction of identical subtrees. By default,
subtrees are compacted whenever possible.</p>

<p>-G Use VT100 line drawing characters.</p>

<p>-h Highlight the current process and its ancestors. This
is a no-op if the terminal doesnt support highlighting or if
neither the current process nor any of its ancestors are in
the subtree being shown.</p>

<p>-H Like -h, but highlight the specified process instead.
Unlike with -h, pstree fails when using -H if highlighting
is not available.</p>

<p>-l Display long lines. By default, lines are truncated
to the dis- play width or 132 if output is sent to a non-tty
or if the dis- play width is unknown.</p>

<p>-n Sort processes with the same ancestor by PID instead
of by name. (Numeric sort.)</p>

<p>-p Show PIDs. PIDs are shown as decimal numbers in
parentheses after each process name. -p implicitly disables
compaction.</p>

<p>-u Show uid transitions. Whenever the uid of a process
differs from the uid of its parent, the new uid is shown in
parentheses after the process name.</p>

<p>-U Use UTF-8 (Unicode) line drawing characters. Under
Linux 1.1-54 and above, UTF-8 mode is entered on the console
with echo -e 033%8and left with echo -033%@</p>

<p>-V Display version information.</p>

<p>-Z (SELinux) Show security context for each process.</p>

<p>FILES /proc location of the proc file system</p>

<p>BUGS Some character sets may be incompatible with the
VT100 characters.</p>
