<p>NAME htnotify - sends email notifications about
out-dated web pages discov- ered by htmerge</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS htnotify [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Htnotify scans the document database created
by htmerge and sends an email message for every page that is

manual for instructions on how to set up this service.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b database Specifies an alternative database
than what is specified in the configuration file.</p>

the default. -v Verbose mode. This increases the verbosity
of the program. Used once will display a log of what email
messages were sent. Used more than once will display
information about each document that has email notification
set.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/htdig/htdig.conf The default configuration
file.</p>
