<p>LINKAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual LINKAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME linkat - create a file link relative to directory
file descriptors</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _ATFILE_SOURCE #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
/* Definition of AT_* constants */ #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int linkat(int olddirfd, const char *oldpath, int
newdirfd, const char *newpath, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The linkat() system call operates in exactly
the same way as link(2), except for the differences
described in this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in oldpath is relative, then it is
interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor olddirfd (rather than relative to the
current working directory of the calling process, as is done
by link(2) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If oldpath is relative and olddirfd is the special value
AT_FDCWD, then oldpath is interpreted relative to the
current working directory of the calling process (like
link(2)).</p>

<p>If oldpath is absolute, then olddirfd is ignored.</p>

<p>The interpretation of newpath is as for oldpath, except
that a relative pathname is interpreted relative to the
directory referred to by the file descriptor newdirfd.</p>

<p>By default, linkat(), does not dereference oldpath if it
is a symbolic link (like link(2)). Since Linux 2.6.18, the
flag AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW can be specified in flags to cause
oldpath to be dereferenced if it is a symbolic link. Before
kernel 2.6.18, the flags argument was unused, and had to be
specified as 0.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, linkat() returns 0. On error,
-1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for link(2) can also
occur for linkat(). The following additional errors can
occur for linkat():</p>

<p>EBADF olddirfd or newdirfd is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR oldpath is relative and olddirfd is a file
descriptor referring to a file other than a directory; or
similar for newpath and newdirfd</p>

<p>VERSIONS linkat() was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2008.</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
linkat().</p>
