<p>MBTOWC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MBTOWC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mbtowc - convert a character to a wide-character
code</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mbtowc(wchar_t *restrict pwc, const char *restrict
s, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If s is not a null pointer, mbtowc() shall
determine the number of bytes that constitute the character
pointed to by s. It shall then determine the wide-character
code for the value of type wchar_t that corresponds to that
character. (The value of the wide-character code
corresponding to the null byte is 0.) If the character is
valid and pwc is not a null pointer, mbtowc() shall store
the wide-character code in the object pointed to by pwc.</p>

<p>The behavior of this function is affected by the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale. For a
state-dependent encoding, this function is placed into its
initial state by a call for which its character pointer
argument, s, is a null pointer. Subsequent calls with s as
other than a null pointer shall cause the internal state of
the function to be altered as necessary. A call with s as a
null pointer shall cause this function to return a non-zero
value if encodings have state dependency, and 0 otherwise.
If the implementation employs special bytes to change the
shift state, these bytes shall not produce separate
wide-character codes, but shall be grouped with an adjacent
character. Changing the LC_CTYPE category causes the shift
state of this function to be unspec- ified. At most n bytes
of the array pointed to by s shall be examined.</p>

<p>The implementation shall behave as if no function
defined in this vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 calls
mbtowc().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If s is a null pointer, mbtowc() shall
return a non-zero or 0 value, if character encodings,
respectively, do or do not have state-dependent encodings.
If s is not a null pointer, mbtowc() shall either return 0
(if s points to the null byte), or return the number of
bytes that con- stitute the converted character (if the next
n or fewer bytes form a valid character), or return -1 and
may set errno to indicate the error (if they do not form a
valid character).</p>

<p>In no case shall the value returned be greater than n or
the value of the {MB_CUR_MAX} macro.</p>

<p>ERRORS The mbtowc() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EILSEQ Invalid character sequence is detected.</p>
