<p>LINK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual LINK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME link - link to a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int link(const char *path1, const char *path2);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The link() function shall create a new link
(directory entry) for the existing file, path1.</p>

<p>The path1 argument points to a pathname naming an
existing file. The path2 argument points to a pathname
naming the new directory entry to be created. The link()
function shall atomically create a new link for the existing
file and the link count of the file shall be incremented by
one.</p>

<p>If path1 names a directory, link() shall fail unless the
process has appropriate privileges and the implementation
supports using link() on directories.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, link() shall mark for update
the st_ctime field of the file. Also, the st_ctime and
st_mtime fields of the direc- tory that contains the new
entry shall be marked for update.</p>

<p>If link() fails, no link shall be created and the link
count of the file shall remain unchanged.</p>

<p>The implementation may require that the calling process
has permission to access the existing file.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The link() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES A component of either path prefix denies search
permission, or the requested link requires writing in a
directory that denies write permission, or the calling
process does not have permis- sion to access the existing
file and this is required by the implementation.</p>

<p>EEXIST The path2 argument resolves to an existing file
or refers to a symbolic link.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path1 or path2 argument.</p>

<p>EMLINK The number of links to the file named by path1
would exceed {LINK_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path1 or path2 argument
exceeds {PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of either path prefix does not exist;
the file named by path1 does not exist; or path1 or path2
points to an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The directory to contain the link cannot be
extended.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of either path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The file named by path1 is a directory and either
the calling process does not have appropriate privileges or
the implementa- tion prohibits using link() on
directories.</p>

<p>EROFS The requested link requires writing in a directory
on a read- only file system.</p>

<p>EXDEV The link named by path2 and the file named by
path1 are on dif- ferent file systems and the implementation
does not support links between file systems.</p>

<p>EXDEV path1 refers to a named STREAM.</p>

<p>The link() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path1 or path2
argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG As a result of encountering a symbolic link
in resolution of the path1 or path2 argument, the length of
the substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Creating a Link to a File The following example
shows how to create a link to a file named /home/cnd/mod1 by
creating a new directory entry named /modules/pass1.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *path1 = &quot;/home/cnd/mod1&quot;; char *path2 =
&quot;/modules/pass1&quot;; int status; ... status = link
(path1, path2);</p>

<p>Creating a Link to a File Within a Program In the
following program example, the link() function links the
/etc/passwd file (defined as PASSWDFILE) to a file named
/etc/opasswd (defined as SAVEFILE), which is used to save
the current password file. Then, after removing the current
password file (defined as PASSWDFILE), the new password file
is saved as the current password file using the link()
function again.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>#define LOCKFILE &quot;/etc/ptmp&quot; #define
PASSWDFILE &quot;/etc/passwd&quot; #define SAVEFILE
&quot;/etc/opasswd&quot; ... /* Save current password file
*/ link (PASSWDFILE, SAVEFILE);</p>

<p>/* Remove current password file. */ unlink
(PASSWDFILE);</p>

<p>/* Save new password file as current password file. */
link (LOCKFILE,PASSWDFILE);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Some implementations do allow links
between file systems.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Linking to a directory is restricted to the
superuser in most histori- cal implementations because this
capability may produce loops in the file hierarchy or
otherwise corrupt the file system. This volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 continues that philosophy by prohibiting link()
and unlink() from doing this. Other functions could do it if
the imple- mentor designed such an extension.</p>

<p>Some historical implementations allow linking of files
on different file systems. Wording was added to explicitly
allow this optional behavior.</p>

<p>The exception for cross-file system links is intended to
apply only to links that are programmatically
indistinguishable from &quot;hard&quot; links.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
