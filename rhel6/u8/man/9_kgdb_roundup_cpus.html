<p>NAME kgdb_roundup_cpus - Get other CPUs into a holding
pattern</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void kgdb_roundup_cpus(unsigned long
flags);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS flags Current IRQ state</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION On SMP systems, we need to get the attention
of the other CPUs and get them be in a known state. This
should do what is needed to get the other CPUs to call
kgdb_wait. Note that on some arches, the NMI approach is not
used for rounding up all the CPUs. For example, in case of
MIPS, smp_call_function is used to roundup CPUs. In this
case, we have to make sure that interrupts are enabled
before calling smp_call_function. The argument to this
function is the flags that will be used when restoring the
interrupts. There is local_irq_save call before
kgdb_roundup_cpus.</p>

<p>On non-SMP systems, this is not called.</p>
