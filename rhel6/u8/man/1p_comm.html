<p>COMM(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual COMM(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME comm - select or reject lines common to two
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS comm [-123] file1 file2</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The comm utility shall read file1 and file2,
which should be ordered in the current collating sequence,
and produce three text columns as out- put: lines only in
file1, lines only in file2, and lines in both files.</p>

<p>If the lines in both files are not ordered according to
the collating sequence of the current locale, the results
are unspecified.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The comm utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-1 Suppress the output column of lines unique to
file1.</p>

<p>-2 Suppress the output column of lines unique to
file2.</p>

<p>-3 Suppress the output column of lines duplicated in
file1 and file2.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>file1 A pathname of the first file to be compared. If
file1 is , the standard input shall be used.</p>

<p>file2 A pathname of the second file to be compared. If
file2 is, the standard input shall be used.</p>

<p>If both file1 and file2 refer to standard input or to
the same FIFO special, block special, or character special
file, the results are undefined.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if one of
the file1 or file2 operands refers to standard input. See
the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be text files.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of comm:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for the collating sequence comm
expects to have been used when the input files were
sorted.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The comm utility shall produce output depending
on the options selected. If the -1, -2, and -3 options are
all selected, comm shall write nothing to standard
output.</p>

<p>If the -1 option is not selected, lines contained only
in file1 shall be written using the format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;line in file1&gt;</p>

<p>If the -2 option is not selected, lines contained only
in file2 are written using the format:</p>

<p>&quot;%s%n&quot;, &lt;lead&gt;, &lt;line in
file2&gt;</p>

<p>where the string &lt;lead&gt; is as follows:</p>

<p>&lt;tab&gt; The -1 option is not selected.</p>

<p>null string The -1 option is selected.</p>

<p>If the -3 option is not selected, lines contained in
both files shall be written using the format:</p>

<p>&quot;%s%n&quot;, &lt;lead&gt;, &lt;line in both&gt;</p>

<p>where the string &lt;lead&gt; is as follows:</p>

<p>&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt; Neither the -1 nor the -2 option
is selected.</p>

<p>&lt;tab&gt; Exactly one of the -1 and -2 options is
selected.</p>

<p>null string Both the -1 and -2 options are selected.</p>

<p>If the input files were ordered according to the
collating sequence of the current locale, the lines written
shall be in the collating sequence of the original
lines.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All input files were successfully output as
specified.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If the input files are not properly
presorted, the output of comm might not be useful.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES If a file named xcu contains a sorted list of
the utilities in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, a file
named xpg3 contains a sorted list of the utilities specified
in the X/Open Portability Guide, Issue 3, and a file named
svid89 contains a sorted list of the utilities in the System
V Interface Definition Third Edition:</p>

<p>comm -23 xcu xpg3 | comm -23 - svid89</p>

<p>would print a list of utilities in this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 not specified by either of the other
documents:</p>

<p>comm -12 xcu xpg3 | comm -12 - svid89</p>

<p>would print a list of utilities specified by all three
documents, and:</p>

<p>comm -12 xpg3 svid89 | comm -23 - xcu</p>

<p>would print a list of utilities specified by both XPG3
and the SVID, but not specified in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
