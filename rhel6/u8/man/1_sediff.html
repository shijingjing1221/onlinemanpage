<p>NAME sediff - SELinux policy difference tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sediff [OPTIONS] [EXPRESSION] ORIGINAL_POLICY ;
MODIFIED_POLICY</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sediff allows the user to inspect the
semantic differences between two SELinux policies.</p>

<p>POLICY sediff supports loading SELinux policies in one
of four formats.</p>

<p>source A single text file containing policy source for
versions 12 through 21. This file is usually named
policy.conf.</p>

<p>binary A single file containing a monolithic kernel
binary policy for versions 15 through 21. This file is
usually named by version - for example, policy.20.</p>

<p>modular A list of policy packages each containing a
loadable policy mod- ule. The first module listed must be a
base module.</p>

<p>policy list A single text file containing all the
information needed to load a policy, usually exported by
SETools graphical utilities.</p>

<p>Policies do not need to be the same format. If not
provided sediff will print an error message and exit.</p>

<p>EXPRESSIONS The user may specify an expression listing
the policy elements to dif- ferentiate. If not provided, all
supported policy elements sans never- allows are
examined.</p>

<p>-c, --class Find differences in permissions assigned to
object classes and common permission sets.</p>

<p>--level Find differences in categories authorized for
MLS levels.</p>

<p>--category Find differences in category definitions.</p>

<p>-t, --type Find differences in attributes associated
with types.</p>

<p>-a, --attribute Find differences in types assigned to
attributes.</p>

<p>-r, --role Find differences in types authorized for
roles.</p>

<p>-u, --user Find differences in roles authorized for
users.</p>

<p>-b, --bool Find differences in the default values of
booleans.</p>

<p>-A, --allow Find differences in allow rules.</p>

<p>--auditallow Find differences in auditallow rules.</p>

<p>--dontaudit Find differences in dontaudit rules.</p>

<p>--neverallow Find differences in neverallow rules.</p>

<p>--type_trans Find differences in type_transition
rules.</p>

<p>--type_member Find differences in type_member rules.</p>

<p>--type_change Find differences in type_change rules.</p>

<p>--role_trans Find differences in role_transition rules.
This includes dif- ferences in the default role.</p>

<p>--role_allow Find differences in role allow rules.</p>

<p>--range_trans Find differences in range_transition
rules. This includes dif- ferences in the target MLS
range.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -q, --quiet If there are no differences for
elements of a given kind, sup- press status output for that
kind of element.</p>

<p>--stats Print difference statistics only.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print help information and exit.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>DIFFERENCES sediff categorizes differences in policy
elements into one of three forms.</p>

<p>added The element exists only in the modified
policy.</p>

<p>removed The element exists only in the original
policy.</p>

<p>modified The element exists in both policies but its
semantic meaning has changed. For example, a class is
modified if one or more permissions are added or
removed.</p>

<p>For all rules with types as their source or target, two
additional forms of difference are recognized. This helps
distinguish differences due to new types from differences in
rules for existing types.</p>

<p>added, new type The rule exists only in the modified
policy; furthermore, one or more of the types in the rule do
not exist in the original policy.</p>

<p>removed, missing type The rule exists only in the
original policy; furthermore, one or more of the types in
the rule do not exist in the modified policy.</p>

<p>NOTE Most shells interpret the semicolon as a
metacharacter, thus requiring a backslash like so: sediff
original.policy ; modified.policy</p>
