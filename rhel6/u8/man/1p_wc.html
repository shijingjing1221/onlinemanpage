<p>WC(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WC(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wc - word, line, and byte or character count</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS wc [-c|-m][-lw][file...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wc utility shall read one or more input
files and, by default, write the number of &lt;newline&gt;s,
words, and bytes contained in each input file to the
standard output.</p>

<p>The utility also shall write a total count for all named
files, if more than one input file is specified.</p>

<p>The wc utility shall consider a word to be a
non-zero-length string of characters delimited by white
space.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The wc utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-c Write to the standard output the number of bytes in
each input file.</p>

<p>-l Write to the standard output the number of
&lt;newline&gt;s in each input file.</p>

<p>-m Write to the standard output the number of characters
in each input file.</p>

<p>-w Write to the standard output the number of words in
each input file.</p>

<p>When any option is specified, wc shall report only the
information requested by the specified options.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of an input file. If no file operands
are specified, the standard input shall be used.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied. See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files may be of any type.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of wc:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files) and which characters are defined as white
space characters.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT By default, the standard output shall contain an
entry for each input file of the form:</p>

<p>&quot;%d %d %d %n&quot;, &lt;newlines&gt;,
&lt;words&gt;, &lt;bytes&gt;, &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>If the -m option is specified, the number of characters
shall replace the &lt;bytes&gt; field in this format.</p>

<p>If any options are specified and the -l option is not
specified, the number of &lt;newline&gt;s shall not be
written.</p>

<p>If any options are specified and the -w option is not
specified, the number of words shall not be written.</p>

<p>If any options are specified and neither -c nor -m is
specified, the number of bytes or characters shall not be
written.</p>

<p>If no input file operands are specified, no name shall
be written and no &lt;blank&gt;s preceding the pathname
shall be written.</p>

<p>If more than one input file operand is specified, an
additional line shall be written, of the same format as the
other lines, except that the word total (in the POSIX
locale) shall be written instead of a pathname and the total
of each column shall be written as appropriate. Such an
additional line, if any, is written at the end of the
output.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The -m option is not a switch, but an
option at the same level as -c. Thus, to produce the full
default output with character counts instead of bytes, the
command required is:</p>

<p>wc -mlw</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The output file format pseudo- printf() string
differs from the System V version of wc:</p>

<p>&quot;%7d%7d%7d %n&quot;</p>

<p>which produces possibly ambiguous and unparsable results
for very large files, as it assumes no number shall exceed
six digits.</p>

<p>Some historical implementations use only &lt;space&gt;,
&lt;tab&gt;, and &lt;newline&gt; as word separators. The
equivalent of the ISO C standard isspace() function is more
appropriate.</p>

<p>The -c option stands for &quot;character&quot; count,
even though it counts bytes. This stems from the sometimes
erroneous historical view that bytes and characters are the
same size. Due to international require- ments, the -m
option (reminiscent of &quot;multi-byte&quot;) was added to
obtain actual character counts.</p>

<p>Early proposals only specified the results when input
files were text files. The current specification more
closely matches historical prac- tice. (Bytes, words, and
&lt;newline&gt;s are counted separately and the results are
written when an end-of-file is detected.)</p>

<p>Historical implementations of the wc utility only
accepted one argument to specify the options -c, -l, and -w.
Some of them also had multiple occurrences of an option
cause the corresponding count to be written multiple times
and had the order of specification of the options affect the
order of the fields on output, but did not document either
of these. Because common usage either specifies no options
or only one option, and because none of this was documented,
the changes required by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
should not break many historical applications (and do not
break any historical conforming applications).</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
