<p>NAME pamsumm - Summarize the samples in a Netpbm image
arithmetically</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamsumm { -sum | -mean | -min | -max }
[-normalize] [-brief] [image- file]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one. You may
separate an option name and its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamsumm reads a Netpbm image (PNM or PAM) and performs a
summary func- tion over all the samples in all the rows,
columns, and planes and prints the result to Standard
Output.</p>

<p>pamsumm performs the operation on the actual sample
values, not on the light intensities represented by them in
the case that the image is a PGM or PPM image or PAM
equivalent. If you want to do arithmetic on light
intensities of such a visual image, you can use pnmgamma to
con- vert it to one with samples proportional to light
intensity, and then use pamsumm on the result.</p>

<p>If you want to summarize by column (e.g. add up the
columns sepa- rately), use pamsummcol. If you want to
summarize by row, use a combi- nation of pamsummcol and
pamflip. If you want to summarize a particu- lar plane, use
pamchannel to extract it and then pamsumm.</p>

<p>OPTIONS You must specify exactly one of -sum, -mean,
-min, or -max.</p>

<p>-sum</p>

<p>This option makes the summary function addition.</p>

<p>-mean</p>

<p>This option makes the summary function arithmetic
mean.</p>

<p>-min</p>

<p>This option makes the summary function arithmetic
minimum.</p>

<p>-max</p>

<p>This option makes the summary function arithmetic
maximum.</p>

<p>-normalize</p>

<p>This option causes each sample to be normalized to a
fraction (in the range 0..1) so the result is independent of
the images maxval. E.g. if you request the mean of an image
which has maxval 200 and all the samples have value 50,
pamsumm will give you 50 as an answer. But pamsumm
-normalize will give you .25.</p>

<p>If instead you want a result that is independent of
maxval but still in integers, you can use pamdepth to
convert the input to some standard maxval and not use
-normalize. For example, if you want the mean intensity of a
PPM image, on a scale of 0 to 99, do</p>

<p>pamdepth 99 myimage.ppm | pamsumm -mean</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004)</p>

<p>-brief</p>

<p>This option causes pamsumm to display the answer as a
bare number, rather than in a complete sentence.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004)</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pamsumm(1), pam(1),</p>

<p>HISTORY pamsumm was added to Netpbm in Release 10.21
(March 2004).</p>
