<p>WCSCAT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCSCAT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcscat - concatenate two wide-character strings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wchar_t *wcscat(wchar_t *restrict ws1, const wchar_t
*restrict ws2);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcscat() function shall append a copy of
the wide-character string pointed to by ws2 (including the
terminating null wide-character code) to the end of the
wide-character string pointed to by ws1. The initial
wide-character code of ws2 shall overwrite the null
wide-character code at the end of ws1. If copying takes
place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wcscat() function shall return ws1; no
return value is reserved to indicate an error.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
