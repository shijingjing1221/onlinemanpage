<p>UUIDGEN(1) UUIDGEN(1)</p>

<p>NAME uuidgen - command-line utility to create a new UUID
value</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS uuidgen [-r|-t]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The uuidgen program creates (and prints) a
new universally unique iden- tifier (UUID) using the
libuuid(3) library. The new UUID can reason- ably be
considered unique among all UUIDs created on the local
system, and among UUIDs created on other systems in the past
and in the future.</p>

<p>There are two types of UUID s which uuidgen can
generate: time-based UUID s and random-based UUIDs. By
default uuidgen will generate a random-based UUID if a
high-quality random number generator is present. Otherwise,
it will chose a time-based UUID. It is possible to force the
generation of one of these two UUID types by using the -r or
-t options.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -r Generate a random-based UUID. This method
creates a UUID con- sisting mostly of random bits. It
requires that the operating system have a high quality
random number generator, such as /dev/random.</p>

<p>-t Generate a time-based UUID. This method creates a
UUID based on the system clock plus the systems ethernet
hardware address, if present.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO OSF DCE 1.1</p>

<p>AUTHOR uuidgen was written by Andreas Dilger for

util-linux-ng package and is avail- able from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
