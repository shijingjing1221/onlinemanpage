<p>NAME system-config-printer-applet - print job
manager</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS system-config-printer-applet
[--no-tray-icon]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION system-config-printer-applet is a print job
manager for CUPS. Normally it will display a printer icon in
the notification area, greyed out when there are no print
jobs for the current user. Clicking on the icon displays a
simple print job manager for cancelling or reprinting
jobs.</p>

<p>To save memory, the applet waits first of all until the
user has printed a job before putting the icon in the
notification area. To invoke the print job manager before a
job has been printed, run the applet with the --no-tray-icon
option: a desktop file is provided for this, so that it
should appear in the system menu.</p>

<p>As well as displaying a printer icon in the notification
area, the applet also provides a D-BUS server for the
com.redhat.PrintDriverSelection interface, to help configure
a new printer when it is plugged in.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display a short usage message.</p>

<p>--version Display the version of the applet.</p>

<p>--no-tray-icon Do not display an icon in the
notification area. Quit when the job manager window is
closed.</p>
