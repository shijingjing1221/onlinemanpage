<p>NAME svnlook - Subversion repository examination
tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS svnlook command /path/to/repos [options]
[args]</p>

<p>OVERVIEW Subversion is a version control system, which
allows you to keep old versions of files and directories
(usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why
changes occurred, etc., like CVS, RCS or SCCS. Sub- version
keeps a single copy of the master sources. This copy is
called the source repository; it contains all the
information to permit extracting previous versions of those
files at any time.</p>

<p>For more information about the Subversion project, visit
http://subver- sion.tigris.org.</p>

<p>Documentation for Subversion and its tools, including
detailed usage explanations of the svn, svnadmin, svnserve
and svnlook programs, his- torical background, philosophical
approaches and reasonings, etc., can be found at
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/.</p>
