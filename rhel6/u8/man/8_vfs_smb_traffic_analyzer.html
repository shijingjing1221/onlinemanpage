<p>NAME vfs_smb_traffic_analyzer - log Samba VFS read and
write operations through a socket to a helper
application</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = smb_traffic_analyzer</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The vfs_smb_traffic_analyzer VFS module logs client file
operations on a Samba server and sends this data over a
socket to a helper program (in the following the
&quot;Receiver&quot;), which feeds a SQL database. More
information on the helper programs can be obtained from the
homepage of the project at:
http://holger123.wordpress.com/smb-traffic-analyzer/ Since
the VFS module depends on a receiver that is doing something
with the data, it is evolving in it&rsquo;s development.
Therefore, the module works with different protocol
versions, and the receiver has to be able to decode the
protocol that is used. The protocol version 1 was introduced
to Samba at September 25, 2008. It was a very simple
protocol, supporting only a small list of VFS operations,
and had several drawbacks. The protocol version 2 is a try
to solve the problems version 1 had while at the same time
adding new features. With the release of Samba 3.6.0, the
module will run protocol version 2 by default.</p>

<p>PROTOCOL VERSION 1 DOCUMENTATION
vfs_smb_traffic_analyzer protocol version 1 is aware of the
following VFS operations: write pwrite read pread</p>

<p>vfs_smb_traffic_analyzer sends the following data in a
fixed format separated by a comma through either an internet
or a unix domain socket:</p>


<p>BYTES|USER|DOMAIN|READ/WRITE|SHARE|FILENAME|TIMESTAMP</p>

<p>Description of the records:</p>

<p>&middot; BYTES - the length in bytes of the VFS
operation</p>

<p>&middot; USER - the user who initiated the operation</p>

<p>&middot; DOMAIN - the domain of the user</p>

<p>&middot; READ/WRITE - either &quot;W&quot; for a write
operation or &quot;R&quot; for read</p>

<p>&middot; SHARE - the name of the share on which the VFS
operation occurred</p>

<p>&middot; FILENAME - the name of the file that was used
by the VFS operation</p>

<p>&middot; TIMESTAMP - a timestamp, formatted as
&quot;yyyy-mm-dd hh-mm-ss.ms&quot; indicating when the VFS
operation occurred</p>

<p>&middot; IP - The IP Address (v4 or v6) of the client
machine that initiated the VFS operation.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>DRAWBACKS OF PROTOCOL VERSION 1 Several drawbacks have
been seen with protocol version 1 over time.</p>

<p>&middot; Problematic parsing - Protocol version 1 uses
hyphen and comma to seperate blocks of data. Once there is a
filename with a hyphen, you will run into problems because
the receiver decodes the data in a wrong way.</p>

<p>&middot; Insecure network transfer - Protocol version 1
sends all it&rsquo;s data as plaintext over the network.</p>

<p>&middot; Limited set of supported VFS operations -
Protocol version 1 supports only four VFS operations.</p>

<p>&middot; No subreleases of the protocol - Protocol
version 1 is fixed on it&rsquo;s version, making it unable
to introduce new features or bugfixes through compatible
sub-releases.</p>

<p>VERSION 2 OF THE PROTOCOL Protocol version 2 is an
approach to solve the problems introduced with protcol v1.
From the users perspective, the following changes are most
prominent among other enhancements:</p>

<p>&middot; The data from the module may be send encrypted,
with a key stored in secrets.tdb. The Receiver then has to
use the same key. The module does AES block encryption over
the data to send.</p>

<p>&middot; The module now can identify itself against the
receiver with a sub-release number, where the receiver may
run with a different sub-release number than the module.
However, as long as both run on the V2.x protocol, the
receiver will not crash, even if the module uses features
only implemented in the newer subrelease. If the module uses
a new feature from a newer subrelease, and the receiver runs
an older protocol, it is just ignoring the functionality. Of
course it is best to have both the receiver and the module
running the same subrelease of the protocol.</p>

<p>&middot; The parsing problems of protocol V1 can no
longer happen, because V2 is marshalling the data packages
in a proper way.</p>

<p>&middot; The module now potientially has the ability to
create data on every VFS function. As of protocol V2.0,
there is support for 8 VFS functions, namely
write,read,pread,pwrite, rename,chdir,mkdir and rmdir.
Supporting more VFS functions is one of the targets for the
upcoming sub-releases.</p>

<p>To enable protocol V2, the protocol_version vfs option
has to be used (see OPTIONS).</p>

<p>OPTIONS WITH PROTOCOL V1 AND V2.X
smb_traffic_analyzer:mode = STRING If STRING matches to
&quot;unix_domain_socket&quot;, the module will use a unix
domain socket located at /var/tmp/stadsocket, if STRING
contains an different string or is not defined, the module
will use an internet domain socket for data transfer.</p>

<p>smb_traffic_analyzer:host = STRING The module will send
the data to the system named with the hostname STRING.</p>

<p>smb_traffic_analyzer:port = STRING The module will send
the data using the TCP port given in STRING.</p>

<p>smb_traffic_analyzer:anonymize_prefix = STRING The
module will replace the user names with a prefix given by
STRING and a simple hash number. In version 2.x of the
protocol, the users SID will also be anonymized.</p>

<p>smb_traffic_analyzer:total_anonymization = STRING If
STRING matches to &rsquo;yes&rsquo;, the module will replace
any user name with the string given by the option
smb_traffic_analyzer:anonymize_prefix, without generating an
additional hash number. This means that any transfer data
will be mapped to a single user, leading to a total
anonymization of user related data. In version 2.x of the
protocol, the users SID will also be anonymized.</p>

<p>smb_traffic_analyzer:protocol_version = STRING If STRING
matches to V1, the module will use version 1 of the
protocol. If STRING is not given, the module will use
version 2 of the protocol, which is the default.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Running protocol V2 on share
&quot;example_share&quot;, using an internet socket.</p>

<p>[example_share] path = /data/example vfs_objects =
smb_traffic_analyzer smb_traffic_analyzer:host = examplehost
smb_traffic_analyzer:port = 3491</p>

<p>The module running on share &quot;example_share&quot;,

<p>[example_share] path = /data/example vfs objects =
smb_traffic_analyzer smb_traffic_analyzer:mode =
unix_domain_socket</p>

<p>The module running on share &quot;example_share&quot;,

&quot;examplehost&quot; on port 3491.</p>

<p>[example_share] path = /data/example vfs objects =
smb_traffic_analyzer smb_traffic_analyzer:host = examplehost
smb_traffic_analyzer:port = 3491</p>

<p>The module running on share &quot;example_share&quot;,

&quot;examplehost&quot; on port 3491, anonymizing user names
with the prefix &quot;User&quot;.</p>

<p>[example_share] path = /data/example vfs objects =

smb_traffic_analyzer:port = 3491

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.3 of the
Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The original version of the VFS module and the helper
tools were created by Holger Hetterich.</p>
