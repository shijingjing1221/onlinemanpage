<p>EXEC(3) Linux Programmer s Manual EXEC(3)</p>

<p>NAME execl, execlp, execle, execv, execvp - execute a
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>extern char **environ;</p>

<p>int execl(const char *path, const char *arg, ...); int
execlp(const char *file, const char *arg, ...); int
execle(const char *path, const char *arg, ..., char * const
envp[]); int execv(const char *path, char *const argv[]);
int execvp(const char *file, char *const argv[]);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The exec() family of functions replaces the
current process image with a new process image. The
functions described in this manual page are front-ends for
execve(2). (See the manual page for execve(2) for fur- ther
details about the replacement of the current process
image.)</p>

<p>The initial argument for these functions is the pathname
of a file which is to be executed.</p>

<p>The const char *arg and subsequent ellipses in the
execl(), execlp(), and execle() functions can be thought of
as arg0, arg1, ..., argn. Together they describe a list of
one or more pointers to null-termi- nated strings that
represent the argument list available to the exe- cuted
program. The first argument, by convention, should point to
the filename associated with the file being executed. The
list of argu- ments must be terminated by a NULL pointer,
and, since these are vari- adic functions, this pointer must
be cast (char *) NULL.</p>

<p>The execv() and execvp() functions provide an array of
pointers to null-terminated strings that represent the
argument list available to the new program. The first
argument, by convention, should point to the filename
associated with the file being executed. The array of
pointers must be terminated by a NULL pointer.</p>

<p>The execle() function also specifies the environment of
the executed process by following the NULL pointer that
terminates the list of argu- ments in the argument list or
the pointer to the argv array with an additional argument.
This additional argument is an array of pointers to
null-terminated strings and must be terminated by a NULL
pointer. The other functions take the environment for the
new process image from the external variable environ in the
current process.</p>

<p>Special semantics for execlp() and execvp() The
functions execlp() and execvp() will duplicate the actions
of the shell in searching for an executable file if the
specified filename does not contain a slash (/) character.
The search path is the path specified in the environment by
the PATH variable. If this variable isnt specified, the
default path &quot;:/bin:/usr/bin&quot; is used. In addi-
tion, certain errors are treated specially.</p>

<p>If permission is denied for a file (the attempted
execve(2) failed with the error EACCES), these functions
will continue searching the rest of the search path. If no
other file is found, however, they will return with errno
set to EACCES.</p>

<p>If the header of a file isn t recognized (the attempted
execve(2) failed with the error ENOEXEC), these functions
will execute the shell (/bin/sh) with the path of the file
as its first argument. (If this attempt fails, no further
searching is done.)</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If any of the exec() functions returns, an
error will have occurred. The return value is -1, and errno
will be set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS All of these functions may fail and set errno for
any of the errors specified for the library function
execve(2).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES On some other systems the default path (used when
the environment does not contain the variable PATH) has the
current working directory listed after /bin and /usr/bin, as
an anti-Trojan-horse measure. Linux uses here the
traditional &quot;current directory first&quot; default
path.</p>

<p>The behavior of execlp() and execvp() when errors occur
while attempt- ing to execute the file is historic practice,
but has not traditionally been documented and is not
specified by the POSIX standard. BSD (and possibly other
systems) do an automatic sleep and retry if ETXTBSY is
encountered. Linux treats it as a hard error and returns
immediately.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the functions execlp() and execvp()
ignored all errors except for the ones described above and
ENOMEM and E2BIG, upon which they returned. They now return
if any error other than the ones described above occurs.</p>
