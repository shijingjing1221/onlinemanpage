<p>NAME ctie - merge or apply CWEB change files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ctie -c|-m outputfile masterfile
changefile...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The CTIE program is used to process multiple
change files used with the CWEB system for literate
programming. The CWEB programs allow one to apply patches to
a source file (the masterfile) by means of a single change
file. CTIE can be used to either merge up to 32 change files
into a single one or to apply the changes to the masterfile
in order to create a new master file. Output of either the
new change file or the patched master file goes into
outputfile. Any include files (indicated using the CWEB @i
command) are fully expanded during CTIE processing, which
means that the change files are able to modify the contents
of any included files. Also, if this program has been
compiled using the kpathsea library, then files are searched
for using the CWEBINPUTS environment variable, as described
in the kpathsea documentation.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Create a single change file from the given
changefiles.</p>

<p>-m Create a new master file by applying the given
changefiles.</p>

program was by Klaus Guntermann, TH Darmstadt, Institut f.
Theoretische Informatik. The TIE man page was by Joachim
Schnitter, TH Darmstadt, Phys. Chemie I, and was modified
for CTIE by Julian Gilbey.</p>
