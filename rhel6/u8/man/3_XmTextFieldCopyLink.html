<p>NAME XmTextFieldCopyLink A TextField function that
copies a link to the primary selection to the clipboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/TextF.h&gt; Boolean
XmTextFieldCopyLink( Widget widget, Time time);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmTextFieldCopyLink copies a link to the
primary selected text to the clipboard. This routine calls
the XmNconvertCallback procedures, pos- sibly multiple
times, with the selection member of the XmConvertCall-
backStruct set to CLIPBOARD and with the parm member set to
XmLINK. The TextField widget itself does not copy any links;
XmNconvertCallback procedures are responsible for copying
the link to the clipboard and for taking any related
actions.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the TextField widget ID.</p>

<p>time Specifies the time of the transfer. This should be
the time of the event which triggered this request. One
source of a valid time stamp is the function
XtLastTimestampProcessed.</p>

<p>For a complete definition of TextField and its
associated resources, see XmTextField(3).</p>

<p>RETURN This function returns False if the primary
selection is NULL, if the widget does not own the primary
selection, if the function is unable to gain ownership of
the clipboard selection, or if no data is placed on the
clipboard. Otherwise, it returns True.</p>
