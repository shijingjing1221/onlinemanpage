<p>XButtonEvent(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XButtonEvent(3)</p>

<p>NAME XButtonEvent, XKeyEvent, XMotionEvent - KeyPress,
KeyRelease, Button- Press, ButtonRelease, and MotionNotify
event structures</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structures for KeyPress, KeyRelease,
ButtonPress, ButtonRelease, and MotionNotify events
contain:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* ButtonPress or
ButtonRelease */ unsigned long serial; /* # of last request
processed by server */ Bool send_event; /* true if this came
from a SendEvent request */ Display *display; /* Display the
event was read from */ Window window; /* event window it is
reported relative to */ Window root; /* root window that the
event occurred on */ Window subwindow; /* child window */
Time time; /* milliseconds */ int x, y; /* pointer x, y
coordinates in event window */ int x_root, y_root; /*
coordinates relative to root */ unsigned int state; /* key
or button mask */ unsigned int button; /* detail */ Bool
same_screen; /* same screen flag */ } XButtonEvent; typedef
XButtonEvent XButtonPressedEvent; typedef XButtonEvent
XButtonReleasedEvent;</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* KeyPress or KeyRelease */
unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a
SendEvent request */ Display *display; /* Display the event
was read from */ Window window; /* event window it is
reported relative to */ Window root; /* root window that the
event occurred on */ Window subwindow; /* child window */
Time time; /* milliseconds */ int x, y; /* pointer x, y
coordinates in event window */ int x_root, y_root; /*
coordinates relative to root */ unsigned int state; /* key
or button mask */ unsigned int keycode; /* detail */ Bool
same_screen; /* same screen flag */ } XKeyEvent; typedef
XKeyEvent XKeyPressedEvent; typedef XKeyEvent
XKeyReleasedEvent;</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* MotionNotify */ unsigned
long serial; /* # of last request processed by server */
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ Display *display; /* Display the event was read
from */ Window window; /* event window reported relative to
*/ Window root; /* root window that the event occurred on */
Window subwindow; /* child window */ Time time; /*
milliseconds */ int x, y; /* pointer x, y coordinates in
event window */ int x_root, y_root; /* coordinates relative
to root */ unsigned int state; /* key or button mask */ char
is_hint; /* detail */ Bool same_screen; /* same screen flag
*/ } XMotionEvent; typedef XMotionEvent
XPointerMovedEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive these events, their structure members
are set as follows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>These structures have the following common members:
window, root, sub- window, time, x, y, x_root, y_root,
state, and same_screen. The window member is set to the
window on which the event was generated and is referred to
as the event window. As long as the conditions previously
discussed are met, this is the window used by the X server
to report the event. The root member is set to the source
windows root window. The x_root and y_root members are set
to the pointer s coordinates rel- ative to the root windows
origin at the time of the event.</p>

<p>The same_screen member is set to indicate whether the
event window is on the same screen as the root window and
can be either True or False. If True, the event and root
windows are on the same screen. If False, the event and root
windows are not on the same screen.</p>

<p>If the source window is an inferior of the event window,
the subwindow member of the structure is set to the child of
the event window that is the source window or the child of
the event window that is an ancestor of the source window.
Otherwise, the X server sets the subwindow mem- ber to None.
The time member is set to the time when the event was
generated and is expressed in milliseconds.</p>

<p>If the event window is on the same screen as the root
window, the x and y members are set to the coordinates
relative to the event windows origin. Otherwise, these
members are set to zero.</p>

<p>The state member is set to indicate the logical state of
the pointer buttons and modifier keys just prior to the
event, which is the bitwise inclusive OR of one or more of
the button or modifier key masks: But- ton1Mask,
Button2Mask, Button3Mask, Button4Mask, Button5Mask, Shift-
Mask, LockMask, ControlMask, Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask,
Mod4Mask, and Mod5Mask.</p>

<p>Each of these structures also has a member that
indicates the detail. For the XKeyPressedEvent and
XKeyReleasedEvent structures, this member is called a
keycode. It is set to a number that represents a physical
key on the keyboard. The keycode is an arbitrary
representation for any key on the keyboard (see sections
12.7 and 16.1).</p>

<p>For the XButtonPressedEvent and XButtonReleasedEvent
structures, this member is called button. It represents the
pointer button that changed state and can be the Button1,
Button2, Button3, Button4, or Button5 value. For the
XPointerMovedEvent structure, this member is called is_hint.
It can be set to NotifyNormal or NotifyHint.</p>
