<p>STARTX(1) STARTX(1)</p>

<p>NAME startx - initialize an X session</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS startx [ [ client ] options ... ] [ -- [ server
] [ display ] options ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The startx script is a front end to xinit
that provides a somewhat nicer user interface for running a
single session of the X Window Sys- tem. It is often run
with no arguments.</p>

<p>Arguments immediately following the startx command are
used to start a client in the same manner as xinit(1). The
special argument -- marks the end of client arguments and
the beginning of server options. It may be convenient to
specify server options with startx to change on a
per-session basis the default color depth, the servers
notion of the number of dots-per-inch the display device
presents, or take advantage of a different server layout, as
permitted by the Xorg(1) server and specified in the
xorg.conf(5) file. Some examples of specifying server
arguments follow; consult the manual page for your X server
to deter- mine which arguments are legal.</p>

<p>startx -- -depth 16</p>

<p>startx -- -dpi 100</p>

<p>startx -- -layout Multihead</p>

<p>To determine the client to run, startx first looks for a
file called .xinitrc in the user s home directory. If that
is not found, it uses the file xinitrc in the xinit library
directory.</p>

<p>If command line client options are given, they override
this behavior and revert to the xinit(1) behavior. To
determine the server to run, startx first looks for a file
called .xserverrc in the users home directory. If that is
not found, it uses the file xserverrc in the xinit library
directory. If command line server options are given, they
override this behavior and revert to the xinit(1) behavior.
Users rarely need to provide a .xserverrc file. See the
xinit(1) manual page for more details on the arguments.</p>

<p>The system-wide xinitrc and xserverrc files are found in
the /etc/X11/xinit directory.</p>

<p>The .xinitrc is typically a shell script which starts
many clients according to the user s preference. When this
shell script exits, startx kills the server and performs any
other session shutdown needed. Most of the clients started
by .xinitrc should be run in the back- ground. The last
client should run in the foreground; when it exits, the
session will exit. People often choose a session manager,
window manager, or xterm as the magic client.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Below is a sample .xinitrc that starts several
applications and leaves the window manager running as the
last application. Assuming that the window manager has been
configured properly, the user then chooses the Exit menu
item to shut down X.</p>

<p>xrdb -load $HOME/.Xresources xsetroot -solid gray &amp;
xbiff -geometry -430+5 &amp; oclock -geometry 75x75-0-0
&amp; xload -geometry -80-0 &amp; xterm -geometry +0+60 -ls
&amp; xterm -geometry +0-100 &amp; xconsole -geometry -0+0
-fn 5x7 &amp; exec twm</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES DISPLAY This variable gets set to
the name of the dis- play to which clients should connect.
Note that this gets set, not read.</p>

<p>XAUTHORITY This variable, if not already defined, gets
set to $(HOME)/.Xauthority. This is to pre- vent the X
server, if not given the -auth argument, from automatically
setting up inse- cure host-based authentication for the
local host. See the Xserver(1) and Xsecurity(7) manual pages
for more information on X client/server authentication.</p>

<p>FILES $(HOME)/.xinitrc Client to run. Typically a shell
script which runs many programs in the background.</p>

<p>$(HOME)/.xserverrc Server to run. The default is X.</p>

<p>/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc Client to run if the user has no
.xinitrc file.</p>

<p>/etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc Server to run if the user has
no .xserverrc file.</p>
