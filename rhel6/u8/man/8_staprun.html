<p>NAME staprun - systemtap runtime</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS staprun [ OPTIONS ] MODULE [ MODULE-OPTIONS
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The staprun program is the back-end of the
Systemtap tool. It expects a kernel module produced by the
front-end stap tool.</p>

<p>Splitting the systemtap tool into a front-end and a
back-end allows a user to compile a systemtap script on a
development machine that has the kernel development tools
(needed to compile the script) and then transfer the
resulting kernel module to a production machine that doesnt
have any development tools installed.</p>

<p>Please refer to stappaths (7) for the version number, or
run rpm -q systemtap (fedora/red hat) apt-get -v systemtap
(ubuntu)</p>

<p>OPTIONS The staprun program supports the following
options. Any other option prints a list of supported
options.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode. The level of verbosity is also set in
the SYSTEM- TAP_VERBOSE environment variable.</p>

<p>-V Print version number and exit.</p>

<p>-w Suppress warnings from the script.</p>

<p>-u Load the uprobes.ko module.</p>

<p>-c CMD Command CMD will be run and the staprun program
will exit when CMD does. The _stp_target variable will
contain the pid for CMD.</p>

<p>-x PID The _stp_target variable will be set to PID.</p>

<p>-o FILE Send output to FILE. If the module uses bulk
mode, the output will be in percpu files FILE_x(FILE_cpux in
background and bulk mode) where x is the cpu number. This
supports strftime(3) formats for FILE.</p>

<p>-b BUFFER_SIZE The systemtap module will specify a
buffer size. Setting one here will override that value. The
value should be an integer between 1 and 4095 which be
assumed to be the buffer size in MB. That value will be
per-cpu if bulk mode is used.</p>

<p>-L Load module and start probes, then detach from the
module leav- ing the probes running. The module can be
attached to later by using the -A option.</p>

<p>-A Attach to loaded systemtap module.</p>

<p>-C WHEN Control coloring of error messages. WHEN must be
either &quot;never&quot;, &quot;always&quot;, or
&quot;auto&quot; (i.e. enable only if at a terminal). If the
option is missing, then &quot;auto&quot; is assumed. Colors
can be modi- fied using the SYSTEMTAP_COLORS environment
variable. See the stap(1) manual page for more information
on syntax and be- haviour.</p>

<p>-d Delete a module. Only detached or unused modules the
user has permission to access will be deleted. Use
&quot;*&quot; (quoted) to delete all unused modules.</p>

<p>-D Run staprun in background as a daemon and show its
pid.</p>

<p>-R Rename the module to a unique name before inserting
it.</p>

<p>-r N:URI Pass the given number and URI data to the
tapset functions re- mote_id() and remote_uri().</p>

<p>-S size[,N] Sets the maximum size of output file and the
maximum number of output files. If the size of output file
will exceed size , systemtap switches output file to the
next file. And if the num- ber of output files exceed N ,
systemtap removes the oldest out- put file. You can omit the
second argument.</p>

<p>-T timeout Sets maximum time reader thread will wait
before dumping trace buffer. Value is in ms, default is
200ms. Setting this to a high value decreases number of
stapio wake-ups, allowing deeper sleep for embedded
platforms. But it impacts interactivity on terminal as
traces are dumped less often in case of low throughput.
There is no interactivity or performance impact for high
throughput as trace is dumped when buffer is full, before
this timeout expires.</p>

<p>var1=val Sets the value of global variable var1 to val.
Global variables contained within a module are treated as
module options and can be set from the staprun command
line.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS MODULE is either a module path or a module
name. If it is a module name, the module will be looked for
in the following directory (where VERSION is the output of
&quot;uname -r&quot;):</p>

<p>/lib/modules/VERSION/systemtap</p>

<p>Any additional arguments on the command line are passed
to the module. One use of these additional module arguments
is to set the value of global variables declared within the
module.</p>

<p>$ stap -p4 -m mod1 -e &rsquo;global
var1=&quot;foo&quot;; probe begin{printf(&quot;%s0, var1);
exit()}&rsquo;</p>

<p>Running this with an additional module argument:</p>

<p>$ staprun mod1.ko var1=&quot;HelloWorld&quot;
HelloWorld</p>

<p>Spaces and exclamation marks currently cannot be passed
into global variables this way.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES See the stapex(3stap) manual page for a
collection of sample scripts.</p>

<p>Here is a very basic example of how to use staprun.
First, use stap to compile a script. The stap program will
report the pathname to the re- sulting module.</p>

<p>$ stap -p4 -e &rsquo;probe begin { printf(&quot;Hello
World!0); exit() }&rsquo;
/home/user/.systemtap/cache/85/stap_8553d83f78c_265.ko</p>

<p>Run staprun with the pathname to the module as an
argument.</p>

<p>$ staprun
/home/user/.systemtap/cache/85/stap_8553d83f78c_265.ko Hello
World!</p>

<p>MODULE DETACHING AND ATTACHING After the staprun program
installs a Systemtap kernel module, users can detach from
the kernel module and reattach to it later. The -L option
loads the module and automatically detaches. Users can also
detach from the kernel module interactively by sending the
SIGQUIT signal from the keyboard (typically by typing
Ctrl-.</p>

<p>To reattach to a kernel module, the staprun -A option
would be used.</p>

<p>FILE SWITCHING BY SIGNAL After staprun launched the
stapio program, users can command it to switch output file
to next file when it outputs to file(s) (running staprun
with -o option) by sending a SIGUSR2 signal to the stapio
pro- cess. When it receives SIGUSR2, it will switch output
file to new file with suffix .N where N is the sequential
number. For example,</p>

<p>$ staprun -o foo ...</p>

<p>outputs trace logs to foo and if it receives SIGUSR2
signal, it switch- es output to foo.1 file. And receiving
SIGUSR2 again, it switches to foo.2 file.</p>

<p>SAFETY AND SECURITY Systemtap, in the default
kernel-module runtime mode, is an administra- tive tool. It
exposes kernel internal data structures and potentially
private user information. See the stap(1) manual page for
additional information on safety and security.</p>

<p>To increase system security, users of systemtap must be
root, or in the staprun group in order to execute this
setuid staprun program. A user may select a particular
privilege level with the stap --privilege= op- tion, which
staprun will later enforce.</p>

<p>stapdev Members of the stapdev group can write and load
script modules with root-equivalent privileges, without
particular security constraints. (Many safety constraints
remain.)</p>

<p>stapsys Members of the stapsys group have almost all the
privileges of stapdev, except for guru mode constructs.</p>

<p>staprun Members only of the stapusr group may
any-privileged modules placed into the
/lib/modules/VERSION/systemtap by the system ad-
ministrator.</p>

<p>staprun Members only of the stapusr group may also write
and load low- privilege script modules, which are normally
limited to manipu- lating their own processes (and not the
kernel nor other users processes).</p>

<p>Part of the privilege enforcement mechanism may require
using a stap- server and administrative trust in its
cryptographic signer; see the stap-server(8) manual page for
a for more information.</p>

<p>On a kernel with FIPS mode enabled, staprun normally
refuses to attempt to load systemtap-generated kernel
modules. This is because on some kernels, this results in a
panic. If your kernel includes corrections such as linux
commit #002c77a48b47, then you can force staprun to at-
tempt module loads anyway, by setting the STAP_FIPS_OVERRIDE
environ- ment variable to any value.</p>

<p>FILES /lib/modules/VERSION/systemtap If MODULE is a
module name, the module will be looked for in this
directory. Users who are only in the stapusr_ group can
install modules located in this directory. This directory
must be owned by the root user and not be world
writable.</p>
