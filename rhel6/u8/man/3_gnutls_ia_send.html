<p>NAME gnutls_ia_send - API function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/extra.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t gnutls_ia_send(gnutls_session_t session, const
char * data, size_t sizeofdata);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a gnutls_session_t
structure.</p>

<p>const char * data contains the data to send</p>

<p>size_t sizeofdata is the length of the data</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Send TLS/IA application payload data. This
function has the similar semantics with send(). The only
difference is that it accepts a GnuTLS session, and uses
different error codes.</p>

<p>The TLS/IA protocol is synchronous, so you cannot send
more than one packet at a time. The client always send the
first packet.</p>

<p>To finish an application phase in the server, use
gnutls_ia_end- phase_send(). The client cannot end an
application phase unilaterally; rather, a client is required
to respond with an endphase of its own if gnutls_ia_recv
indicates that the server has sent one.</p>

<p>If the EINTR is returned by the internal push function
(the default is send()} then GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED will be
returned. If GNUTLS_E_INTER- RUPTED or GNUTLS_E_AGAIN is
returned, you must call this function again, with the same
parameters; alternatively you could provide a NULL pointer
for data, and 0 for size.</p>

<p>RETURNS The number of bytes sent, or a negative error
code.</p>
