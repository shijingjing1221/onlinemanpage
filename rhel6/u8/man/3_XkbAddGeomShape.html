<p>XkbAddGeomShape(3) XKB FUNCTIONS XkbAddGeomShape(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbAddGeomShape - Add a shape to a keyboard
geometry</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS XkbShapePtr XkbAddGeomShape (XkbGeometryPtr
geom, Atom name, int sz_outlines);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - geom geometry to be updated</p>

<p>- name name of the new shape</p>

<p>- sz_outlines number of outlines to be reserved</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkb provides functions to add a single new
element to the top-level keyboard geometry. In each case the
num_ * fields of the corresponding structure is incremented
by 1. These functions do not change sz_* unless there is no
more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the
values of the element s structure from the arguments. For
other functions, you must explicitly write code to fill the
structures ele- ments.</p>

<p>The top-level geometry description includes a list of
geometry proper- ties. A geometry property associates an
arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary name. Programs
that display images of keyboards can use geometry properties
as hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other
geometry structures refer to geometry properties.</p>

<p>A geometry contains an arbitrary number of shapes, each
of which is made up of an arbitrary number of outlines.
XkbAddGeomShape adds a shape to a geometry geom by
allocating space for sz_outlines outlines for it and giving
it the name specified by name. If a shape with name name
already exists in the geometry, a pointer to the existing
shape is returned. XkbAddGeomShape returns NULL if any of
the parameters is empty or if it was not able to allocate
space. To allocate space for an arbitrary number of geometry
shapes, use XkbAllocGeomShapes.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES typedef struct _XkbShape { Atom name; /
shapes name */ unsigned short num_outlines; / number of
outlines for the shape */ unsigned short sz_outlines; / size
of the outlines array */ XkbOutlinePtr outlines; / array of
outlines for the shape */ XkbOutlinePtr approx; / pointer
into the array to the approximating outline */ XkbOutlinePtr
primary; / pointer into the array to the primary outline */
XkbBoundsRec bounds; / bounding box for the shape;
encompasses all outlines */ } XkbShapeRec, *XkbShapePtr;</p>
