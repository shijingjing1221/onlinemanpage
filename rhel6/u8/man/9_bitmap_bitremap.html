<p>BITMAP_BITREMAP(9) Basic Kernel Library Functions
BITMAP_BITREMAP(9)</p>

<p>NAME bitmap_bitremap - Apply map defined by a pair of
bitmaps to a single bit</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int bitmap_bitremap(int oldbit, const unsigned
long * old, const unsigned long * new, int bits);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS oldbit bit position to be mapped</p>

<p>old defines domain of map</p>

<p>new defines range of map</p>

<p>bits number of bits in each of these bitmaps</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Let old and new define a mapping of bit
positions, such that whatever position is held by the n-th
set bit in old is mapped to the n-th set bit in new. In the
more general case, allowing for the possibility that the
weight &acute;w&acute; of new is less than the weight of
old, map the position of the n-th set bit in old to the
position of the m-th set bit in new, where m == n % w.</p>

<p>The positions of unset bits in old are mapped to
themselves (the identify map).</p>

<p>Apply the above specified mapping to bit position
oldbit, returning the new bit position.</p>

<p>For example, lets say that old has bits 4 through 7 set,
and new has bits 12 through 15 set. This defines the mapping
of bit position 4 to 12, 5 to 13, 6 to 14 and 7 to 15, and
of all other bit positions unchanged. So if say oldbit is 5,
then this routine returns 13.</p>
