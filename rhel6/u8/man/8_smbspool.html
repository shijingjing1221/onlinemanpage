<p>NAME smbspool - send a print file to an SMB printer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smbspool {job} {user} {title} {copies}
{options} [filename]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p>smbspool is a very small print spooling program that
sends a print file to an SMB printer. The command-line
arguments are position-dependent for compatibility with the
Common UNIX Printing System, but you can use smbspool with
any printing system or from a program or script.</p>

<p>DEVICE URI</p>

<p>smbspool specifies the destination using a Uniform
Resource Identifier (&quot;URI&quot;) with a method of
&quot;smb&quot;. This string can take a number of forms:</p>

<p>&middot; smb://server[:port]/printer</p>

<p>&middot; smb://workgroup/server[:port]/printer</p>

<p>&middot;
smb://username:password@server[:port]/printer</p>

<p>&middot;
smb://username:password@workgroup/server[:port]/printer</p>

<p>smbspool tries to get the URI from the environment
variable DEVICE_URI. If DEVICE_URI is not present, smbspool
will use argv[0] if that starts with smb:// or argv[1] if
that is not the case.</p>

<p>Programs using the exec(2) functions can pass the URI in
argv[0], while shell scripts must set the DEVICE_URI
environment variable prior to running smbspool.</p>

<p>OPTIONS &middot; The job argument (argv[1]) contains the
job ID number and is presently not used by smbspool.</p>

<p>&middot; The user argument (argv[2]) contains the print
user&rsquo;s name and is presently not used by smbspool.</p>

<p>&middot; The title argument (argv[3]) contains the job
title string and is passed as the remote file name when
sending the print job.</p>

<p>&middot; The copies argument (argv[4]) contains the
number of copies to be printed of the named file. If no
filename is provided then this argument is not used by
smbspool.</p>

<p>&middot; The options argument (argv[5]) contains the
print options in a single string and is currently not used
by smbspool.</p>

<p>&middot; The filename argument (argv[6]) contains the
name of the file to print. If this argument is not specified
then the print file is read from the standard input.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3 of the
Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR smbspool was written by Michael Sweet at Easy
Software Products.</p>

<p>The original Samba software and related utilities were
created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the
Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer.
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba
2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to
DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander
Bokovoy.</p>
