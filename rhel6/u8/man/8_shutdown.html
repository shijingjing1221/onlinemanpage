<p>NAME shutdown - bring the system down</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS shutdown [OPTION]... TIME [MESSAGE]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION shutdown arranges for the system to be
brought down in a safe way. All logged-in users are notified
that the system is going down and, within the last five
minutes of TIME, new logins are prevented.</p>

<p>TIME may have different formats, the most common is
simply the word now which will bring the system down
immediately. Other valid for- mats are +m, where m is the
number of minutes to wait until shutting down and hh:mm
which specifies the time on the 24hr clock.</p>

<p>Once TIME has elapsed, shutdown sends a request to the
init(8) daemon to bring the system down into the appropriate
runlevel.</p>

<p>This is performed by emitting the runlevel(7) event,
which includes the new runlevel in the RUNLEVEL environment
variable as well as the previ- ous runlevel (obtained from
the environment or from /var/run/utmp) in the PREVLEVEL
variable. An additional INIT_HALT variable may be set, this
will contain the value HALT when bringing the system down
for halt and POWEROFF when bringing the system down for
power off.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -r Requests that the system be rebooted after it
has been brought down.</p>

<p>-h Requests that the system be either halted or powered
off after it has been brought down, with the choice as to
which left up to the system.</p>

<p>-H Requests that the system be halted after it has been
brought down.</p>

<p>-P Requests that the system be powered off after it has
been brought down.</p>

<p>-c Cancels a running shutdown. TIME is not specified
with this option, the first argument is MESSAGE.</p>

<p>-k Only send out the warning messages and disable
logins, do not actually bring the system down.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT RUNLEVEL shutdown will read the current
runlevel from this environment variable if set in preference
to reading from /var/run/utmp</p>

<p>FILES /var/run/utmp Where the current runlevel will be
read from; this file will also be updated with the new
runlevel.</p>

<p>/var/log/wtmp A new runlevel record will be appended to
this file for the new runlevel.</p>

<p>NOTES The Upstart init(8) daemon does not keep track of
runlevels itself, instead they are implemented entirely by
its userspace tools.</p>

<p>See runlevel(7) for more details.</p>
