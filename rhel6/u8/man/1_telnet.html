<p>TELNET(1) BSD General Commands Manual TELNET(1)</p>

<p>NAME telnet - user interface to the TELNET protocol</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS telnet [-8EFKLacdfrx] [-X authtype] [-b
hostalias] [-e escapechar] [-k realm] [-l user] [-n
tracefile] [host [port]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The telnet command is used to communicate
with another host using the TELNET protocol. If telnet is
invoked without the host argument, it enters command mode,
indicated by its prompt (telnet&gt;). In this mode, it
accepts and executes the commands listed below. If it is
invoked with arguments, it performs an open command with
those arguments.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-7 Strip 8th bit on input and output. Telnet is 8-bit
clean by default but doesn t send the TELNET BINARY option
unless forced.</p>

<p>-8 Specifies an 8-bit data path. This causes an attempt
to negoti- ate the TELNET BINARY option on both input and
output.</p>

<p>-E Stops any character from being recognized as an
escape character.</p>

<p>-F If Kerberos V5 authentication is being used, the -F
option allows the local credentials to be forwarded to the
remote system, including any credentials that have already
been forwarded into the local environment.</p>

<p>-K Specifies no automatic login to the remote
system.</p>

<p>-L Specifies an 8-bit data path on output. This causes
the BINARY option to be negotiated on output.</p>

<p>-X atype Disables the atype type of authentication.</p>

<p>-a Attempt automatic login. Currently, this sends the
user name via the USER variable of the ENVIRON option if
supported by the remote system. The name used is that of the
current user as returned by getlogin(2) if it agrees with
the current user ID, otherwise it is the name associated
with the user ID.</p>

<p>-b hostalias Uses bind(2) on the local socket to bind it
to an aliased address (see ifconfig(8) and the alias
specifier) or to the address of another interface than the
one naturally chosen by connect(2). This can be useful when
connecting to services which use IP addresses for
authentication and reconfiguration of the server is
undesirable (or impossible).</p>

<p>-c Disables the reading of the users .telnetrc file.
(See the toggle skiprc command on this man page.)</p>

<p>-d Sets the initial value of the debug toggle to
TRUE.</p>

<p>-e escapechar Sets the initial telnet escape character
to escapechar. If escapechar is omitted, then there will be
no escape character.</p>

<p>-f If Kerberos V5 authentication is being used, the -f
option allows the local credentials to be forwarded to the
remote system.</p>

<p>-k realm If Kerberos authentication is being used, the
-k option requests that telnet obtain tickets for the remote
host in realm realm instead of the remote hosts realm, as
determined by krb_realmofhost(3).</p>

<p>-l user When connecting to the remote system, if the
remote system under- stands the ENVIRON option, then user
will be sent to the remote system as the value for the
variable USER. This option implies the -a option. This
option may also be used with the open com- mand.</p>

<p>-n tracefile Opens tracefile for recording trace
information. See the set tracefile command below.</p>

<p>-r Specifies a user interface similar to rlogin(1). In
this mode, the escape character is set to the tilde (~)
character, unless modified by the -e option.</p>

<p>-x Turns on encryption of the data stream if
possible.</p>

<p>host Indicates the official name, an alias, or the
Internet address of a remote host.</p>

<p>port Indicates a port number (address of an
application). If a number is not specified, the default
telnet port is used.</p>

<p>When in rlogin mode, a line of the form ~. disconnects
from the remote host; ~ is the telnet escape character.
Similarly, the line ~^Z suspends the telnet session. The
line ~^] escapes to the normal telnet escape prompt.</p>

<p>Once a connection has been opened, telnet will attempt
to enable the TELNET LINEMODE option. If this fails, telnet
will revert to one of two input modes: either character at a
time or old line by line depending on what the remote system
supports.</p>

<p>When LINEMODE is enabled, character processing is done
on the local sys- tem, under the control of the remote
system. When input editing or char- acter echoing is to be
disabled, the remote system will relay that infor- mation.
The remote system will also relay changes to any special
charac- ters that happen on the remote system, so that they
can take effect on the local system.</p>

<p>In character at a time mode, most text typed is
immediately sent to the remote host for processing.</p>

<p>In old line by line mode, all text is echoed locally,
and (normally) only completed lines are sent to the remote
host. The local echo char- acter (initially ^E) may be used
to turn off and on the local echo (this would mostly be used
to enter passwords without the password being echoed).</p>

<p>If the LINEMODE option is enabled, or if the localchars
toggle is TRUE (the default for old line by line; see
below), the users quit, intr, and flush characters are
trapped locally, and sent as TELNET protocol sequences to
the remote side. If LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then the
users susp and eof are also sent as TELNET protocol
sequences, and quit is sent as a TELNET ABORT instead of
BREAK. There are options (see toggle autoflush and toggle
autosynch below) which cause this action to flush subsequent
output to the terminal (until the remote host acknowl- edges
the TELNET sequence) and flush previous terminal input (in
the case of quit and intr).</p>

<p>While connected to a remote host, telnet command mode
may be entered by typing the telnet escape character
(initially ^]). When in com- mand mode, the normal terminal
editing conventions are available. Note that the escape
character will return to the command mode of the initial
invocation of telnet that has the controlling terminal. Use
the send escape command to switch to command mode in
subsequent telnet processes on remote hosts.</p>

<p>The following telnet commands are available. Only enough
of each command to uniquely identify it need be typed (this
is also true for arguments to the mode, set, toggle, unset,
slc, environ, and display commands).</p>

<p>auth argument [...] The auth command manipulates the
information sent through the TELNET AUTHENTICATE option.
Valid arguments for the auth com- mand are as follows:</p>

<p>disable type Disables the specified type of
authentication. To obtain a list of available types, use the
auth disable ? command.</p>

<p>enable type Enables the specified type of
authentication. To obtain a list of available types, use the
auth enable ? command.</p>

<p>status Lists the current status of the various types of
authentication.</p>

<p>close Close a TELNET session and return to command
mode.</p>

<p>display argument [...] Displays all, or some, of the set
and toggle values (see below).</p>

<p>encrypt argument [...] The encrypt command manipulates
the information sent through the TELNET ENCRYPT option.</p>

<p>Valid arguments for the encrypt command are as
follows:</p>

<p>disable type [input|output] Disables the specified type
of encryption. If you omit input and output, both input and
output are disabled. To obtain a list of available types,
use the encrypt disable ? command.</p>

<p>enable type [input|output] Enables the specified type of
encryption. If you omit input and output, both input and
output are enabled. To obtain a list of available types, use
the encrypt enable ? command.</p>

<p>input This is the same as the encrypt start input com-
mand.</p>

<p>-input This is the same as the encrypt stop input com-
mand.</p>

<p>output This is the same as the encrypt start output
command.</p>

<p>-output This is the same as the encrypt stop output com-
mand.</p>

<p>start [input|output] Attempts to start encryption. If
you omit input and output, both input and output are
enabled. To obtain a list of available types, use the
encrypt enable ? command.</p>

<p>status Lists the current status of encryption.</p>

<p>stop [input|output] Stops encryption. If you omit input
and output, encryption is on both input and output.</p>

<p>type type Sets the default type of encryption to be used
with later encrypt start or encrypt stop com- mands.</p>

<p>environ arguments [...] The environ command is used to
manipulate the variables that may be sent through the TELNET
ENVIRON option. The initial set of variables is taken from
the users environment, with only the DISPLAY and PRINTER
variables being exported by default. The USER variable is
also exported if the -a or -l options are used. Valid
arguments for the environ command are:</p>

<p>define variable value Define the variable variable to
have a value of value. Any variables defined by this command
are automatically exported. The value may be enclosed in
single or double quotes so that tabs and spaces may be
included.</p>

<p>undefine variable Remove variable from the list of
environment vari- ables.</p>

<p>export variable Mark the variable variable to be
exported to the remote side.</p>

<p>unexport variable Mark the variable variable to not be
exported unless explicitly asked for by the remote side.</p>

<p>list List the current set of environment variables.
Those marked with a * will be sent automatically, other
variables will only be sent if explicitly requested.</p>

<p>? Prints out help information for the environ com-
mand.</p>

<p>logout Sends the TELNET LOGOUT option to the remote
side. This com- mand is similar to a close command; however,
if the remote side does not support the LOGOUT option,
nothing happens. If, however, the remote side does support
the LOGOUT option, this command should cause the remote side
to close the TELNET con- nection. If the remote side also
supports the concept of sus- pending a users session for
later reattachment, the logout argument indicates that you
should terminate the session imme- diately.</p>

<p>mode type type is one of several options, depending on
the state of the TELNET session. The remote host is asked
for permission to go into the requested mode. If the remote
host is capable of entering that mode, the requested mode
will be entered.</p>

<p>character Disable the TELNET LINEMODE option, or, if the
remote side does not understand the LINEMODE option, then
enter character at a time mode.</p>

<p>line Enable the TELNET LINEMODE option, or, if the
remote side does not understand the LINEMODE option, then
attempt to enter old-line-by- line mode.</p>

<p>isig (-isig) Attempt to enable (disable) the TRAPSIG
mode of the LINEMODE option. This requires that the LINEMODE
option be enabled.</p>

<p>edit (-edit) Attempt to enable (disable) the EDIT mode
of the LINEMODE option. This requires that the LINEMODE
option be enabled.</p>

<p>softtabs (-softtabs) Attempt to enable (disable) the
SOFT_TAB mode of the LINEMODE option. This requires that the
LINEMODE option be enabled.</p>

<p>litecho (-litecho) Attempt to enable (disable) the
LIT_ECHO mode of the LINEMODE option. This requires that the
LINEMODE option be enabled.</p>

<p>? Prints out help information for the mode com-
mand.</p>

<p>open host [-l user] [[-] port] Open a connection to the
named host. If no port number is specified, telnet will
attempt to contact a TELNET server at the default port. The
host specification may be either a host name (see hosts(5))
or an Internet address specified in the dot notation (see
inet(3)). The -l option may be used to specify the user name
to be passed to the remote system via the ENVIRON option.
When connecting to a non-standard port, telnet omits any
automatic initiation of TELNET options. When the port number
is preceded by a minus sign, the initial option negotiation
is done. After establishing a connection, the file .telnetrc
in the users home directory is opened. Lines beginning with
a # are comment lines. Blank lines are ignored. Lines that
begin without whitespace are the start of a machine entry.
The first thing on the line is the name of the machine that
is being connected to. The rest of the line, and successive
lines that begin with whitespace are assumed to be telnet
commands and are processed as if they had been typed in
manually to the telnet command prompt.</p>

<p>quit Close any open TELNET session and exit telnet. An
end-of-file (in command mode) will also close a session and
exit.</p>

<p>send arguments Sends one or more special character
sequences to the remote host. The following are the
arguments which may be specified (more than one argument may
be specified at a time):</p>

<p>abort Sends the TELNET ABORT (Abort processes)
sequence.</p>

<p>ao Sends the TELNET AO (Abort Output) sequence, which
should cause the remote system to flush all output from the
remote system to the users terminal.</p>

<p>ayt Sends the TELNET AYT (Are You There) sequence, to
which the remote system may or may not choose to
respond.</p>

<p>brk Sends the TELNET BRK (Break) sequence, which may
have significance to the remote system.</p>

<p>ec Sends the TELNET EC (Erase Character) sequence, which
should cause the remote system to erase the last char- acter
entered.</p>

<p>el Sends the TELNET EL (Erase Line) sequence, which
should cause the remote system to erase the line cur- rently
being entered.</p>

<p>eof Sends the TELNET EOF (End Of File) sequence.</p>

<p>eor Sends the TELNET EOR (End of Record) sequence.</p>

<p>escape Sends the current telnet escape character
(initially ^]).</p>

<p>ga Sends the TELNET GA (Go Ahead) sequence, which likely
has no significance to the remote system.</p>

<p>getstatus If the remote side supports the TELNET STATUS
command, getstatus will send the subnegotiation to request
that the server send its current option status.</p>

<p>ip Sends the TELNET IP (Interrupt Process) sequence,
which should cause the remote system to abort the cur-
rently running process.</p>

<p>nop Sends the TELNET NOP (No OPeration) sequence.</p>

<p>susp Sends the TELNET SUSP (SUSPend process)
sequence.</p>

<p>synch Sends the TELNET SYNCH sequence. This sequence
causes the remote system to discard all previously typed
(but not yet read) input. This sequence is sent as TCP
urgent data (and may not work if the remote system is a
4.2BSD system -- if it doesnt work, a lower case r may be
echoed on the terminal).</p>

<p>do cmd Sends the TELNET DO cmd sequence. cmd can be
either a decimal number between 0 and 255, or a symbolic
name for a specific TELNET command. cmd can also be either
help or ? to print out help information, including a list of
known symbolic names.</p>

<p>dont cmd Sends the TELNET DONT cmd sequence. cmd can be
either a decimal number between 0 and 255, or a symbolic
name for a specific TELNET command. cmd can also be either
help or ? to print out help information, including a list of
known symbolic names.</p>

<p>will cmd Sends the TELNET WILL cmd sequence. cmd can be
either a decimal number between 0 and 255, or a symbolic
name for a specific TELNET command. cmd can also be either
help or ? to print out help information, including a list of
known symbolic names.</p>

<p>wont cmd Sends the TELNET WONT cmd sequence. cmd can be
either a decimal number between 0 and 255, or a symbolic
name for a specific TELNET command. cmd can also be either
help or ? to print out help information, including a list of
known symbolic names.</p>

<p>? Prints out help information for the send command.</p>

<p>set argument value</p>

<p>unset argument value The set command will set any one of
a number of telnet vari- ables to a specific value or to
TRUE. The special value off turns off the function
associated with the variable; this is equivalent to using
the unset command. The unset command will disable or set to
FALSE any of the specified functions. The values of
variables may be interrogated with the display com- mand.
The variables which may be set or unset, but not tog- gled,
are listed here. In addition, any of the variables for the
toggle command may be explicitly set or unset using the set
and unset commands.</p>

<p>ayt If TELNET is in localchars mode, or LINEMODE is
enabled, and the status character is typed, a TELNET AYT
sequence (see send ayt preceding) is sent to the remote
host. The initial value for the &quot;Are You There&quot;
character is the terminals status character.</p>

<p>echo This is the value (initially ^E) which, when in
line by line mode, toggles between doing local echoing of
entered characters (for normal processing), and suppressing
echoing of entered characters (for entering, say, a
password).</p>

<p>eof If telnet is operating in LINEMODE or old line by
line mode, entering this character as the first character on
a line will cause this character to be sent to the remote
system. The initial value of the eof character is taken to
be the terminal s eof char- acter.</p>

<p>erase If telnet is in localchars mode (see toggle
localchars below), and if telnet is operating in character
at a time mode, then when this character is typed, a TELNET
EC sequence (see send ec above) is sent to the remote
system. The initial value for the erase char- acter is taken
to be the terminals erase character.</p>

<p>escape This is the telnet escape character (initially
^[) which causes entry into telnet command mode (when con-
nected to a remote system).</p>

<p>flushoutput If telnet is in localchars mode (see toggle
localchars below) and the flushoutput character is typed, a
TELNET AO sequence (see send ao above) is sent to the remote
host. The initial value for the flush charac- ter is taken
to be the terminal s flush character.</p>

<p>forw1</p>

<p>forw2 If TELNET is operating in LINEMODE, these are the
characters that, when typed, cause partial lines to be
forwarded to the remote system. The initial value for the
forwarding characters are taken from the termi- nals eol and
eol2 characters.</p>

<p>interrupt If telnet is in localchars mode (see toggle
localchars below) and the interrupt character is typed, a
TELNET IP sequence (see send ip above) is sent to the remote
host. The initial value for the interrupt character is taken
to be the terminal s intr character.</p>

<p>kill If telnet is in localchars mode (see toggle
localchars below), and if telnet is operating in character
at a time mode, then when this character is typed, a TELNET
EL sequence (see send el above) is sent to the remote
system. The initial value for the kill charac- ter is taken
to be the terminals kill character.</p>

<p>lnext If telnet is operating in LINEMODE or old line by
line mode, then this character is taken to be the terminals
lnext character. The initial value for the lnext character
is taken to be the terminals lnext character.</p>

<p>quit If telnet is in localchars mode (see toggle
localchars below) and the quit character is typed, a TELNET
BRK sequence (see send brk above) is sent to the remote
host. The initial value for the quit character is taken to
be the terminals quit character.</p>

<p>reprint If telnet is operating in LINEMODE or old line
by line mode, then this character is taken to be the
terminals reprint character. The initial value for the
reprint character is taken to be the terminals reprint
character.</p>

<p>rlogin This is the rlogin escape character. If set, the
nor- mal TELNET escape character is ignored unless it is
preceded by this character at the beginning of a line. This
character, at the beginning of a line, followed by a
&quot;.&quot; closes the connection; when followed by a ^Z
it suspends the telnet command. The initial state is to
disable the rlogin escape character.</p>

<p>start If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been
enabled, then this character is taken to be the termi- nal s
start character. The initial value for the start character
is taken to be the terminals start character.</p>

<p>stop If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been
enabled, then this character is taken to be the termi- nal s
stop character. The initial value for the stop character is
taken to be the terminal s stop charac- ter.</p>

<p>susp If telnet is in localchars mode, or LINEMODE is
enabled, and the suspend character is typed, a TELNET SUSP
sequence (see send susp above) is sent to the remote host.
The initial value for the suspend char- acter is taken to be
the terminal s suspend character.</p>

<p>tracefile This is the file to which the output, caused
by netdata or option tracing being TRUE, will be written. If
it is set to - , then tracing information will be written to
standard output (the default).</p>

<p>worderase If telnet is operating in LINEMODE or old line
by line mode, then this character is taken to be the
terminal s worderase character. The initial value for the
worderase character is taken to be the terminals worderase
character.</p>

<p>? Displays the legal set (unset) commands.</p>

<p>skey sequence challenge The skey command computes a
response to the S/Key challenge. See skey(1) for more
information on the S/Key system.</p>

<p>slc state The slc command (Set Local Characters) is used
to set or change the state of the special characters when
the TELNET LINEMODE option has been enabled. Special
characters are characters that get mapped to TELNET commands
sequences (like ip or quit) or line editing characters (like
erase and kill). By default, the local special characters
are exported.</p>

<p>check Verify the current settings for the current spe-
cial characters. The remote side is requested to send all
the current special character settings, and if there are any
discrepancies with the local side, the local side will
switch to the remote value.</p>

<p>export Switch to the local defaults for the special
char- acters. The local default characters are those of the
local terminal at the time when telnet was started.</p>

<p>import Switch to the remote defaults for the special
characters. The remote default characters are those of the
remote system at the time when the TELNET connection was
established.</p>

<p>? Prints out help information for the slc command.</p>

<p>status Show the current status of telnet. This includes
the peer one is connected to, as well as the current
mode.</p>

<p>toggle arguments [...] Toggle (between TRUE and FALSE)
various flags that control how telnet responds to events.
These flags may be set explicitly to TRUE or FALSE using the
set and unset commands listed above. More than one argument
may be specified. The state of these flags may be
interrogated with the display command. Valid arguments
are:</p>

<p>authdebug Turns on debugging information for the
authenti- cation code.</p>

<p>autoflush If autoflush and localchars are both TRUE,
then when the ao or quit characters are recognized (and
transformed into TELNET sequences; see set above for
details), telnet refuses to display any data on the user s
terminal until the remote system acknowledges (via a TELNET
TIMING MARK option) that it has processed those TELNET
sequences. The initial value for this toggle is TRUE if the
terminal user had not done an &quot;stty noflsh&quot;,
otherwise FALSE (see stty(1)).</p>

<p>autodecrypt When the TELNET ENCRYPT option is
negotiated, by default the actual encryption (decryption) of
the data stream does not start automatically. The
autoencrypt (autodecrypt) command states that encryption of
the output (input) stream should be enabled as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>autologin If the remote side supports the TELNET
AUTHENTICATION option TELNET attempts to use it to perform
automatic authentication. If the AUTHENTICATION option is
not supported, the users login name are propagated through
the TELNET ENVIRON option. This command is the same as
specifying a option on the open command.</p>

<p>autosynch If autosynch and localchars are both TRUE,
then when either the intr or quit character is typed (see
set above for descriptions of the intr and quit characters),
the resulting TELNET sequence sent is followed by the TELNET
SYNCH sequence. This procedure should cause the remote
system to begin throwing away all previously typed input
until both of the TELNET sequences have been read and acted
upon. The initial value of this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p>binary Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on
both input and output.</p>

<p>inbinary Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on
input.</p>

<p>outbinary Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on
output.</p>

<p>crlf If this is TRUE, then carriage returns will be sent
as &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;. If this is FALSE, then car- riage
returns will be send as &lt;CR&gt;&lt;NUL&gt;. The initial
value for this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p>crmod Toggle carriage return mode. When this mode is
enabled, most carriage return characters received from the
remote host will be mapped into a carriage return followed
by a line feed. This mode does not affect those characters
typed by the user, only those received from the remote host.
This mode is not very useful unless the remote host only
sends carriage return, but never line feeds. The initial
value for this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p>debug Toggles socket level debugging (useful only to the
superuser). The initial value for this tog- gle is
FALSE.</p>

<p>encdebug Turns on debugging information for the encryp-
tion code.</p>

<p>localchars If this is TRUE, then the flush, interrupt,
quit, erase, and kill characters (see set above) are
recognized locally, and transformed into (hopefully)
appropriate TELNET control sequences (respectively ao, ip,
brk, ec, and el; see send above). The initial value for this
toggle is TRUE in old line by line mode, and FALSE in
character at a time mode. When the LINEMODE option is
enabled, the value of localchars is ignored, and assumed to
always be TRUE. If LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then quit
is sent as abort, and eof and suspend are sent as eof and
susp (see send above).</p>

<p>netdata Toggles the display of all network data (in hex-
adecimal format). The initial value for this toggle is
FALSE.</p>

<p>options Toggles the display of some internal telnet pro-
tocol processing (having to do with TELNET options). The
initial value for this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p>prettydump When the netdata toggle is enabled, if
prettydump is enabled the output from the netdata command
will be formatted in a more user readable format. Spaces are
put between each character in the output, and the beginning
of any TELNET escape sequence is preceded by a * to aid in
locating them.</p>

<p>skiprc When the skiprc toggle is TRUE, TELNET skips the
reading of the .telnetrc file in the users home directory
when connections are opened. The ini- tial value for this
toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p>termdata Toggles the display of all terminal data (in
hexadecimal format). The initial value for this toggle is
FALSE.</p>

<p>verbose_encrypt When the verbose_encrypt toggle is TRUE,
telnet prints out a message each time encryption is enabled
or disabled. The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p>? Displays the legal toggle commands.</p>

<p>z Suspend telnet. This command only works when the user
is using the csh(1).</p>

<p>! [command] Execute a single command in a subshell on
the local system. If command is omitted, then an interactive
subshell is invoked.</p>

<p>? [command] Get help. With no arguments, telnet prints a
help summary. If a command is specified, telnet will print
the help informa- tion for just that command.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT telnet uses at least the HOME, SHELL,
DISPLAY, and TERM environment vari- ables. Other environment
variables may be propagated to the other side via the TELNET
ENVIRON option.</p>

<p>FILES ~/.telnetrc user customized telnet startup
values</p>

<p>HISTORY The telnet command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>NOTES On some remote systems, echo has to be turned off
manually when in old line by line mode.</p>

<p>In old line by line mode or LINEMODE the terminal s eof
character is only recognized (and sent to the remote system)
when it is the first character on a line.</p>

<p>Source routing is not supported yet for IPv6.</p>
