<p>LISTEN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual LISTEN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME listen - listen for socket connections and limit
the queue of incoming connections</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int listen(int socket, int backlog);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The listen() function shall mark a
connection-mode socket, specified by the socket argument, as
accepting connections.</p>

<p>The backlog argument provides a hint to the
implementation which the implementation shall use to limit
the number of outstanding connections in the sockets listen
queue. Implementations may impose a limit on backlog and
silently reduce the specified value. Normally, a larger
backlog argument value shall result in a larger or equal
length of the listen queue. Implementations shall support
values of backlog up to SOMAXCONN, defined in
&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;.</p>

<p>The implementation may include incomplete connections in
its listen queue. The limits on the number of incomplete
connections and completed connections queued may be
different.</p>

<p>The implementation may have an upper limit on the length
of the listen queue-either global or per accepting socket.
If backlog exceeds this limit, the length of the listen
queue is set to the limit.</p>

<p>If listen() is called with a backlog argument value that
is less than 0, the function behaves as if it had been
called with a backlog argu- ment value of 0.</p>

<p>A backlog argument of 0 may allow the socket to accept
connections, in which case the length of the listen queue
may be set to an implementa- tion-defined minimum value.</p>

<p>The socket in use may require the process to have
appropriate privi- leges to use the listen() function.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completions, listen() shall
return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The listen() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EDESTADDRREQ</p>

<p>The socket is not bound to a local address, and the
protocol does not support listening on an unbound
socket.</p>

<p>EINVAL The socket is already connected.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a
socket.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The socket protocol does not support
listen().</p>

<p>The listen() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES The calling process does not have the appropriate
privileges.</p>

<p>EINVAL The socket has been shut down.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS Insufficient resources are available in the
system to complete the call.</p>
