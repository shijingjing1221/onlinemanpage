<p>AUTOFS_LDAP_AUTH.CONF(5) AUTOFS_LDAP_AUTH.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME autofs_ldap_auth.conf - autofs LDAP authentication
configuration</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION LDAP authenticated binds, TLS encrypted
connections and certification may be used by setting
appropriate values in the autofs authentication
configuration file and configuring the LDAP client with
appropriate settings. The default location of this file is
/etc/autofs_ldap_auth.conf. If this file exists it will be
used to es- tablish whether TLS or authentication should be
used.</p>

<p>An example of this file is:</p>

<p>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;autofs_ldap_sasl_conf usetls=&quot;yes&quot;
tlsrequired=&quot;no&quot; authrequired=&quot;no&quot;
authtype=&quot;DIGEST-MD5&quot; user=&quot;xyz&quot;
secret=&quot;abc&quot; /&gt;</p>

<p>If TLS encryption is to be used the location of the
Certificate Author- ity certificate must be set within the
LDAP client configuration in or- der to validate the server
certificate. If, in addition, a certified connection is to
be used then the client certificate and private key file
locations must also be configured within the LDAP
client.</p>

<p>OPTIONS This files contains a single XML element, as
shown in the example above, with several attributes.</p>

<p>The possible attributes are:</p>

<p>usetls=&quot;yes&quot;|&quot;no&quot; Determines whether
an encrypted connection to the ldap server should be
attempted.</p>

<p>tlsrequired=&quot;yes&quot;|&quot;no&quot; This flag
tells whether the ldap connection must be encrypted. If set
to &quot;yes&quot;, the automounter will fail to start if an
en- crypted connection cannot be established.</p>


<p>authrequired=&quot;yes&quot;|&quot;no&quot;|&quot;autodetect&quot;|&quot;simple&quot;
This option tells whether an authenticated connection to the
ldap server is required in order to perform ldap queries. If
the flag is set to yes, only sasl authenticated connections
will be allowed. If it is set to no then authentication is
not needed for ldap server connections. If it is set to
autodetect then the ldap server will be queried to establish
a suitable sasl authen- tication mechanism. If no suitable
mechanism can be found, con- nections to the ldap server are
made without authentication. Fi- nally, if it is set to
simple, then simple authentication will be used instead of
SASL.</p>


<p>authtype=&quot;GSSAPI&quot;|&quot;LOGIN&quot;|&quot;PLAIN&quot;|&quot;ANONYMOUS&quot;|&quot;DIGEST-MD5|EXTERNAL&quot;
This attribute can be used to specify a preferred
authentication mechanism. In normal operations, the
automounter will attempt to authenticate to the ldap server
using the list of supported- SASLmechanisms obtained from
the directory server. Explicitly setting the authtype will
bypass this selection and only try the mechanism specified.
The EXTERNAL mechanism may be used to au- thenticate using a
client certificate and requires that authre- quired set to
&quot;yes&quot; if using SSL or usetls, tlsrequired and au-
threquired all set to &quot;yes&quot; if using TLS, in
addition to au- thtype being set to EXTERNAL.</p>

<p>If using authtype EXTERNAL two additional configuration
entries are required:</p>

<p>external_cert=&quot;&lt;client certificate
path&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>This specifies the path of the file containing the
client cer- tificate.</p>

<p>external_key=&quot;&lt;client certificate key
path&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>This specifies the path of the file containing the
client cer- tificate key.</p>

<p>These two configuration entries are mandatory when using
the EX- TERNAL method as the HOME environment variable
cannot be assumed to be set or, if it is, to be set to the
location we expect.</p>

<p>user=&quot;&lt;username&gt;&quot; This attribute holds
the authentication identity used by authen- tication
mechanisms that require it. Legal values for this at-
tribute include any printable characters that can be used by
the selected authentication mechanism.</p>

<p>secret=&quot;&lt;password&gt;&quot; This attribute holds
the secret used by authentication mecha- nisms that require
it. Legal values for this attribute include any printable
characters that can be used by the selected au- thentication
mechanism.</p>

<p>encoded_secret=&quot;&lt;base64 encoded
password&gt;&quot; This attribute holds the base64 encoded
secret used by authenti- cation mechanisms that require it.
If this entry is present as well as the secret entry this
value will take precedence.</p>

<p>clientprinc=&quot;&lt;GSSAPI client principal&gt;&quot;
When using GSSAPI authentication, this attribute is con-
sulted to determine the principal name to use when au-
thenticating to the directory server. By default, this will
be set to &quot;autofsclient/&lt;fqdn&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;.</p>

<p>credentialcache=&quot;&lt;external credential cache
path&gt;&quot; When using GSSAPI authentication, this
attribute can be used to specify an externally configured
credential cache that is used during authentication. By
default, autofs will setup a memory based credential
cache.</p>
