<p>NAME smp_discover - invoke DISCOVER SMP function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smp_discover [--brief] [--help] [--hex]
[--ignore] [--interface=PARAMS] [--list] [--multiple]
[--num=NUM] [--phy=ID] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--verbose]
[--version] SMP_DEVICE[,N]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends a SAS Management Protocol (SMP)
DISCOVER request function to a SMP target and decodes or
outputs the response. The SMP target is iden- tified by the
SMP_DEVICE and the SAS_ADDR. Depending on the interface, the
SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE. With one
interface there is one SMP_DEVICE per machine so the
SMP_DEVICE,N syntax is needed to differentiate between HBAs
if there are multiple present.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Mandatory arguments to long options are
mandatory for short options as well.</p>

<p>-b, --brief reduce the decoded response output. If used
twice will exit if there is no attached device (after
outputting that). When used with --multiple, unattached phys
are not listed; when used twice, trims attached phys
output.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex output the response in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-i, --ignore sets the Ignore Zone Group bit in the SMP
Discover request.</p>

<p>-I, --interface=PARAMS interface specific parameters. In
this case &quot;interface&quot; refers to the path through
the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.</p>

<p>-l, --list list attributes in &quot;name=value&quot;
form, one entry per line.</p>

<p>-m, --multiple loops over multiple phys within SMP
target (typically an expander) and does a DISCOVER request
and outputs a one line summary. Phy 0 is queried first, then
phy 1, continuing until an error occurs. If --brief is given
then there is no output for phys that indicate there is no
attached device; when used twice additionally trims the
output line of attached phys.</p>

<p>-n, --num=NUM number of phys to fetch, starting at
--phy=ID when the --multi- ple option is given. The default
value is 0 which is interpreted as &quot;the rest&quot;
(i.e. until a &quot;phy does not exist&quot; function result
is received). This option is ignored in the absence of the
--multiple option.</p>

<p>-p, --phy=ID phy identifier. ID is a value between 0 and
127. Default is 0.</p>

<p>-r, --raw send the response to stdout in binary. All
error messages are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-s, --sa=SAS_ADDR specifies the SAS address of the SMP
target device. Typically this is an expander. This option
may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the targets SAS
address within it. The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS
addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in
hexadecimal either prefix it with 0x or put a trailing h on
it.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the verbosity of the output. Can
be used multiple times</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>SINGLE LINE FORMAT The --multiple option causes SMP
DISCOVER responses to be compressed to a header followed by
one line per phy. To save space SAS addresses are shown in
hex without a 0x prefix or h suffix. The header line gives
the SAS address of the SMP target itself and assumes it is
an expander.</p>

<p>Each line starts with &quot; phy &lt;n&gt;:&quot; where
&lt;n&gt; is the phy identifier (and they are origin zero).
That is followed by the routing attribute represented by a
single letter which is either &quot;D&quot; for direct
routing, &quot;S&quot; to subtractive routing or
&quot;T&quot; for table routing. Then comes the negotiated
physical link rate which is either &quot;disabled&quot;,
&quot;reset prob- lem&quot; or &quot;spinup hold&quot;.
Other states are mapped to &quot;attached&quot;. This
includes enabled phys with nothing connected which appear as
&quot;attached:[0000000000000000:00]&quot;.</p>

<p>Information shown between the brackets is for the
attached device. Phys that are connected display something
like: &quot;attached:[5000c50000520a2a:01 &quot; where the
first number is the attached SAS address (in hex) and the
second number is the attached devices phy identifier. If the
attached device type is other than an end device then one of
these abbreviations is output: &quot;exp&quot; (for
expander), &quot;fex&quot; (for fanout expander) or
&quot;res&quot; (for unknown attached device type). If a phy
is flagged as &quot;virtual&quot; then the letter
&quot;V&quot; appears next. Next are the protocols supported
by the attached device which are shown as
&quot;i(&lt;list&gt;)&quot; for initiator protocols and/or
&quot;t(&lt;list&gt;)&quot; for target pro- tocols. The
&lt;list&gt; is made up of &quot;PORT_SEL&quot;,
&quot;SSP&quot;, &quot;STP&quot;, &quot;SMP&quot; and
&quot;SATA&quot; with &quot;+&quot; used as a separator. For
example a SAS host adapter wi11 most likely appear as:
&quot;i(SSP+STP+SMP)&quot;. This completes the infor- mation
about the attached phy, hence the closing right bracket.</p>

<p>Finally, if appropriate, the negotiated physical link
rate is shown in gigabits per second. Here is an example of
a line for expander phy identifier 11 connected to a SATA
target (or SATA &quot;device&quot; to use the t13.org
term):</p>

<p>phy 11:T:attached:[500605b000000afb:00 t(SATA)] 1.5
Gbps</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The SMP DISCOVER function was introduced
in SAS-1, with small additions in SAS-1.1 . There have been
a large number of additions in SAS-2 .</p>
