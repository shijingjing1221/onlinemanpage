<p>NAME skb_copy_expand - copy and expand sk_buff</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct sk_buff * skb_copy_expand(const struct
sk_buff * skb, int newheadroom, int newtailroom, gfp_t
gfp_mask);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS skb buffer to copy</p>

<p>newheadroom new free bytes at head</p>

<p>newtailroom new free bytes at tail</p>

<p>gfp_mask allocation priority</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Make a copy of both an sk_buff and its data
and while doing so allocate additional space.</p>

<p>This is used when the caller wishes to modify the data
and needs a private copy of the data to alter as well as
more space for new fields. Returns NULL on failure or the
pointer to the buffer on success. The returned buffer has a
reference count of 1.</p>

<p>You must pass GFP_ATOMIC as the allocation priority if
this function is called from an interrupt.</p>
