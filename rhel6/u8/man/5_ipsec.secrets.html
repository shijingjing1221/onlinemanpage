<p>NAME ipsec.secrets - secrets for IKE/IPsec
authentication</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file ipsec.secrets contains a list of
secrets. Currently supported secrets are preshared secrets
(PSKs), RSA keys and XAUTH passwords. These secrets are used
by pluto(8) , the Libreswan Internet Key Exchange daemon, to
authenticate other hosts.</p>

<p>RSA private keys are stored in the NSS database. The
secrets file only contains a reference to these private RSA
keys. For RSA keys belonging to imported X.509 certificates,
the certificate &quot;friendly name&quot; is used. For raw
RSA keys, the CKAID is used.</p>

<p>XAUTH passwords are stored in plaintext in this file.
The secrets file should be owned by root, and permissions
should be set to block all access by others. (eg: chmod
600)</p>

<p>The file is a sequence of entries and include
directives. Here is an example - each entry or directive
must start at the left margin, but if it continues beyond a
single line, each continuation line must be indented.</p>

<p># XAUTH password, used with leftxauthusername=username
@username : XAUTH &quot;password&quot;</p>

<p>include ipsec.*.secrets # get secrets from other
files</p>

<p>Each entry in the file is a list of indices, followed by
a secret. The two parts are separated by a colon (:) that is
followed by whitespace or a newline.</p>

<p>An index is an IP address, or a Fully Qualified Domain
Name, user@FQDN, %any or %any6 (other kinds may come). An IP
address may be written in the familiar dotted quad form or
as a domain name to be looked up when the file is loaded (or
in any of the forms supported by the Libreswan
ipsec_ttoaddr(3) routine). Be aware that using domain names
requires DNS to be functional before the IPsec tunnel comes
up. To denote a Fully Qualified Domain Name (as opposed to
an IP address denoted by its domain name), precede the name
with an at sign (@).</p>

<p>Matching IDs with indices is fairly straightforward:
they have to be equal. In the case of a Road Warrior
connection, if an equal match is not found for the
Peer&acute;s ID, and it is in the form of an IP address, an
index of %any will match the peer&acute;s IP address if IPV4
and %any6 will match a the peer&acute;s IP address if
IPV6.</p>

<p>This file is only read at startup time. If any changes
are made to this file, the pluto daemon should be told to
re-read this file using the command ipsec secrets or ipsec
auto --rereadsecrets. Note that currently there is no way to
add a specific new entry - it&acute;s all or nothing.</p>

<p>Smartcard support has been moved from Libreswan to NSS.
Please see the NSS documentation on how to configure
smartcards.</p>

<p>An additional complexity arises in the case of
authentication by preshared secret: the responder will need
to look up the secret before the Peer&acute;s ID payload has
been decoded, so the ID used will be the IP address.</p>

<p>To authenticate a connection between two hosts, the
entry that most specifically matches the host and peer IDs
is used. An entry with no index will match any host and
peer. More specifically, an entry with one index will match
a host and peer if the index matches the host&acute;s ID
(the peer isn&acute;t considered). Still more specifically,
an entry with multiple indices will match a host and peer if
the host ID and peer ID each match one of the indices. If
the key is for an asymmetric authentication technique (i.e.
a public key system such as RSA), an entry with multiple
indices will match a host and peer even if only the host ID
matches an index (it is presumed that the multiple indices
are all identities of the host). It is acceptable for two
entries to be the best match as long as they agree about the
secret or private key.</p>

<p>Authentication by preshared secret requires that both
systems find the identical secret (the secret is not
actually transmitted by the IKE protocol). If both the host
and peer appear in the index list, the same entry will be
suitable for both systems so verbatim copying between
systems can be used. This naturally extends to larger groups
sharing the same secret. Thus multiple-index entries are
best for PSK authentication.</p>

<p>Authentication by raw RSA Signatures requires that each
host have its own private key. A host could reasonably use a
different private keys for different interfaces and for
different peers. But it would not be normal to share entries
between systems. Thus no-index and one-index forms of entry
often make sense for RSA Signature authentication.</p>

<p>The key part of an entry may start with a token
indicating the kind of key. RSA signifies RSA private key
and PSK signifies PreShared Key (case is ignored).</p>

<p>The token XAUTH indicates a eXtended Authentication
password. There should be one indice, and it should be in
the @FQDN format. The file will be searched with the XAUTH
username, which is usually provided in the configuration
file. XAUTH is otherwise identical to PSK in syntax.</p>

<p>A preshared secret is most conveniently represented as a
sequence of characters, delimited by the double-quote
character (&quot;). The sequence cannot contain a newline or
double-quote. Strictly speaking, the secret is actually the
sequence of bytes that is used in the file to represent the
sequence of characters (excluding the delimiters). A
preshared secret may also be represented, without quotes, in
any form supported by ipsec_ttodata(3).</p>

<p>A raw RSA private key is a composite of eight generally
large numbers. The notation used is a brace-enclosed list of
field name and value pairs (see the example above). A
suitable key, in a suitable format, may be generated by
ipsec_rsasigkey(8). The structure is very similar to that
used by BIND 8.2.2 or later, but note that the numbers must
have a 0s prefix if they are in base 64. The order of the
fields is fixed. Note that most fields are now unused and
filled in with the CKAID, which is a reference to the
location within the NSS database.</p>

<p>The first token of an entry must start in the first
column of its line. Subsequent tokens must be separated by
whitespace, except for a colon token, which only needs to be
followed by whitespace. A newline is taken as whitespace,
but every line of an entry after the first must be
indented.</p>

<p>Whitespace at the end of a line is ignored (except in
the 0t notation for a key). At the start of line or after
whitespace, # and the following text up to the end of the
line is treated as a comment. Within entries, all lines must
be indented (except for lines with no tokens). Outside
entries, no line may be indented (this is to make sure that
the file layout reflects its structure).</p>

<p>An include directive causes the contents of the named
file to be processed before continuing with the current
file. The filename is subject to globbing as in sh(1), so
every file with a matching name is processed. Includes may
be nested to a modest depth (10, currently). If the filename
doesn&acute;t start with a /, the directory containing the
current file is prepended to the name. The include directive
is a line that starts with the word include, followed by
whitespace, followed by the filename (which must not contain
whitespace).</p>

<p>HISTORY Originally designed for the FreeS/WAN project
&lt;http://www.freeswan.org&gt; by D. Hugh Redelmeier.
Updated for Openswan by Ken Bantoft. Updated for Libreswan
by Paul Wouters</p>

<p>This file originally stored the private part of RSA
keys. All private key material is now stored in the NSS
database. The fields of the raw RSA key currently filled
with the CKAID might be ignored and removed in future
versions.</p>

<p>BUGS If an ID is 0.0.0.0, it will match %any; if it is
0::0, it will match %any6.</p>
