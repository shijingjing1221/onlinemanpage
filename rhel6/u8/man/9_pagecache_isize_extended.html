<p>NAME pagecache_isize_extended - update pagecache after
extension of i_size</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void pagecache_isize_extended(struct inode *
inode, loff_t from, loff_t to);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS inode inode for which i_size was extended</p>

<p>from original inode size</p>

<p>to new inode size</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Handle extension of inode size either caused
by extending truncate or by write starting after current
i_size. We mark the page straddling current i_size RO so
that page_mkwrite is called on the nearest write access to
the page. This way filesystem can be sure that page_mkwrite
is called on the page before user writes to the page via
mmap after the i_size has been changed.</p>

<p>The function must be called after i_size is updated so
that page fault coming after we unlock the page will already
see the new i_size. The function must be called while we
still hold i_mutex - this not only makes sure i_size is
stable but also that userspace cannot observe new i_size
value before we are prepared to store mmap writes at new
inode size.</p>
