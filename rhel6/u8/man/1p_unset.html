<p>UNSET(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UNSET(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME unset - unset values and attributes of variables
and functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS unset [-fv] name ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Each variable or function specified by name
shall be unset.</p>

<p>If -v is specified, name refers to a variable name and
the shell shall unset it and remove it from the environment.
Read-only variables cannot be unset.</p>

<p>If -f is specified, name refers to a function and the
shell shall unset the function definition.</p>

<p>If neither -f nor -v is specified, name refers to a
variable; if a variable by that name does not exist, it is
unspecified whether a func- tion by that name, if any, shall
be unset.</p>

<p>Unsetting a variable or function that was not previously
set shall not be considered an error and does not cause the
shell to abort.</p>

<p>The unset special built-in shall support the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>Note that:</p>

<p>VARIABLE=</p>

<p>is not equivalent to an unset of VARIABLE; in the
example, VARIABLE is set to &quot;&quot; . Also, the
variables that can be unset should not be misin- terpreted
to include the special parameters (see Special Parameters
).</p>

<p>OPTIONS See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>OPERANDS See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES None.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 All name operands were successfully
unset.</p>

<p>&gt;0 At least one name could not be unset.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Unset VISUAL variable:</p>

<p>unset -v VISUAL</p>

<p>Unset the functions foo and bar:</p>

<p>unset -f foo bar</p>

<p>RATIONALE Consideration was given to omitting the -f
option in favor of an unfunction utility, but the standard
developers decided to retain his- torical practice.</p>

<p>The -v option was introduced because System V
historically used one name space for both variables and
functions. When unset is used without options, System V
historically unset either a function or a variable, and
there was no confusion about which one was intended. A
portable POSIX application can use unset without an option
to unset a variable, but not a function; the -f option must
be used.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
