<p>htdig(1) htdig(1)</p>

<p>NAME htstat - returns statistics on the document and
word databases, much like the -s option to htdig or
htmerge.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS htstat [-v][-a][-c configfile][-u]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Htdig retrieves HTML documents using the
HTTP protocol and gathers information from these documents
which can later be used to search these documents. This
program can be referred to as the search robot.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Use alternate work files. Tells htstat to
append .work to database files, causing a second copy of the
database to be built. This allows the original files to be
used by htsearch during the run.</p>

<p>-c configfile Use the specified configfile instead of
the default.</p>

<p>-u Give a list of URLs in the document database.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode. This increases the verbosity of the
program. Using more than 2 is probably only useful for
debugging pur- poses. The default verbose mode (using only
one -v) gives a nice progress report while digging.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/htdig/htdig.conf The default configuration
file.</p>

htdig-doc package) /usr/share/doc/htdig-doc/html/index.html

commands.</p>
