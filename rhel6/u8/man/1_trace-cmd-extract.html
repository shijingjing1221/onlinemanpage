<p>TRACE-CMD-EXTRACT(1) [FIXME: manual]
TRACE-CMD-EXTRACT(1)</p>

<p>NAME trace-cmd-extract - extract out the data from the
Ftrace Linux tracer.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS trace-cmd extract [OPTIONS]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The trace-cmd(1) extract is usually used
after trace-cmd-start(1) and trace-cmd-stop(1). It can be
used after the Ftrace tracer has been started manually
through the Ftrace pseudo file system.</p>

<p>The extract command creates a trace.dat file that can be
used by trace-cmd-report(1) to read from. It reads the
kernel internal ring buffer to produce the trace.dat
file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p plugin Although extract does not start any
traces, some of the plugins require just reading the output
in ASCII format. These are the latency tracers, since the
latency tracers have a separate internal buffer. The plugin
option is therefore only necessary for the wakeup,
wakeup-rt, irqsoff, preemptoff and preemptirqsoff
plugins.</p>

<p>With out this option, the extract command will extract
from the internal Ftrace buffers.</p>

<p>-O option If a latency tracer is being extracted, and
the -p option is used, then there are some Ftrace options
that can change the format. This will update those options
before extracting. To see the list of options see
trace-cmd-list. To enable an option, write its name, to
disable the option append the characters no to it. For
example: noprint-parent will disable the print-parent option
that prints the parent function in printing a function
event.</p>

<p>-o outputfile By default, the extract command will
create a trace.dat file. This option will change where the
file is written to.</p>

<p>--date This is the same as the trace-cmd-record(1)
--date option, but it does cause the extract routine to
disable all tracing. That is, the end of the extract will
perform something similar to trace-cmd-reset(1).</p>
