<p>PERLFAQ2(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLFAQ2(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlfaq2 - Obtaining and Learning about Perl</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This section of the FAQ answers questions
about where to find source and documentation for Perl,
support, and related matters.</p>

<p>What machines support perl? Where do I get it? The
standard release of perl (the one maintained by the perl
development team) is distributed only in source code form.
You can find the latest releases at
http://www.cpan.org/src/README.html .</p>

<p>Perl builds and runs on a bewildering number of
platforms. Virtually all known and current Unix derivatives
are supported (perl s native platform), as are other systems
like VMS, DOS, OS/2, Windows, QNX, BeOS, OS X, MPE/iX and
the Amiga.</p>

<p>Binary distributions for some proprietary platforms can
be found http://www.cpan.org/ports/ directory. Because these
are not part of the standard distribution, they may and in
fact do differ from the base perl port in a variety of ways.
Youll have to check their respective release notes to see
just what the differences are. These differences can be
either positive (e.g. extensions for the features of the
particular platform that are not supported in the source
release of perl) or negative (e.g. might be based upon a
less current source release of perl).</p>

<p>How can I get a binary version of perl? (contributed by
brian d foy)</p>

<p>ActiveState: Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, AIX and
HP-UX</p>

<p>http://www.activestate.com/</p>

<p>Sunfreeware.com: Solaris 2.5 to Solaris 10 (SPARC and
x86)</p>

<p>http://www.sunfreeware.com/</p>

<p>Strawberry Perl: Windows, Perl 5.8.8 and 5.10.0</p>

<p>http://www.strawberryperl.com</p>

<p>IndigoPerl: Windows</p>

<p>http://indigostar.com/</p>

<p>I dot have a C compiler. How can I build my own Perl
interpreter? Since you don t have a C compiler, youre doomed
and your vendor should be sacrificed to the Sun gods. But
that doesnt help you.</p>

<p>What you need to do is get a binary version of gcc for
your system first. Consult the Usenet FAQs for your
operating system for information on where to get such a
binary version.</p>

<p>You might look around the net for a pre-built binary of
Perl (or a C compiler!) that meets your needs, though:</p>

<p>For Windows, Vanilla Perl ( http://vanillaperl.com/ )
and Strawberry Perl ( http://strawberryperl.com/ ) come with
a bundled C compiler. ActivePerl is a pre-compiled version
of Perl ready-to-use.</p>

<p>For Sun systems, SunFreeware.com provides binaries of
most popular applications, including compilers and Perl.</p>

<p>I copied the perl binary from one machine to another,
but scripts dot work. That s probably because you forgot
libraries, or library paths differ. You really should build
the whole distribution on the machine it will eventually
live on, and then type &quot;make install&quot;. Most other
approaches are doomed to failure.</p>

<p>One simple way to check that things are in the right
place is to print out the hard-coded @INC that perl looks
through for libraries:</p>

<p>% perl -le &rsquo;print for @INC&rsquo;</p>

<p>If this command lists any paths that dont exist on your
system, then you may need to move the appropriate libraries
to these locations, or create symbolic links, aliases, or
shortcuts appropriately. @INC is also printed as part of the
output of</p>

<p>% perl -V</p>

<p>You might also want to check out &quot;How do I keep my
own module/library directory?&quot; in perlfaq8.</p>

<p>I grabbed the sources and tried to compile but
gdbm/dynamic loading/malloc/linking/... failed. How do I
make it work? Read the INSTALL file, which is part of the
source distribution. It describes in detail how to cope with
most idiosyncrasies that the Configure script cant work
around for any given system or architecture.</p>

<p>What modules and extensions are available for Perl? What
is CPAN? What does CPAN/src/... mean? CPAN stands for
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a multi-gigabyte archive
replicated on hundreds of machines all over the world. CPAN
contains source code, non-native ports, documentation,
scripts, and many third-party modules and extensions,
designed for everything from commercial database interfaces
to keyboard/screen control to web walking and CGI scripts.
The master web site for CPAN is http://www.cpan.org/ and
there is the CPAN Multiplexer at
http://www.cpan.org/CPAN.html which will choose a mirror
near you via DNS. See http://www.perl.com/CPAN (without a
slash at the end) for how this process works. Also,
http://mirror.cpan.org/ has a nice interface to the
http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY mirror directory.</p>

<p>See the CPAN FAQ at
http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html for answers to the
most frequently asked questions about CPAN including how to
become a mirror.</p>

<p>CPAN/path/... is a naming convention for files available
on CPAN sites. CPAN indicates the base directory of a CPAN
mirror, and the rest of the path is the path from that
directory to the file. For instance, if you re using
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN as your CPAN
site, the file CPAN/misc/japh is downloadable as
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/misc/japh .</p>

<p>Considering that, as of 2006, there are over ten
thousand existing modules in the archive, one probably
exists to do nearly anything you can think of. Current
categories under CPAN/modules/by-category/ include Perl core
modules; development support; operating system interfaces;
networking, devices, and interprocess communication; data
type utilities; database interfaces; user interfaces;
interfaces to other languages; filenames, file systems, and
file locking; internationalization and locale; world wide
web support; server and daemon utilities; archiving and
compression; image manipulation; mail and news; control flow
utilities; filehandle and I/O; Microsoft Windows modules;
and miscellaneous modules.</p>

<p>See http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html or
http://search.cpan.org/ for a more complete list of modules
by category.</p>

<p>CPAN is a free service and is not affiliated with
OReilly Media.</p>

<p>Is there an ISO or ANSI certified version of Perl?
Certainly not. Larry expects that he ll be certified before
Perl is.</p>

<p>Where can I get information on Perl? The complete Perl
documentation is available with the Perl distribution. If
you have Perl installed locally, you probably have the
documentation installed as well: type &quot;man perl&quot;
if youre on a system resembling Unix. This will lead you to
other important man pages, including how to set your
$MANPATH. If youre not on a Unix system, access to the
documentation will be different; for example, documentation
might only be in HTML format. All proper perl installations
have fully-accessible documentation.</p>

<p>You might also try &quot;perldoc perl&quot; in case your
system doesnt have a proper man command, or its been
misinstalled. If that doesnt work, try looking in
/usr/local/lib/perl5/pod for documentation.</p>

<p>If all else fails, consult http://perldoc.perl.org/
which has the complete documentation in HTML and PDF
format.</p>

<p>Many good books have been written about Perl--see the
section later in perlfaq2 for more details.</p>

<p>Tutorial documents are included in current or upcoming
Perl releases include perltoot for objects or perlboot for a
beginner s approach to objects, perlopentut for file opening
semantics, perlreftut for managing references, perlretut for
regular expressions, perlthrtut for threads, perldebtut for
debugging, and perlxstut for linking C and Perl together.
There may be more by the time you read this. These URLs
might also be useful:</p>

<p>http://perldoc.perl.org/
http://bookmarks.cpan.org/search.cgi?cat=Training%2FTutorials</p>

<p>What are the Perl newsgroups on Usenet? Where do I post
questions? Several groups devoted to the Perl language are
on Usenet:</p>

<p>comp.lang.perl.announce Moderated announcement group
comp.lang.perl.misc High traffic general Perl discussion
comp.lang.perl.moderated Moderated discussion group
comp.lang.perl.modules Use and development of Perl modules
comp.lang.perl.tk Using Tk (and X) from Perl</p>

<p>Some years ago, comp.lang.perl was divided into those
groups, and comp.lang.perl itself officially removed. While
that group may still be found on some news servers, it is
unwise to use it, because postings there will not appear on
news servers which honour the official list of group names.
Use comp.lang.perl.misc for topics which do not have a
more-appropriate specific group.</p>

<p>There is also a Usenet gateway to Perl mailing lists
sponsored by perl.org at nntp://nntp.perl.org , a web
interface to the same lists at http://nntp.perl.org/group/
and these lists are also available under the
&quot;perl.*&quot; hierarchy at http://groups.google.com .
Other groups are listed at http://lists.perl.org/ ( also
known as http://lists.cpan.org/ ).</p>

<p>A nice place to ask questions is the PerlMonks site,
http://www.perlmonks.org/ , or the Perl Beginners mailing
list http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=beginners .</p>

<p>Note that none of the above are supposed to write your
code for you: asking questions about particular problems or
general advice is fine, but asking someone to write your
code for free is not very cool.</p>

<p>Where should I post source code? You should post source
code to whichever group is most appropriate, but feel free
to cross-post to comp.lang.perl.misc. If you want to cross-
post to alt.sources, please make sure it follows their
posting standards, including setting the Followup-To header
line to NOT include alt.sources; see their FAQ (
http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-sources-intro/ ) for
details.</p>

<p>If youre just looking for software, first use Google (
http://www.google.com ), Googles usenet search interface (
http://groups.google.com ), and CPAN Search (
http://search.cpan.org ). This is faster and more productive
than just posting a request.</p>

<p>Perl Books A number of books on Perl and/or CGI
programming are available. A few of these are good, some are
OK, but many arent worth your money. There is a list of
these books, some with extensive reviews, at
http://books.perl.org/ . If you dont see your book listed
here, you can write to perlfaq-workers@perl.org .</p>

<p>The incontestably definitive reference book on Perl,
written by the creator of Perl, is Programming Perl:</p>

<p>Programming Perl (the &quot;Camel Book&quot;): by Larry
Wall, Tom Christiansen, and Jon Orwant ISBN 0-596-00027-8
[3rd edition July 2000]
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pperl3/ (English,
translations to several languages are also available)</p>

<p>The companion volume to the Camel containing thousands
of real-world examples, mini-tutorials, and complete
programs is:</p>

<p>The Perl Cookbook (the &quot;Ram Book&quot;): by Tom
Christiansen and Nathan Torkington, with Foreword by Larry
Wall ISBN 0-596-00313-7 [2nd Edition August 2003]
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlckbk2/</p>

<p>If youre already a seasoned programmer, then the Camel
Book might suffice for you to learn Perl. If youre not,
check out the Llama book:</p>

<p>Learning Perl by Randal L. Schwartz, Tom Phoenix, and
brian d foy ISBN 0-596-10105-8 [4th edition July 2005]
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/learnperl4/</p>

<p>And for more advanced information on writing larger
programs, presented in the same style as the Llama book,
continue your education with the Alpaca book:</p>

<p>Intermediate Perl (the &quot;Alpaca Book&quot;) by
Randal L. Schwartz and brian d foy, with Tom Phoenix
(foreword by Damian Conway) ISBN 0-596-10206-2 [1st edition
March 2006] http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lrnperlorm/</p>

<p>Addison-Wesley ( http://www.awlonline.com/ ) and Manning
( http://www.manning.com/ ) are also publishers of some fine
Perl books such as Object Oriented Programming with Perl by
Damian Conway and Network Programming with Perl by Lincoln
Stein.</p>

<p>An excellent technical book discounter is Bookpool at
http://www.bookpool.com/ where a 30% discount or more is not
unusual.</p>

<p>What follows is a list of the books that the FAQ authors
found personally useful. Your mileage may (but, we hope,
probably wont) vary.</p>

<p>Recommended books on (or mostly on) Perl follow.</p>

<p>Which magazines have Perl content? The Perl Review (
http://www.theperlreview.com ) focuses on Perl almost
completely (although it sometimes sneaks in an article about
another language). There s also $foo Magazin, a german
magazine dedicated to Perl, at ( http://www.foo-magazin.de
).</p>

<p>Magazines that frequently carry quality articles on Perl
include The Perl Review ( http://www.theperlreview.com ),
Unix Review ( http://www.unixreview.com/ ), Linux Magazine (
http://www.linuxmagazine.com/ ), and Usenix s
newsletter/magazine to its members, login: (
http://www.usenix.org/ )</p>

<p>The Perl columns of Randal L. Schwartz are available on
the web at http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/WebTechniques/ ,
http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/ , and
http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/ .</p>

<p>The first (and for a long time, only) periodical devoted
to All Things Perl, The Perl Journal contains tutorials,
demonstrations, case studies, announcements, contests, and
much more. TPJ has columns on web development, databases,
Win32 Perl, graphical programming, regular expressions, and
networking, and sponsors the Obfuscated Perl Contest and the
Perl Poetry Contests. Beginning in November 2002, TPJ moved
to a reader-supported monthly e-zine format in which
subscribers can download issues as PDF documents. In 2006,
TPJ merged with Dr. Dobbs Journal (online edition). To read
old TPJ articles, see http://www.ddj.com/ .</p>

<p>What mailing lists are there for Perl? Most of the major
modules (Tk, CGI, libwww-perl) have their own mailing lists.
Consult the documentation that came with the module for
subscription information.</p>

<p>A comprehensive list of Perl related mailing lists can
be found at:</p>

<p>http://lists.perl.org/</p>

<p>Where are the archives for comp.lang.perl.misc? The
Google search engine now carries archived and searchable
newsgroup content.</p>


<p>http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/topics</p>

<p>If you have a question, you can be sure someone has
already asked the same question at some point on c.l.p.m. It
requires some time and patience to sift through all the
content but often you will find the answer you seek.</p>

<p>Where can I buy a commercial version of perl? In a real
sense, perl already is commercial software: it has a license
that you can grab and carefully read to your manager. It is
distributed in releases and comes in well-defined packages.
There is a very large user community and an extensive
literature. The comp.lang.perl.* newsgroups and several of
the mailing lists provide free answers to your questions in
near real-time. Perl has traditionally been supported by
Larry, scores of software designers and developers, and
myriad programmers, all working for free to create a useful
thing to make life better for everyone.</p>

<p>However, these answers may not suffice for managers who
require a purchase order from a company whom they can sue
should anything go awry. Or maybe they need very serious
hand-holding and contractual obligations. Shrink-wrapped CDs
with perl on them are available from several sources if that
will help. For example, many Perl books include a
distribution of perl, as do the O Reilly Perl Resource Kits
(in both the Unix flavor and in the proprietary Microsoft
flavor); the free Unix distributions also all come with
perl.</p>

<p>Where do I send bug reports? (contributed by brian d
foy)</p>

<p>First, ensure that youve found an actual bug. Second,
ensure youve found an actual bug.</p>

<p>If you ve found a bug with the perl interpreter or one
of the modules in the standard library (those that come with
Perl), you can use the &quot;perlbug&quot; utility that
comes with Perl (&gt;= 5.004). It collects information about
your installation to include with your message, then sends
the message to the right place.</p>

<p>To determine if a module came with your version of Perl,
you can use the &quot;Module::CoreList&quot; module. It has
the information about the modules (with their versions)
included with each release of Perl.</p>

<p>Every CPAN module has a bug tracker set up in RT,
http://rt.cpan.org . You can submit bugs to RT either
through its web interface or by email. To email a bug
report, send it to bug-&lt;distribution-name&gt;@rt.cpan.org
. For example, if you wanted to report a bug in
&quot;Business::ISBN&quot;, you could send a message to
bug-Business-ISBN@rt.cpan.org .</p>

<p>Some modules might have special reporting requirements,
such as a Sourceforge or Google Code tracking system, so you
should check the module documentation too.</p>

<p>What is perl.com? Perl Mongers? pm.org? perl.org?
cpan.org? Perl.com at http://www.perl.com/ is part of the O
Reilly Network, a subsidiary of OReilly Media.</p>

<p>The Perl Foundation is an advocacy organization for the
Perl language which maintains the web site
http://www.perl.org/ as a general advocacy site for the Perl
language. It uses the domain to provide general support
services to the Perl community, including the hosting of
mailing lists, web sites, and other services. There are also
many other sub-domains for special topics like learning
Perl, Perl news, jobs in Perl, such as:</p>

<p>http://learn.perl.org/ http://use.perl.org/
http://jobs.perl.org/ http://lists.perl.org/</p>

<p>Perl Mongers uses the pm.org domain for services related
to Perl user groups, including the hosting of mailing lists
and web sites. See the Perl user group web site at
http://www.pm.org/ for more information about joining,
starting, or requesting services for a Perl user group.</p>

<p>http://www.cpan.org/ is the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network, a replicated worldwide repository of Perl software,
see the What is CPAN? question earlier in this document.</p>
