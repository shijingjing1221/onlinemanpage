<p>tk(n) Tk Built-In Commands tk(n)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME tk - Manipulate Tk internal state</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tk option ?arg arg ...?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tk command provides access to
miscellaneous elements of Tks inter- nal state. Most of the
information manipulated by this command per- tains to the
application as a whole, or to a screen or display, rather
than to a particular window. The command can take any of a
number of different forms depending on the option argument.
The legal forms are:</p>

<p>tk appname ?newName? If newName is not specified, this
command returns the name of the application (the name that
may be used in send commands to communicate with the
application). If newName is specified, then the name of the
application is changed to newName. If the given name is
already in use, then a suffix of the form #2 or #3 is
appended in order to make the name unique. The com- mands
result is the name actually chosen. newName should not start
with a capital letter. This will interfere with option
processing, since names starting with capitals are assumed
to be classes; as a result, Tk may not be able to find some
options for the application. If sends have been disabled by
deleting the send command, this command will reenable them
and recreate the send command.</p>

<p>tk caret window ?-x x? ?-y y? ?-height height? Sets and
queries the caret location for the display of the spec-
ified Tk window window. The caret is the per-display cursor
location used for indicating global focus (e.g. to comply
with Microsoft Accessibility guidelines), as well as for
location of the over-the-spot XIM (X Input Methods) or
Windows IME windows. If no options are specified, the last
values used for setting the caret are return in option-value
pair format. -x and -y represent window-relative
coordinates, and -height is the height of the current cursor
location, or the height of the specified window if none is
given.</p>

<p>tk scaling ?-displayof window? ?number? Sets and queries
the current scaling factor used by Tk to con- vert between
physical units (for example, points, inches, or millimeters)
and pixels. The number argument is a floating point number
that specifies the number of pixels per point on window s
display. If the window argument is omitted, it defaults to
the main window. If the number argument is omitted, the
current value of the scaling factor is returned.</p>

<p>A point is a unit of measurement equal to 1/72 inch. A
scal- ing factor of 1.0 corresponds to 1 pixel per point,
which is equivalent to a standard 72 dpi monitor. A scaling
factor of 1.25 would mean 1.25 pixels per point, which is
the setting for a 90 dpi monitor; setting the scaling factor
to 1.25 on a 72 dpi monitor would cause everything in the
application to be dis- played 1.25 times as large as normal.
The initial value for the scaling factor is set when the
application starts, based on properties of the installed
monitor, but it can be changed at any time. Measurements
made after the scaling factor is changed will use the new
scaling factor, but it is undefined whether existing widgets
will resize themselves dynamically to accommo- date the new
scaling factor.</p>

<p>tk inactive ?-displayof window? ?reset? Returns a
positive integer, the number of milliseconds since the last
time the user interacted with the system. If the -displayof
option is given then the return value refers to the display
of window; otherwise it refers to the display of the
applications main window.</p>

<p>tk inactive will return -1, if querying the user
inactive time is not supported by the system, and in safe
interpreters.</p>

<p>If the literal string reset is given as an additional
argument, the timer is reset and an empty string is
returned. Resetting the inactivity time is forbidden in safe
interpreters and will throw and error if tried.</p>

<p>tk useinputmethods ?-displayof window? ?boolean? Sets
and queries the state of whether Tk should use XIM (X Input
Methods) for filtering events. The resulting state is
returned. XIM is used in some locales (i.e., Japanese,
Korean), to handle special input devices. This feature is
only significant on X. If XIM support is not available, this
will always return 0. If the window argument is omitted, it
defaults to the main window. If the boolean argument is
omitted, the current state is returned. This is turned on by
default for the main display.</p>

<p>tk windowingsystem Returns the current Tk windowing
system, one of x11 (X11-based), win32 (MS Windows), or aqua
(Mac OS X Aqua).</p>
