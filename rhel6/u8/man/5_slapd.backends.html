<p>NAME slapd.backends - backends for slapd, the
stand-alone LDAP daemon</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The slapd(8) daemon can use a variety of
different backends for serving LDAP requests. Backends may
be compiled statically into slapd, or when module support is
enabled, they may be dynamically loaded. Multiple instances
of a backend can be configured, to serve separate databases
from the same slapd server.</p>

<p>Configuration options for each backend are documented
separately in the corresponding slapd-&lt;backend&gt;(5)
manual pages.</p>

<p>bdb This was the recommended primary backend through
OpenLDAP 2.3, but it has since been superseded by the hdb
backend. It takes care to configure it properly. It uses the
transactional database interface of the Oracle Berkeley DB
(BDB) package to store data.</p>

<p>config This backend is used to manage the configuration
of slapd at run-time. Unlike other backends, only a single
instance of the config backend may be defined. It also
instantiates itself auto- matically, so it is always present
even if not explicitly defined in the slapd.conf(5)
file.</p>

<p>dnssrv This backend is experimental. It serves up
referrals based upon SRV resource records held in the Domain
Name System.</p>

<p>hdb This is the recommended primary backend for a normal
slapd database. hdb is a variant of the bdb backend that
uses a hier- archical database layout. This layout stores
entry DNs more efficiently than the bdb backend, using less
space and requiring less work to create, delete, and rename
entries. It is also one of the few backends to support
subtree renames.</p>

<p>ldap This backend acts as a proxy to forward incoming
requests to another LDAP server.</p>

<p>ldif This database uses the filesystem to build the tree
structure of the database, using plain ascii files to store
data. Its usage should be limited to very simple databases,
where performance is not a requirement. This backend also
supports subtree renames.</p>

<p>mdb This will soon be the recommended primary backend,
superseding hdb. This backend uses OpenLDAPs own MDB
transactional database library. It is extremely compact and
extremely effi- cient, delivering much higher performance
than the Berkeley DB backends while using significantly less
memory. Also, unlike Berkeley DB, MDB is crash proof, and
requires no special tuning or maintenance. This backend also
supports subtree renames.</p>

<p>meta This backend performs basic LDAP proxying with
respect to a set of remote LDAP servers. It is an
enhancement of the ldap back- end.</p>

<p>monitor This backend provides information about the
running status of the slapd daemon. Only a single instance
of the monitor backend may be defined.</p>

<p>ndb This backend is experimental. It uses the
transactional database interface of the MySQL Cluster Engine
(NDB) to store data. Note that Oracle, which now owns MySQL,
has withdrawn sup- port for NDB and this backend is unlikely
to be developed any further.</p>

<p>null Operations in this backend succeed but do
nothing.</p>

<p>passwd This backend is provided for demonstration
purposes only. It serves up user account information from
the system passwd(5) file.</p>

<p>perl This backend embeds a perl(1) interpreter into
slapd. It runs Perl subroutines to implement LDAP
operations.</p>

<p>relay This backend is experimental. It redirects LDAP
operations to another database in the same server, based on
the naming context of the request. Its use requires the rwm
overlay (see slapo-rwm(5) for details) to rewrite the naming
context of the request. It is primarily intended to
implement virtual views on databases that actually store
data.</p>

<p>shell This backend executes external programs to
implement LDAP opera- tions. It is primarily intended to be
used in prototypes.</p>

<p>sql This backend is experimental. It services LDAP
requests from an SQL database.</p>
