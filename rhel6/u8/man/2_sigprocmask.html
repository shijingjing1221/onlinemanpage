<p>SIGPROCMASK(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SIGPROCMASK(2)</p>

<p>NAME sigprocmask - examine and change blocked
signals</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sigprocmask(int how, const sigset_t *set, sigset_t
*oldset);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>sigprocmask(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE
|| _POSIX_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sigprocmask() is used to fetch and/or change
the signal mask of the calling thread. The signal mask is
the set of signals whose delivery is currently blocked for
the caller (see also signal(7) for more details).</p>

<p>The behavior of the call is dependent on the value of
how, as follows.</p>

<p>SIG_BLOCK The set of blocked signals is the union of the
current set and the set argument.</p>

<p>SIG_UNBLOCK The signals in set are removed from the
current set of blocked signals. It is permissible to attempt
to unblock a signal which is not blocked.</p>

<p>SIG_SETMASK The set of blocked signals is set to the
argument set.</p>

<p>If oldset is non-null, the previous value of the signal
mask is stored in oldset.</p>

<p>If set is NULL, then the signal mask is unchanged (i.e.,
how is ignored), but the current value of the signal mask is
nevertheless returned in oldset (if it is not NULL).</p>

<p>The use of sigprocmask() is unspecified in a
multithreaded process; see pthread_sigmask(3).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE sigprocmask() returns 0 on success and -1
on error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL The value specified in how was
invalid.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES It is not possible to block SIGKILL or SIGSTOP.
Attempts to do so are silently ignored.</p>

<p>Each of the threads in a process has its own signal
mask.</p>

<p>A child created via fork(2) inherits a copy of its
parents signal mask; the signal mask is preserved across
execve(2).</p>

<p>If SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, or SIGSEGV are generated
while they are blocked, the result is undefined, unless the
signal was generated by the kill(2), sigqueue(2), or
raise(3).</p>

<p>See sigsetops(3) for details on manipulating signal
sets.</p>
