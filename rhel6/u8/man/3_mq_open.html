<p>MQ_OPEN(3) Linux Programmer s Manual MQ_OPEN(3)</p>

<p>NAME mq_open - open a message queue</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt; /* For O_* constants
*/ #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt; /* For mode constants */
#include &lt;mqueue.h&gt;</p>

<p>mqd_t mq_open(const char *name, int oflag); mqd_t
mq_open(const char *name, int oflag, mode_t mode, struct
mq_attr *attr);</p>

<p>Link with -lrt.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mq_open() creates a new POSIX message queue
or opens an existing queue. The queue is identified by name.
For details of the construction of name, see
mq_overview(7).</p>

<p>The oflag argument specifies flags that control the
operation of the call. (Definitions of the flags values can
be obtained by including &lt;fcntl.h&gt;.) Exactly one of
the following must be specified in oflag:</p>

<p>O_RDONLY Open the queue to receive messages only.</p>

<p>O_WRONLY Open the queue to send messages only.</p>

<p>O_RDWR Open the queue to both send and receive
messages.</p>

<p>Zero or more of the following flags can additionally be
ORed in oflag:</p>

<p>O_NONBLOCK Open the queue in non-blocking mode. In
circumstances where mq_receive(3) and mq_send(3) would
normally block, these func- tions instead fail with the
error EAGAIN.</p>

<p>O_CREAT Create the message queue if it does not exist.
The owner (user ID) of the message queue is set to the
effective user ID of the calling process. The group
ownership (group ID) is set to the effective group ID of the
calling process.</p>

<p>O_EXCL If O_CREAT was specified in oflag, and a queue
with the given name already exists, then fail with the error
EEXIST.</p>

<p>If O_CREAT is specified in oflag, then two additional
arguments must be supplied. The mode argument specifies the
permissions to be placed on the new queue, as for open(2).
(Symbolic definitions for the permis- sions bits can be
obtained by including &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;.) The permissions
settings are masked against the process umask. The attr
argument spec- ifies attributes for the queue. See
mq_getattr(3) for details. If attr is NULL, then the queue
is created with implementation-defined default
attributes.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, mq_open() returns a message
queue descriptor for use by other message queue functions.
On error, mq_open() returns (mqd_t) -1, with errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES The queue exists, but the caller does not
have permission to open it in the specified mode.</p>

<p>EACCES name contained more than one slash.</p>

<p>EEXIST Both O_CREAT and O_EXCL were specified in oflag,
but a queue with this name already exists.</p>

<p>EINVAL O_CREAT was specified in oflag, and attr was not
NULL, but attr-&gt;mq_maxmsg or attr-&gt;mq_msqsize was
invalid. Both of these fields must be greater than zero. In
a process that is unprivi- leged (does not have the
CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability), attr-&gt;mq_maxmsg must be
less than or equal to the msg_max limit, and
attr-&gt;mq_msgsize must be less than or equal to the msg-
size_max limit. In addition, even in a privileged process,
attr-&gt;mq_maxmsg cannot exceed the HARD_MAX limit. (See
mq_overview(7) for details of these limits.)</p>

<p>EMFILE The process already has the maximum number of
files and message queues open.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG name was too long.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files and message queues has been reached.</p>

<p>ENOENT The O_CREAT flag was not specified in oflag, and
no queue with this name exists.</p>

<p>ENOENT name was just &quot;/&quot; followed by no other
characters.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory.</p>

<p>ENOSPC Insufficient space for the creation of a new
message queue. This probably occurred because the queues_max
limit was encoun- tered; see mq_overview(7).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>BUGS In kernels before 2.6.14, the process umask was not
applied to the per- missions specified in mode.</p>
