<p>DESCRIPTION mke2fs is used to create an ext2, ext3, or
ext4 filesystem, usually in a disk partition. device is the
special file corresponding to the device (e.g /dev/hdXX).
blocks-count is the number of blocks on the device. If
omitted, mke2fs automagically figures the file system size.
If called as mkfs.ext3 a journal is created as if the -j
option was specified.</p>

<p>The defaults of the parameters for the newly created
filesystem, if not overridden by the options listed below,
are controlled by the /etc/mke2fs.conf configuration file.
See the mke2fs.conf(5) manual page for more details.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b block-size Specify the size of blocks in
bytes. Valid block-size values are 1024, 2048 and 4096 bytes
per block. If omitted, block-size is heuristically
determined by the filesystem size and the expected usage of
the filesystem (see the -T option). If block- size is
negative, then mke2fs will use heuristics to determine the
appropriate block size, with the constraint that the block
size will be at least block-size bytes. This is useful for
cer- tain hardware devices which require that the blocksize
be a mul- tiple of 2k.</p>

<p>-c Check the device for bad blocks before creating the
file system. If this option is specified twice, then a
slower read-write test is used instead of a fast read-only
test.</p>

<p>-E extended-options Set extended options for the
filesystem. Extended options are comma separated, and may
take an argument using the equals (=) sign. The -E option
used to be -R in earlier versions of mke2fs. The -R option
is still accepted for backwards compati- bility. The
following extended options are supported:</p>

<p>stride=stride-size Configure the filesystem for a RAID
array with stride-size filesystem blocks. This is the number
of blocks read or written to disk before moving to the next
disk, which is sometimes referred to as the chunk size. This
mostly affects placement of filesystem metadata like bitmaps
at mke2fs time to avoid placing them on a single disk, which
can hurt performance. It may also be used by the block allo-
cator.</p>

<p>stripe-width=stripe-width Configure the filesystem for a
RAID array with stripe-width filesystem blocks per stripe.
This is typically stride-size * N, where N is the number of
data-bearing disks in the RAID (e.g. for RAID 5 there is one
parity disk, so N will be the number of disks in the array
minus 1). This allows the block allocator to prevent
read-modify-write of the parity in a RAID stripe if possible
when the data is writ- ten.</p>

<p>resize=max-online-resize Reserve enough space so that
the block group descriptor table can grow to support a
filesystem that has max-online-resize blocks.</p>

<p>lazy_itable_init[= &lt;0 to disable, 1 to enable&gt;] If
enabled and the uninit_bg feature is enabled, the inode
table will not be fully initialized by mke2fs. This speeds
up filesystem initialization noticeably, but it requires the
kernel to finish initializing the filesystem in the
background when the filesystem is first mounted. If the
option value is omitted, it defaults to 1 to enable lazy
inode table initial- ization.</p>

<p>test_fs Set a flag in the filesystem superblock
indicating that it may be mounted using experimental kernel
code, such as the ext4dev filesystem.</p>

<p>discard Attempt to discard blocks at mkfs time
(discarding blocks initially is useful on solid state
devices and sparse / thin-provisioned storage). When the
device advertises that discard also zeroes data (any
subsequent read after the discard and before write returns
zero), then mark all not-yet-zeroed inode tables as zeroed.
This significantly speeds up filesystem initialization. This
is set as default.</p>

<p>nodiscard Do not attempt to discard blocks at mkfs
time.</p>

<p>-f fragment-size Specify the size of fragments in
bytes.</p>

<p>-F Force mke2fs to create a filesystem, even if the
specified device is not a partition on a block special
device, or if other parameters do not make sense. In order
to force mke2fs to cre- ate a filesystem even if the
filesystem appears to be in use or is mounted (a truly
dangerous thing to do), this option must be specified
twice.</p>

<p>-g blocks-per-group Specify the number of blocks in a
block group. There is gener- ally no reason for the user to
ever set this parameter, as the default is optimal for the
filesystem. (For administrators who are creating filesystems
on RAID arrays, it is preferable to use the stride RAID
parameter as part of the -E option rather than manipulating
the number of blocks per group.) This option is generally
used by developers who are developing test cases.</p>

<p>-G number-of-groups Specify the number of block groups
that will be packed together to create a larger virtual
block group (or &quot;flex_bg group&quot;) in an ext4
filesystem. This improves meta-data locality and per-
formance on meta-data heavy workloads. The number of groups
must be a power of 2 and may only be specified if the
flex_bg filesystem feature is enabled.</p>

<p>-i bytes-per-inode Specify the bytes/inode ratio. mke2fs
creates an inode for every bytes-per-inode bytes of space on
the disk. The larger the bytes-per-inode ratio, the fewer
inodes will be created. This value generally shouldnt be
smaller than the blocksize of the filesystem, since in that
case more inodes would be made than can ever be used. Be
warned that it is not possible to expand the number of
inodes on a filesystem after it is created, so be careful
deciding the correct value for this parameter.</p>

<p>-I inode-size Specify the size of each inode in bytes.
mke2fs creates 256-byte inodes by default. In kernels after
2.6.10 and some earlier vendor kernels it is possible to
utilize inodes larger than 128 bytes to store extended
attributes for improved perfor- mance. The inode-size value
must be a power of 2 larger or equal to 128. The larger the
inode-size the more space the inode table will consume, and
this reduces the usable space in the filesystem and can also
negatively impact performance. Extended attributes stored in
large inodes are not visible with older kernels, and such
filesystems will not be mountable with 2.4 kernels at all.
It is not possible to change this value after the filesystem
is created.</p>

<p>-j Create the filesystem with an ext3 journal. If the -J
option is not specified, the default journal parameters will
be used to create an appropriately sized journal (given the
size of the filesystem) stored within the filesystem. Note
that you must be using a kernel which has ext3 support in
order to actually make use of the journal.</p>

<p>-J journal-options Create the ext3 journal using options
specified on the command- line. Journal options are comma
separated, and may take an argument using the equals ( = )
sign. The following journal options are supported:</p>

<p>size=journal-size Create an internal journal (i.e.,
stored inside the filesystem) of size journal-size
megabytes. The size of the journal must be at least 1024
filesystem blocks (i.e., 1MB if using 1k blocks, 4MB if
using 4k blocks, etc.) and may be no more than 102,400
filesystem blocks.</p>

<p>device=external-journal Attach the filesystem to the
journal block device located on external-journal. The
external journal must already have been created using the
command</p>

<p>mke2fs -O journal_dev external-journal</p>

<p>Note that external-journal must have been created with
the same block size as the new filesystem. In addition,
while there is support for attaching mul- tiple filesystems
to a single external journal, the Linux kernel and e2fsck(8)
do not currently support shared external journals yet.</p>

<p>Instead of specifying a device name directly, exter-
nal-journal can also be specified by either LABEL=label or
UUID=UUID to locate the external journal by either the
volume label or UUID stored in the ext2 superblock at the
start of the journal. Use dumpe2fs(8) to display a journal
devices volume label and UUID. See also the -L option of
tune2fs(8).</p>

<p>Only one of the size or device options can be given for
a filesystem.</p>

<p>-K Keep, do not attempt to discard blocks at mkfs time
(discarding blocks initially is useful on solid state
devices and sparse / thin-provisioned storage).</p>

<p>-l filename Read the bad blocks list from filename. Note
that the block numbers in the bad block list must be
generated using the same block size as used by mke2fs. As a
result, the -c option to mke2fs is a much simpler and less
error-prone method of checking a disk for bad blocks before
formatting it, as mke2fs will auto- matically pass the
correct parameters to the badblocks program.</p>

<p>-L new-volume-label Set the volume label for the
filesystem to new-volume-label. The maximum length of the
volume label is 16 bytes.</p>

<p>-m reserved-blocks-percentage Specify the percentage of
the filesystem blocks reserved for the super-user. This
avoids fragmentation, and allows root-owned daemons, such as
syslogd(8), to continue to function correctly after
non-privileged processes are prevented from writing to the
filesystem. The default percentage is 5%.</p>

<p>-M last-mounted-directory Set the last mounted directory
for the filesystem. This might be useful for the sake of
utilities that key off of the last mounted directory to
determine where the filesystem should be mounted.</p>

<p>-n Causes mke2fs to not actually create a filesystem,
but display what it would do if it were to create a
filesystem. This can be used to determine the location of
the backup superblocks for a particular filesystem, so long
as the mke2fs parameters that were passed when the
filesystem was originally created are used again. (With the
-n option added, of course!)</p>

<p>-N number-of-inodes Overrides the default calculation of
the number of inodes that should be reserved for the
filesystem (which is based on the number of blocks and the
bytes-per-inode ratio). This allows the user to specify the
number of desired inodes directly.</p>

<p>-o creator-os Overrides the default value of the
&quot;creator operating system&quot; field of the
filesystem. The creator field is set by default to the name
of the OS the mke2fs executable was compiled for.</p>

<p>-O feature[,...] Create a filesystem with the given
features (filesystem options), overriding the default
filesystem options. The fea- tures that are enabled by
default are specified by the base_fea- tures relation,
either in the [defaults] section in the /etc/mke2fs.conf
configuration file, or in the [fs_types] sub- sections for
the usage types as specified by the -T option, fur- ther
modified by the features relation found in the [fs_types]
subsections for the filesystem and usage types. See the
mke2fs.conf(5) manual page for more details. The filesystem
type-specific configuration setting found in the [fs_types]
section will override the global default found in
[defaults].</p>

<p>The filesystem feature set will be further edited using
either the feature set specified by this option, or if this
option is not given, by the default_features relation for
the filesystem type being created, or in the [defaults]
section of the configu- ration file.</p>

<p>The filesystem feature set is comprised of a list of
features, separated by commas, that are to be enabled. To
disable a fea- ture, simply prefix the feature name with a
caret (^) charac- ter. The pseudo-filesystem feature
&quot;none&quot; will clear all filesystem features.</p>

<p>dir_index Use hashed b-trees to speed up lookups in
large directories.</p>

<p>extent Instead of using the indirect block scheme for
stor- ing the location of data blocks in an inode, use
extents instead. This is a much more efficient encoding
which speeds up filesystem access, espe- cially for large
files.</p>

<p>filetype Store file type information in directory
entries.</p>

<p>flex_bg Allow the per-block group metadata (allocation
bitmaps and inode tables) to be placed anywhere on the
storage media. In addition, mke2fs will place the per-block
group metadata together starting at the first block group of
each &quot;flex_bg group&quot;. The size of the flex_bg
group can be specified using the -G option.</p>

<p>has_journal Create an ext3 journal (as if using the -j
option).</p>

<p>journal_dev Create an external ext3 journal on the given
device instead of a regular ext2 filesystem. Note that
external-journal must be created with the same block size as
the filesystems that will be using it.</p>

<p>large_file Filesystem can contain files that are greater
than 2GB. (Modern kernels set this feature automatically
when a file &gt; 2GB is created.)</p>

<p>resize_inode Reserve space so the block group descriptor
table may grow in the future. Useful for online resizing
using resize2fs. By default mke2fs will attempt to reserve
enough space so that the filesystem may grow to 1024 times
its initial size. This can be changed using the resize
extended option.</p>

<p>sparse_super Create a filesystem with fewer superblock
backup copies (saves space on large filesystems).</p>

<p>uninit_bg Create a filesystem without initializing all
of the block groups. This feature also enables checksums and
highest-inode-used statistics in each block- group. This
feature can speed up filesystem creation time noticeably (if
lazy_itable_init is enabled), and can also reduce e2fsck
time dramati- cally. It is only supported by the ext4
filesystem in recent Linux kernels.</p>

<p>-q Quiet execution. Useful if mke2fs is run in a
script.</p>

<p>-r revision Set the filesystem revision for the new
filesystem. Note that 1.2 kernels only support revision 0
filesystems. The default is to create revision 1
filesystems.</p>

<p>-S Write superblock and group descriptors only. This is
useful if all of the superblock and backup superblocks are
corrupted, and a last-ditch recovery method is desired. It
causes mke2fs to reinitialize the superblock and group
descriptors, while not touching the inode table and the
block and inode bitmaps. The e2fsck program should be run
immediately after this option is used, and there is no
guarantee that any data will be salvage- able. It is
critical to specify the correct filesystem block- size when
using this option, or there is no chance of recovery.</p>

<p>-t fs-type Specify the filesystem type (i.e., ext2,
ext3, ext4, etc.) that is to be created. If this option is
not specified, mke2fs will pick a default either via how the
command was run (for example, using a name of the form
mkfs.ext2, mkfs.ext3, etc.) or via a default as defined by
the /etc/mke2fs.conf(5) file. This option controls which
filesystem options are used by default, based on the fstypes
configuration stanza in /etc/mke2fs.conf(5).</p>

<p>If the -O option is used to explicitly add or remove
filesystem options that should be set in the newly created
filesystem, the resulting filesystem may not be supported by
the requested fs- type. (e.g., &quot;mke2fs -t ext3 -O
extents /dev/sdXX&quot; will create a filesystem that is not
supported by the ext3 implementation as found in the Linux
kernel; and &quot;mke2fs -t ext3 -O ^has_journal
/dev/hdXX&quot; will create a filesystem that does not have
a journal and hence will not be supported by the ext3
filesystem code in the Linux kernel.)</p>

<p>-T usage-type[,...] Specify how the filesystem is going
to be used, so that mke2fs can choose optimal filesystem
parameters for that use. The usage types that are supported
are defined in the configuration file /etc/mke2fs.conf(5).
The user may specify one or more usage types using a comma
separated list.</p>

<p>If this option is is not specified, mke2fs will pick a
single default usage type based on the size of the
filesystem to be created. If the filesystem size is less
than or equal to 3 megabytes, mke2fs will use the filesystem
type floppy. If the filesystem size is greater than 3 but
less than or equal to 512 megabytes, mke2fs(8) will use the
filesystem small. Otherwise, mke2fs(8) will use the default
filesystem type default.</p>

<p>-U UUID Create the filesystem with the specified
UUID.</p>

<p>-v Verbose execution.</p>

<p>-V Print the version number of mke2fs and exit.</p>

<p>AUTHOR This version of mke2fs has been written by
Theodore Tso &lt;tytso@mit.edu&gt;.</p>

<p>BUGS mke2fs accepts the -f option but currently ignores
it because the sec- ond extended file system does not
support fragments yet. There may be other ones. Please,
report them to the author.</p>
