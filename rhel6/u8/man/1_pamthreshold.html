<p>NAME pamthreshold - threshold grayscale image to black
and white</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamthreshold [-simple] [-local=widthxheight]
[-dual=widthxheight] [-threshold=threshold]
[-contrast=threshold] [inputpamfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviations of options are acceptable.
You may use double hyphens instead of a single hyphen to
denote options. You may use white space in place of the
equals sign to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamthreshold thresholds a grayscale image. Thresholding
means dividing the image into background and foreground by
comparing every pixel to a thresholding value.</p>

<p>The input should be a PGM image or a PAM image of tuple
type GRAYSCALE or GRAYSCALE_ALPHA. However, pamthreshold
doesn t check; it just thresholds the first channel as if it
were grayscale samples and if there is a second channel,
processes it as if it is an alpha (trans- parency) channel.
So if you feed it e.g. a PPM image, it will work but produce
probably useless results.</p>

<p>The output is a PAM with tuple type BLACKANDWHITE or
BLACKAND- WHITE_ALPHA, depending on whether the input has an
alpha channel. You can turn this into a PBM (if you need to
use it with an older program that doesnt understand PAM, or
you can t afford the 8X amount of space that PAM uses for
the image) with pamtopnm.</p>

<p>The output is to Standard Output.</p>

<p>When the input has an alpha channel, pamthreshold
includes an alpha channel in the output. Since the output
has maxval 1, the alpha chan- nel can indicate only fully
transparent or fully opaque. pamthreshold make it fully
transparent where the input is more than half transparent
and fully opaque where it isnt.</p>

<p>The alpha function was new in Netpbm 10.43 (June 2008).
Before that, pamthreshold ignores any alpha channel in the
input.</p>

<p>Another way to convert a grayscale image to black and
white is to dither. Dithering is using clustered black and
white pixels such that if you step back and look at the
picture, you see varying levels of gray. pamditherbw does
dithering.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Without any options, pamthreshold uses an
iterative algorithm found in the wikipedia article
Thresholding (image processing) to compute the thresholding
value. ( this version of the Wikipedia article was current
at the time of this writing). It uses this threshold to
globally threshold the image. This should work well for most
images. The program issues a message telling you what
threshold it used. (Netpbm messages go to Standard Error,
and you can turn them off with the Netpbm common option
-quiet).</p>

<p>-simple This selects simple or global thresholding, i.e.
pamthreshold compares every pixel to the threshold you
specify with -thresh- old. Those with a brightness greater
than or equal to the threshold become white; others become
black. This works well for black and white text pages
scanned with a flatbed scanner and is faster than the
default method that iteratively deter- mines the
thresholding value first.</p>

<p>-local=widthxheight This selects local adaptive
thresholding (also known as dynamic thresholding) using the
neighborhood of width and height around every pixel.
pamthreshold computes the threshold individually for each
pixel of the image. This can accommodate changing lighting
conditions in the image. Depending on the size of the
neighborhood this can be quite slow.</p>

<p>-dual=widthxheight This selects a dual thresholding
algorithm using a global threshold for low contrast
neighborhoods and local thresholding otherwise. This can
preserve larger back- respectively fore- ground areas than
local adaptive thresholding. This algorithm was proposed in
the paper &quot;An Approach To Licence Plate Recogni-
tion&quot; by J.R. Parker and Pavol Federl.</p>

<p>-threshold=threshold This sets the thresholding value
for simple or local threshold- ing. The value is a floating
point number in the range [0, 1] directly proportional to
the Netpbm sample values, where 0 cor- responds to black and
1 to the maxval of the image.</p>

<p>If you dont specify this option, pamthreshold uses a
threshold of 0.5. Without -simple or -local this option is
meaningless.</p>

<p>The meaning of the threshold depends upon the kind of
threshold- ing you do (as determined by other options).
Roughly, pixels at least as bright as the threshold become
white in the output while others become black.</p>

<p>-contrast=threshold This sets the threshold to determine
if a neighborhood has low contrast or not for dual
thresholding. The value is a floating point number in the
range [0, 1].</p>

<p>If you dont specify this option, pamthreshold uses a
contrast threshold of 0.05. Without -dual this option is
meaningless.</p>
