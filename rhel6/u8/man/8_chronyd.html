<p>CHRONYD(8) System Administration CHRONYD(8)</p>

<p>NAME chronyd - chrony background daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS chronyd [OPTIONS] [configuration commands]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION chrony is a pair of programs for maintaining
the accuracy of computer clocks. chronyd is a background
daemon program that can be started at boot time.</p>

<p>chronyd is a daemon which runs in background on the
system. It obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of
the systems offset relative to other systems, and adjusts
the system time accordingly. For isolated systems, the user
can periodically enter the correct time by hand (using
chronyc). In either case, chronyd determines the rate at
which the computer gains or loses time, and compensates for
this.</p>

<p>USAGE chronyd is usually started at boot-time and
requires superuser privi- leges.</p>

<p>If chronyd has been installed to its default location
/usr/sbin/chronyd, starting it is simply a matter of
entering the com- mand:</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/chronyd</p>

<p>Information messages and warnings will be logged to
syslog.</p>

<p>If no configuration commands are specified on the
command line, chronyd will read the commands from the
configuration file (default /etc/chrony.conf).</p>

<p>OPTIONS A summary of the options supported by chronyd is
included below.</p>

<p>-P priority This option will select the SCHED_FIFO
real-time scheduler at the specified priority (which must be
between 0 and 100). This mode is supported only on
Linux.</p>

<p>-m This option will lock chronyd into RAM so that it
will never be paged out. This mode is only supported on
Linux.</p>

<p>-n When run in this mode, the program will not detach
itself from the terminal.</p>

<p>-d When run in this mode, the program will not detach
itself from the terminal, and all messages will be sent to
the terminal instead of to syslog. When chronyd was compiled
with debugging support, this option can be used twice to
print also debugging messages.</p>

<p>-f conf-file This option can be used to specify an
alternate location for the configuration file (default
/etc/chrony.conf).</p>

<p>-r This option will reload sample histories for each of
the servers being used. These histories are created by using
the dump com- mand in chronyc, or by setting the dumponexit
directive in the configuration file. This option is useful
if you want to stop and restart chronyd briefly for any
reason, e.g. to install a new version. However, it only
makes sense on systems where the kernel can maintain clock
compensation whilst not under chronyd s control. The only
version where this happens so far is Linux. On other systems
this option should not be used.</p>

<p>-R When this option is used, the initstepslew directive
and the makestep directive used with a positive limit will
be ignored. This option is useful when restarting chronyd
and can be used in conjunction with the -r option.</p>

<p>-s This option will set the system clock from the
computers real- time clock. This is analogous to supplying
the -s flag to the /sbin/hwclock program during the Linux
boot sequence.</p>

<p>Support for real-time clocks is limited at present - the
crite- ria are described in the section on the rtcfile
directive in the documentation supplied with the
distribution.</p>

<p>If used in conjunction with the -r flag, chronyd will
attempt to preserve the old samples after setting the system
clock from the real time clock (RTC). This can be used to
allow chronyd to perform long term averaging of the gain or
loss rate across sys- tem reboots, and is useful for dial-up
systems that are shut down when not in use. For this to work
well, it relies on chronyd having been able to determine
accurate statistics for the difference between the RTC and
system clock last time the computer was on.</p>

<p>If chronyd doesnt support the RTC on your computer or
there is no RTC installed, the system clock will be set with
this option forward to the time of the last modification of
the drift file (specified by the driftfile directive) to
restore the system time at which chronyd was previously
stopped.</p>

<p>-u user This option sets the name of the user to which
will chronyd switch to drop root privileges if compiled with
Linux capabili- ties support (default chrony).</p>

<p>-q When run in this mode, chronyd will set the system
clock once and exit. It will not detach from the
terminal.</p>

<p>-Q This option is similar to -q, but it will only print
the offset and not correct the clock.</p>

<p>-v This option displays chronyds version number to the
terminal and exits</p>

<p>-4 Resolve hostnames only to IPv4 addresses and create
only IPv4 sockets.</p>

<p>-6 Resolve hostnames only to IPv6 addresses and create
only IPv6 sockets.</p>
