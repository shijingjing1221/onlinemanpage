<p>SG_GET_CONFIG(8) SG3_UTILS SG_GET_CONFIG(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_get_config - sends a SCSI GET CONFIGURATION
command (MMC-4 +)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_get_config [--brief] [--current] [--help]
[--hex] [--inner-hex] [--list] [--raw] [--rt=RT]
[--starting=FC] [--verbose] [--version] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends a SCSI GET CONFIGURATION command to
DEVICE and decodes the response. The response includes the
features and profiles of the device. Typically these devices
are CD, DVD, HD-DVD and BD players that may (but not
necessarily) have media in them. These devices may well be
connected via ATAPI, USB or IEEE 1394 transports. In such
cases they are &quot;SCSI&quot; devices only in the sense
that they use the &quot;Multi-Media command&quot; set (MMC).
MMC is a specialized SCSI command set whose definition can
be found at http://www.t10.org .</p>

<p>This utility is based on the MMC-4 and later draft
standards. See sec- tion 5 on &quot;Features and Profile for
Multi_Media devices&quot; for more information on specific
feature parameters and profiles. The manufac- turers product
manual may also be useful.</p>

<p>Since modern DVD and BD writers support many features
and profiles, the decoded output from this utility can be
large. There are various ways to cut down the output. If the
--brief option is used only the feature names are shown and
the feature parameters are not decoded. Alterna- tively if
only one feature is of interest then this combination of
options is appropriate: &quot;--rt=2 --starting=FC&quot;.
Another possibility is to show only the features that are
relevant to the media in the drive (i.e.
&quot;current&quot;) with the &quot;--rt=1&quot; option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-b, --brief show the feature names but don t decode the
parameters of those features. When used with --list outputs
known feature names but not known profile names.</p>

<p>-c, --current output features marked as current. This
option is equivalent to --rt=1.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex output the response in hex (dont decode
response).</p>

<p>-i, --inner-hex decode to the feature name level then
output each features data in hex.</p>

<p>-l, --list list all known feature and profile names.
Ignore the device name (if given). Simply lists the feature
names and profiles (fol- lowed by their hex values) that
this utility knows about. If --brief is also given then only
feature names are listed.</p>

<p>-r, --rt=RT where RT is the field of that name in the
GET CONFIGURATION cdb. Allowable values are 0, 1, 2, or 3 .
The commands action also depends on the value given to the
--starting=FC option. The default value is 0. When RT is 0
then all features, regardless of currency, are returned
(whose feature code is greater than or equal to FC given to
--starting=). When RT is 1 then all current features are
returned (whose feature code is greater than or equal to
FC). When RT is 2 then the feature whose feature code is
equal to FC, if any, is returned. When RT is 3 the response
is reserved (probably yields an &quot;illegal field in
cdb&quot; error). To simplify the meanings of the RT values
are: 0 : all features, current on not 1 : only current
features 2 : only feature whose code is FC 3 : reserved</p>

<p>-R, --raw output response in binary (to stdout). Note
that the short form is -R unlike most other utilities in
this package that use -r for this action.</p>

<p>-s, --starting=FC where FC is the feature code value.
This option works closely with the --rt=RT option. The FC
value is in the range 0 to 65535 (0xffff) inclusive. Its
default value is 0. A value prefixed with &quot;0x&quot; (or
a trailing h) is interpreted as hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output).</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>NOTES There are multiple versions of the MMC (draft)
standards: MMC [1997], MMC-2 [2000], MMC-3 [2002], MMC-4 and
MMC-5. The first three are now ANSI INCITS standards with
the year they became standards shown in brackets. The draft
immediately prior to standardization can be found at
http://www.t10.org . In the initial MMC standard there was
no GET CONFIGURATION command and the relevant information
was obtained from the &quot;CD capabilities and mechanical
status mode page&quot; (mode page 0x2a). It was later
renamed the &quot;MM capabilities and mechanical status mode
page&quot; and has been made obsolete in MMC-4 and MMC-5.
The GET CONFIGURA- TION command was introduced in MMC-2 and
has become a replacement for that mode page. New features
such as support for &quot;BD&quot; (blue ray) media type can
only be found by using the GET CONFIGURATION command. Hence
older CD players may not support the GET CONFIGURATION
command in which case the &quot;MM capabilities ...&quot;
mode page can be checked with sdparm(8), sginfo(8) or
sg_modes(8).</p>

<p>In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the DEVICE must be a
SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block devices
can also be specified. For example &quot;sg_get_config
/dev/hdc&quot; will work in the 2.6 series kernels as long
as /dev/hdc is an ATAPI device. In the 2.6 series external
DVD writers attached via USB could be queried with
&quot;sg_get_config /dev/scd1&quot; for example.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_get_config is 0 when
it is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man
page.</p>
