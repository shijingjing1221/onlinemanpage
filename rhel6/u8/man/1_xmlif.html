<p>NAME xmlif - conditional processing instructions for
XML</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xmlif [attrib=value...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xmlif filters XML according to
conditionalizing markup. This can be useful for formatting
one of several versions of an XML document depending on
conditions passed to the command.</p>

<p>Attribute/value pairs from the command line are matched
against the attributes associated with certain processing
instructions in the document. The instructions are
&lt;?xmlif if?&gt; and its inverse &lt;?xmlif if not?&gt;,
&lt;?xmlif elif?&gt; and its inverse &lt;?xmlif elif
not?&gt;, &lt;?xmlif else?&gt;, and &lt;?xmlif fi?&gt;.</p>

<p>Argument/value pairs given on the command line are
checked against the value of corresponding attributes in the
conditional processing instructions. An attribute
match&acute; happens if an attribute occurs in both the
command-line arguments and the tag, and the values match. An
attribute mismatch&acute; happens if an attribute occurs in
both the command-line arguments and the tag, but the values
do not match.</p>

<p>Spans between &lt;?xmlif if?&gt; or &lt;?xmlif elif?&gt;
and the next conditional processing instruction at the same
nesting level are passed through unaltered if there is at
least one attribute match and no attribute mismatch; spans
between &lt;?xmlif if not?&gt; and &lt;?xmlif elif not?&gt;
and the next conditional processing instruction are passed
otherwise. Spans between &lt;?xmlif else?&gt; and the next
conditional-processing tag are passed through only if no
previous span at the same level has been passed through.
&lt;?xmlif if?&gt; and &lt;?xmlif fi?&gt; (and their
not&acute; variants) change the current nesting level;
&lt;?xmlif else?&gt; and &lt;?xmlif elif?&gt; do not.</p>

<p>All these processing instructions will be removed from
the output produced. Aside from the conditionalization, all
other input is passed through untouched; in particular,
entity references are not resolved.</p>

<p>Value matching is by string equality, except that
&quot;|&quot; in an attribute value is interpreted as an
alternation character. Thus, saying
foo=&acute;red|blue&acute; on the command line enables
conditions red and blue. Saying
color=&acute;black|white&acute; in a tag matches
command-line conditions color=&acute;black&acute; and
color=&acute;white&acute;.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<p>Always issue this text. &lt;?xmlif if
condition=&acute;html&acute;?&gt; Issue this text if
&acute;condition=html&acute; is given on the command line.
&lt;?xmlif elif condition=&acute;pdf|ps&acute;?&gt; Issue
this text if &acute;condition=pdf&acute; or
&acute;condition=ps&acute; is given on the command line.
&lt;?xmlif else?&gt; Otherwise issue this text. &lt;?xmlif
fi?&gt; Always issue this text.</p>
