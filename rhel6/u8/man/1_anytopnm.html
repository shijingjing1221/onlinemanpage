<p>NAME anytopnm - convert an arbitrary type of image file
to PBM, PGM, or PPM</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS anytopnm [file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>anytopnm converts the input image, which may be in any
of about 100 graphics formats, to PBM, PGM, or PPM format,
depending on that nature of the input image, and outputs it
to Standard Output.</p>

<p>To determine the format of the input, anytopnm uses the
file program (possibly assisted by the magic numbers file
fragment included with Netpbm). If that fails (very few
image formats have magic numbers), anytopnm looks at the
filename extension. If that fails, anytopnm punts.</p>

<p>The type of the output file depends on the input
image.</p>

<p>anytopnm uses the converters for particular graphics
formats that are in the Netpbm package, so it cant convert
any format that you couldnt convert with some other Netpbm
program. What anytopnm adds is the ability to recognize the
format and choose the appropriate Netpbm pro- gram to
convert it. For example, if you invoke anytopnm on a GIF
file, anytopnm will recognize that it is a GIF file and
therefore giftopnm knows how to convert it to PNM, so
anytopnm invokes giftopnm.</p>

<p>anytopnm cannot recognize every possible input format,
so you may still be able to convert an image with a specific
Netpbm program when any- topnm fails to convert it.</p>

<p>If file indicates that the input file is compressed
(either via Unix compress, gzip, or bzip compression),
anytopnm uncompresses it and pro- ceeds as above with the
uncompressed result.</p>

<p>If file indicates that the input file is encoded by
uuencode or btoa, anytopnm decodes it and proceeds as above
with the decoded result.</p>

<p>If file is - or not given, anytopnm takes its input from
Standard Input.</p>
