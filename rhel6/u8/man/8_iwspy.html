<p>NAME iwspy - Get wireless statistics from specific
nodes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS iwspy [interface] iwspy interface [+] DNSNAME |
IPADDR | HWADDR [...] iwspy interface off iwspy interface
setthr low high iwspy interface getthr</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Iwspy is used to set a list of addresses to
monitor in a wireless net- work interface and to read back
quality of link information for each of those. This
information is the same as the one available in
/proc/net/wireless : quality of the link, signal strength
and noise level.</p>

<p>This information is updated each time a new packet is
received, so each address of the list adds some overhead in
the driver.</p>

<p>Note that this functionality works only for nodes part
of the current wireless cell, you can not monitor Access
Points you are not associated with (you can use Scanning for
that) and nodes in other cells. In Man- aged mode, in most
case packets are relayed by the Access Point, in this case
you will get the signal strength of the Access Point. For
those reasons this functionality is mostly useful in Ad-Hoc
and Master mode.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS You may set any number of addresses up to
8.</p>

<p>DNSNAME | IPADDR Set an IP address, or in some cases a
DNS name (using the name resolver). As the hardware works
with hardware addresses, iwspy will translate this IP
address through ARP. In some case, this address might not be
in the ARP cache and iwspy will fail. In those case, ping(8)
this name/address and retry.</p>

<p>HWADDR Set a hardware (MAC) address (this address is not
translated &amp; checked like the IP one). The address must
contain a colon (:) to be recognised as a hardware
address.</p>

<p>+ Add the new set of addresses at the end of the current
list instead of replacing it. The address list is unique for
each device, so each user should use this option to avoid
conflicts.</p>

<p>off Remove the current list of addresses and disable the
spy func- tionality</p>

<p>setthr Set the low and high signal strength threshold
for the iwspy event (for drivers that support it). Every
time the signal strength for any of the address monitored
with iwspy goes lower than the low threshold or goes higher
than the high threshold, a Wireless Event will be generated.
This can be used to monitor link outages without having to
run iwspy periodically.</p>

<p>getthr Retrieve the current low and high signal strength
threshold for the iwspy event.</p>
