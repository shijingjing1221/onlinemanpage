<p>NAME pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot - locate PCI device for
a given PCI domain (segment), bus, and slot</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct pci_dev *
pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot(int domain, unsigned int bus,
unsigned int devfn);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS domain PCI domain/segment on which the PCI
device resides.</p>

<p>bus PCI bus on which desired PCI device resides</p>

<p>devfn encodes number of PCI slot in which the desired
PCI device resides and the logical device number within that
slot in case of multi-function devices.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Given a PCI domain, bus, and slot/function
number, the desired PCI device is located in the list of PCI
devices. If the device is found, its reference count is
increased and this function returns a pointer to its data
structure. The caller must decrement the reference count by
calling pci_dev_put. If no device is found, NULL is
returned.</p>
