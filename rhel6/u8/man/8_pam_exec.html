<p>NAME pam_exec - PAM module which calls an external
command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_exec.so [debug] [expose_authtok] [seteuid]
[quiet] [log=file] command [...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pam_exec is a PAM module that can be used to
run an external command.</p>

<p>The child&acute;s environment is set to the current PAM
environment list, as returned by pam_getenvlist(3) In
addition, the following PAM items are exported as
environment variables: PAM_RHOST, PAM_RUSER, PAM_SERVICE,
PAM_TTY, PAM_USER and PAM_TYPE, which contains one of the
module types: account, auth, password, open_session and
close_session.</p>

<p>OPTIONS debug Print debug information.</p>

<p>expose_authtok During authentication the calling command
can read the password from stdin(3). Only first
PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE bytes of a password are provided to the
command.</p>

<p>log=file The output of the command is appended to
file</p>

<p>quiet Per default pam_exec.so will echo the exit status
of the external command if it fails. Specifying this option
will suppress the message.</p>

<p>seteuid Per default pam_exec.so will execute the
external command with the real user ID of the calling
process. Specifying this option means the command is run
with the effective user ID.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED All module types (auth, account,
password and session) are provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_SUCCESS The external command was run
successfully.</p>

<p>PAM_SERVICE_ERR No argument or a wrong number of
arguments were given.</p>

<p>PAM_SYSTEM_ERR A system error occurred or the command to
execute failed.</p>

<p>PAM_IGNORE</p>

<p>pam_setcred was called, which does not execute the
command.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/passwd to
rebuild the NIS database after each local password
change:</p>

<p>passwd optional pam_exec.so seteuid make -C /var/yp</p>

<p>This will execute the command</p>

<p>make -C /var/yp</p>

<p>with effective user ID.</p>
