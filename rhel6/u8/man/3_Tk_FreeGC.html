<p>Tk_GetGC(3) Tk Library Procedures Tk_GetGC(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_GetGC, Tk_FreeGC - maintain database of
read-only graphics contexts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>GC Tk_GetGC(tkwin, valueMask, valuePtr)</p>

<p>Tk_FreeGC(display, gc)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_Window tkwin (in) Token for window in which
the graphics context will be used.</p>

<p>unsigned long valueMask (in) Mask of bits (such as
GCFore- ground or GCStipple) indicating which fields of
*valuePtr are valid.</p>

<p>XGCValues *valuePtr (in) Pointer to structure describing
the desired values for the graph- ics context.</p>

<p>Display *display (in) Display for which gc was allo-
cated.</p>

<p>GC gc (in) X identifier for graphics context that is no
longer needed. Must have been allocated by Tk_GetGC.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_GetGC and Tk_FreeGC manage a collection
of graphics contexts being used by an application. The
procedures allow graphics contexts to be shared, thereby
avoiding the server overhead that would be incurred if a
separate GC were created for each use. Tk_GetGC takes
arguments describing the desired graphics context and
returns an X identifier for a GC that fits the description.
The graphics context that is returned will have default
values in all of the fields not specified explicitly by
valueMask and valuePtr.</p>

<p>Tk_GetGC maintains a database of all the graphics
contexts it has cre- ated. Whenever possible, a call to
Tk_GetGC will return an existing graphics context rather
than creating a new one. This approach can substantially
reduce server overhead, so Tk_GetGC should generally be used
in preference to the Xlib procedure XCreateGC, which creates
a new graphics context on each call.</p>

<p>Since the return values of Tk_GetGC are shared, callers
should never modify the graphics contexts returned by
Tk_GetGC. If a graphics con- text must be modified
dynamically, then it should be created by calling XCreateGC
instead of Tk_GetGC.</p>

<p>When a graphics context is no longer needed, Tk_FreeGC
should be called to release it. There should be exactly one
call to Tk_FreeGC for each call to Tk_GetGC. When a graphics
context is no longer in use anywhere (i.e. it has been freed
as many times as it has been gotten) Tk_FreeGC will release
it to the X server and delete it from the database.</p>
