<p>DESCRIPTION GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program.
It is used to edit and manipulate images. It can load and
save a variety of image formats and can be used to convert
between formats.</p>

<p>GIMP can also be used as a paint program. It features a
set of drawing and painting tools such as airbrush, clone,
pencil, and paint brush. Painting and drawing tools can be
applied to an image with a variety of paint modes. It also
offers an extensive array of selection tools like rectangle,
ellipse, fuzzy select, bezier select, intelligent scissors,
and select by color.</p>

<p>GIMP offers a variety of plug-ins that perform a variety
of image manipulations. Examples include bumpmap, edge
detect, gaussian blur, and many others. In addition, GIMP
has several scripting extension which allow for advanced
non-interactive processing and creation of images.</p>

<p>GIMP ships with a second binary called gimp-console.
This binary is a console-only version and behaves as if gimp
was called with the --no-interface command-line option.</p>

<p>On platforms with the D-Bus message bus system, GIMP
will by default check if an instance is already running in
this user session. If it detects that, it will pass all
filenames given on the command-line to the already running
GIMP instance and quit.</p>

<p>OPTIONS GIMP accepts the following options:</p>

<p>-h, --help Show GIMP command-line options.</p>

<p>--help-all Show all command-line options.</p>

<p>--help-gtk Show GTK+ command-line options.</p>

<p>--help-gegl Show GEGL command-line options.</p>

<p>-v, --version Output version information and exit. When
combined with the --verbose option, version information
about libraries used by GIMP is shown as well.</p>

<p>--license Output license information and exit.</p>

<p>--verbose Be verbose and create information on standard
output.</p>

<p>-n, --new-instance Do not attempt to reuse an already
running GIMP instance. Always start a new one.</p>

<p>-a, --as-new Open filenames passed on the command-line
as new images, dont set the filename on them.</p>

<p>-i, --no-interface Run without a user interface.</p>

<p>-d, --no-data Do not load patterns, gradients, palettes,
or brushes. Often useful in non-interactive situations where
startup time is to be minimized.</p>

<p>-f, --no-fonts Do not load any fonts. No text
functionality will be available if this option is used.</p>

<p>--display display Use the designated X display.</p>

<p>-s, --no-splash Do not show the splash screen.</p>

<p>--no-shm Do not use shared memory between GIMP and its
plug-ins. Instead of using shared memory, GIMP will send the
data via pipe. This will result in slower performance than
using shared memory.</p>

<p>--no-cpu-accel Do not use CPU accelerations such as MMX
or SSE even if GIMP detects that your CPU provides this
functionality.</p>

<p>--session &lt;name&gt; Use a different sessionrc for
this GIMP session. The given ses- sion name is appended to
the default sessionrc filename.</p>

<p>-g, --gimprc &lt;gimprc&gt; Use an alternative gimprc
instead of the default one. Useful in cases where plug-in
paths or machine specs may be different.</p>

<p>--system-gimprc &lt;gimprc&gt; Use an alternate system
gimprc file.</p>

<p>--dump-gimprc Output a gimprc file with default
settings.</p>

<p>--debug-handlers Enable debugging signal handlers.</p>

<p>-c, --console-messages Do not popup dialog boxes on
errors or warnings. Print the mes- sages on the console
instead.</p>

<p>--stack-trace-mode {never|query|always} If a stack-trace
should be generated in case of fatal signals.</p>

<p>--pdb-compat-mode {off|on|warn} If the PDB should
provide aliases for deprecated functions.</p>

<p>--batch-interpreter &lt;procedure&gt; Specifies the
procedure to use to process batch events. The default is to
let Script-Fu evaluate the commands.</p>

<p>-b, --batch &lt;command&gt; Execute &lt;command&gt;
non-interactively. This option may appear multiple times.
The &lt;command&gt; is passed to the batch inter- preter.
When &lt;command&gt; is - the commands are read from
standard input.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT GIMP respects a number of environment
variables.</p>

<p>DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.</p>

<p>GIMP2_DIRECTORY to get the name of the personal GIMP
directory. If unset .gimp-2.6 is used. If this is an
absolute path, it is used as is. If it is a relative path,
it is taken to be a subdirectory of the home directory.</p>

<p>GIMP2_DATADIR to get the base location for data files
such as brushes and patterns. If unset /usr/share/gimp/2.0
is used.</p>

<p>GIMP2_LOCALEDIR to get the base location for
translations. If unset /usr/share/locale is used.</p>

<p>GIMP2_PLUGINDIR to get the base location for plug-ins
and modules. If unset /usr/lib64/gimp/2.0 is used.</p>

<p>GIMP2_SYSCONFDIR to get the location of configuration
files. If unset /etc/gimp/2.0 is used.</p>

<p>On Linux GIMP can be compiled with support for binary
relocati- bility. This will cause data, plug-ins and
configuration files to be searched relative to the location
of the gimp executable file unless overridden by the
environment variables mentioned above.</p>

<p>FILES GIMP s data files are stored in
/usr/share/gimp/2.0, where ${dataroot- dir} is set on
install, but is typically /usr/share. GIMPs system-wide
configuration files are stored in /etc/gimp/2.0, where
${prefix} is typically /usr.</p>

<p>Most GIMP configuration is read in from the user s init
file, $HOME/.gimp-2.6/gimprc. The system wide equivalent is
in /etc/gimprc. The system wide file is parsed first and the
user gimprc can override the system settings.
/etc/gimprc_user is the default gimprc placed in users home
directories the first time GIMP is run.</p>

<p>$HOME/.gimp-2.6/devicerc - holds settings for input
devices together with the tool, colors, brush, pattern and
gradient associated to that device.</p>

<p>$HOME/.gimp-2.6/gtkrc - users set of GIMP-specific GTK+
config settings. Options such as widget color and fonts
sizes can be set here.</p>

<p>/etc/gimp/2.0/gtkrc - sytem wide default set of
GIMP-specific GTK+ con- fig settings.</p>

<p>$HOME/.gimp-2.6/menurc - users set of keybindings.</p>

<p>$HOME/.gimp-2.6/parasiterc - Stores all persistent GIMP
parasites. This file will be rewritten every time you quit

it manually, but of course you can do. This file will be
entirely rewritten every time you quit GIMP. If this file
isnt found, defaults are used.</p>

<p>$HOME/.gimp-2.6/templaterc - Image templates are kept in
this file. New images can conveniently created from these
templates. If this file isnt found, defaults are used.</p>

<p>/etc/gimp/2.0/unitrc - default user unit database. It
contains the unit definitions for centimeters, meters, feet,
yards, typographic points and typographic picas and is
placed in users home directories the first time GIMP is ran.
If this file isnt found, defaults are used.</p>

<p>$HOME/.gimp-2.6/unitrc - This file contains your user
unit database. You can modify this list with the unit
editor. You are not supposed to edit it manually, but of
course you can do. This file will be entirely rewritten
every time you quit GIMP.</p>

<p>$HOME/.gimp-2.6/plug-ins - location of user installed
plug-ins.</p>

<p>$HOME/.gimp-2.6/pluginrc - plug-in initialization values
are stored here. This file is parsed on startup and
regenerated if need be.</p>

the GIMP about dialog.</p>

<p>/usr/share/gimp/2.0/tips/gimp-tips.xml - tips as
displayed in the &quot;Tip of the Day&quot; dialog box.</p>

<p>SPLASH IMAGES GIMP comes with a default image for the
splash screen but it allows system administrators and users
to customize the splash screen by pro- viding other images.
The image to be used with the splash screen is chosen as
follows:</p>

<p>1. GIMP tries to load a random splash screen from the
directory $HOME/.gimp-2.6/splashes.</p>

<p>2. It then falls back to using
$HOME/.gimp-2.6/gimp-splash.png.</p>

<p>3. If the user didn t install any custom splash images,
a random image is picked from
/usr/share/gimp/2.0/splashes.</p>

<p>4. As a last resort, GIMP uses the default splash image
located at /usr/share/gimp/2.0/images/gimp-splash.png.</p>

<p>SUGGESTIONS AND BUG REPORTS Any bugs found should be
reported to the online bug-tracking system available on the
web at http://bugzilla.gnome.org/. Before reporting bugs,
please check to see if the bug has already been
reported.</p>

<p>When reporting GIMP bugs, it is important to include a
reliable way to reproduce the bug, version number of GIMP
(and probably GTK+), OS name and version, and any relevant
hardware specs. If a bug is causing a crash, it is very
useful if a stack trace can be provided. And of course,
patches to rectify the bug are even better.</p>

<p>OTHER INFO The canonical place to find GIMP info is at
http://www.gimp.org/. Here you can find links to just about
many other GIMP sites, tutorials, data sets, mailing list
archives, and more.</p>

<p>There is also a GIMP User Manual available at
http://docs.gimp.org/ that goes into much more detail about
the interactive use of GIMP.</p>

<p>The latest version of GIMP and the GTK+ libs is always
available at ftp://ftp.gimp.org/.</p>
