<p>FSTATVFS(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FSTATVFS(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fstatvfs, statvfs - get file system information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/statvfs.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fstatvfs(int fildes, struct statvfs *buf); int
statvfs(const char *restrict path, struct statvfs *restrict
buf);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fstatvfs() function shall obtain
information about the file system containing the file
referenced by fildes.</p>

<p>The statvfs() function shall obtain information about
the file system containing the file named by path.</p>

<p>For both functions, the buf argument is a pointer to a
statvfs struc- ture that shall be filled. Read, write, or
execute permission of the named file is not required.</p>

<p>The following flags can be returned in the f_flag
member:</p>

<p>ST_RDONLY Read-only file system.</p>

<p>ST_NOSUID Setuid/setgid bits ignored by exec.</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether all members of the statvfs
structure have meaningful values on all file systems.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, statvfs() shall
return 0. Otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fstatvfs() and statvfs() functions shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading the file
system.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught during execution of the
function.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW One of the values to be returned cannot be
represented correctly in the structure pointed to by
buf.</p>

<p>The fstatvfs() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not an open file
descriptor.</p>

<p>The statvfs() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the
path prefix.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}
or a pathname compo- nent is longer than {NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing
file or path is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix of path is not a
directory.</p>

<p>The statvfs() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG Pathname resolution of a symbolic link
produced an intermediate result whose length exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Obtaining File System Information Using
fstatvfs() The following example shows how to obtain file
system information for the file system upon which the file
named /home/cnd/mod1 resides, using the fstatvfs() function.
The /home/cnd/mod1 file is opened with read/write privileges
and the open file descriptor is passed to the fstatvfs()
function.</p>

<p>#include &lt;statvfs.h&gt; #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct statvfs buffer; int status; ... fildes =
open(&quot;/home/cnd/mod1&quot;, O_RDWR); status =
fstatvfs(fildes, &amp;buffer);</p>

<p>Obtaining File System Information Using statvfs() The
following example shows how to obtain file system
information for the file system upon which the file named
/home/cnd/mod1 resides, using the statvfs() function.</p>

<p>#include &lt;statvfs.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct statvfs buffer; int status; ... status =
statvfs(&quot;/home/cnd/mod1&quot;, &amp;buffer);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
