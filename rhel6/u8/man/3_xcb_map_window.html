<p>xcb_map_window(3) XCB Requests xcb_map_window(3)</p>

<p>NAME xcb_map_window - Makes a window visible</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</p>

<p>Request function xcb_void_cookie_t
xcb_map_window(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_window_t
window);</p>

<p>REQUEST ARGUMENTS conn The XCB connection to X11.</p>

<p>window The window to make visible.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Maps the specified window. This means making
the window visible (as long as its parent is visible).</p>

<p>This MapWindow request will be translated to a
MapRequest request if a window manager is running. The
window manager then decides to either map the window or not.
Set the override-redirect window attribute to true if you
want to bypass this mechanism.</p>

<p>If the window manager decides to map the window (or if
no window manag- er is running), a MapNotify event is
generated.</p>

<p>If the window becomes viewable and no earlier contents
for it are re- membered, the X server tiles the window with
its background. If the window s background is undefined, the
existing screen contents are not altered, and the X server
generates zero or more Expose events.</p>

<p>If the window type is InputOutput, an Expose event will
be generated when the window becomes visible. The normal
response to an Expose event should be to repaint the
window.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if
any) have to be handled in the event loop.</p>

<p>If you want to handle errors directly with
xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_map_window_checked. See
xcb-requests(3) for details.</p>

<p>ERRORS xcb_match_error_t The specified window does not
exist.</p>
