<p>NAME ppmtobmp - convert a PPM image into a BMP file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtobmp</p>

<p>[-windows]</p>

<p>[-os2]</p>

<p>[-bpp=bits_per_pixel]</p>

<p>[-mapfile=filename]</p>

<p>[ppmfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtobmp reads a PPM image as input and produces a
Microsoft Windows or OS/2 BMP file as output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -windows Tells the program to produce a
Microsoft Windows BMP file. (This is the default.)</p>

<p>-os2 Tells the program to produce an OS/2 BMP file.
(Before August 2000, this was the default).</p>

<p>-bpp This tells how many bits per pixel you want the BMP
file to con- tain. Only 1, 4, 8, and 24 are possible. By
default, ppmtobmp chooses the smallest number with which it
can represent all the colors in the input image. If you
specify a number too small to represent all the colors in
the input image, ppmtobmp tells you and terminates. You can
use pnmquant or ppmdither to reduce the number of colors in
the image.</p>

<p>-mapfile=filename This identifies a file to use as the
BMP palette (aka col- ormap ). In one BMP subformat, the BMP
stream contains a palette of up to 256 colors, and
represents the image raster as indices into that palette.
Normally, ppmtobmp takes care of computing a suitable
palette, but if you are going to dissect the BMP output in
some way, you may want certain values for the palette
indices. E.g. you might want red to be 13, where ppm- tobmp
would (arbitrarily) choose 39. In that case, you can con-
struct the palette yourself and use this option to tell
ppmtobmp to use your palette.</p>

<p>This option does not control what colors are in the
output. The colors in the output are exactly those in the
input, and the palette you supply must contain at least all
the colors that are in the input. You can use pnmremap to
adjust your input image so that it contains only colors from
your palette.</p>

<p>The palette file is a Netpbm format file with one pixel
per palette entry. Each pixel must have a distinct color (no
repeats). The order of the BMP palette ppmtobmp generates is
the order of the pixels in the palette file, going from top
to bottom, left to right.</p>

<p>A BMP palette may have at most 256 colors, so the
palette file must have at most 256 pixels.</p>

<p>You may find pnmcolormap useful in generating the
palette file. pamseq too.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.45 (December 2008).</p>

<p>NOTES To get a faithful reproduction of the input image,
the maxval of the input image must be 255. If it is
something else, the colors in the BMP file may be slightly
different from the colors in the input.</p>

<p>Windows icons are not BMP files. Use ppmtowinicon to
create those.</p>
