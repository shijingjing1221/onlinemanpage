<p>NAME unflatten - adjust directed graphs to improve
layout aspect ratio</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS unflatten [-f] [-llen] [-clen ] [ -o outfile ]
[ files ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION unflatten is a preprocessor to dot that is
used to improve the aspect ratio of graphs having many
leaves or disconnected nodes. The usual layout for such a
graph is generally very wide or tall. unflatten inserts
invisible edges or adjusts the minlen on edges to improve
lay- out compaction.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>-l len The minimum length of leaf edges is staggered
between 1 and len (a small integer).</p>

<p>-f Enables the staggering of the -l option to fanout
nodes whose indegree and outdegree are both 1. This helps
with structures such as a -&gt; {w x y z} -&gt; b. This
option only works if the -l flag is set.</p>

<p>-c len Form disconnected nodes into chains of up to len
nodes.</p>

<p>-o outfile causes the output to be written to the
specified file; by default, output is written to stdout.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand is supported:</p>

<p>files Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot
format. If no files operand is specified, the standard input
will be used.</p>
