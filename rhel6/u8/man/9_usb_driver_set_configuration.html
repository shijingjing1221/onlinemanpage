<p>NAME usb_driver_set_configuration - Provide a way for
drivers to change device configurations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int usb_driver_set_configuration(struct
usb_device * udev, int config);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS udev the device whose configuration is being
updated</p>

<p>config the configuration being chosen.</p>

<p>CONTEXT In process context, must be able to sleep</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Device interface drivers are not allowed to
change device configurations. This is because changing
configurations will destroy the interface the driver is
bound to and create new ones; it would be like a floppy-disk
driver telling the computer to replace the floppy-disk drive
with a tape drive!</p>

<p>Still, in certain specialized circumstances the need may
arise. This routine gets around the normal restrictions by
using a work thread to submit the change-config request.</p>

<p>Returns 0 if the request was succesfully queued, error
code otherwise. The caller has no way to know whether the
queued request will eventually succeed.</p>
