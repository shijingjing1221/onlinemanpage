<p>NAME icastats - display statistic data for the libica
cryptographic func- tions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS icastats [-v | --version] [-h | --help]
[--reset-all | -R] [--reset | -r] [--delete-all |-D]
[--delete | -d] [--all | -A] [--summary | -S] [[-U | --user]
&lt;username&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION icastats displays statistic data about the
usage of cryptographic func- tions provided by libica.
Libica is a cryptographic library supporting SHA, RSA, DES
and AES in different modes of operations. The invocation of
each call to all the cryptographic functions is tracked with
individual counters which can be displayed and maintained
with icastats. Here is a sample output:</p>

<p>function | # hardware | # software
--------------+-----------------------+-------------------------
| ENC CRYPT DEC | ENC CRYPT DEC
--------------|-----------------------|-------------------------
SHA-1 | 0 | 0 SHA-224 | 0 | 0 SHA-256 | 0 | 0 SHA-384 | 0 |
0 SHA-512 | 0 | 0 P_RNG | 0 | 0 RSA-ME | 0 | 0 RSA-CRT | 0 |
0 DES ECB | 0 0 | 0 0 DES CBC | 0 0 | 0 0 DES CBC CS | 0 0 |

0 0</p>

<p>For each cryptographic function the table shows the
number of invoca- tions where hardware support was involved
or the libica fall back implementation in software was used.
For the ciphering methods the invocation counter is further
divided into encrypt and decrypt opera- tion counter
values.</p>

<p>All the counter values are stored and maintained in one
shared memory page for each user. This memory area is
created automatically with the first run of icastats and
persists until it is explicitly removed (see the -d option)
or system shut down. This also means that the statisti- cal
data shown with icastats is on a per user base and only the
root user is able to see and maintain the collection of
statistic data from libica at system scope.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v or --version show libica version and
copyright</p>

<p>-h or --help display this help and exit</p>

<p>-R or --reset-all reset the statistic data for each user
that has a shared memory segment to zero (only root
user)</p>

<p>-r or --reset reset the statistic data for the current
user to zero</p>

<p>-D or --delete-all delete all shared memory segments
from all users who have an icastats shared memory segment
(only root user)</p>

<p>-d or --delete delete the libica shared memory area for
the current user</p>

<p>-A or --all show libica statistic data for each user in
the system where a shared memory area exists in multiple
tables (only root user)</p>

<p>-S or --summary show libica statistic data for each user
in the system where a shared memory area exists in one table
accumulating all the per user counter values (only root
user)</p>

<p>-U &lt;username&gt; or --user &lt;username&gt; show
statistic values from the given user (only root user)</p>

<p>FILES /shm/dev/icastats_&lt;userid&gt;</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE 1 unsupported or unknown argument, argument
which requires root privileges given but not root user,
failures at creating or attaching to the shared memory area
...</p>

<p>0 normal and sucessful program execution</p>
