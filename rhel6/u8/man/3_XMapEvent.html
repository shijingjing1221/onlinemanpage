<p>NAME XMapEvent, XMappingEvent - MapNotify and
MappingNotify event structures</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structure for MapNotify events
contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* MapNotify */ unsigned long
serial; /* # of last request processed by server */ Bool
send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
Display *display; /* Display the event was read from */
Window event; Window window; Bool override_redirect; /*
boolean, is override set... */ } XMapEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive this event, the structure members are
set as follows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>The event member is set either to the window that was
mapped or to its parent, depending on whether
StructureNotify or SubstructureNotify was selected. The
window member is set to the window that was mapped. The
override_redirect member is set to the override-redirect
attribute of the window. Window manager clients normally
should ignore this window if the override-redirect attribute
is True, because these events usu- ally are generated from
pop-ups, which override structure control.</p>

<p>The structure for MappingNotify events is:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* MappingNotify */ unsigned
long serial; /* # of last request processed by server */
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ Display *display; /* Display the event was read
from */ Window window; /* unused */ int request; /* one of
MappingModifier, MappingKeyboard, MappingPointer */ int
first_keycode; /* first keycode */ int count; /* defines
range of change w. first_keycode*/ } XMappingEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive this event, the structure members are
set as follows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>The request member is set to indicate the kind of
mapping change that occurred and can be MappingModifier,
MappingKeyboard, MappingPointer. If it is MappingModifier,
the modifier mapping was changed. If it is MappingKeyboard,
the keyboard mapping was changed. If it is Mapping- Pointer,
the pointer button mapping was changed. The first_keycode
and count members are set only if the request member was set
to MappingKey- board. The number in first_keycode represents
the first number in the range of the altered mapping, and
count represents the number of key- codes altered.</p>
