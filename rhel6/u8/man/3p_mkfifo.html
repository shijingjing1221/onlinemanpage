<p>MKFIFO(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MKFIFO(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mkfifo - make a FIFO special file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mkfifo(const char *path, mode_t mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mkfifo() function shall create a new
FIFO special file named by the pathname pointed to by path.
The file permission bits of the new FIFO shall be
initialized from mode. The file permission bits of the mode
argument shall be modified by the process file creation
mask.</p>

<p>When bits in mode other than the file permission bits
are set, the effect is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>If path names a symbolic link, mkfifo() shall fail and
set errno to [EEXIST].</p>

<p>The FIFO s user ID shall be set to the process effective
user ID. The FIFOs group ID shall be set to the group ID of
the parent directory or to the effective group ID of the
process. Implementations shall provide a way to initialize
the FIFOs group ID to the group ID of the parent directory.
Implementations may, but need not, provide an implementa-
tion-defined way to initialize the FIFO s group ID to the
effective group ID of the calling process.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, mkfifo() shall mark for
update the st_atime, st_ctime, and st_mtime fields of the
file. Also, the st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the
directory that contains the new entry shall be marked for
update.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned, no FIFO shall be
created, and errno shall be set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The mkfifo() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES A component of the path prefix denies search
permission, or write permission is denied on the parent
directory of the FIFO to be created.</p>

<p>EEXIST The named file already exists.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of the path prefix specified by path
does not name an existing directory or path is an empty
string.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The directory that would contain the new file
cannot be extended or the file system is out of
file-allocation resources.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EROFS The named file resides on a read-only file
system.</p>

<p>The mkfifo() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG As a result of encountering a symbolic link
in resolution of the path argument, the length of the
substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Creating a FIFO File The following example
shows how to create a FIFO file named /home/cnd/mod_done,
with read/write permissions for owner, and with read
permissions for group and others.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int status; ... status =
mkfifo(&quot;/home/cnd/mod_done&quot;, S_IWUSR | S_IRUSR |
S_IRGRP | S_IROTH);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The syntax of this function is intended to
maintain compatibility with historical implementations of
mknod(). The latter function was included in the 1984
/usr/group standard but only for use in creating FIFO spe-
cial files. The mknod() function was originally excluded
from the POSIX.1-1988 standard as implementation-defined and
replaced by mkdir() and mkfifo(). The mknod() function is
now included for alignment with the Single UNIX
Specification.</p>

<p>The POSIX.1-1990 standard required that the group ID of
a newly created FIFO be set to the group ID of its parent
directory or to the effective group ID of the creating
process. FIPS 151-2 required that implementa- tions provide
a way to have the group ID be set to the group ID of the
containing directory, but did not prohibit implementations
also sup- porting a way to set the group ID to the effective
group ID of the cre- ating process. Conforming applications
should not assume which group ID will be used. If it
matters, an application can use chown() to set the group ID
after the FIFO is created, or determine under what
conditions the implementation will set the desired group
ID.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
