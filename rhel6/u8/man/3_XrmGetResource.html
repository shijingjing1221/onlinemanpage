<p>ARGUMENTS class Specifies the resource class.</p>

<p>classes Specifies a list of resource classes.</p>

<p>database Specifies the database that is to be used.</p>

<p>list Specifies the search list returned by
XrmQGetSearchList.</p>

<p>list_length Specifies the number of entries (not the
byte size) allocated for list_return.</p>

<p>list_return Returns a search list for further use.</p>

<p>name Specifies the resource name.</p>

<p>names Specifies a list of resource names.</p>

<p>quark_class Specifies the fully qualified class of the
value being retrieved (as a quark).</p>

<p>quark_name Specifies the fully qualified name of the
value being retrieved (as a quark).</p>

<p>quark_type_return Returns the representation type of the
destination (as a quark).</p>

<p>str_class Specifies the fully qualified class of the
value being retrieved (as a string).</p>

<p>str_name Specifies the fully qualified name of the value
being retrieved (as a string).</p>

<p>str_type_return Returns the representation type of the
destination (as a string).</p>

<p>type_return Returns data representation type.</p>

<p>value_return Returns the value in the database.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XrmGetResource and XrmQGetResource
functions retrieve a resource from the specified database.
Both take a fully qualified name/class pair, a destination
resource representation, and the address of a value
(size/address pair). The value and returned type point into
database memory; therefore, you must not modify the
data.</p>

<p>The database only frees or overwrites entries on
XrmPutResource, XrmQPutResource, or XrmMergeDatabases. A
client that is not storing new values into the database or
is not merging the database should be safe using the address
passed back at any time until it exits. If a resource was
found, both XrmGetResource and XrmQGetResource return True;
otherwise, they return False.</p>

<p>The XrmQGetSearchList function takes a list of names and
classes and returns a list of database levels where a match
might occur. The returned list is in best-to-worst order and
uses the same algorithm as XrmGetResource for determining
precedence. If list_return was large enough for the search
list, XrmQGetSearchList returns True; otherwise, it returns
False.</p>

<p>The size of the search list that the caller must
allocate is dependent upon the number of levels and
wildcards in the resource specifiers that are stored in the
database. The worst case length is %3 sup n%, where n is the
number of name or class components in names or classes.</p>

<p>When using XrmQGetSearchList followed by multiple probes
for resources with a common name and class prefix, only the
common prefix should be specified in the name and class list
to XrmQGetSearchList.</p>

<p>The XrmQGetSearchResource function searches the
specified database lev- els for the resource that is fully
identified by the specified name and class. The search stops
with the first match. XrmQGetSearchResource returns True if
the resource was found; otherwise, it returns False.</p>

<p>A call to XrmQGetSearchList with a name and class list
containing all but the last component of a resource name
followed by a call to XrmQGetSearchResource with the last
component name and class returns the same database entry as
XrmGetResource and XrmQGetResource with the fully qualified
name and class.</p>

<p>MATCHING RULES The algorithm for determining which
resource database entry matches a given query is the heart
of the resource manager. All queries must fully specify the
name and class of the desired resource (use of the
characters * and ? are not permitted). The library supports
up to 100 components in a full name or class. Resources are
stored in the database with only partially specified names
and classes, using pattern matching constructs. An asterisk
(*) is a loose binding and is used to represent any number
of intervening components, including none. A period (.) is a
tight binding and is used to separate immediately adja- cent
components. A question mark (?) is used to match any single
com- ponent name or class. A database entry cannot end in a
loose binding; the final component (which cannot be the
character ?) must be spec- ified. The lookup algorithm
searches the database for the entry that most closely
matches (is most specific for) the full name and class being
queried. When more than one database entry matches the full
name and class, precedence rules are used to select just
one.</p>

<p>The full name and class are scanned from left to right
(from highest level in the hierarchy to lowest), one
component at a time. At each level, the corresponding
component and/or binding of each matching entry is
determined, and these matching components and bindings are
compared according to precedence rules. Each of the rules is
applied at each level before moving to the next level, until
a rule selects a single entry over all others. The rules, in
order of precedence, are:</p>

<p>1. An entry that contains a matching component (whether
name, class, or the character ?) takes precedence over
entries that elide the level (that is, entries that match
the level in a loose bind- ing).</p>

<p>2. An entry with a matching name takes precedence over
both entries with a matching class and entries that match
using the character ? . An entry with a matching class takes
precedence over entries that match using the character
?.</p>

<p>3. An entry preceded by a tight binding takes precedence
over entries preceded by a loose binding.</p>
