<p>FCHDIR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FCHDIR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fchdir - change working directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fchdir(int fildes);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fchdir() function shall be equivalent to
chdir() except that the directory that is to be the new
current working directory is specified by the file
descriptor fildes.</p>

<p>A conforming application can obtain a file descriptor
for a file of type directory using open(), provided that the
file status flags and access modes do not contain O_WRONLY
or O_RDWR.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, fchdir() shall
return 0. Otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error. On failure the current working directory
shall remain unchanged.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fchdir() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied for the directory
referenced by fildes.</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not an open file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR The open file descriptor fildes does not refer
to a directory.</p>

<p>The fchdir() may fail if:</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught during the execution of
fchdir().</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing
to the file system.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
