<p>VISUDO(8) BSD System Manager s Manual VISUDO(8)</p>

<p>NAME visudo - edit the sudoers file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS visudo [-chqsV] [-f sudoers]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION visudo edits the sudoers file in a safe
fashion, analogous to vipw(8). visudo locks the sudoers file
against multiple simultaneous edits, pro- vides basic sanity
checks, and checks for parse errors. If the sudoers file is
currently being edited you will receive a message to try
again later.</p>

<p>There is a hard-coded list of one or more editors that
visudo will use set at compile-time that may be overridden
via the editor sudoers Default variable. This list defaults
to /usr/local/bin/vi. Normally, visudo does not honor the
VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables unless they contain
an editor in the aforementioned editors list. However, if
visudo is configured with the --with-env-editor option or
the env_editor Default variable is set in sudoers, visudo
will use any the editor defines by VISUAL or EDITOR. Note
that this can be a security hole since it allows the user to
execute any program they wish simply by setting VISUAL or
EDITOR.</p>

<p>visudo parses the sudoers file after the edit and will
not save the changes if there is a syntax error. Upon
finding an error, visudo will print a message stating the
line number(s) where the error occurred and the user will
receive the What now? prompt. At this point the user may
enter e to re-edit the sudoers file, x to exit without
saving the changes, or Q to quit and save changes. The Q
option should be used with extreme care because if visudo
believes there to be a parse error, so will sudo and no one
will be able to sudo again until the error is fixed. If e is
typed to edit the sudoers file after a parse error has been
detected, the cursor will be placed on the line where the
error occurred (if the editor supports this feature).</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-c Enable check-only mode. The existing sudoers file
will be checked for syntax errors, owner and mode. A message
will be printed to the standard output describing the status
of sudoers unless the -q option was specified. If the check
completes successfully, visudo will exit with a value of 0.
If an error is encountered, visudo will exit with a value of
1.</p>

<p>-f sudoers Specify and alternate sudoers file location.
With this option visudo will edit (or check) the sudoers
file of your choice, instead of the default, /etc/sudoers.
The lock file used is the specified sudoers file with .tmp
appended to it. In check-only mode only, the argument to -f
may be -, indicating that sudoers will be read from the
standard input.</p>

<p>-h The -h (help) option causes visudo to print a short
help mes- sage to the standard output and exit.</p>

<p>-q Enable quiet mode. In this mode details about syntax
errors are not printed. This option is only useful when
combined with the -c option.</p>

<p>-s Enable strict checking of the sudoers file. If an
alias is used before it is defined, visudo will consider
this a parse error. Note that it is not possible to
differentiate between an alias and a host name or user name
that consists solely of uppercase letters, digits, and the
underscore (_ ) charac- ter.</p>

<p>-V The -V (version) option causes visudo to print its
version number and exit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The following environment variables may be
consulted depending on the value of the editor and
env_editor sudoers settings:</p>

<p>VISUAL Invoked by visudo as the editor to use</p>

<p>EDITOR Used by visudo if VISUAL is not set</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sudoers List of who can run what</p>

<p>/etc/sudoers.tmp Lock file for visudo</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS sudoers file busy, try again later. Someone
else is currently editing the sudoers file.</p>

<p>/etc/sudoers.tmp: Permission denied You didnt run visudo
as root.</p>

<p>Cant find you in the passwd database Your user ID does
not appear in the system passwd file.</p>

<p>Warning: {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias referenced but not
defined Either you are trying to use an undeclared
{User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias or you have a user or host name
listed that consists solely of uppercase letters, digits,
and the under- score ( _ ) character. In the latter case,
you can ignore the warnings (sudo will not complain). In -s
(strict) mode these are errors, not warnings.</p>

<p>Warning: unused {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias The
specified {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias was defined but never
used. You may wish to comment out or remove the unused
alias. In -s (strict) mode this is an error, not a
warning.</p>

<p>Warning: cycle in {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias The
specified {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias includes a reference
to itself, either directly or through an alias it includes.
This is only a warning by default as sudo will ignore cycles
when parsing the sudoers file.</p>

<p>CAVEATS There is no easy way to prevent a user from
gaining a root shell if the editor used by visudo allows
shell escapes.</p>
