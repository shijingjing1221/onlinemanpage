<p>RDS-PING(1) BSD General Commands Manual RDS-PING(1)</p>

<p>NAME rds-ping - test reachability of remote node over
RDS</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rds-ping [-c count] [-i interval] [-I
local_addr] remote_addr</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rds-ping is used to test whether a remote
node is reachable over RDS. Its interface is designed to
operate pretty much the standard ping(8) utility, even
though the way it works is pretty different.</p>

<p>rds-ping opens several RDS sockets and sends packets to
port 0 on the indicated host. This is a special port number
to which no socket is bound; instead, the kernel processes
incoming packets and responds to them.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are available for use on
the command line:</p>

<p>-c count Causes rds-ping to exit after sending (and
receiving) the speci- fied number of packets.</p>

<p>-I address By default, rds-ping will pick the local
source address for the RDS socket based on routing
information for the destination address (i.e. if packets to
the given destination would be routed through interface ib0,
then it will use the IP address of ib0 as source address).
Using the -I option, you can override this choice.</p>

<p>-i timeout By default, rds-ping will wait for one second
between sending packets. Use this option to specified a
different interval. The timeout value is given in seconds,
and can be a floating point number. Optionally, append msec
or usec to specify a timeout in milliseconds or
microseconds, respectively.</p>

<p>Specifying a timeout considerably smaller than the
packet round- trip time will produce unexpected results.</p>
