<p>NAME slattach - attach a network interface to a serial
line</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS slattach [-dehlLmnqv] [-c command] [-p proto]
[-s speed] [tty]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Slattach is a tiny little program that can
be used to put a normal ter- minal (&quot;serial&quot;) line
into one of several &quot;network&quot; modes, thus allow-
ing you to use it for point-to-point links to other
computers.</p>

<p>OPTIONS [-c command] Execute command when the line is
hung up. This can be used to run scripts or re-establish
connections when a link goes down.</p>

<p>[-d] Enable debugging output. Useful when determining
why a given setup doesnt work.</p>

<p>[-h] Exit when the carrier is lost. This works on both
/dev/tty and /dev/cua devices by directly monitoring the
carrier status every 15 seconds. [-v] Enable verbose output.
Useful in shell scripts.</p>

<p>[-q] Operate in quiet mode - no messages at all.</p>

<p>[-l] Create an UUCP-style lockfile for the device in
/var/lock.</p>

<p>[-n] Equivalent to the &quot;mesg n&quot; command.</p>

<p>[-m] Do not initialize the line into 8 bits raw
mode.</p>

<p>[-e] Exit right after initializing device, instead of
waiting for the line to hangup.</p>

<p>[-L] Enable 3 wire operation. The terminal is moved into
CLOCAL mode, carrier watching is disabled.</p>

<p>[-p proto] Set a specific kind of protocol to use on the
line. The default is set to cslip , i.e. compressed SLIP.
Other possible values are slip (normal SLIP), adaptive
(adaptive CSLIP/SLIP), ppp (Point-to-Point Protocol) and
kiss (a protocol used for communi- cating with AX.25 packet
radio terminal node controllers). The special argument tty
can be used to put the device back into normal serial
operation. Using ppp mode is not normally use- ful as ppp
requires an additional ppp daemon pppd to be active on the
line. For kiss connections the axattach program should be
used.</p>

<p>[-s speed] Set a specific line speed, other than the
default.</p>

<p>If no arguments are given, the current terminal line
(usually: the login device) is used. Otherwise, an attempt
is made to claim the indicated terminal port, lock it, and
open it.</p>

<p>FILES /dev/cua* /var/lock/LCK.*</p>

<p>BUGS None known.</p>
