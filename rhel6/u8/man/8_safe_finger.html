<p>SAFE_FINGER(8) Linux Programmer s Manual
SAFE_FINGER(8)</p>

<p>NAME safe_finger - finger client wrapper that protects
against nasty stuff from finger servers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS safe_finger [finger_options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The safe_finger command protects against
nasty stuff from finger servers. Use this program for
automatic reverse finger probes from the tcp_wrapper (tcpd)
, not the raw finger command. The safe_finger com- mand
makes sure that the finger client is not run with root
privileges. It also runs the finger client with a defined
PATH environment. safe_finger will also protect you from
problems caused by the output of some finger servers. The
problem: some programs may react to stuff in the first
column. Other programs may get upset by thrash anywhere on a
line. File systems may fill up as the finger server keeps
sending data. Text editors may bomb out on extremely long
lines. The finger server may take forever because it is
somehow wedged. safe_finger takes care of all this
badness.</p>
