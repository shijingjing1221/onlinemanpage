<p>NAME XVisibilityEvent - VisibilityNotify event
structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structure for VisibilityNotify events
contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* VisibilityNotify */
unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a
SendEvent request */ Display *display; /* Display the event
was read from */ Window window; int state; }
XVisibilityEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive this event, the structure members are
set as follows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>The window member is set to the window whose visibility
state changes. The state member is set to the state of the
window s visibility and can be VisibilityUnobscured,
VisibilityPartiallyObscured, or VisibilityFul- lyObscured.
The X server ignores all of a window s subwindows when
determining the visibility state of the window and processes
Visibili- tyNotify events according to the following:</p>

<p>&middot; When the window changes state from partially
obscured, fully obscured, or not viewable to viewable and
completely unobscured, the X server generates the event with
the state member of the XVisibilityEvent structure set to
VisibilityUnobscured.</p>

<p>&middot; When the window changes state from viewable and
completely unob- scured or not viewable to viewable and
partially obscured, the X server generates the event with
the state member of the XVisibili- tyEvent structure set to
VisibilityPartiallyObscured.</p>

<p>&middot; When the window changes state from viewable and
completely unob- scured, viewable and partially obscured, or
not viewable to view- able and fully obscured, the X server
generates the event with the state member of the
XVisibilityEvent structure set to Visibility-
FullyObscured.</p>
