<p>NAME rio_get_asm - Begin or continue searching for a RIO
device by vid/did/asm_vid/asm_did</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct rio_dev * rio_get_asm(u16 vid, u16 did,
u16 asm_vid, u16 asm_did, struct rio_dev * from);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS vid RIO vid to match or RIO_ANY_ID to match
all vids</p>

<p>did RIO did to match or RIO_ANY_ID to match all dids</p>

<p>asm_vid RIO asm_vid to match or RIO_ANY_ID to match all
asm_vids</p>

<p>asm_did RIO asm_did to match or RIO_ANY_ID to match all
asm_dids</p>

<p>from Previous RIO device found in search, or NULL for
new search</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Iterates through the list of known RIO
devices. If a RIO device is found with a matching vid, did,
asm_vid, asm_did, the reference count to the device is
incrememted and a pointer to its device structure is
returned. Otherwise, NULL is returned. A new search is
initiated by passing NULL to the from argument. Otherwise,
if from is not NULL, searches continue from next device on
the global list. The reference count for from is always
decremented if it is not NULL.</p>
