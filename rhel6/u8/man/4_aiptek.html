<p>NAME aiptek - Aiptek USB Digital Tablet Input Driver for
Linux</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;InputDevice&quot; Identifier
&quot;idevname&quot; Driver &quot;aiptek&quot; Option
&quot;Device&quot; &quot;devpath&quot; ... EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION aiptek is an Xorg input driver for Aiptek
HyperPen USB-based tablet devices. This driver only supports
the USB protocol, and only under Linux; for RS-232C-based
HyperPens, please see the &quot;hyperpen&quot; driver.</p>

<p>The aiptek driver functions as a pointer input device,
and may be used as the X servers core pointer.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE This driver supports the Aiptek
HyperPen 4000U, 5000U, 6000U, 8000U and 12000U USB-based
input tablet on some Linux platforms.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details and for options that can be
used with all input drivers. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>Multiple instances of the Aiptek devices can cohabit. It
can be useful to define multiple devices with different
active zones. Each device supports the following
entries:</p>

<p>Option &quot;Type&quot;
&quot;stylus&quot;|&quot;eraser&quot;|&quot;cursor&quot;
sets the type of tool the device represent. This option is
mandatory.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Device&quot; &quot;path&quot; sets the path
to the special file which represents serial line where the
tablet is plugged. You have to specify it for each
subsection with the same value if you want to have multiple
devices with the same tablet. This option is mandatory.</p>

<p>Option &quot;USB&quot; &quot;on&quot; specifies that you
are using the USB bus to communicate with your tablet. This
setting is mandatory, as USB is the only protocol supported
by this driver.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DeviceName&quot; &quot;name&quot; sets the
name of the X device.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Mode&quot;
&quot;Relative&quot;|&quot;Absolute&quot; sets the mode of
the device.</p>

<p>Option &quot;HistorySize&quot; &quot;number&quot; sets
the motion history size. By default the value is zero.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AlwaysCore&quot; &quot;on&quot; enables the
sharing of the core pointer. When this feature is enabled,
the device will take control of the core pointer (and thus
will emit core events) and at the same time will be able,
when asked so, to report extended events. You can use the
last available integer feedback to control this feature.
When the value of the feedback is zero, the feature is
disabled. The feature is enabled for any other value.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XTop&quot; &quot;number&quot; First of
three sets of parameters to set the active zone. This sets
the X coordinate of the top corner of the active zone.
&quot;TopX&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;YTop&quot; &quot;number&quot; First of
three sets of parameters to set the active zone. This sets
the Y coordinate of the top corner of the active zone.
&quot;TopY&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XBottom&quot; &quot;Inumber&quot; First of
three sets of parameters to set the active zone. This sets
the X coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone.
&quot;BottomX&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;YBottom&quot; &quot;number&quot; First of
three sets of parameters to set the active zone. This sets
the Y coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone.
&quot;BottomY&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XMax&quot; &quot;number&quot; Second of
three sets of parameters to set the active zone. This sets
the the X coordinate of the bottom corner of the active
zone. The Top X corners coordinate is fixed at 0.
&quot;MaxX&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;YMax&quot; &quot;number&quot; Second of
three sets of parameters to set the active zone. This sets
the the Y coordinate of the bottom corner of the active
zone. The Top Y corners coordinate is fixed at 0.
&quot;MaxY&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XOffset&quot; &quot;number&quot; Third of
three sets of parameters to set the active zone. This sets
the X coordinate of the top corner of the active zone.
&quot;OffsetX&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;YOffset&quot; &quot;number&quot; Third of
three sets of parameters to set the active zone. This sets
the Y coordinate of the top corner of the active zone.
&quot;OffsetY&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XSize&quot; &quot;number&quot; Third of
three sets of parameters to set the active zone. This sets
the X coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone.
Unlike others, this parameter is expressed in relative
coordinates from the &quot;XOffset&quot; parameter.
&quot;XSize&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;YSize&quot; &quot;number&quot; Third of
three sets of parameters to set the active zone. This sets
the Y coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone.
Unlike others, this parameter is expressed in relative
coordinates from the &quot;YOffset&quot; parameter.
&quot;YSize&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ZMin&quot; &quot;number&quot; Minimum
pressure reading that will be accepted from the Stylus tool.
&quot;MinZ&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ZMax&quot; &quot;number&quot; Maximum
pressure reading that will be accepted from the Stylus tool.
&quot;MaxZ&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XThreshold&quot; &quot;number&quot; Minimal
change in X coordinate position that will be accepted as
data input. &quot;ThresholdX&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;YThreshold&quot; &quot;number&quot; Minimal
change in Y coordinate position that will be accepted as
data input. &quot;ThresholdY&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ZThreshold&quot; &quot;number&quot; Minimal
change in pressure reading that will be accepted as data
input. &quot;ThresholdZ&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;InvX&quot; &quot;on&quot; Inverts X
coordinate reports. &quot;XInv&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;InvY&quot; &quot;on&quot; Inverts Y
coordinate reports. &quot;YInv&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Pressure&quot;
&quot;soft&quot;|&quot;hard&quot;|&quot;linear&quot;
Pressure reports either delivered in linearly incremental
values (default), or perturbed by one of two log-linear
algorithms (&quot;soft&quot; or &quot;hard&quot;.)</p>

<p>Option &quot;KeepShape&quot; &quot;on&quot; When this
option is enabled, the active zone begins according to TopX
and TopY. The bottom corner is adjusted to keep the ratio
width/height of the active zone the same as the screen while
maximizing the area described by the active area set of
parameters, XTop/YTop/XBottom/YBottom, XMax/YMax, or
XOffset/YOffset/XSize/YSize.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DebugLevel&quot; number sets the level of
debugging info reported.</p>

<p>This driver is currently Linux specific.</p>
