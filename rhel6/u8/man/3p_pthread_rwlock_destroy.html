<p>PTHREAD_RWLOCK_DESTROY(3P) POSIX Programmer s
ManualPTHREAD_RWLOCK_DESTROY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_rwlock_destroy, pthread_rwlock_init -
destroy and initialize a read-write lock object</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_rwlock_destroy(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock);
int pthread_rwlock_init(pthread_rwlock_t *restrict rwlock,
const pthread_rwlockattr_t *restrict attr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_rwlock_destroy() function shall
destroy the read-write lock object referenced by rwlock and
release any resources used by the lock. The effect of
subsequent use of the lock is undefined until the lock is
reinitialized by another call to pthread_rwlock_init(). An
implementa- tion may cause pthread_rwlock_destroy() to set
the object referenced by rwlock to an invalid value. Results
are undefined if pthread_rwlock_destroy() is called when any
thread holds rwlock. Attempting to destroy an uninitialized
read-write lock results in unde- fined behavior.</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlock_init() function shall allocate any
resources required to use the read-write lock referenced by
rwlock and initial- izes the lock to an unlocked state with
attributes referenced by attr. If attr is NULL, the default
read-write lock attributes shall be used; the effect is the
same as passing the address of a default read-write lock
attributes object. Once initialized, the lock can be used
any num- ber of times without being reinitialized. Results
are undefined if pthread_rwlock_init() is called specifying
an already initialized read- write lock. Results are
undefined if a read-write lock is used without first being
initialized.</p>

<p>If the pthread_rwlock_init() function fails, rwlock
shall not be ini- tialized and the contents of rwlock are
undefined.</p>

<p>Only the object referenced by rwlock may be used for
performing syn- chronization. The result of referring to
copies of that object in calls to pthread_rwlock_destroy(),
pthread_rwlock_rdlock(), pthread_rwlock_timedrdlock(),
pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(), pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock(),
pthread_rwlock_trywrlock(), pthread_rwlock_unlock(), or
pthread_rwlock_wrlock() is undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the pthread_rwlock_destroy()
and pthread_rwlock_init() functions shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>The [EBUSY] and [EINVAL] error checks, if implemented,
act as if they were performed immediately at the beginning
of processing for the func- tion and caused an error return
prior to modifying the state of the read-write lock
specified by rwlock.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_rwlock_destroy() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EBUSY The implementation has detected an attempt to
destroy the object referenced by rwlock while it is
locked.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by rwlock is invalid.</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlock_init() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The system lacked the necessary resources (other
than memory) to initialize another read-write lock.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to initialize the
read-write lock.</p>

<p>EPERM The caller does not have the privilege to perform
the operation.</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlock_init() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EBUSY The implementation has detected an attempt to
reinitialize the object referenced by rwlock, a previously
initialized but not yet destroyed read-write lock.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Applications using these and related
read-write lock functions may be subject to priority
inversion, as discussed in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.285, Priority Inversion.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
