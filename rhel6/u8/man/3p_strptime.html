<p>STRPTIME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRPTIME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strptime - date and time conversion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *strptime(const char *restrict buf, const char
*restrict format, struct tm *restrict tm);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strptime() function shall convert the
character string pointed to by buf to values which are
stored in the tm structure pointed to by tm, using the
format specified by format.</p>

<p>The format is composed of zero or more directives. Each
directive is composed of one of the following: one or more
white-space characters (as specified by isspace()); an
ordinary character (neither% nor a white-space character);
or a conversion specification. Each conversion specification
is composed of a%character followed by a conversion
character which specifies the replacement required. The
application shall ensure that there is white-space or other
non-alphanumeric char- acters between any two conversion
specifications. The following conver- sion specifications
are supported:</p>

<p>%a The day of the week, using the locale s weekday
names; either the abbreviated or full name may be
specified.</p>

<p>%A Equivalent to %a .</p>

<p>%b The month, using the locales month names; either the
abbrevi- ated or full name may be specified.</p>

<p>%B Equivalent to %b .</p>

<p>%c Replaced by the locales appropriate date and time
representa- tion.</p>

<p>%C The century number [00,99]; leading zeros are
permitted but not required.</p>

<p>%d The day of the month [01,31]; leading zeros are
permitted but not required.</p>

<p>%D The date as %m / %d / %y .</p>

<p>%e Equivalent to %d .</p>

<p>%h Equivalent to %b .</p>

<p>%H The hour (24-hour clock) [00,23]; leading zeros are
permitted but not required.</p>

<p>%I The hour (12-hour clock) [01,12]; leading zeros are
permitted but not required.</p>

<p>%j The day number of the year [001,366]; leading zeros
are permit- ted but not required.</p>

<p>%m The month number [01,12]; leading zeros are permitted
but not required.</p>

<p>%M The minute [00,59]; leading zeros are permitted but
not required.</p>

<p>%n Any white space.</p>

<p>%p The locales equivalent of a.m or p.m.</p>

<p>%r 12-hour clock time using the AM/PM notation if
t_fmt_ampm is not an empty string in the LC_TIME portion of
the current locale; in the POSIX locale, this shall be
equivalent to %I : %M : %S %p .</p>

<p>%R The time as %H : %M .</p>

<p>%S The seconds [00,60]; leading zeros are permitted but
not required.</p>

<p>%t Any white space.</p>

<p>%T The time as %H : %M : %S .</p>

<p>%U The week number of the year (Sunday as the first day
of the week) as a decimal number [00,53]; leading zeros are
permitted but not required.</p>

<p>%w The weekday as a decimal number [0,6], with 0
representing Sun- day; leading zeros are permitted but not
required.</p>

<p>%W The week number of the year (Monday as the first day
of the week) as a decimal number [00,53]; leading zeros are
permitted but not required.</p>

<p>%x The date, using the locales date format.</p>

<p>%X The time, using the locales time format.</p>

<p>%y The year within century. When a century is not
otherwise speci- fied, values in the range [69,99] shall
refer to years 1969 to 1999 inclusive, and values in the
range [00,68] shall refer to years 2000 to 2068 inclusive;
leading zeros shall be permitted but shall not be
required.</p>

<p>Note: It is expected that in a future version of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 the default century inferred from a 2-digit
year will change. (This would apply to all commands
accepting a 2-digit year as input.)</p>

<p>%Y The year, including the century (for example,
1988).</p>

<p>%% Replaced by % .</p>

<p>Modified Conversion Specifiers Some conversion
specifiers can be modified by the E and O modifier
characters to indicate that an alternative format or
specification should be used rather than the one normally
used by the unmodified con- version specifier. If the
alternative format or specification does not exist in the
current locale, the behavior shall be as if the unmodified
conversion specification were used.</p>

<p>%Ec The locales alternative appropriate date and time
representa- tion.</p>

<p>%EC The name of the base year (period) in the locale s
alternative representation.</p>

<p>%Ex The locales alternative date representation.</p>

<p>%EX The locales alternative time representation.</p>

<p>%Ey The offset from %EC (year only) in the locales
alternative rep- resentation.</p>

<p>%EY The full alternative year representation.</p>

<p>%Od The day of the month using the locales alternative
numeric sym- bols; leading zeros are permitted but not
required.</p>

<p>%Oe Equivalent to %Od .</p>

<p>%OH The hour (24-hour clock) using the locale s
alternative numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%OI The hour (12-hour clock) using the locale s
alternative numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%Om The month using the locale s alternative numeric
symbols.</p>

<p>%OM The minutes using the locales alternative numeric
symbols.</p>

<p>%OS The seconds using the locales alternative numeric
symbols.</p>

<p>%OU The week number of the year (Sunday as the first day
of the week) using the locale s alternative numeric
symbols.</p>

<p>%Ow The number of the weekday (Sunday=0) using the
locales alterna- tive numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%OW The week number of the year (Monday as the first day
of the week) using the locale s alternative numeric
symbols.</p>

<p>%Oy The year (offset from %C ) using the locale s
alternative numeric symbols.</p>

<p>A conversion specification composed of white-space
characters is exe- cuted by scanning input up to the first
character that is not white- space (which remains
unscanned), or until no more characters can be scanned.</p>

<p>A conversion specification that is an ordinary character
is executed by scanning the next character from the buffer.
If the character scanned from the buffer differs from the
one comprising the directive, the directive fails, and the
differing and subsequent characters remain unscanned.</p>

<p>A series of conversion specifications composed of %n,
%t, white-space characters, or any combination is executed
by scanning up to the first character that is not white
space (which remains unscanned), or until no more characters
can be scanned.</p>

<p>Any other conversion specification is executed by
scanning characters until a character matching the next
directive is scanned, or until no more characters can be
scanned. These characters, except the one match- ing the
next directive, are then compared to the locale values
associated with the conversion specifier. If a match is
found, values for the appropriate tm structure members are
set to values correspond- ing to the locale information.
Case is ignored when matching items in buf such as month or
weekday names. If no match is found, strptime() fails and no
more characters are scanned.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, strptime()
shall return a pointer to the character following the last
character parsed. Otherwise, a null pointer shall be
returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Several &quot;equivalent to&quot;
formats and the special processing of white- space
characters are provided in order to ease the use of
identical format strings for strftime() and strptime().</p>

<p>Applications should use %Y (4-digit years) in preference
to %y (2-digit years).</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether multiple calls to strptime()
using the same tm structure will update the current contents
of the structure or over- write all contents of the
structure. Conforming applications should make a single call
to strptime() with a format and all data needed to
completely specify the date and time being converted.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS The strptime() function is expected to
be mandatory in the next version of this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>
