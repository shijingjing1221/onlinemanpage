<p>protoize(1) GNU protoize(1)</p>

<p>NAME protoize, unprotoize - automatically add or remove
function prototypes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS protoize [-CfgklNnqv] [-B DIRECTORY] [-c
COMPILATION-OPTIONS] [-d DIRECTORY] [-i STRING] [-p PROGRAM]
[-x FILE] [FILE...]</p>

<p>unprotoize [-fkNnqv] [-c COMPILATION-OPTIONS] [-d
DIRECTORY] [-i STRING] [-p PROGRAM] [-x FILE] [FILE...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION protoize is an optional part of GCC. You can
use it to add prototypes to a program, thus converting the
program to ANSI C in one respect. The companion program
unprotoize does the reverse: it removes argument types from
any prototypes that are found.</p>

<p>When you run these programs, you must specify a set of
source files as command line arguments. The conversion
programs start out by compiling these files to see what
functions they define. The information gath- ered about a
file FOO is saved in a file named FOO.X.</p>

<p>After scanning comes the actual conversion. The
specified files are all eligible to be converted; any files
they include (whether sources or just headers) are eligible
as well.</p>

<p>But not all the eligible files are converted. By
default, protoize and unprotoize convert only source and
header files in the current direc- tory. You can specify
additional directories whose files should be converted with
the -d DIRECTORY option. You can also specify particu- lar
files to exclude with the -x FILE option. A file is
converted if it is eligible, its directory name matches one
of the specified direc- tory names, and its name within the
directory has not been excluded.</p>

<p>Basic conversion with protoize consists of rewriting
most function def- initions and function declarations to
specify the types of the argu- ments. The only ones not
rewritten are those for varargs functions.</p>

<p>protoize optionally inserts prototype declarations at
the beginning of the source file, to make them available for
any calls that precede the functions definition. Or it can
insert prototype declarations with block scope in the blocks
where undeclared functions are called.</p>

<p>Basic conversion with unprotoize consists of rewriting
most function declarations to remove any argument types, and
rewriting function defi- nitions to the old-style pre-ANSI
form.</p>

<p>Both conversion programs print a warning for any
function declaration or definition that they cant convert.
You can suppress these warnings with the -q option.</p>

<p>The output from protoize or unprotoize replaces the
original source file. The original file is renamed to a name
ending with .save. If the .save file already exists, then
the source file is simply dis- carded.</p>

<p>protoize and unprotoize both depend on gcc(1) to scan
the program and collect information about the functions it
uses.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-B DIRECTORY Look for the file SYSCALLS.c.X in
directory, instead of the usual directory (normally
/usr/local/lib). This file contains prototype information
about standard system functions. This option applies only to
protoize.</p>

<p>-C Rename files to end in .C instead of .c. This is
convenient if you are converting a C program to C++. This
option applies only to protoize.</p>

<p>-c COMPILATION-OPTIONS Use COMPILATION-OPTIONS as the
options when running gcc(1) to produce the .X files. The
special option -aux-info is always passed in addition, to
tell gcc to write a .X file. Note that the compilation
options must be given as a single argument to protoize or
unprotoize. If you want to specify several gcc options, you
must quote the entire set of compilation options to make
them a single word in the shell. There are certain gcc
arguments that you cannot use, because they would produce
the wrong kind of output. These include -g, -O, -c, -S,-o.
If you include these in the COMPILATION-OPTIONS, they are
ignored.</p>

<p>-d DIRECTORY Specify additional directories whose files
should be converted.</p>

<p>-g Add explicit global declarations. This means
inserting explicit declarations at the beginning of each
source file for each func- tion that is called in the file
and was not declared. These declarations precede the first
function definition that contains a call to an undeclared
function. This option applies only to</p>

<p>-i STRING Indent old-style parameter declarations with
the string STRING. This option applies only to protoize.
unprotoize converts pro- totyped function definitions to
old-style function definitions, where the arguments are
declared between the argument list and the initial {. By
default, unprotoize uses five spaces as the indentation. If
you want to indent with just one space instead, use -i
&quot; &quot;.</p>

<p>-k Keep the .X files. Normally, they are deleted after
conversion is finished.</p>

<p>-l Add explicit local declarations. protoize with -l
inserts a prototype declaration for each function in each
block which calls the function without any declaration. This
option applies only to protoize.</p>

<p>-N Make no .save files. The original files are simply
deleted. Use this option with caution.</p>

<p>-n Make no real changes. This mode just prints
information about the conversions that would have been done
without -n.</p>

<p>-p PROGRAM Use the program PROGRAM as the compiler.
Normally, the name gcc is used.</p>

<p>-q Work quietly. Most warnings are suppressed.</p>

<p>-v Print the version number, just like -v for gcc.</p>

<p>-x FILE List of files to exclude from the conversion
process.</p>

<p>If you need special compiler options to compile one of
your programs source files, then you should generate that
files .X file specially, by running gcc on that source file
with the appropriate options and the option -aux-info. Then
run protoize on the entire set of files. pro- toize will use
the existing .X file because it is newer than the source
file. For example:</p>

<p>You need to include the special files along with the
rest in the pro- toize command, even though their .X files
already exist, because other- wise they wont get
converted.</p>

particularly Running protoize sec- tion.</p>

<p>HISTORY Ron Guilmette implemented the protoize and
unprotoize tools.</p>

<p>CAVEATS The conversion programs protoize and unprotoize
can sometimes change a source file in a way that wont work
unless you rearrange it.</p>

<p>protoize can insert references to a type name or type
tag before the definition, or in a file where they are not
defined.</p>

<p>If this happens, compiler error messages should indicate
where the new references are, so fixing the file by hand is
straightforward.</p>

<p>There are some C constructs which protoize cannot figure
out. For example, it cant determine argument types for
declaring a pointer-to- function variable; this must be done
by hand. protoize inserts a com- ment containing ??? each
time it finds such a variable; all such vari- ables can be
found by searching for this string. ANSI C does not require
declaring the argument types of pointer-to-function
types.</p>

<p>Using unprotoize can easily introduce bugs. If the
program relied on prototypes to bring about conversion of
arguments, these conversions will not take place in the
program without prototypes. One case in which you can be
sure unprotoize is safe is when you are removing pro-
totypes that were made with protoize; if the program worked
before without any prototypes, it will work again without
them.</p>

<p>You can find all the places where this problem might
occur by compiling the program with the -Wconversion option.
It prints a warning whenever an argument is converted.</p>

<p>Both conversion programs can be confused if there are
macro calls in and around the text to be converted. In other
words, the standard syn- tax for a declaration or definition
must not result from expanding a macro. This problem is
inherent in the design of C and cannot be fixed. If only a
few functions have confusing macro calls, you can easily
convert them manually.</p>

<p>protoize cannot get the argument types for a function
whose definition was not actually compiled due to
preprocessing conditionals. When this happens, protoize
changes nothing in regard to such a function. pro- toize
tries to detect such instances and warn about them.</p>

<p>You can generally work around this problem by using
protoize step by step, each time specifying a different set
of -D options for compila- tion, until all of the functions
have been converted. There is no automatic way to verify
that you have got them all, however.</p>

<p>Confusion may result if there is an occasion to convert
a function dec- laration or definition in a region of source
code where there is more than one formal parameter list
present. Thus, attempts to convert code containing multiple
(conditionally compiled) versions of a single function
header (in the same vicinity) may not produce the desired
(or expected) results.</p>

<p>If you plan on converting source files which contain
such code, it is recommended that you first make sure that
each conditionally compiled region of source code which
contains an alternative function header also contains at
least one additional follower token (past the final right
parenthesis of the function header). This should circumvent
the problem.</p>

<p>unprotoize can become confused when trying to convert a
function defi- nition or declaration which contains a
declaration for a pointer-to- function formal argument which
has the same name as the function being defined or declared.
We recommand you avoid such choices of formal parameter
names.</p>

<p>It might be necessary to correct some of the indentation
by hand and break long lines. (The conversion programs dont
write lines longer than eighty characters in any case.)</p>
