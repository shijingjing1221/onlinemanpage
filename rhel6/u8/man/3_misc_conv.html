<p>MISC_CONV(3) Linux-PAM Manual MISC_CONV(3)</p>

<p>NAME misc_conv - text based conversation function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;security/pam_misc.h&gt;</p>

<p>void misc_conv(int num_msg, const struct pam_message
**msgm, struct pam_response **response, void
*appdata_ptr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The misc_conv function is part of
libpam_misc and not of the standard libpam library. This
function will prompt the user with the appropriate comments
and obtain the appropriate inputs as directed by
authentication modules.</p>

<p>In addition to simply slotting into the appropriate
pam_conv(3), this function provides some time-out
facilities. The function exports five variables that can be
used by an application programmer to limit the amount of
time this conversation function will spend waiting for the
user to type something. The five variabls are as
follows:</p>

<p>time_t pam_misc_conv_warn_time; This variable contains
the time (as returned by time(2)) that the user should be
first warned that the clock is ticking. By default it has
the value 0, which indicates that no such warning will be
given. The application may set its value to sometime in the
future, but this should be done prior to passing control to
the Linux-PAM library.</p>

<p>const char *pam_misc_conv_warn_line; Used in conjuction
with pam_misc_conv_warn_time, this variable is a pointer to
the string that will be displayed when it becomes time to
warn the user that the timeout is approaching. Its default
value is a translated version of ...Time is running out... ,
but this can be changed by the application prior to passing
control to Linux-PAM.</p>

<p>time_t pam_misc_conv_die_time; This variable contains
the time (as returned by time(2)) that the will time out. By
default it has the value 0, which indicates that the
conversation function will not timeout. The application may
set its value to sometime in the future, but this should be
done prior to passing control to the Linux-PAM library.</p>

<p>const char *pam_misc_conv_die_line; Used in conjuction
with pam_misc_conv_die_time, this variable is a pointer to
the string that will be displayed when the conversation
times out. Its default value is a translated version of
...Sorry, your time is up! , but this can be changed by the
application prior to passing control to Linux-PAM.</p>

<p>int pam_misc_conv_died; Following a return from the
Linux-PAM libraray, the value of this variable indicates
whether the conversation has timed out. A value of 1
indicates the time-out occurred.</p>

<p>The following two function pointers are available for
supporting binary prompts in the conversation function. They
are optimized for the current incarnation of the libpamc
library and are subject to change.</p>

<p>int (*pam_binary_handler_fn)(void *appdata, pamc_bp_t
*prompt_p); This function pointer is initialized to NULL but
can be filled with a function that provides machine-machine
(hidden) message exchange. It is intended for use with
hidden authentication protocols such as RSA or
Diffie-Hellman key exchanges. (This is still under
development.)</p>

<p>int (*pam_binary_handler_free)(void *appdata, pamc_bp_t
*delete_me); This function pointer is initialized to
PAM_BP_RENEW(delete_me, 0, 0), but can be redefined as
desired by the application.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pam_conv(3), pam(8)</p>

<p>STANDARDS The misc_conv function is part of the
libpam_misc Library and not defined in any standard.</p>
