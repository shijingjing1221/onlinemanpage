<p>NAME rpc.mountd - NFS mount daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/sbin/rpc.mountd [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rpc.mountd daemon implements the server
side of the NFS MOUNT pro- tocol, an NFS side protocol used
by NFS version 2 [RFC1094] and NFS version 3 [RFC1813].</p>

<p>An NFS server maintains a table of local physical file
systems that are accessible to NFS clients. Each file system
in this table is referred to as an exported file system, or
export, for short.</p>

<p>Each file system in the export table has an access
control list. rpc.mountd uses these access control lists to
determine whether an NFS client is permitted to access a
given file system. For details on how to manage your NFS
server s export table, see the exports(5) and exportfs(8)
man pages.</p>

<p>Mounting exported NFS File Systems The NFS MOUNT
protocol has several procedures. The most important of these
are MNT (mount an export) and UMNT (unmount an export).</p>

<p>A MNT request has two arguments: an explicit argument
that contains the pathname of the root directory of the
export to be mounted, and an implicit argument that is the
senders IP address.</p>

<p>When receiving a MNT request from an NFS client,
rpc.mountd checks both the pathname and the sender s IP
address against its export table. If the sender is permitted
to access the requested export, rpc.mountd returns an NFS
file handle for the exports root directory to the client.
The client can then use the root file handle and NFS LOOKUP
requests to navigate the directory structure of the
export.</p>

<p>The rmtab File The rpc.mountd daemon registers every
successful MNT request by adding an entry to the
/var/lib/nfs/rmtab file. When receivng a UMNT request from
an NFS client, rpc.mountd simply removes the matching entry
from /var/lib/nfs/rmtab, as long as the access control list
for that export allows that sender to access the export.</p>

<p>Clients can discover the list of file systems an NFS
server is cur- rently exporting, or the list of other
clients that have mounted its exports, by using the
showmount(8) command. showmount(8) uses other procedures in
the NFS MOUNT protocol to report information about the
servers exported file systems.</p>

<p>Note, however, that there is little to guarantee that
the contents of /var/lib/nfs/rmtab are accurate. A client
may continue accessing an export even after invoking UMNT.
If the client reboots without sending a UMNT request, stale
entries remain for that client in /var/lib/nfs/rmtab.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d kind or --debug kind Turn on debugging. Valid
kinds are: all, auth, call, general and parse.</p>

<p>-F or --foreground Run in foreground (do not
daemonize)</p>

<p>-f export-file or --exports-file export-file This option
specifies the exports file, listing the clients that this
server is prepared to serve and parameters to apply to each
such mount (see exports(5)). By default, export information
is read from /etc/exports.</p>

<p>-h or --help Display usage message.</p>

<p>-o num or --descriptors num Set the limit of the number
of open file descriptors to num. The default is to leave the
limit unchanged.</p>

<p>-N mountd-version or --no-nfs-version mountd-version
This option can be used to request that rpc.mountd do not
offer certain versions of NFS. The current version of
rpc.mountd can support both NFS version 2, 3 and 4. If the
either one of these version should not be offered,
rpc.mountd must be invoked with the option --no-nfs-version
&lt;vers&gt; .</p>

<p>-n or --no-tcp Dont advertise TCP for mount.</p>

<p>-P Ignored (compatibility with unfsd??).</p>

<p>-p num or --port num Specifies the port number used for
RPC listener sockets. If this option is not specified,
rpc.mountd chooses a random ephemeral port for each listener
socket.</p>

<p>This option can be used to fix the port value of
rpc.mountds listeners when NFS MOUNT requests must traverse
a firewall between clients and servers.</p>

<p>-H prog or --ha-callout prog Specify a high availability
callout program. This program receives callouts for all
MOUNT and UNMOUNT requests. This allows rpc.mountd to be
used in a High Availability NFS (HA-NFS) environment.</p>

<p>The callout program is run with 4 arguments. The first
is mount or unmount depending on the reason for the callout.
The second will be the name of the client performing the
mount. The third will be the path that the client is
mounting. The last is the number of concurrent mounts that
we believe the client has of that path.</p>

<p>This callout is not needed with 2.6 and later kernels.
Instead, mount the nfsd filesystem on /proc/fs/nfsd.</p>

<p>-s, --state-directory-path directory Specify a directory
in which to place statd state information. If this option is
not specified the default of /var/lib/nfs is used.</p>

<p>-r, --reverse-lookup rpc.mountd tracks IP addresses in
the rmtab file. When a DUMP request is made (by someone
running showmount -a, for instance), it returns IP addresses
instead of hostnames by default. This option causes
rpc.mountd to perform a reverse lookup on each IP address
and return that hostname instead. Enabling this can have a
substantial negative effect on performance in some situa-
tions.</p>

<p>-t N or --num-threads=Nor --num-threads N This option
specifies the number of worker threads that rpc.mountd
spawns. The default is 1 thread, which is probably enough.
More threads are usually only needed for NFS servers which
need to handle mount storms of hundreds of NFS mounts in a
few seconds, or when your DNS server is slow or
unreliable.</p>

<p>-V version or --nfs-version version This option can be
used to request that rpc.mountd offer certain versions of
NFS. The current version of rpc.mountd can support both NFS
version 2 and the newer version 3.</p>

<p>-v or --version Print the version of rpc.mountd and
exit.</p>

<p>-g or --manage-gids Accept requests from the kernel to
map user id numbers into lists of group id numbers for use
in access control. An NFS request will normally (except when
using Kerberos or other cryp- tographic authentication)
contains a user-id and a list of group-ids. Due to a
limitation in the NFS protocol, at most 16 groups ids can be
listed. If you use the -g flag, then the list of group ids
received from the client will be replaced by a list of group
ids determined by an appropriate lookup on the server. Note
that the primary group id is not affected so a newgroup
command on the client will still be effective. This function
requires a Linux Kernel with version at least 2.6.21.</p>

<p>TCP_WRAPPERS SUPPORT You can protect your rpc.mountd
listeners using the tcp_wrapper library or iptables(8).</p>

<p>Note that the tcp_wrapper library supports only IPv4
networking.</p>

<p>Add the hostnames of NFS peers that are allowed to
access rpc.mountd to /etc/hosts.allow. Use the daemon name
mountd even if the rpc.mountd binary has a different
name.</p>

<p>Hostnames used in either access file will be ignored
when they can not be resolved into IP addresses. For further
information see the tcpd(8) and hosts_access(5) man
pages.</p>

<p>IPv6 and TI-RPC support TI-RPC is a pre-requisite for
supporting NFS on IPv6. If TI-RPC sup- port is built into
rpc.mountd, it attempts to start listeners on net- work
transports marked visible in /etc/netconfig. As long as at
least one network transport listener starts successfully,
rpc.mountd will operate.</p>

exports, export options, and access control lists</p>
