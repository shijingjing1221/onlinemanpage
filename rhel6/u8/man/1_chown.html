<p>NAME chown - change file owner and group</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS chown [OPTION]... [OWNER][:[GROUP]] FILE...
chown [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents the GNU version
of chown. chown changes the user and/or group ownership of
each given file. If only an owner (a user name or numeric
user ID) is given, that user is made the owner of each given
file, and the files group is not changed. If the owner is
followed by a colon and a group name (or numeric group ID),
with no spaces between them, the group ownership of the
files is changed as well. If a colon but no group name
follows the user name, that user is made the owner of the
files and the group of the files is changed to that users
login group. If the colon and group are given, but the owner
is omitted, only the group of the files is changed; in this
case, chown performs the same function as chgrp. If only a
colon is given, or if the entire operand is empty, neither
the owner nor the group is changed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Change the owner and/or group of each FILE to
OWNER and/or GROUP. With --reference, change the owner and
group of each FILE to those of RFILE.</p>

<p>-c, --changes like verbose but report only when a change
is made</p>

<p>--dereference affect the referent of each symbolic link
(this is the default), rather than the symbolic link
itself</p>

<p>-h, --no-dereference affect each symbolic link instead
of any referenced file (useful only on systems that can
change the ownership of a symlink)</p>

<p>--from=CURRENT_OWNER:CURRENT_GROUP change the owner
and/or group of each file only if its current owner and/or
group match those specified here. Either may be omitted, in
which case a match is not required for the omitted
attribute.</p>

<p>--no-preserve-root do not treat / specially (the
default)</p>

<p>--preserve-root fail to operate recursively on /</p>

<p>-f, --silent, --quiet suppress most error messages</p>

<p>--reference=RFILE use RFILEs owner and group rather than
specifying OWNER:GROUP values</p>

<p>-R, --recursive operate on files and directories
recursively</p>

<p>-v, --verbose output a diagnostic for every file
processed</p>

<p>The following options modify how a hierarchy is
traversed when the -R option is also specified. If more than
one is specified, only the final one takes effect.</p>

<p>-H if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a
directory, traverse it</p>

<p>-L traverse every symbolic link to a directory
encountered</p>

<p>-P do not traverse any symbolic links (default)</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>Owner is unchanged if missing. Group is unchanged if
missing, but changed to login group if implied by a :
following a symbolic OWNER. OWNER and GROUP may be numeric
as well as symbolic.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES chown root /u Change the owner of /u to
&quot;root&quot;.</p>

<p>chown root:staff /u Likewise, but also change its group
to &quot;staff&quot;.</p>

<p>chown -hR root /u Change the owner of /u and subfiles to
&quot;root&quot;.</p>
