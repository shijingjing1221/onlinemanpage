<p>NAME vncpasswd - change the VNC password</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vncpasswd [passwd-file] vncpasswd -f</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vncpasswd allows you to set the password
used to access VNC desktops. Its default behavior is to
prompt for a VNC password and then store an obfuscated
version of this password to passwd-file (or to
$HOME/.vnc/passwd if no password file is specified.) The
vncserver script runs vncpasswd the first time you start a
VNC desktop, and it invokes Xvnc with the appropriate
-rfbauth option. vncviewer can also be given a password file
to use via the -passwd option.</p>

<p>The password must be at least six characters long
(unless the -f com- mand-line option is used-- see below),
and only the first eight charac- ters are significant. Note
that the stored password is not encrypted securely - anyone
who has access to this file can trivially find out the
plain-text password, so vncpasswd always sets appropriate
permis- sions (read and write only by the owner.) However,
when accessing a VNC desktop, a challenge-response mechanism
is used over the wire mak- ing it hard for anyone to crack
the password simply by snooping on the network.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Filter mode. Read a plain-text password from
stdin and write an encrypted version to stdout. Note that in
filter mode, short or even empty passwords will be silently
accepted.</p>

<p>FILES $HOME/.vnc/passwd Default location of the VNC
password file.</p>
