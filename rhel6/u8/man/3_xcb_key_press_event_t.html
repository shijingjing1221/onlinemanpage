<p>NAME xcb_key_press_event_t - a key was
pressed/released</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</p>

<p>Event datastructure typedef struct xcb_key_press_event_t
{ uint8_t response_type; xcb_keycode_t detail; uint16_t
sequence; xcb_timestamp_t time; xcb_window_t root;
xcb_window_t event; xcb_window_t child; int16_t root_x;
int16_t root_y; int16_t event_x; int16_t event_y; uint16_t
state; uint8_t same_screen; uint8_t pad0; }
xcb_key_press_event_t;</p>

<p>EVENT FIELDS response_type The type of this event, in
this case XCB_KEY_PRESS. This field is also present in the
xcb_generic_event_t and can be used to tell events apart
from each other.</p>

<p>sequence The sequence number of the last request
processed by the X11 server.</p>

<p>detail The keycode (a number representing a physical key
on the key- board) of the key which was pressed.</p>

<p>time Time when the event was generated (in
milliseconds).</p>

<p>root The root window of child.</p>

<p>event NOT YET DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>child NOT YET DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>root_x The X coordinate of the pointer relative to the
root window at the time of the event.</p>

<p>root_y The Y coordinate of the pointer relative to the
root window at the time of the event.</p>

<p>event_x If same_screen is true, this is the X coordinate
relative to the event window s origin. Otherwise, event_x
will be set to zero.</p>

<p>event_y If same_screen is true, this is the Y coordinate
relative to the event window s origin. Otherwise, event_y
will be set to zero.</p>

<p>state The logical state of the pointer buttons and
modifier keys just prior to the event.</p>

<p>same_screen Whether the event window is on the same
screen as the root window.</p>
