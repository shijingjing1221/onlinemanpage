<p>NAME XmImMbLookupString An input manager function that
retrieves a com- posed string from an input method</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/XmIm.h&gt; int
XmImMbLookupString( Widget widget, XKeyPressedEvent *event,
char *buffer_return, int bytes_buffer, KeySym
*keysym_return, int *status_return);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmImMbLookupString returns a string composed
in the locale associated with the widget s input method and
a KeySym that is currently mapped to the keycode in a
KeyPress event. The KeySym is obtained by using the standard
interpretation of Shift, Lock and Group modifiers as defined
in the X Protocol specification.</p>

<p>An XIM will be created, but an XIC will not be created.
One of the functions, XmImSetValues, XmImVaSetValues, or
XmImGetXIC, needs to be called to create an XIC.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the ID of the widget registered with
the input man- ager</p>

<p>event Specifies the key press event</p>

<p>buffer_return Specifies the buffer in which the string
is returned</p>

<p>bytes_buffer Specifies the size of the buffer in
bytes</p>

<p>keysym_return Specifies a pointer to the KeySym returned
if one exists</p>

<p>status_return Specifies the status values returned by
the function. These status values are the same as those for
the XmbLookupString function. The possible status values
are:</p>

<p>XBufferOverflow The size of the buffer was insufficient
to handle the returned string. The contents of buffer_return
and keysym_return are not modified. The required buffer size
is returned as a value of the function. The client should
repeat the call with a larger buffer size to receive the
string.</p>

<p>XLookupNone No consistent input was composed. The
contents of buffer_return and keysym_return are not modified
and the function returns a value of 0.</p>

<p>XLookupChars Some input characters were composed and
returned in buffer_return. The content of keysym_return is
not modified. The function returns the length of the string
in bytes.</p>

<p>XLookupKeysym A keysym value was returned instead of a
string. The content of buffer_return is not modified and the
function returns a value of 0.</p>

<p>XLookupBoth A keysym value and a string were returned.
The keysym value may not necessarily correspond to the
string returned. The function returns the length of the
string in bytes.</p>

<p>RETURN Return values depend on the status returned by
the function. Refer to the description of status values
above.</p>
