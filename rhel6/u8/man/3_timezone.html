<p>TZSET(3) Linux Programmer s Manual TZSET(3)</p>

<p>NAME tzset, tzname, timezone, daylight - initialize time
conversion informa- tion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>void tzset (void);</p>

<p>extern char *tzname[2]; extern long timezone; extern int
daylight;</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>tzset(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE ||
_POSIX_SOURCE tzname: _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 1 ||
_XOPEN_SOURCE || _POSIX_SOURCE timezone: _SVID_SOURCE ||
_XOPEN_SOURCE daylight: _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tzset() function initializes the tzname
variable from the TZ envi- ronment variable. This function
is automatically called by the other time conversion
functions that depend on the timezone. In a System-V- like
environment it will also set the variables timezone (seconds
West of GMT) and daylight (0 if this timezone does not have
any daylight saving time rules, non-zero if there is a time
during the year when daylight saving time applies).</p>

<p>If the TZ variable does not appear in the environment,
the tzname vari- able is initialized with the best
approximation of local wall clock time, as specified by the
tzfile(5)-format file localtime found in the system timezone
directory (see below). (One also often sees /etc/localtime
used here, a symlink to the right file in the system
timezone directory.)</p>

<p>If the TZ variable does appear in the environment but
its value is empty or its value cannot be interpreted using
any of the formats spec- ified below, Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC) is used.</p>

<p>The value of TZ can be one of three formats. The first
format is used when there is no daylight saving time in the
local timezone:</p>

<p>std offset</p>

<p>The std string specifies the name of the timezone and
must be three or more alphabetic characters. The offset
string immediately follows std and specifies the time value
to be added to the local time to get Coor- dinated Universal
Time (UTC). The offset is positive if the local timezone is
west of the Prime Meridian and negative if it is east. The
hour must be between 0 and 24, and the minutes and seconds 0
and 59.</p>

<p>The second format is used when there is daylight saving
time:</p>

<p>std offset dst [offset],start[/time],end[/time]</p>

<p>There are no spaces in the specification. The initial
std and offset specify the standard timezone, as described
above. The dst string and offset specify the name and offset
for the corresponding daylight sav- ing timezone. If the
offset is omitted, it default to one hour ahead of standard
time.</p>

<p>The start field specifies when daylight saving time goes
into effect and the end field specifies when the change is
made back to standard time. These fields may have the
following formats:</p>

<p>Jn This specifies the Julian day with n between 1 and
365. Febru- ary 29 is never counted even in leap years.</p>

<p>n This specifies the Julian day with n between 0 and
365. Febru- ary 29 is counted in leap years.</p>

<p>Mm.w.d This specifies day d (0 &lt;= d &lt;= 6) of week
w (1 &lt;= w &lt;= 5) of month m (1 &lt;= m &lt;= 12). Week
1 is the first week in which day d occurs and week 5 is the
last week in which day d occurs. Day 0 is a Sunday.</p>

<p>The time fields specify when, in the local time
currently in effect, the change to the other time occurs. If
omitted, the default is 02:00:00.</p>

<p>Here is an example for New Zealand, where the standard
time (NZST) is 12 hours ahead of UTC, and daylight saving
time (NZDT), 13 hours ahead of UTC, runs from the first
Sunday in October to the third Sunday in March, and the
changeovers happen at the default time of 02:00:00:</p>


<p>TZ=&quot;NZST-12.00:00NZDT-13:00:00,M10.1.0,M3.3.0&quot;</p>

<p>The third format specifies that the timezone information
should be read from a file:</p>

<p>:[filespec]</p>

<p>If the file specification filespec is omitted, the
timezone information is read from the file localtime in the
system timezone directory, which nowadays usually is
/usr/share/zoneinfo. This file is in tzfile(5) format. If
filespec is given, it specifies another tzfile(5)-format
file to read the timezone information from. If filespec does
not begin with a &rsquo;/&rsquo;, the file specification is
relative to the system timezone directory.</p>

<p>Heres an example, once more for New Zealand:</p>

<p>TZ=&quot;:Pacific/Auckland&quot;</p>

<p>FILES The system timezone directory used depends on the
(g)libc version. Libc4 and libc5 use /usr/lib/zoneinfo, and,
since libc-5.4.6, when this doesnt work, will try
/usr/share/zoneinfo. Glibc2 will use the envi- ronment
variable TZDIR, when that exists. Its default depends on how
it was installed, but normally is /usr/share/zoneinfo.</p>

<p>This timezone directory contains the files localtime
local timezone file posixrules rules for POSIX-style TZs</p>

<p>Often /etc/localtime is a symlink to the file localtime
or to the cor- rect timezone file in the system timezone
directory.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD.</p>

<p>NOTES Note that the variable daylight does not indicate
that daylight saving time applies right now. It used to give
the number of some algorithm (see the variable tz_dsttime in
gettimeofday(2)). It has been obsolete for many years but is
required by SUSv2.</p>

<p>4.3BSD had a function char *timezone(zone, dst) that
returned the name of the timezone corresponding to its first
argument (minutes West of GMT). If the second argument was
0, the standard name was used, other- wise the daylight
saving time version.</p>
