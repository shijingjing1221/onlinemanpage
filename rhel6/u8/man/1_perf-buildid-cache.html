PERF-BUILDID-CACHE(1)</p>

<p>NAME perf-buildid-cache - Manage build-id cache.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS perf buildid-cache &lt;options&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command manages the build-id cache. It
can add, remove, update and purge files to/from the cache.
In the future it should as well set upper limits for the
space used by the cache, etc.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a, --add= Add specified file to the cache.</p>

<p>-k, --kcore Add specified kcore file to the cache. For
the current host that is /proc/kcore which requires root
permissions to read. Be aware that running perf
buildid-cache as root may update root s build-id cache not
the users. Use the -v option to see where the file is
created. Note that the copied file contains only code
sections not the whole core image. Note also that files
&quot;kallsyms&quot; and &quot;modules&quot; must also be in
the same directory and are also copied. All 3 files are
created with read permissions for root only. kcore will not
be added if there is already a kcore in the cache (with the
same build-id) that has the same modules at the same
addresses. Use the -v option to see if a copy of kcore is
actually made.</p>

<p>-r, --remove= Remove a cached binary which has same
build-id of specified file from the cache.</p>

<p>-p, --purge= Purge all cached binaries including older
caches which have specified path from the cache.</p>

<p>-M, --missing= List missing build ids in the cache for
the specified file.</p>

<p>-u, --update= Update specified file of the cache. Note
that this doesnt remove older entires since those may be
still needed for annotating old (or remote) perf.data. Only
if there is already a cache which has exactly same build-id,
that is replaced by new one. It can be used to update
kallsyms and kernel dso to vmlinux in order to support
annotation.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Be more verbose.</p>
