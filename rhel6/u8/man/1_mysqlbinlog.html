<p>MYSQLBINLOG(1) MySQL Database System MYSQLBINLOG(1)</p>

<p>NAME mysqlbinlog - utility for processing binary log
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysqlbinlog [options] log_file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The server&rsquo;s binary log consists of
files containing events that describe modifications to
database contents. The server writes these files in binary
format. To display their contents in text format, use the
mysqlbinlog utility. You can also use mysqlbinlog to display
the contents of relay log files written by a slave server in
a replication setup because relay logs have the same format
as binary logs. The binary log and relay log are discussed
further in Section 5.2.4, The Binary Log , and Section
16.2.2, Replication Relay and Status Logs.</p>

<p>Invoke mysqlbinlog like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlbinlog [options] log_file ...</p>

<p>For example, to display the contents of the binary log
file named binlog.000003, use this command:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlbinlog binlog.0000003</p>

<p>The output includes events contained in binlog.000003.
For statement-based logging, event information includes the
SQL statement, the ID of the server on which it was
executed, the timestamp when the statement was executed, how
much time it took, and so forth. For row-based logging, the
event indicates a row change rather than an SQL statement.
See Section 16.1.2, Replication Formats , for information
about logging modes.</p>

<p>Events are preceded by header comments that provide
additional information. For example:</p>

<p># at 141 #100309 9:28:36 server id 123 end_log_pos 245
Query thread_id=3350 exec_time=11 error_code=0</p>

<p>In the first line, the number following at indicates the
starting position of the event in the binary log file.</p>

<p>The second line starts with a date and time indicating
when the statement started on the server where the event
originated. For replication, this timestamp is propagated to
slave servers. server id is the server_id value of the
server where the event originated. end_log_pos indicates
where the next event starts (that is, it is the end position
of the current event + 1). thread_id indicates which thread
executed the event. exec_time is the time spent executing
the event, on a master server. On a slave, it is the
difference of the end execution time on the slave minus the
beginning execution time on the master. The difference
serves as an indicator of how much replication lags behind
the master. error_code indicates the result from executing
the event. Zero means that no error occurred.</p>

<p>The output from mysqlbinlog can be re-executed (for
example, by using it as input to mysql) to redo the
statements in the log. This is useful for recovery
operations after a server crash. For other usage examples,
see the discussion later in this section and in Section 7.5,
Point-in- Time (Incremental) Recovery Using the Binary
Log.</p>

<p>Normally, you use mysqlbinlog to read binary log files
directly and apply them to the local MySQL server. It is
also possible to read binary logs from a remote server by
using the --read-from-remote-server option. To read remote
binary logs, the connection parameter options can be given
to indicate how to connect to the server. These options are
--host, --password, --port, --protocol, --socket, and
--user; they are ignored except when you also use the
--read-from-remote-server option.</p>

<p>mysqlbinlog supports the following options, which can be
specified on the command line or in the [mysqlbinlog] and
[client] groups of an option file. mysqlbinlog also supports
the options for processing option files described at Section
4.2.3.4, Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File
Handling.</p>

<p>&middot; --help, -?</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --base64-output[=value]</p>

<p>This option determines when events should be displayed
encoded as base-64 strings using BINLOG statements. The
option has these permissible values (not case
sensitive):</p>

<p>&middot; AUTO (&quot;automatic&quot;) or UNSPEC
(&quot;unspecified&quot;) displays BINLOG statements
automatically when necessary (that is, for format
description events and row events). If no --base64-output
option is given, the effect is the same as
--base64-output=AUTO.</p>

<p>Note Automatic BINLOG display is the only safe behavior
if you intend to use the output of mysqlbinlog to re-execute
binary log file contents. The other option values are
intended only for debugging or testing purposes because they
may produce output that does not include all events in
executable form.</p>

<p>&middot; ALWAYS displays BINLOG statements whenever
possible. If the --base64-output option is given without a
value, the effect is the same as --base64-output=ALWAYS.</p>

<p>&middot; NEVER causes BINLOG statements not to be
displayed. mysqlbinlog exits with an error if a row event is
found that must be displayed using BINLOG.</p>

<p>&middot; DECODE-ROWS specifies to mysqlbinlog that you
intend for row events to be decoded and displayed as
commented SQL statements by also specifying the --verbose
option. Like NEVER, DECODE-ROWS suppresses display of BINLOG
statements, but unlike NEVER, it does not exit with an error
if a row event is found.</p>

<p>The --base64-output option was introduced in MySQL
5.1.5, to be given as --base64-output or
--skip-base64-output (with the sense of AUTO or NEVER). The
option values described in the preceding list may be used as
of MySQL 5.1.24, with the exception of UNSPEC and
DECODE-ROWS, which are available as of MySQL 5.1.28.</p>

<p>For examples that show the effect of --base64-output and
--verbose on row event output, see the section called
MYSQLBINLOG ROW EVENT DISPLAY.</p>

<p>&middot; --bind-address=ip_address</p>

<p>On a computer having multiple network interfaces, this
option can be used to select which interface is employed
when connecting to the MySQL server.</p>

<p>This option is supported only in the version of
mysqlbinlog that is supplied with MySQL Cluster, beginning
with MySQL Cluster NDB 6.3.4. It is not available in
standard MySQL 5.1 releases.</p>

<p>&middot; --character-sets-dir=path</p>

<p>The directory where character sets are installed. See
Section 10.5, Character Set Configuration.</p>

<p>&middot; --database=db_name, -d db_name</p>

<p>This option causes mysqlbinlog to output entries from
the binary log (local log only) that occur while db_name is
been selected as the default database by USE.</p>

<p>The --database option for mysqlbinlog is similar to the
--binlog-do-db option for mysqld, but can be used to specify
only one database. If --database is given multiple times,
only the last instance is used.</p>

<p>The effects of this option depend on whether the
statement-based or row-based logging format is in use, in
the same way that the effects of --binlog-do-db depend on
whether statement-based or row-based logging is in use.</p>

<p>Statement-based logging. The --database option works as
follows:</p>

<p>&middot; While db_name is the default database,
statements are output whether they modify tables in db_name
or a different database.</p>

<p>&middot; Unless db_name is selected as the default
database, statements are not output, even if they modify
tables in db_name.</p>

<p>&middot; There is an exception for CREATE DATABASE,
ALTER DATABASE, and DROP DATABASE. The database being
created, altered, or dropped is considered to be the default
database when determining whether to output the
statement.</p>

<p>Suppose that the binary log was created by executing
these statements using statement-based-logging:</p>

<p>INSERT INTO test.t1 (i) VALUES(100); INSERT INTO db2.t2
(j) VALUES(200); USE test; INSERT INTO test.t1 (i)
VALUES(101); INSERT INTO t1 (i) VALUES(102); INSERT INTO
db2.t2 (j) VALUES(201); USE db2; INSERT INTO test.t1 (i)
VALUES(103); INSERT INTO db2.t2 (j) VALUES(202); INSERT INTO
t2 (j) VALUES(203);</p>

<p>mysqlbinlog --database=test does not output the first
two INSERT statements because there is no default database.
It outputs the three INSERT statements following USE test,
but not the three INSERT statements following USE db2.</p>

<p>mysqlbinlog --database=db2 does not output the first two
INSERT statements because there is no default database. It
does not output the three INSERT statements following USE
test, but does output the three INSERT statements following
USE db2.</p>

<p>Row-based logging. mysqlbinlog outputs only entries that
change tables belonging to db_name. The default database has
no effect on this. Suppose that the binary log just
described was created using row-based logging rather than
statement-based logging. mysqlbinlog --database=test outputs
only those entries that modify t1 in the test database,
regardless of whether USE was issued or what the default
database is. If a server is running with binlog_format set
to MIXED and you want it to be possible to use mysqlbinlog
with the --database option, you must ensure that tables that
are modified are in the database selected by USE. (In
particular, no cross-database updates should be used.)</p>

<p>This option did not work correctly for mysqlbinlog with
row-based logging prior to MySQL 5.1.37. (Bug #42941)</p>

<p>Note Prior to MySQL Cluster NDB 7.0.28 and MySQL Cluster
NDB 7.1.17, this option did not work correctly with MySQL
Cluster tables unless, unless the binary log was generated
using --log-bin-use-v1-row-events=0. (Bug #13067813)</p>

<p>&middot; --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]</p>

<p>Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
&rsquo;d:t:o,file_name&rsquo;. The default is
&rsquo;d:t:o,/tmp/mysqlbinlog.trace&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug-check</p>

<p>Print some debugging information when the program exits.
This option was added in MySQL 5.1.21.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug-info</p>

<p>Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage
statistics when the program exits. This option was added in
MySQL 5.1.21.</p>

<p>&middot; --disable-log-bin, -D</p>

<p>Disable binary logging. This is useful for avoiding an
endless loop if you use the --to-last-log option and are
sending the output to the same MySQL server. This option
also is useful when restoring after a crash to avoid
duplication of the statements you have logged.</p>

<p>This option requires that you have the SUPER privilege.
It causes mysqlbinlog to include a SET sql_log_bin = 0
statement in its output to disable binary logging of the
remaining output. The SET statement is ineffective unless
you have the SUPER privilege.</p>

<p>&middot; --force-if-open, -F</p>

<p>Read binary log files even if they are open or were not
closed properly. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.15.</p>

<p>&middot; --force-read, -f</p>

<p>With this option, if mysqlbinlog reads a binary log
event that it does not recognize, it prints a warning,
ignores the event, and continues. Without this option,
mysqlbinlog stops if it reads such an event.</p>

<p>&middot; --hexdump, -H</p>

<p>Display a hex dump of the log in comments, as described
in the section called MYSQLBINLOG HEX DUMP FORMAT . The hex
output can be helpful for replication debugging. This option
was added in MySQL 5.1.2.</p>

<p>&middot; --host=host_name, -h host_name</p>

<p>Get the binary log from the MySQL server on the given
host.</p>

<p>&middot; --local-load=path, -l path</p>

<p>Prepare local temporary files for LOAD DATA INFILE in
the specified directory.</p>

<p>Important These temporary files are not automatically
removed by mysqlbinlog or any other MySQL program.</p>

<p>&middot; --offset=N, -o N</p>

<p>Skip the first N entries in the log.</p>

<p>&middot; --password[=password], -p[password]</p>

<p>The password to use when connecting to the server. If
you use the short option form (-p), you cannot have a space
between the option and the password. If you omit the
password value following the --password or -p option on the
command line, mysqlbinlog prompts for one.</p>

<p>Specifying a password on the command line should be
considered insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, End-User
Guidelines for Password Security . You can use an option
file to avoid giving the password on the command line.</p>

<p>&middot; --port=port_num, -P port_num</p>

<p>The TCP/IP port number to use for connecting to a remote
server.</p>

<p>&middot; --position=N</p>

<p>Deprecated. Use --start-position instead. --position is
removed in MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>&middot; --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}</p>

<p>The connection protocol to use for connecting to the
server. It is useful when the other connection parameters
normally would cause a protocol to be used other than the
one you want. For details on the permissible values, see
Section 4.2.2, Connecting to the MySQL Server.</p>

<p>&middot; --read-from-remote-server, -R</p>

<p>Read the binary log from a MySQL server rather than
reading a local log file. Any connection parameter options
are ignored unless this option is given as well. These
options are --host, --password, --port, --protocol,
--socket, and --user.</p>

<p>This option requires that the remote server be running.
It works only for binary log files on the remote server, not
relay log files.</p>

<p>&middot; --result-file=name, -r name</p>

<p>Direct output to the given file.</p>

<p>&middot; --server-id=id</p>

<p>Display only those events created by the server having
the given server ID. This option is available as of MySQL
5.1.4.</p>

<p>&middot; --server-id-bits=N</p>

<p>Use only the first N bits of the server_id to identify
the server. If the binary log was written by a mysqld with
server-id-bits set to less than 32 and user data stored in
the most significant bit, running mysqlbinlog with
--server-id-bits set to 32 enables this data to be seen.</p>

<p>This option was added in MySQL Cluster NDB 7.0.17 and
MySQL Cluster NDB 7.1.6, and is supported only by the
versions of mysqlbinlog supplied with these and later
releases of MySQL Cluster.</p>

<p>&middot; --set-charset=charset_name</p>

<p>Add a SET NAMES charset_name statement to the output to
specify the character set to be used for processing log
files. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.12.</p>

<p>&middot; --short-form, -s</p>

<p>Display only the statements contained in the log,
without any extra information or row-based events. This is
for testing only, and should not be used in production
systems.</p>

<p>&middot; --socket=path, -S path</p>

<p>For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to
use, or, on Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.</p>

<p>&middot; --start-datetime=datetime</p>

<p>Start reading the binary log at the first event having a
timestamp equal to or later than the datetime argument. The
datetime value is relative to the local time zone on the
machine where you run mysqlbinlog. The value should be in a
format accepted for the DATETIME or TIMESTAMP data types.
For example:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlbinlog --start-datetime=&quot;2005-12-25
11:25:56&quot; binlog.000003</p>

<p>This option is useful for point-in-time recovery. See
Section 7.3, Example Backup and Recovery Strategy.</p>

<p>&middot; --start-position=N, -j N</p>

<p>Start reading the binary log at the first event having a
position equal to or greater than N. This option applies to
the first log file named on the command line.</p>

<p>This option is useful for point-in-time recovery. See
Section 7.3, Example Backup and Recovery Strategy.</p>

<p>&middot; --stop-datetime=datetime</p>

<p>Stop reading the binary log at the first event having a
timestamp equal to or later than the datetime argument. This
option is useful for point-in-time recovery. See the
description of the --start-datetime option for information
about the datetime value.</p>

<p>This option is useful for point-in-time recovery. See
Section 7.3, Example Backup and Recovery Strategy.</p>

<p>&middot; --stop-position=N</p>

<p>Stop reading the binary log at the first event having a
position equal to or greater than N. This option applies to
the last log file named on the command line.</p>

<p>This option is useful for point-in-time recovery. See
Section 7.3, Example Backup and Recovery Strategy.</p>

<p>&middot; --to-last-log, -t</p>

<p>Do not stop at the end of the requested binary log from
a MySQL server, but rather continue printing until the end
of the last binary log. If you send the output to the same
MySQL server, this may lead to an endless loop. This option
requires --read-from-remote-server.</p>

<p>&middot; --user=user_name, -u user_name</p>

<p>The MySQL user name to use when connecting to a remote
server.</p>

<p>&middot; --verbose, -v</p>

<p>Reconstruct row events and display them as commented SQL
statements. If this option is given twice, the output
includes comments to indicate column data types and some
metadata. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.28.</p>

<p>For examples that show the effect of --base64-output and
--verbose on row event output, see the section called
MYSQLBINLOG ROW EVENT DISPLAY.</p>

<p>&middot; --version, -V</p>

<p>Display version information and exit.</p>

<p>In MySQL 5.1, the version number shown for mysqlbinlog
is always 3.3.</p>

<p>You can also set the following variable by using
--var_name=value syntax:</p>

<p>&middot; open_files_limit</p>

<p>Specify the number of open file descriptors to
reserve.</p>

<p>You can pipe the output of mysqlbinlog into the mysql
client to execute the events contained in the binary log.
This technique is used to recover from a crash when you have
an old backup (see Section 7.5, Point-in-Time (Incremental)
Recovery Using the Binary Log ). For example:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 | mysql -u root
-p</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlbinlog binlog.[0-9]* | mysql -u root
-p</p>

<p>You can also redirect the output of mysqlbinlog to a
text file instead, if you need to modify the statement log
first (for example, to remove statements that you do not
want to execute for some reason). After editing the file,
execute the statements that it contains by using it as input
to the mysql program:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 &gt; tmpfile
shell&gt; ... edit tmpfile ... shell&gt; mysql -u root -p
&lt; tmpfile</p>

<p>When mysqlbinlog is invoked with the --start-position
option, it displays only those events with an offset in the
binary log greater than or equal to a given position (the
given position must match the start of one event). It also
has options to stop and start when it sees an event with a
given date and time. This enables you to perform
point-in-time recovery using the --stop-datetime option (to
be able to say, for example, roll forward my databases to
how they were today at 10:30 a.m.).</p>

<p>If you have more than one binary log to execute on the
MySQL server, the safe method is to process them all using a
single connection to the server. Here is an example that
demonstrates what may be unsafe:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 | mysql -u root -p #
DANGER!! shell&gt; mysqlbinlog binlog.000002 | mysql -u root
-p # DANGER!!</p>

<p>Processing binary logs this way using multiple
connections to the server causes problems if the first log
file contains a CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE statement and the
second log contains a statement that uses the temporary
table. When the first mysql process terminates, the server
drops the temporary table. When the second mysql process
attempts to use the table, the server reports unknown
table.</p>

<p>To avoid problems like this, use a single mysql process
to execute the contents of all binary logs that you want to
process. Here is one way to do so:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 binlog.000002 |
mysql -u root -p</p>

<p>Another approach is to write all the logs to a single
file and then process the file:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 &gt;
/tmp/statements.sql shell&gt; mysqlbinlog binlog.000002
&gt;&gt; /tmp/statements.sql shell&gt; mysql -u root -p -e
&quot;source /tmp/statements.sql&quot;</p>

<p>mysqlbinlog can produce output that reproduces a LOAD
DATA INFILE operation without the original data file.
mysqlbinlog copies the data to a temporary file and writes a
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE statement that refers to the file.
The default location of the directory where these files are
written is system-specific. To specify a directory
explicitly, use the --local-load option.</p>

<p>Because mysqlbinlog converts LOAD DATA INFILE statements
to LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE statements (that is, it adds
LOCAL), both the client and the server that you use to
process the statements must be configured with the LOCAL
capability enabled. See Section 6.1.6, Security Issues with
LOAD DATA LOCAL.</p>

<p>Warning The temporary files created for LOAD DATA LOCAL
statements are not automatically deleted because they are
needed until you actually execute those statements. You
should delete the temporary files yourself after you no
longer need the statement log. The files can be found in the
temporary file directory and have names like
original_file_name-#-#.</p>

<p>MYSQLBINLOG HEX DUMP FORMAT The --hexdump option causes
mysqlbinlog to produce a hex dump of the binary log
contents:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlbinlog --hexdump master-bin.000001</p>

<p>The hex output consists of comment lines beginning with
#, so the output might look like this for the preceding
command:</p>

<p>/*!40019 SET @@session.max_insert_delayed_threads=0*/;
/*!50003 SET

<p>Hex dump output currently contains the elements in the
following list. This format is subject to change. (For more
information about binary log format, see MySQL Internals:
The Binary Log[1].</p>

<p>&middot; Position: The byte position within the log
file.</p>

<p>&middot; Timestamp: The event timestamp. In the example

<p>MYSQLBINLOG ROW EVENT DISPLAY The following examples
illustrate how mysqlbinlog displays row events that specify
data modifications. These correspond to events with the
WRITE_ROWS_EVENT, UPDATE_ROWS_EVENT, and DELETE_ROWS_EVENT
type codes. The --base64-output=DECODE-ROWS and --verbose
options may be used to affect row event output. These
options are available as of MySQL 5.1.28.</p>

<p>Suppose that the server is using row-based binary
logging and that you execute the following sequence of
statements:</p>

<p>CREATE TABLE t ( id INT NOT NULL, name VARCHAR(20) NOT
NULL, date DATE NULL ) ENGINE = InnoDB; START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO t VALUES(1, &rsquo;apple&rsquo;, NULL); UPDATE t
SET name = &rsquo;pear&rsquo;, date =
&rsquo;2009-01-01&rsquo; WHERE id = 1; DELETE FROM t WHERE
id = 1; COMMIT;</p>

<p>By default, mysqlbinlog displays row events encoded as
base-64 strings using BINLOG statements. Omitting extraneous
lines, the output for the row events produced by the
preceding statement sequence looks like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlbinlog log_file ... # at 218 #080828
15:03:08 server id 1 end_log_pos 258 Write_rows: table id 17

fAS3SBkBAAAAKgAAALoBAAAQABEAAAAAAAEAA//4AQAAAARwZWFyIbIP
&rsquo;/*!*/;</p>

<p>To see the row events as comments in the form of
pseudo-SQL statements, run mysqlbinlog with the --verbose or
-v option. The output will contain lines beginning with
###:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlbinlog -v log_file ... # at 218 #080828
15:03:08 server id 1 end_log_pos 258 Write_rows: table id 17

&rsquo;/*!*/; ### DELETE FROM test.t ### WHERE ### @1=1 ###
@2=&rsquo;pear&rsquo; ### @3=&rsquo;2009:01:01&rsquo;</p>

<p>Specify --verbose or -v twice to also display data types
and some metadata for each column. The output will contain
an additional comment following each column change:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlbinlog -vv log_file ... # at 218 #080828

<p>You can tell mysqlbinlog to suppress the BINLOG
statements for row events by using the
--base64-output=DECODE-ROWS option. This is similar to
--base64-output=NEVER but does not exit with an error if a
row event is found. The combination of
--base64-output=DECODE-ROWS and --verbose provides a
convenient way to see row events only as SQL statements:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlbinlog -v --base64-output=DECODE-ROWS
log_file ... # at 218 #080828 15:03:08 server id 1
end_log_pos 258 Write_rows: table id 17 flags: STMT_END_F
### INSERT INTO test.t ### SET ### @1=1 ###
@2=&rsquo;apple&rsquo; ### @3=NULL ... # at 302 #080828
15:03:08 server id 1 end_log_pos 356 Update_rows: table id
17 flags: STMT_END_F ### UPDATE test.t ### WHERE ### @1=1
### @2=&rsquo;apple&rsquo; ### @3=NULL ### SET ### @1=1 ###
@2=&rsquo;pear&rsquo; ### @3=&rsquo;2009:01:01&rsquo; ... #
at 400 #080828 15:03:08 server id 1 end_log_pos 442
Delete_rows: table id 17 flags: STMT_END_F ### DELETE FROM
test.t ### WHERE ### @1=1 ### @2=&rsquo;pear&rsquo; ###
@3=&rsquo;2009:01:01&rsquo;</p>

<p>Note You should not suppress BINLOG statements if you
intend to re-execute mysqlbinlog output.</p>

<p>The SQL statements produced by --verbose for row events
are much more readable than the corresponding BINLOG
statements. However, they do not correspond exactly to the
original SQL statements that generated the events. The
following limitations apply:</p>

<p>&middot; The original column names are lost and replaced
by @N, where N is a column number.</p>

<p>&middot; Character set information is not available in
the binary log, which affects string column display:</p>

<p>&middot; There is no distinction made between
corresponding binary and nonbinary string types (BINARY and
CHAR, VARBINARY and VARCHAR, BLOB and TEXT). The output uses
a data type of STRING for fixed-length strings and VARSTRING
for variable-length strings.</p>

<p>&middot; For multi-byte character sets, the maximum
number of bytes per character is not present in the binary
log, so the length for string types is displayed in bytes
rather than in characters. For example, STRING(4) will be
used as the data type for values from either of these column
types:</p>

<p>CHAR(4) CHARACTER SET latin1 CHAR(2) CHARACTER SET
ucs2</p>

<p>&middot; Due to the storage format for events of type
UPDATE_ROWS_EVENT, UPDATE statements are displayed with the
WHERE clause preceding the SET clause.</p>

<p>Proper interpretation of row events requires the
information from the format description event at the
beginning of the binary log. Because mysqlbinlog does not
know in advance whether the rest of the log contains row
events, by default it displays the format description event
using a BINLOG statement in the initial part of the
output.</p>

<p>If the binary log is known not to contain any events
requiring a BINLOG statement (that is, no row events), the
--base64-output=NEVER option can be used to prevent this
header from being written.</p>
