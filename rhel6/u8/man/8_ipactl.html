<p>NAME ipactl - IPA Server Control Interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipactl command</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A tool to help an administer control an IPA
environment.</p>

<p>IPA glues several discrete services together to work in
concert and the order that these services are started and
stopped is important. ipactl ensures that they are started
and stopped in the correct order.</p>

<p>IPA stores the available masters and the services
configured on each one. The first thing ipactl does is start
(if it is not already run- ning) the IPA 389-ds instance to
query what services it controls. The hostname used in the
query needs to match the hostname of the value stored in
LDAP. This can be controlled with the host option in
/etc/ipa/default.conf. This should be a fully-qualified
hostname.</p>

<p>OPTIONS start Start all of the services that make up
IPA</p>

<p>stop Stop all of the services that make up IPA</p>

<p>restart Stop then start all of the services that make up
IPA</p>
