<p>NAME i2c_add_numbered_adapter - declare i2c adapter, use
static bus number</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int i2c_add_numbered_adapter(struct i2c_adapter
* adap);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS adap the adapter to register (with adap-&gt;nr
initialized)</p>

<p>CONTEXT can sleep</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This routine is used to declare an I2C
adapter when its bus number matters. For example, use it for
I2C adapters from system-on-chip CPUs, or otherwise built in
to the system&acute;s mainboard, and where i2c_board_info is
used to properly configure I2C devices.</p>

<p>If no devices have pre-been declared for this bus, then
be sure to register the adapter before any dynamically
allocated ones. Otherwise the required bus ID may not be
available.</p>

<p>When this returns zero, the specified adapter became
available for clients using the bus number provided in
adap-&gt;nr. Also, the table of I2C devices pre-declared
using i2c_register_board_info is scanned, and the
appropriate driver model device nodes are created.
Otherwise, a negative errno value is returned.</p>
