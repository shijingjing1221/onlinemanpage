<p>NAME syscalls - Linux system calls</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Linux system calls.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The system call is the fundamental interface
between an application and the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>System calls and library wrapper functions System calls
are generally not invoked directly, but rather via wrapper
functions in glibc (or perhaps some other library). For
details of direct invocation of a system call, see intro(2).
Often, but not always, the name of the wrapper function is
the same as the name of the system call that it invokes. For
example, glibc contains a function truncate() which invokes
the underlying &quot;truncate&quot; system call.</p>

<p>Often the glibc wrapper function is quite thin, doing
little work other than copying arguments to the right
registers before invoking the sys- tem call, and then
setting errno appropriately after the system call has
returned. (These are the same steps that are performed by
syscall(2), which can be used to invoke system calls for
which no wrap- per function is provided.) Note: system calls
indicate a failure by returning a negative error number to
the caller; when this happens, the wrapper function negates
the returned error number (to make it posi- tive), copies it
to errno, and returns -1 to the caller of the wrapper.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, the wrapper function does some extra
work before invoking the system call. For example, nowadays
there are (for reasons described below) two related system
calls, truncate(2) and trun- cate64(2), and the glibc
truncate() wrapper function checks which of those system
calls are provided by the kernel and determines which should
be employed.</p>

<p>System call list Below is a list of those system calls
that are common to most plat- forms. In the list, the Kernel
column indicates the kernel version for those system calls
that were new in Linux 2.2, or have appeared since that
kernel version. Note the following points:</p>

<p>* Where no kernel version is indicated, the system call
appeared in kernel 1.0 or earlier.</p>

<p>* Where a system call is marked &quot;1.2&quot; this
means the system call prob- ably appeared in a 1.1.x kernel
version, and first appeared in a stable kernel with 1.2.
(Development of the 1.2 kernel was initi- ated from a branch
of kernel 1.0.6 via the 1.1.x unstable kernel series.)</p>

<p>* Where a system call is marked &quot;2.0&quot; this
means the system call prob- ably appeared in a 1.3.x kernel
version, and first appeared in a stable kernel with 2.0.
(Development of the 2.0 kernel was initi- ated from a branch
of kernel 1.2.x, somewhere around 1.2.10, via the 1.3.x
unstable kernel series.)</p>

<p>* Where a system call is marked &quot;2.2&quot; this
means the system call prob- ably appeared in a 2.1.x kernel
version, and first appeared in a stable kernel with 2.2.0.
(Development of the 2.2 kernel was initi- ated from a branch
of kernel 2.0.21 via the 2.1.x unstable kernel series.)</p>

<p>* Where a system call is marked &quot;2.4&quot; this
means the system call prob- ably appeared in a 2.3.x kernel
version, and first appeared in a stable kernel with 2.4.0.
(Development of the 2.4 kernel was initi- ated from a branch
of kernel 2.2.8 via the 2.3.x unstable kernel series.)</p>

<p>* Where a system call is marked &quot;2.6&quot; this
means the system call prob- ably appeared in a 2.5.x kernel
version, and first appeared in a stable kernel with 2.6.0.
(Development of kernel 2.6 was initiated from a branch of
kernel 2.4.15 via the 2.5.x unstable kernel series.)</p>

<p>* Starting with kernel 2.6.0, the development model
changed, and new system calls may appear in each 2.6.x
release. In this case, the exact version number where the
system call appeared is shown.</p>

<p>* In some cases, a system call was added to a stable
kernel series after it branched from the previous stable
kernel series, and then backported into the earlier stable
kernel series. For example some system calls that appeared
in 2.6.x were also backported into a 2.4.x release after
2.4.15. When this is so, the version where the system call
appeared in both of the major kernel series is listed.</p>

<p>The list of system calls that are available as at kernel
2.6.28 (or in a few cases only on older kernels) is as
follows:</p>

<p>On many platforms, including i386, socket calls are all
multiplexed (via glibc wrapper functions) through
socketcall(2) and similarly Sys- tem V IPC calls are
multiplexed through ipc(2).</p>

<p>NOTES Note the following points:</p>

<p>* Although slots are reserved for them in the system
call table, the following system calls are not implemented
in the standard kernel: afs_syscall(2), break(2), ftime(2),
getpmsg(2), gtty(2), idle(2), lock(2), madvise1(2), mpx(2),
phys(2), prof(2), profil(2), putpmsg(2), security(2),
stty(2), tuxcall(2), ulimit(2), and vserver(2) (see also
unimplemented(2)). However, ftime(3), pro- fil(3) and
ulimit(3) exist as library routines. The slot for phys(2) is
in use since kernel 2.1.116 for umount(2); phys(2) will
never be implemented.</p>

<p>* The getpmsg(2) and putpmsg(2) calls are for kernels
patched to sup- port STREAMS, and may never be in the
standard kernel.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, the code belonging to the system call
with number __NR_xxx defined in /usr/include/asm/unistd.h
can be found in the ker- nel source in the routine
sys_xxx(). (The dispatch table for i386 can be found in
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/entry.S.) There are many
exceptions, however, mostly because older system calls were
superseded by newer ones, and this has been treated somewhat
unsystematically. On platforms with proprietary OS
emulation, such as parisc, sparc, sparc64 and alpha, there
are many additional system calls; mips64 also contains a
full set of 32-bit system calls.</p>

<p>Over time, changes to the interfaces of some system
calls have been necessary. One reason for such changes was
the need to increase the size of structures or scalar values
passed to the system call. Because of these changes, there
are now various groups of related system calls (e.g.,
truncate(2) and truncate64(2)) which perform similar tasks,
but which vary in details such as the size of their
arguments. (As noted earlier, applications are generally
unaware of this: the glibc wrapper functions do some work to
ensure that the right system call is invoked, and that ABI
compatibility is preserved for old binaries.) Examples of
systems calls that exist in multiple versions are the
following:</p>

<p>* By now there are three different versions of stat(2):
sys_stat() (slot __NR_oldstat), sys_newstat() (slot
__NR_stat), and sys_stat64() (slot __NR_stat64), with the
last being the most cur- rent. A similar story applies for
lstat(2) and fstat(2).</p>

<p>* Similarly, the defines __NR_oldolduname,
__NR_olduname, and __NR_uname refer to the routines
sys_olduname(), sys_uname() and sys_newuname().</p>

<p>* In Linux 2.0, a new version of vm86(2) appeared, with
the old and the new kernel routines being named
sys_vm86old() and sys_vm86().</p>

<p>* In Linux 2.4, a new version of getrlimit(2) appeared,
with the old and the new kernel routines being named
sys_old_getrlimit() (slot __NR_getrlimit) and
sys_getrlimit() (slot __NR_ugetrlimit).</p>

<p>* Linux 2.4 increased the size of user and group IDs
from 16 to 32 bits. To support this change, a range of
system calls were added (e.g., chown32(2), getuid32(2),
getgroups32(2), setresuid32(2)), superseding earlier calls
of the same name without the &quot;32&quot; suffix.</p>

<p>* Linux 2.4 added support for applications on 32-bit
architectures to access large files (i.e., files for which
the sizes and file offsets cant be represented in 32 bits.)
To support this change, replace- ments were required for
system calls that deal with file offsets and sizes. Thus the
following system calls were added: fcntl64(2),
ftruncate64(2), getdents64(2), stat64(2), statfs64(2), and
their analogs that work with file descriptors or symbolic
links. These system calls supersede the older system calls
which, except in the case of the &quot;stat&quot; calls,
have the same name without the &quot;64&quot; suf- fix.</p>

<p>On newer platforms that only have 64-bit file access and
32-bit uids (e.g., alpha, ia64, s390x) there are no *64 or
*32 calls. Where the *64 and *32 calls exist, the other
versions are obsolete.</p>

<p>* The rt_sig* calls were added in kernel 2.2 to support
the addition of real-time signals (see signal(7)). These
system calls supersede the older system calls of the same
name without the &quot;rt_&quot; prefix.</p>

<p>* The select(2) and mmap(2) system calls use five or
more arguments, which caused problems the way argument
passing on the i386 used to be set up. Thus, while other
architectures have sys_select() and sys_mmap() corresponding
to __NR_select and __NR_mmap, on i386 one finds old_select()
and old_mmap() (routines that use a pointer to a argument
block) instead. These days passing five arguments is not a
problem any more, and there is a __NR__newselect that
corresponds directly to sys_select() and similarly
__NR_mmap2.</p>
