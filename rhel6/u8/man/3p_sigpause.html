<p>SIGHOLD(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SIGHOLD(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sighold, sigignore, sigpause, sigrelse, sigset -
signal management</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sighold(int sig); int sigignore(int sig); int
sigpause(int sig); int sigrelse(int sig); void (*sigset(int
sig, void (*disp)(int)))(int);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Use of any of these functions is unspecified
in a multi-threaded pro- cess.</p>

<p>The sighold(), sigignore(), sigpause(), sigrelse(), and
sigset() func- tions provide simplified signal
management.</p>

<p>The sigset() function shall modify signal dispositions.
The sig argu- ment specifies the signal, which may be any
signal except SIGKILL and SIGSTOP. The disp argument
specifies the signal s disposition, which may be SIG_DFL,
SIG_IGN, or the address of a signal handler. If sigset() is
used, and disp is the address of a signal handler, the sys-
tem shall add sig to the calling process signal mask before
executing the signal handler; when the signal handler
returns, the system shall restore the calling process signal
mask to its state prior to the delivery of the signal. In
addition, if sigset() is used, and disp is equal to
SIG_HOLD, sig shall be added to the calling process signal
mask and sig s disposition shall remain unchanged. If
sigset() is used, and disp is not equal to SIG_HOLD, sig
shall be removed from the call- ing process signal mask.</p>

<p>The sighold() function shall add sig to the calling
process signal mask.</p>

<p>The sigrelse() function shall remove sig from the
calling process sig- nal mask.</p>

<p>The sigignore() function shall set the disposition of
sig to SIG_IGN.</p>

<p>The sigpause() function shall remove sig from the
calling process sig- nal mask and suspend the calling
process until a signal is received. The sigpause() function
shall restore the process signal mask to its original state
before returning.</p>

<p>If the action for the SIGCHLD signal is set to SIG_IGN,
child processes of the calling processes shall not be
transformed into zombie processes when they terminate. If
the calling process subsequently waits for its children, and
the process has no unwaited-for children that were trans-
formed into zombie processes, it shall block until all of
its children terminate, and wait(), waitid(), and waitpid()
shall fail and set errno to [ECHILD].</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, sigset() shall
return SIG_HOLD if the sig- nal had been blocked and the
signals previous disposition if it had not been blocked.
Otherwise, SIG_ERR shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>The sigpause() function shall suspend execution of the
thread until a signal is received, whereupon it shall return
-1 and set errno to [EINTR].</p>

<p>For all other functions, upon successful completion, 0
shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno
set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The sig argument is an illegal signal number.</p>

<p>The sigset() and sigignore() functions shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL An attempt is made to catch a signal that cannot
be caught, or to ignore a signal that cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The sigaction() function provides a
more comprehensive and reliable mechanism for controlling
signals; new applications should use sigac- tion() rather
than sigset().</p>

<p>The sighold() function, in conjunction with sigrelse()
or sigpause(), may be used to establish critical regions of
code that require the delivery of a signal to be temporarily
deferred.</p>

<p>The sigsuspend() function should be used in preference
to sigpause() for broader portability.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
