<p>NAME i2cget - read from I2C/SMBus chip registers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS i2cget [-f] [-y] i2cbus chip-address
[data-address [mode]] i2cget -V</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION i2cget is a small helper program to read
registers visible through the I2C bus (or SMBus).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V Display the version and exit.</p>

<p>-f Force access to the device even if it is already
busy. By default, i2cget will refuse to access a device
which is already under the control of a kernel driver. Using
this flag is danger- ous, it can seriously confuse the
kernel driver in question. It can also cause i2cget to
return an invalid value. So use at your own risk and only if
you know what youre doing.</p>

<p>-y Disable interactive mode. By default, i2cget will
wait for a confirmation from the user before messing with
the I2C bus. When this flag is used, it will perform the
operation directly. This is mainly meant to be used in
scripts. Use with caution.</p>

<p>There are two required options to i2cget. i2cbus
indicates the number or name of the I2C bus to be scanned.
This number should correspond to one of the busses listed by
i2cdetect -l. chip-address specifies the address of the chip
on that bus, and is an integer between 0x03 and 0x77.</p>

<p>data-address specifies the address on that chip to read
from, and is an integer between 0x00 and 0xFF. If omitted,
the currently active regis- ter will be read (if that makes
sense for the considered chip).</p>

<p>The mode parameter, if specified, is one of the letters
b, w or c, cor- responding to a read byte data, a read word
data or a write byte/read byte transaction, respectively. A
p can also be appended to the mode parameter to enable PEC.
If the mode parameter is omitted, i2cget defaults to a read
byte data transaction, unless data-address is also omitted,
in which case the default (and only valid) transaction is a
single read byte.</p>

<p>WARNING i2cget can be extremely dangerous if used
improperly. I2C and SMBus are designed in such a way that an
SMBus read transaction can be seen as a write transaction by
certain chips. This is particularly true if set- ting mode
to cp (write byte/read byte with PEC). Be extremely careful
using this program.</p>
