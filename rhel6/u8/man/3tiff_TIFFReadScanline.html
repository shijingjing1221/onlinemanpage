<p>TIFFReadScanline(3TIFF) TIFFReadScanline(3TIFF)</p>

<p>NAME TIFFReadScanline - read and decode a scanline of
data from an open TIFF file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int TIFFReadScanline(TIFF *tif, tdata_t buf, uint32 row,
tsample_t sam- ple)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Read the data for the specified row into the
(user supplied) data buffer buf. The data are returned
decompressed and, in the native byte- and bit-ordering, but
are otherwise packed (see further below). The buffer must be
large enough to hold an entire scanline of data.
Applications should call the routine TIFFScanlineSize to
find out the size (in bytes) of a scanline buffer. The row
parameter is always used by TIFFReadScanline; the sample
parameter is used only if data are organized in separate
planes (PlanarConfiguration=2).</p>

<p>NOTES The library attempts to hide bit- and
byte-ordering differences between the image and the native
machine by converting data to the native machine order. Bit
reversal is done if the FillOrder tag is opposite to the
native machine bit order. 16- and 32-bit samples are
automati- cally byte-swapped if the file was written with a
byte order opposite to the native machine byte order,</p>

<p>In C++ the sample parameter defaults to 0.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES TIFFReadScanline returns -1 if it detects
an error; otherwise 1 is returned.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error messages are directed to the
TIFFError(3TIFF) routine.</p>

<p>Compression algorithm does not support random access.
Data was requested in a non-sequential order from a file
that uses a compression algorithm and that has RowsPerStrip
greater than one. That is, data in the image is stored in a
compressed form, and with multiple rows packed into a strip.
In this case, the library does not support random access to
the data. The data should either be accessed sequentially,
or the file should be converted so that each strip is made
up of one row of data.</p>

<p>BUGS Reading subsampled YCbCR data does not work
correctly because, for Pla- narConfiguration=2 the size of a
scanline is not calculated on a per- sample basis, and for
PlanarConfiguration=1 the library does not unpack the
block-interleaved samples; use the strip- and tile-based
interfaces to read these formats.</p>
