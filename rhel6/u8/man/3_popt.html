<p>DESCRIPTION The popt library exists essentially for
parsing command-line options. It is found superior in many
ways when compared to parsing the argv array by hand or
using the getopt functions getopt() and getopt_long() [see
getopt(3)]. Some specific advantages of popt are: it does
not utilize global variables, thus enabling multiple passes
in parsing argv ; it can parse an arbitrary array of
argv-style elements, allowing parsing of
command-line-strings from any source; it provides a standard
method of option aliasing (to be discussed at length
below.); it can exec external option filters; and, finally,
it can automatically gener- ate help and usage messages for
the application.</p>

<p>Like getopt_long(), the popt library supports short and
long style options. Recall that a short option consists of a
- character followed by a single alphanumeric character. A
long option, common in GNU util- ities, consists of two -
characters followed by a string made up of letters, numbers
and hyphens. Long options are optionally allowed to begin
with a single -, primarily to allow command-line
compatibility between popt applications and X toolkit
applications. Either type of option may be followed by an
argument. A space separates a short option from its
arguments; either a space or an = separates a long option
from an argument.</p>

<p>The popt library is highly portable and should work on
any POSIX plat- form. The latest version is distributed with
rpm and is always avail- able from:
ftp://ftp.rpm.org/pub/rpm/dist.</p>

<p>It may be redistributed under the X consortium license,
see the file COPYING in the popt source distribution for
details.</p>

<p>BASIC POPT USAGE 1. THE OPTION TABLE Applications
provide popt with information on their command-line options
by means of an &quot;option table,&quot; i.e., an array of
struct poptOp- tion structures:</p>

<p>#include &lt;popt.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct poptOption { const char * longName; /* may be
NULL */ char shortName; /* may be */ int argInfo; void *
arg; /* depends on argInfo */ int val; /* 0 means dont
return, just update flag */ char * descrip; /* description
for autohelp -- may be NULL */ char * argDescrip; /*
argument description for autohelp */ };</p>

<p>Each member of the table defines a single option that
may be passed to the program. Long and short options are
considered a single option that may occur in two different
forms. The first two members, longName and shortName, define
the names of the option; the first is a long name, while the
latter is a single character.</p>

<p>The argInfo member tells popt what type of argument is
expected after the argument. If no option is expected,
POPT_ARG_NONE should be used. The rest of the valid values
are shown in the following table:</p>

<p>Value Description arg Type POPT_ARG_NONE No argument
expected int POPT_ARG_STRING No type checking to be
performed char * POPT_ARG_INT An integer argument is
expected int POPT_ARG_LONG A long integer is expected long
POPT_ARG_VAL Integer value taken from val int POPT_ARG_FLOAT
An float argument is expected float POPT_ARG_DOUBLE A double
argument is expected double</p>

<p>For numeric values, if the argInfo value is bitwise ord
with one of POPT_ARGFLAG_OR, POPT_ARGFLAG_AND, or
POPT_ARGFLAG_XOR, the value is saved by performing an OR,
AND, or XOR. If the argInfo value is bit- wise ord with
POPT_ARGFLAG_NOT, the value will be negated before sav- ing.
For the common operations of setting and/or clearing bits,
POPT_BIT_SET and POPT_BIT_CLR have the appropriate flags set
to perform bit operations.</p>

<p>If the argInfo value is bitwise or d with
POPT_ARGFLAG_ONEDASH, the long argument may be given with a
single - instead of two. For example, if --longopt is an
option with POPT_ARGFLAG_ONEDASH, is specified, -longopt is
accepted as well.</p>

<p>The next element, arg, allows popt to automatically
update program variables when the option is used. If arg is
NULL, it is ignored and popt takes no special action.
Otherwise it should point to a variable of the type
indicated in the right-most column of the table above.</p>

<p>If the option takes no argument (argInfo is
POPT_ARG_NONE), the vari- able pointed to by arg is set to 1
when the option is used. (Inciden- tally, it will perhaps
not escape the attention of hunt-and-peck typ- ists that the
value of POPT_ARG_NONE is 0.) If the option does take an
argument, the variable that arg points to is updated to
reflect the value of the argument. Any string is acceptable
for POPT_ARG_STRING arguments, but POPT_ARG_INT,
POPT_ARG_LONG, POPT_ARG_FLOAT, and POPT_ARG_DOUBLE are
converted to the appropriate type, and an error returned if
the conversion fails.</p>

<p>POPT_ARG_VAL causes arg to be set to the (integer) value
of val when the argument is found. This is most often useful
for mutually-exclu- sive arguments in cases where it is not
an error for multiple arguments to occur and where you want
the last argument specified to win; for example, &quot;rm -i
-f&quot;. POPT_ARG_VAL causes the parsing function not to
return a value, since the value of val has already been
used.</p>

<p>If the argInfo value is bitwise or d with
POPT_ARGFLAG_OPTIONAL, the argument to the long option may
be omitted. If the long option is used without an argument,
a default value of zero or NULL will be saved (if the arg
pointer is present), otherwise behavior will be identical to
a long option with argument.</p>

<p>The next option, val, is the value popt s parsing
function should return when the option is encountered. If it
is 0, the parsing func- tion does not return a value,
instead parsing the next command-line argument.</p>

<p>The last two options, descrip and argDescrip are only
required if auto- matic help messages are desired (automatic
usage messages can be gener- ated without them). descrip is
a text description of the argument and argdescrip is a short
summary of the type of arguments the option expects, or NULL
if the option doesn t require any arguments.</p>

<p>If popt should automatically provide --usage and --help
(-?) options, one line in the table should be the macro
POPT_AUTOHELP. This macro includes another option table (via
POPT_ARG_INCLUDE_TABLE; see below) in the main one which
provides the table entries for these arguments. When --usage
or --help are passed to programs which use popts automat-
ical help, popt displays the appropriate message on stderr
as soon as it finds the option, and exits the program with a
return code of 0. If you want to use popts automatic help
generation in a different way, you need to explicitly add
the option entries to your programs option table instead of
using POPT_AUTOHELP.</p>

<p>If the argInfo value is bitwise or d with
POPT_ARGFLAG_DOC_HIDDEN, the argument will not be shown in
help output.</p>

<p>If the argInfo value is bitwise or d with
POPT_ARGFLAG_SHOW_DEFAULT, the inital value of the arg will
be shown in help output.</p>

<p>The final structure in the table should have all the
pointer values set to NULL and all the arithmetic values set
to 0, marking the end of the table. The macro POPT_TABLEEND
is provided to do that.</p>

<p>There are two types of option table entries which do not
specify com- mand line options. When either of these types
of entries are used, the longName element must be NULL and
the shortName element must b.</p>

<p>The first of these special entry types allows the
application to nest another option table in the current one;
such nesting may extend quite deeply (the actual depth is
limited by the programs stack). Including other option
tables allows a library to provide a standard set of
command-line options to every program which uses it (this is
often done in graphical programming toolkits, for example).
To do this, set the argInfo field to POPT_ARG_INCLUDE_TABLE
and the arg field to point to the table which is being
included. If automatic help generation is being used, the
descrip field should contain a overall description of the
option table being included.</p>

<p>The other special option table entry type tells popt to
call a function (a callback) when any option in that table
is found. This is especially usefull when included option
tables are being used, as the program which provides the
top-level option table doesnt need to be aware of the other
options which are provided by the included table. When a
callback is set for a table, the parsing function never
returns infor- mation on an option in the table. Instead,
options information must be retained via the callback or by
having popt set a variable through the options arg field.
Option callbacks should match the following proto- type:</p>

<p>void poptCallbackType(poptContext con, const struct
poptOption * opt, const char * arg, void * data);</p>

<p>The first parameter is the context which is being parsed
(see the next section for information on contexts), opt
points to the option which triggered this callback, and arg
is the options argument. If the option does not take an
argument, arg is NULL. The final parameter, data is taken
from the descrip field of the option table entry which
defined the callback. As descrip is a pointer, this allows
callback functions to be passed an arbitrary set of data
(though a typecast will have to be used).</p>

<p>The option table entry which defines a callback has an
argInfo of POPT_ARG_CALLBACK, an arg which points to the
callback function, and a descrip field which specifies an
arbitrary pointer to be passed to the callback.</p>

<p>2. CREATING A CONTEXT popt can interleave the parsing of
multiple command-line sets. It allows this by keeping all
the state information for a particular set of command-line
arguments in a poptContext data structure, an opaque type
that should not be modified outside the popt library.</p>

<p>New popt contexts are created by poptGetContext():</p>

<p>poptContext poptGetContext(const char * name, int argc,
const char ** argv, const struct poptOption * options, int
flags);</p>

<p>The first parameter, name, is used only for alias
handling (discussed later). It should be the name of the
application whose options are being parsed, or should be
NULL if no option aliasing is desired. The next two
arguments specify the command-line arguments to parse. These
are generally passed to poptGetContext() exactly as they
were passed to the program s main() function. The options
parameter points to the ta- ble of command-line options,
which was described in the previous sec- tion. The final
parameter, flags, can take one of three values:</p>

<p>Value Description POPT_CONTEXT_NO_EXEC Ignore exec
expansions POPT_CONTEXT_KEEP_FIRST Do not ignore argv[0]
POPT_CONTEXT_POSIXMEHARDER Options cannot follow
arguments</p>

<p>A poptContext keeps track of which options have already
been parsed and which remain, among other things. If a
program wishes to restart option processing of a set of
arguments, it can reset the poptContext by passing the
context as the sole argument to poptResetContext().</p>

<p>When argument processing is complete, the process should
free the popt- Context as it contains dynamically allocated
components. The popt- FreeContext() function takes a
poptContext as its sole argument and frees the resources the
context is using.</p>

<p>Here are the prototypes of both poptResetContext() and
poptFreeCon- text():</p>

<p>#include &lt;popt.h&gt; void poptFreeContext(poptContext
con); void poptResetContext(poptContext con);</p>

<p>3. PARSING THE COMMAND LINE After an application has
created a poptContext, it may begin parsing arguments.
poptGetNextOpt() performs the actual argument parsing.</p>

<p>#include &lt;popt.h&gt; int poptGetNextOpt(poptContext
con);</p>

<p>Taking the context as its sole argument, this function
parses the next command-line argument found. After finding
the next argument in the option table, the function fills in
the object pointed to by the option table entrys arg pointer
if it is not NULL. If the val entry for the option is non-0,
the function then returns that value. Otherwise, popt-
GetNextOpt() continues on to the next argument.</p>

<p>poptGetNextOpt() returns -1 when the final argument has
been parsed, and other negative values when errors occur.
This makes it a good idea to keep the val elements in the
options table greater than 0.</p>

<p>If all of the command-line options are handled through
arg pointers, command-line parsing is reduced to the
following line of code:</p>

<p>rc = poptGetNextOpt(poptcon);</p>

<p>Many applications require more complex command-line
parsing than this, however, and use the following
structure:</p>

<p>while ((rc = poptGetNextOpt(poptcon)) &gt; 0) { switch
(rc) { /* specific arguments are handled here */ } }</p>

<p>When returned options are handled, the application needs
to know the value of any arguments that were specified after
the option. There are two ways to discover them. One is to
ask popt to fill in a variable with the value of the option
through the option tables arg elements. The other is to use
poptGetOptArg():</p>

<p>#include &lt;popt.h&gt; char * poptGetOptArg(poptContext
con);</p>

<p>This function returns the argument given for the final
option returned by poptGetNextOpt(), or it returns NULL if
no argument was specified. The calling function is
responsible for deallocating this string.</p>

<p>4. LEFTOVER ARGUMENTS Many applications take an
arbitrary number of command-line arguments, such as a list
of file names. When popt encounters an argument that does
not begin with a -, it assumes it is such an argument and
adds it to a list of leftover arguments. Three functions
allow applications to access such arguments:</p>

<p>const char * poptGetArg(poptContext con); This function
returns the next leftover argument and marks it as
processed.</p>

<p>const char * poptPeekArg(poptContext con); The next
leftover argument is returned but not marked as pro- cessed.
This allows an application to look ahead into the argu- ment
list, without modifying the list.</p>

<p>const char ** poptGetArgs(poptContext con); All the
leftover arguments are returned in a manner identical to
argv. The final element in the returned array points to
NULL, indicating the end of the arguments.</p>

<p>5. AUTOMATIC HELP MESSAGES The popt library can
automatically generate help messages which describe the
options a program accepts. There are two types of help
messages which can be generated. Usage messages are a short
messages which lists valid options, but does not describe
them. Help messages describe each option on one (or more)
lines, resulting in a longer, but more useful, message.
Whenever automatic help messages are used, the descrip and
argDescrip fields struct poptOption members should be filled
in for each option.</p>

<p>The POPT_AUTOHELP macro makes it easy to add --usage and
--help mes- sages to your program, and is described in part
1 of this man page. If more control is needed over your help
messages, the following two func- tions are available:</p>

<p>#include &lt;popt.h&gt; void poptPrintHelp(poptContext
con, FILE * f, int flags); void poptPrintUsage(poptContext
con, FILE * f, int flags);</p>

<p>poptPrintHelp() displays the standard help message to
the stdio file descriptor f, while poptPrintUsage() displays
the shorter usage mes- sage. Both functions currently ignore
the flags argument; it is there to allow future changes.</p>

<p>ERROR HANDLING All of the popt functions that can return
errors return integers. When an error occurs, a negative
error code is returned. The following table summarizes the
error codes that occur:</p>

<p>Error Description POPT_ERROR_NOARG Argument missing for
an option. POPT_ERROR_BADOPT Options argument couldnt be
parsed. POPT_ERROR_OPTSTOODEEP Option aliasing nested too
deeply. POPT_ERROR_BADQUOTE Quotations do not match.
POPT_ERROR_BADNUMBER Option couldn t be converted to number.
POPT_ERROR_OVERFLOW A given number was too big or small.</p>

<p>Here is a more detailed discussion of each error:</p>

<p>POPT_ERROR_NOARG An option that requires an argument was
specified on the command line, but no argument was given.
This can be returned only by poptGetNextOpt().</p>

<p>POPT_ERROR_BADOPT An option was specified in argv but is
not in the option table. This error can be returned only
from poptGetNextOpt().</p>

<p>POPT_ERROR_OPTSTOODEEP A set of option aliases is nested
too deeply. Currently, popt follows options only 10 levels
to prevent infinite recursion. Only poptGetNextOpt() can
return this error.</p>

<p>POPT_ERROR_BADQUOTE A parsed string has a quotation
mismatch (such as a single quo- tation mark).
poptParseArgvString(), poptReadConfigFile(), or
poptReadDefaultConfig() can return this error.</p>

<p>POPT_ERROR_BADNUMBER A conversion from a string to a
number (int or long) failed due to the string containing
nonnumeric characters. This occurs when poptGetNextOpt() is
processing an argument of type POPT_ARG_INT, POPT_ARG_LONG,
POPT_ARG_FLOAT, or POPT_ARG_DOUBLE.</p>

<p>POPT_ERROR_OVERFLOW A string-to-number conversion failed
because the number was too large or too small. Like
POPT_ERROR_BADNUMBER, this error can occur only when
poptGetNextOpt() is processing an argument of type
POPT_ARG_INT, POPT_ARG_LONG, POPT_ARG_FLOAT, or
POPT_ARG_DOUBLE.</p>

<p>POPT_ERROR_ERRNO A system call returned with an error,
and errno still contains the error from the system call.
Both poptReadConfigFile() and poptReadDefaultConfig() can
return this error.</p>

<p>Two functions are available to make it easy for
applications to provide good error messages.</p>

<p>const char *const poptStrerror(const int error); This
function takes a popt error code and returns a string
describing the error, just as with the standard strerror()
func- tion.</p>

<p>const char * poptBadOption(poptContext con, int flags);
If an error occurred during poptGetNextOpt(), this function
returns the option that caused the error. If the flags
argument is set to POPT_BADOPTION_NOALIAS, the outermost
option is returned. Otherwise, flags should be 0, and the
option that is returned may have been specified through an
alias.</p>

<p>These two functions make popt error handling trivial for
most applica- tions. When an error is detected from most of
the functions, an error message is printed along with the
error string from poptStrerror(). When an error occurs
during argument parsing, code similiar to the fol- lowing
displays a useful error message:</p>

<p>fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s: %s0, poptBadOption(optCon,
POPT_BADOPTION_NOALIAS), poptStrerror(rc));</p>

<p>OPTION ALIASING One of the primary benefits of using
popt over getopt() is the ability to use option aliasing.
This lets the user specify options that popt expands into
other options when they are specified. If the standard grep
program made use of popt, users could add a --text option
that expanded to -i -n -E -2 to let them more easily find
information in text files.</p>

<p>1. SPECIFYING ALIASES Aliases are normally specified in
two places: /etc/popt and the .popt file in the users home
directory (found through the HOME environment variable).
Both files have the same format, an arbitrary number of
lines formatted like this:</p>

<p>appname alias newoption expansion</p>

<p>The appname is the name of the application, which must
be the same as the name parameter passed to
poptGetContext(). This allows each file to specify aliases
for multiple programs. The alias keyword specifies that an
alias is being defined; currently popt configuration files
support only aliases, but other abilities may be added in
the future. The next option is the option that should be
aliased, and it may be either a short or a long option. The
rest of the line specifies the expansion for the alias. It
is parsed similarly to a shell command, which allows &quot;,
and to be used for quoting. If a backslash is the final
charac- ter on a line, the next line in the file is assumed
to be a logical continuation of the line containing the
backslash, just as in shell.</p>

<p>The following entry would add a --text option to the
grep command, as suggested at the beginning of this
section.</p>

<p>grep alias --text -i -n -E -2</p>

<p>2. ENABLING ALIASES An application must enable alias
expansion for a poptContext before calling poptGetNextArg()
for the first time. There are three functions that define
aliases for a context:</p>

<p>int poptReadDefaultConfig(poptContext con, int flags);
This function reads aliases from /etc/popt and the .popt
file in the users home directory. Currently, flags should be
NULL, as it is provided only for future expansion.</p>

<p>int poptReadConfigFile(poptContext con, char * fn); The
file specified by fn is opened and parsed as a popt configu-
ration file. This allows programs to use program-specific
con- figuration files.</p>

<p>int poptAddAlias(poptContext con, struct poptAlias
alias, int flags); Occasionally, processes want to specify
aliases without having to read them from a configuration
file. This function adds a new alias to a context. The flags
argument should be 0, as it is currently reserved for future
expansion. The new alias is speci- fied as a struct
poptAlias, which is defined as:</p>

<p>struct poptAlias { const char * longName; /* may be NULL
*/ char shortName; /* may be */ int argc; const char **
argv; /* must be free()able */ };</p>

<p>The first two elements, longName and shortName, specify
the option that is aliased. The final two, argc and argv,
define the expansion to use when the aliases option is
encountered.</p>

<p>PARSING ARGUMENT STRINGS Although popt is usually used
for parsing arguments already divided into an argv-style
array, some programs need to parse strings that are
formatted identically to command lines. To facilitate this,
popt pro- vides a function that parses a string into an
array of strings, using rules similiar to normal shell
parsing.</p>

<p>#include &lt;popt.h&gt; int poptParseArgvString(char *
s, int * argcPtr, char *** argvPtr); int poptDupArgv(int
argc, const char ** argv, int * argcPtr, const char ***
argvPtr);</p>

<p>The string s is parsed into an argv-style array. The
integer pointed to by the argcPtr parameter contains the
number of elements parsed, and the final argvPtr parameter
contains the address of the newly created array. The routine
poptDupArgv() can be used to make a copy of an existing
argument array.</p>

<p>The argvPtr created by poptParseArgvString() or
poptDupArgv() is suit- able to pass directly to
poptGetContext(). Both routines return a sin- gle
dynamically allocated contiguous block of storage and should
be free()ed when the application is finished with the
storage.</p>

<p>HANDLING EXTRA ARGUMENTS Some applications implement the
equivalent of option aliasing but need to do so through
special logic. The poptStuffArgs() function allows an
application to insert new arguments into the current
poptContext.</p>

<p>#include &lt;popt.h&gt; int poptStuffArgs(poptContext
con, const char ** argv);</p>

<p>The passed argv must have a NULL pointer as its final
element. When poptGetNextOpt() is next called, the
&quot;stuffed&quot; arguments are the first to be parsed.
popt returns to the normal arguments once all the stuffed
arguments have been exhausted.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following example is a simplified version of
the program &quot;robin&quot; which appears in Chapter 15 of
the text cited below. Robin has been stripped of everything
but its argument-parsing logic, slightly reworked, and
renamed &quot;parse.&quot; It may prove useful in
illustrating at least some of the features of the extremely
rich popt library.</p>

<p>#include &lt;popt.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>void usage(poptContext optCon, int exitcode, char
*error, char *addl) { poptPrintUsage(optCon, stderr, 0); if
(error) fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s: %s0, error, addl);
exit(exitcode); }</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { char c; /* used for
argument parsing */ int i = 0; /* used for tracking options
*/ char *portname; int speed = 0; /* used in argument
parsing to set speed */ int raw = 0; /* raw mode? */ int j;
char buf[BUFSIZ+1]; poptContext optCon; /* context for
parsing command-line options */</p>

<p>struct poptOption optionsTable[] = { { &quot;bps&quot;,
b , POPT_ARG_INT, &amp;speed, 0, &quot;signaling rate in
bits-per-second&quot;, &quot;BPS&quot; }, {
&quot;crnl&quot;, c, 0, 0, c, &quot;expand cr characters to
cr/lf sequences&quot; }, { &quot;hwflow&quot;, h, 0, 0, h,
&quot;use hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control&quot; }, {
&quot;noflow&quot;, n, 0, 0, n, &quot;use no flow
control&quot; }, { &quot;raw&quot;, r, 0, &amp;raw, 0,
&quot;don t perform any character conversions&quot; }, {
&quot;swflow&quot;, s, 0, 0, s, &quot;use software (XON/XOF)
flow control&quot; } , POPT_AUTOHELP { NULL, 0, 0, NULL, 0 }
};</p>

<p>optCon = poptGetContext(NULL, argc, argv, optionsTable,
0); poptSetOtherOptionHelp(optCon, &quot;[OPTIONS]*
&lt;port&gt;&quot;);</p>

<p>if (argc &lt; 2) { poptPrintUsage(optCon, stderr, 0);
exit(1); }</p>

<p>/* Now do options processing, get portname */ while ((c
= poptGetNextOpt(optCon)) &gt;= 0) { switch (c) { case c:
buf[i++] = c; break; case h: buf[i++] = h; break; case s:
buf[i++] = s; break; case n: buf[i++] = n; break; } }
portname = poptGetArg(optCon); if((portname == NULL) ||
!(poptPeekArg(optCon) == NULL)) usage(optCon, 1,
&quot;Specify a single port&quot;, &quot;.e.g.,
/dev/cua0&quot;);</p>

<p>if (c &lt; -1) { /* an error occurred during option
processing */ fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s: %s0,
poptBadOption(optCon, POPT_BADOPTION_NOALIAS),
poptStrerror(c)); return 1; }</p>

<p>/* Print out options, portname chosen */
printf(&quot;Options chosen: &quot;); for(j = 0; j &lt; i ;
j++) printf(&quot;-%c &quot;, buf[j]); if(raw)
printf(&quot;-r &quot;); if(speed) printf(&quot;-b %d
&quot;, speed); printf(&quot;0ortname chosen: %s0,
portname);</p>

<p>poptFreeContext(optCon); exit(0); }</p>

<p>RPM, a popular Linux package management program, makes
heavy use of popts features. Many of its command-line
arguments are implemented through popt aliases, which makes
RPM an excellent example of how to take advantage of the
popt library. For more information on RPM, see
