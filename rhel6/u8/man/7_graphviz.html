<p>GRAPHVIZ(7) GRAPHVIZ(7)</p>

<p>NAME graphviz - rich set of graph drawing tools</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS This manpage has been written to fulfil the
need of a centralized docu- mentation presenting all
available tools in the graphviz package.</p>

<p>AVAILABLE TOOLS Graph layout programs dot filter for
hierarchical layouts of graphs</p>

<p>neato filter for symmetric layouts of graphs</p>

<p>twopi filter for radial layouts of graphs</p>

<p>circo filter for circular layout of graphs</p>

<p>fdp filter for symmetric layouts of graphs</p>

<p>All of the filters work with either directed or
undirected graphs, though dot is typically used for directed
graphs and neato for undi- rected graphs. Note also that
neato -n[2] can be used to render lay- outs produced by the
other filters.</p>

<p>AUTHOR This manual page was written by Cyril Brulebois
&lt;cyril.brule- bois@enst-bretagne.fr&gt; in november 2006,
based on an initial documenta- tion effort by Joachim Berdal
Haga &lt;jbh@lupus.ig3.net&gt;. It can be dis- tributed
under the same terms as the graphviz package.</p>
