<p>mount_selinux(8) SELinux Policy mount
mount_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME mount_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the mount processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mount
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The mount processes execute with the mount_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep mount_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The mount_t SELinux type can be entered via
the mount_exec_t, fuser- mount_exec_t file types.</p>

<p>The default entrypoint paths for the mount_t domain are
the following:</p>

<p>/bin/mount.*, /sbin/mount.*, /bin/umount.*,
/sbin/umount.*, /bin/fuser- mount, /usr/bin/fusermount</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux mount policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their mount pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for mount:</p>

<p>mount_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a mount_t can be used to make
the process type mount_t permissive. SELinux does not deny
access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux
denials) messages are still gener- ated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. mount policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run mount with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow all daemons the ability to
read/write terminals, you must turn on the
allow_daemons_use_tty boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_daemons_use_tty 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to use other domains
file descriptors, you must turn on the allow_domain_fd_use
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_domain_fd_use 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined applications to run with
kerberos, you must turn on the allow_kerberos boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_kerberos 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow the mount command to mount any
directory or file, you must turn on the allow_mount_anyfile
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_mount_anyfile 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all
processes, you must turn on the allow_ptrace boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ptrace 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow system to run with NIS, you must
turn on the allow_ypbind boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ypbind 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load
modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to execute in
fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fips_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable reading of urandom for all
domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P global_ssp 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined applications to use nscd
shared memory, you must turn on the nscd_use_shm boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P nscd_use_shm 1</p>

<p>If you want to disable transitions to insmod, you must
turn on the secure_mode_insmod boolean. Disabled by
default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P secure_mode_insmod 1</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux mount policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their mount processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for mount:</p>

<p>mountd_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 20048 udp 20048</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type mount_t can
manage files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /tmp-inst /var/tmp-inst
/var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux mount policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their mount processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>STANDARD FILE CONTEXT</p>

<p>SELinux defines the file context types for the mount, if
you wanted to store files with these types in a diffent
paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify
alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels
on disk.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t mount_var_run_t
/srv/mymount_content(/.*)? restorecon -R -v
/srv/mymount_content</p>

<p>Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify
labels that match multiple files.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for mount:</p>

<p>mount_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mount_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the mount_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /bin/mount.*, /sbin/mount.*, /bin/umount.*,
/sbin/umount.*</p>

<p>mount_loopback_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mount_loopback_t type, if you want
to treat the files as mount loopback data.</p>

<p>mount_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mount_tmp_t type, if you want to
store mount tem- porary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>mount_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mount_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the mount files under the /run or /var/run
directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/davfs2(/.*)?,
/var/cache/davfs2(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
