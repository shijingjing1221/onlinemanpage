<p>NAME gcj - Ahead-of-time compiler for the Java
language</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gcj [-Idir...] [-d dir...] [--CLASSPATH=path]
[--classpath=path] [-foption...] [--encoding=name]
[--main=classname] [-Dname[=value]...] [-C] [--resource
resource-name] [-d directory] [-Wwarn...] sourcefile...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION As gcj is just another front end to gcc, it
supports many of the same options as gcc. This manual only
documents the options specific to gcj.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Input and output files A gcj command is like a
gcc command, in that it consists of a number of options and
file names. The following kinds of input file names are
supported:</p>

<p>file.java Java source files.</p>

<p>file.class Java bytecode files.</p>

<p>file.zip file.jar An archive containing one or more
&quot;.class&quot; files, all of which are compiled. The
archive may be compressed. Files in an archive which dont
end with .class are treated as resource files; they are
compiled into the resulting object file as core: URLs.</p>

<p>@file A file containing a whitespace-separated list of
input file names. (Currently, these must all be
&quot;.java&quot; source files, but that may change.) Each
named file is compiled, just as if it had been on the
command line.</p>

<p>library.a library.so -llibname Libraries to use when
linking. See the gcc manual.</p>

<p>You can specify more than one input file on the gcj
command line, in which case they will all be compiled. If
you specify a &quot;-o FILENAME&quot; option, all the input
files will be compiled together, producing a single output
file, named FILENAME. This is allowed even when using
&quot;-S&quot; or &quot;-c&quot;, but not when using
&quot;-C&quot; or &quot;--resource&quot;. (This is an
extension beyond the what plain gcc allows.) (If more than
one input file is specified, all must currently be
&quot;.java&quot; files, though we hope to fix this.)</p>

<p>Input Options gcj has options to control where it looks
to find files it needs. For instance, gcj might need to load
a class that is referenced by the file it has been asked to
compile. Like other compilers for the Java language, gcj has
a notion of a class path. There are several options and
environment variables which can be used to manipulate the
class path. When gcj looks for a given class, it searches
the class path looking for matching .class or .java file.
gcj comes with a built-in class path which points at the
installed libgcj.jar, a file which contains all the standard
classes.</p>

<p>In the text below, a directory or path component can
refer either to an actual directory on the filesystem, or to
a .zip or .jar file, which gcj will search as if it is a
directory.</p>

<p>-Idir All directories specified by &quot;-I&quot; are
kept in order and prepended to the class path constructed
from all the other options. Unless compatibility with tools
like &quot;javac&quot; is important, we recommend always
using &quot;-I&quot; instead of the other options for
manipulating the class path.</p>

<p>--classpath=path This sets the class path to path, a
colon-separated list of paths (on Windows-based systems, a
semicolon-separate list of paths). This does not override
the builtin (&quot;boot&quot;) search path.</p>

<p>--CLASSPATH=path Deprecated synonym for
&quot;--classpath&quot;.</p>

<p>--bootclasspath=path Where to find the standard builtin
classes, such as &quot;java.lang.String&quot;.</p>

<p>--extdirs=path For each directory in the path, place the
contents of that directory at the end of the class path.</p>

<p>CLASSPATH This is an environment variable which holds a
list of paths.</p>

<p>The final class path is constructed like so:</p>

<p>&middot; First come all directories specified via
&quot;-I&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; If --classpath is specified, its value is
appended. Otherwise, if the &quot;CLASSPATH&quot;
environment variable is specified, then its value is
appended. Otherwise, the current directory (&quot;.&quot;)
is appended.</p>

<p>&middot; If &quot;--bootclasspath&quot; was specified,
append its value. Otherwise, append the built-in system
directory, libgcj.jar.</p>

<p>&middot; Finally, if &quot;--extdirs&quot; was
specified, append the contents of the specified directories
at the end of the class path. Otherwise, append the contents
of the built-in extdirs at
&quot;$(prefix)/share/java/ext&quot;.</p>

<p>The classfile built by gcj for the class
&quot;java.lang.Object&quot; (and placed in
&quot;libgcj.jar&quot;) contains a special zero length
attribute &quot;gnu.gcj.gcj-compiled&quot;. The compiler
looks for this attribute when loading
&quot;java.lang.Object&quot; and will report an error if it
isnt found, unless it compiles to bytecode (the option
&quot;-fforce-classes-archive-check&quot; can be used to
override this behavior in this particular case.)</p>

<p>-fforce-classes-archive-check This forces the compiler
to always check for the special zero length attribute
&quot;gnu.gcj.gcj-compiled&quot; in
&quot;java.lang.Object&quot; and issue an error if it isnt
found.</p>

<p>-fsource=VERSION This option is used to choose the
source version accepted by gcj. The default is 1.5.</p>

<p>Encodings The Java programming language uses Unicode
throughout. In an effort to integrate well with other
locales, gcj allows .java files to be written using almost
any encoding. gcj knows how to convert these encodings into
its internal encoding at compile time.</p>

<p>You can use the &quot;--encoding=NAME&quot; option to
specify an encoding (of a particular character set) to use
for source files. If this is not specified, the default
encoding comes from your current locale. If your host system
has insufficient locale support, then gcj assumes the
default encoding to be the UTF-8 encoding of Unicode.</p>

<p>To implement &quot;--encoding&quot;, gcj simply uses the
host platforms &quot;iconv&quot; conversion routine. This
means that in practice gcj is limited by the capabilities of
the host platform.</p>

<p>The names allowed for the argument
&quot;--encoding&quot; vary from platform to platform (since
they are not standardized anywhere). However, gcj implements
the encoding named UTF-8 internally, so if you choose to use
this for your source files you can be assured that it will
work on every host.</p>

<p>Warnings gcj implements several warnings. As with other
generic gcc warnings, if an option of the form
&quot;-Wfoo&quot; enables a warning, then
&quot;-Wno-foo&quot; will disable it. Here weve chosen to
document the form of the warning which will have an effect
-- the default being the opposite of what is listed.</p>

<p>-Wredundant-modifiers With this flag, gcj will warn
about redundant modifiers. For instance, it will warn if an
interface method is declared &quot;public&quot;.</p>

<p>-Wextraneous-semicolon This causes gcj to warn about
empty statements. Empty statements have been deprecated.</p>

<p>-Wno-out-of-date This option will cause gcj not to warn
when a source file is newer than its matching class file. By
default gcj will warn about this.</p>

<p>-Wno-deprecated Warn if a deprecated class, method, or
field is referred to.</p>

<p>-Wunused This is the same as gccs
&quot;-Wunused&quot;.</p>

<p>-Wall This is the same as &quot;-Wredundant-modifiers
-Wextraneous-semicolon -Wunused&quot;.</p>

<p>Linking To turn a Java application into an executable
program, you need to link it with the needed libraries, just
as for C or C++. The linker by default looks for a global
function named &quot;main&quot;. Since Java does not have
global functions, and a collection of Java classes may have
more than one class with a &quot;main&quot; method, you need
to let the linker know which of those &quot;main&quot;
methods it should invoke when starting the application. You
can do that in any of these ways:</p>

<p>&middot; Specify the class containing the desired
&quot;main&quot; method when you link the application, using
the &quot;--main&quot; flag, described below.</p>

<p>&middot; Link the Java package(s) into a shared library
(dll) rather than an executable. Then invoke the application
using the &quot;gij&quot; program, making sure that
&quot;gij&quot; can find the libraries it needs.</p>

<p>&middot; Link the Java packages(s) with the flag
&quot;-lgij&quot;, which links in the &quot;main&quot;
routine from the &quot;gij&quot; command. This allows you to
select the class whose &quot;main&quot; method you want to
run when you run the application. You can also use other
&quot;gij&quot; flags, such as &quot;-D&quot; flags to set
properties. Using the &quot;-lgij&quot; library (rather than
the &quot;gij&quot; program of the previous mechanism) has
some advantages: it is compatible with static linking, and
does not require configuring or installing libraries.</p>

<p>These &quot;gij&quot; options relate to linking an
executable:</p>

<p>--main=CLASSNAME This option is used when linking to
specify the name of the class whose &quot;main&quot; method
should be invoked when the resulting executable is run.</p>

<p>-Dname[=value] This option can only be used with
&quot;--main&quot;. It defines a system property named name
with value value. If value is not specified then it defaults
to the empty string. These system properties are initialized
at the program s startup and can be retrieved at runtime
using the &quot;java.lang.System.getProperty&quot;
method.</p>

<p>-lgij Create an application whose command-line
processing is that of the &quot;gij&quot; command.</p>

<p>This option is an alternative to using
&quot;--main&quot;; you cannot use both.</p>

<p>-static-libgcj This option causes linking to be done
against a static version of the libgcj runtime library. This
option is only available if corresponding linker support
exists.</p>

<p>Caution: Static linking of libgcj may cause essential
parts of libgcj to be omitted. Some parts of libgcj use
reflection to load classes at runtime. Since the linker does
not see these references at link time, it can omit the
referred to classes. The result is usually (but not always)
a &quot;ClassNotFoundException&quot; being thrown at
runtime. Caution must be used when using this option. For
more details see:
&lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Statically%20linking%20libgcj&gt;</p>

<p>Code Generation In addition to the many gcc options
controlling code generation, gcj has several options
specific to itself.</p>

<p>-C This option is used to tell gcj to generate bytecode
(.class files) rather than object code.</p>

<p>--resource resource-name This option is used to tell gcj
to compile the contents of a given file to object code so it
may be accessed at runtime with the core protocol handler as
core:/resource-name. Note that resource-name is the name of
the resource as found at runtime; for instance, it could be
used in a call to &quot;ResourceBundle.getBundle&quot;. The
actual file name to be compiled this way must be specified
separately.</p>

<p>-ftarget=VERSION This can be used with -C to choose the
version of bytecode emitted by gcj. The default is 1.5. When
not generating bytecode, this option has no effect.</p>

<p>-d directory When used with &quot;-C&quot;, this causes
all generated .class files to be put in the appropriate
subdirectory of directory. By default they will be put in
subdirectories of the current working directory.</p>

<p>-fno-bounds-check By default, gcj generates code which
checks the bounds of all array indexing operations. With
this option, these checks are omitted, which can improve
performance for code that uses arrays extensively. Note that
this can result in unpredictable behavior if the code in
question actually does violate array bounds constraints. It
is safe to use this option if you are sure that your code
will never throw an
&quot;ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException&quot;.</p>

<p>-fno-store-check Don t generate array store checks. When
storing objects into arrays, a runtime check is normally
generated in order to ensure that the object is assignment
compatible with the component type of the array (which may
not be known at compile-time). With this option, these
checks are omitted. This can improve performance for code
which stores objects into arrays frequently. It is safe to
use this option if you are sure your code will never throw
an &quot;ArrayStoreException&quot;.</p>

<p>-fjni With gcj there are two options for writing native
methods: CNI and JNI. By default gcj assumes you are using
CNI. If you are compiling a class with native methods, and
these methods are implemented using JNI, then you must use
&quot;-fjni&quot;. This option causes gcj to generate stubs
which will invoke the underlying JNI methods.</p>

<p>-fno-assert Dont recognize the &quot;assert&quot;
keyword. This is for compatibility with older versions of
the language specification.</p>

<p>-fno-optimize-static-class-initialization When the
optimization level is greater or equal to &quot;-O2&quot;,
gcj will try to optimize the way calls into the runtime are
made to initialize static classes upon their first use (this
optimization isn t carried out if &quot;-C&quot; was
specified.) When compiling to native code,
&quot;-fno-optimize-static-class-initialization&quot; will
turn this optimization off, regardless of the optimization
level in use.</p>

<p>--disable-assertions[=class-or-package] Don t include
code for checking assertions in the compiled code. If
&quot;=class-or-package&quot; is missing disables assertion
code generation for all classes, unless overridden by a more
specific &quot;--enable-assertions&quot; flag. If
class-or-package is a class name, only disables generating
assertion checks within the named class or its inner
classes. If class-or-package is a package name, disables
generating assertion checks within the named package or a
subpackage.</p>

<p>By default, assertions are enabled when generating class
files or when not optimizing, and disabled when generating
optimized binaries.</p>

<p>--enable-assertions[=class-or-package] Generates code to
check assertions. The option is perhaps misnamed, as you
still need to turn on assertion checking at run- time, and
we dont support any easy way to do that. So this flag isnt
very useful yet, except to partially override
&quot;--disable-assertions&quot;.</p>

<p>-findirect-dispatch gcj has a special binary
compatibility ABI, which is enabled by the
&quot;-findirect-dispatch&quot; option. In this mode, the
code generated by gcj honors the binary compatibility
guarantees in the Java Language Specification, and the
resulting object files do not need to be directly linked
against their dependencies. Instead, all dependencies are
looked up at runtime. This allows free mixing of interpreted
and compiled code.</p>

<p>Note that, at present, &quot;-findirect-dispatch&quot;
can only be used when compiling .class files. It will not
work when compiling from source. CNI also does not yet work
with the binary compatibility ABI. These restrictions will
be lifted in some future release.</p>

<p>However, if you compile CNI code with the standard ABI,
you can call it from code built with the binary
compatibility ABI.</p>

<p>-fbootstrap-classes This option can be use to tell
&quot;libgcj&quot; that the compiled classes should be
loaded by the bootstrap loader, not the system class loader.
By default, if you compile a class and link it into an
executable, it will be treated as if it was loaded using the
system class loader. This is convenient, as it means that
things like &quot;Class.forName()&quot; will search
CLASSPATH to find the desired class.</p>

<p>-freduced-reflection This option causes the code
generated by gcj to contain a reduced amount of the class
meta-data used to support runtime reflection. The cost of
this savings is the loss of the ability to use certain
reflection capabilities of the standard Java runtime
environment. When set all meta-data except for that which is
needed to obtain correct runtime semantics is
eliminated.</p>

<p>For code that does not use reflection (i.e.
serialization, RMI, CORBA or call methods in the
&quot;java.lang.reflect&quot; package),
&quot;-freduced-reflection&quot; will result in proper
operation with a savings in executable code size.</p>

<p>JNI (&quot;-fjni&quot;) and the binary compatibility ABI
(&quot;-findirect-dispatch&quot;) do not work properly
without full reflection meta-data. Because of this, it is an
error to use these options with
&quot;-freduced-reflection&quot;.</p>

<p>Caution: If there is no reflection meta-data, code that
uses a &quot;SecurityManager&quot; may not work properly.
Also calling &quot;Class.forName()&quot; may fail if the
calling method has no reflection meta-data.</p>

<p>Configure-time Options Some gcj code generations options
affect the resulting ABI, and so can only be meaningfully
given when &quot;libgcj&quot;, the runtime package, is
configured. &quot;libgcj&quot; puts the appropriate options
from this group into a spec file which is read by gcj. These
options are listed here for completeness; if you are using
&quot;libgcj&quot; then you wont want to touch these
options.</p>

<p>-fuse-boehm-gc This enables the use of the Boehm GC
bitmap marking code. In particular this causes gcj to put an
object marking descriptor into each vtable.</p>

<p>-fhash-synchronization By default, synchronization data
(the data used for &quot;synchronize&quot;,
&quot;wait&quot;, and &quot;notify&quot;) is pointed to by a
word in each object. With this option gcj assumes that this
information is stored in a hash table and not in the object
itself.</p>

<p>-fuse-divide-subroutine On some systems, a library
routine is called to perform integer division. This is
required to get exception handling correct when dividing by
zero.</p>

<p>-fcheck-references On some systems its necessary to
insert inline checks whenever accessing an object via a
reference. On other systems you wont need this because null
pointer accesses are caught automatically by the
processor.</p>
