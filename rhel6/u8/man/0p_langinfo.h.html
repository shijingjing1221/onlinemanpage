nl_langinfo()). The type of the constant, nl_item, shall be

description segments. ERA_D_FMT LC_TIME Era date format
string. ERA_D_T_FMT LC_TIME Era date and time format string.
ERA_T_FMT LC_TIME Era time format string. ALT_DIGITS LC_TIME
Alternative symbols for digits. RADIXCHAR LC_NUMERIC Radix
character. THOUSEP LC_NUMERIC Separator for thousands.
YESEXPR LC_MESSAGES Affirmative response expression. NOEXPR
LC_MESSAGES Negative response expression. CRNCYSTR
LC_MONETARY Local currency symbol, preceded by- if the
symbol should appear before the value,+ if the symbol should
appear after the value, or .if the symbol should replace the
radix character. If the local currency symbol is the empty
string, implementations may return the empty string (
&quot;&quot; ).</p>

<p>If the locale s values for p_cs_precedes and
n_cs_precedes do not match, the value of
nl_langinfo(CRNCYSTR) is unspecified.</p>

<p>The following shall be declared as a function and may
also be defined as a macro. A function prototype shall be
provided.</p>

<p>char *nl_langinfo(nl_item);</p>

<p>Inclusion of the &lt;langinfo.h&gt; header may also make
visible all symbols from &lt;nl_types.h&gt;.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Wherever possible, users are advised
to use functions compatible with those in the ISO C standard
to access items of langinfo data. In par- ticular, the
strftime() function should be used to access date and time
information defined in category LC_TIME. The localeconv()
function should be used to access information corresponding
to RADIXCHAR, THOUSEP, and CRNCYSTR.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
