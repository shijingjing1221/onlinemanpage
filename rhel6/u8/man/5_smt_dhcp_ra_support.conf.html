<p>NAME smt_dhcp_ra_support.conf - The configuration file
for the DHCP Manage- ment using WBEM technologies.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS The smt_dhcp_ra_support.conf file is used to
configure the WBEM-SMT instrumentation components. It
defines several configuration parameters that are required
to run the CMPI provider correctly.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This configuration file is used to define
some variables used for the WBEM-SMT DHCP Instrumentation.
The providers will pick up the values from this file and
process according to these settings.</p>

<p>FILE FORMAT The file is used in the ini-style format.
Which means to set a configu- ration parameter you have to
specify a name value pair like</p>

<p>&lt;name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;</p>

<p>where name is a known configuration parameter and value
a valid value for the configuration parameter.</p>

<p>Is a line starting with # then the line is used as a
comment. Empty lines are totally ignored from any
processing.</p>

<p>ERROR HANDLING If an attribute name is not known, it
will be ignored from any further processing. Misspelled
values or values which are exceeding the values ranges will
automatically be replaced by the attributes default
value.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS dhcpconf The dhcpconf attribute
is used to define the location and the name of the DHCP
configuration file. The default is /etc/dhcpd.conf_</p>

<p>initscript The initscript attribute defines the location
and the name of the init script which is used to
start/stop/restart the DHCP server. The default is
