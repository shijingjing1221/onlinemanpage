<p>PASSMASS(1) PASSMASS(1)</p>

<p>NAME passmass - change password on multiple machines</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS passmass [ host1 host2 host3 ... ]</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION Passmass changes a password on multiple
machines. If you have accounts on several machines that do
not share password databases, Passmass can help you keep
them all in sync. This, in turn, will make it easier to
change them more frequently.</p>

<p>When Passmass runs, it asks you for the old and new
passwords. (If you are changing root passwords and have
equivalencing, the old password is not used and may be
omitted.)</p>

<p>Passmass understands the &quot;usual&quot; conventions.
Additional arguments may be used for tuning. They affect all
hosts which follow until another argument overrides it. For
example, if you are known as &quot;libes&quot; on host1 and
host2, but &quot;don&quot; on host3, you would say:</p>

<p>passmass host1 host2 -user don host3</p>

<p>Arguments are:</p>

<p>-user User whose password will be changed. By default,
the cur- rent user is used.</p>

<p>-rlogin Use rlogin to access host. (default)</p>

<p>-slogin Use slogin to access host.</p>

<p>-ssh Use ssh to access host.</p>

<p>-telnet Use telnet to access host.</p>

<p>-program</p>

<p>Next argument is a program to run to set the password.
Default is &quot;passwd&quot;. Other common choices are
&quot;yppasswd&quot; and &quot;set passwd&quot; (e.g., VMS
hosts). A program name such as &quot;password fred&quot; can
be used to create entries for new accounts (when run as
root).</p>

<p>-prompt Next argument is a prompt suffix pattern. This
allows the script to know when the shell is prompting. The
default is &quot;# &quot; for root and &quot;% &quot; for
non-root accounts.</p>

<p>-timeout Next argument is the number of seconds to wait
for responses. Default is 30 but some systems can be much
slower logging in.</p>

<p>-su Next argument is 1 or 0. If 1, you are additionally
prompted for a root password which is used to su after log-
ging in. roots password is changed rather than the users.
This is useful for hosts which do not allow root to log
in.</p>

<p>HOW TO USE The best way to run Passmass is to put the
command in a one-line shell script or alias. Whenever you
get a new account on a new machine, add the appropriate
arguments to the command. Then run it whenever you want to
change your passwords on all the hosts.</p>

<p>CAVEATS Using the same password on multiple hosts
carries risks. In particu- lar, if the password can be
stolen, then all of your accounts are at risk. Thus, you
should not use Passmass in situations where your pass- word
is visible, such as across a network which hackers are known
to eavesdrop.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you have enough accounts with
different pass- words, you may end up writing them down
somewhere - and that can be a security problem. Funny story:
my college roommate had an 11&quot;x13&quot; piece of paper
on which he had listed accounts and passwords all across the
Internet. This was several years worth of careful work and
he car- ried it with him everywhere he went. Well one day,
he forgot to remove it from his jeans, and we found a
perfectly blank sheet of paper when we took out the wash the
following day!</p>
