<p>NAME send_arp - tool to notify network of a new IP
address / MAC address mapping</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS send_arp takes the supplied data and sends it
out as an arp broadcast on the specified network device.
This tool is mostly used by software (such as piranha) that
manipulates virtual IP addresses and needs to notify the
network that the device servicing an IP address has
changed.</p>

<p>send_arp [-i
ARG&quot;]old-ip-addrold-mac-addrnew-ip-addrnew-mac-addr&quot;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION send_arp sends out an arp broadcast on the
specified network device (defaults to eth0), reporting an
old and new IP address mapping to a MAC address. This is
most useful in situations involving virtual IP addresses,
where the network device servicing that address has changed,
and other network arp caches need to be notified about it.
All the data is specified in the command line and is simply
passed along in an arp message frame. Since the old and new
data specified can contain the same information, this tool
can also be used to refresh arp caches or send periodic
broadcasts.</p>

<p>send_arp simply takes the specified arguments and places
them in an ethernet arp broadcast.is a daemon used by pulse
to monitor the running status of the specified services on
clustered servers. This tool has NO error checking and
should not be run without the direct supervision of
pulse!</p>

<p>OPTIONS -iARG Optional. Indicates the network device to
send the arp broadcast on. If omitted, the program defaults
to eth0.</p>

<p>old-ip-addr The original IP address (specified in
nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn format) that the MAC address specified in
&quot;old-mac-addr&quot; had mapped to it.</p>

<p>old-mac-addr The MAC address that was servicing the IP
address specified in &quot;old-ip-addr&quot;. The MAC
address is specified in hex, and can be formatted with or
without colon (&quot;:&quot;) separators.</p>

<p>new-ip-addr The new IP address (specified in
nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn format) that the MAC address specified in
&quot;new-mac-addr&quot; now has mapped to it.</p>

<p>new-mac-addr The MAC address that is now servicing the
IP address specified in &quot;new-ip-addr&quot;. The MAC
address is specified in hex, and can be formatted with or
without colon (&quot;:&quot;) separators.</p>
