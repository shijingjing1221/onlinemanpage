<p>QSUB(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual QSUB(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME qsub - submit a script</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS qsub [-a date_time][-A account_string][-c
interval] [-C directive_prefix][-e path_name][-h][-j
join_list][-k keep_list] [-m mail_options][-M mail_list][-N
name] [-o path_name][-p priority][-q destination][-r y|n]
[-S path_name_list][-u user_list][-v variable_list][-V]
[-z][script]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION To submit a script is to create a batch job
that executes the script. A script is submitted by a request
to a batch server. The qsub utility is a user-accessible
batch client that submits a script.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, the qsub utility shall have
created a batch job that will execute the submitted
script.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall submit a script by sending a
Queue Job Request to a batch server.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall place the value of the following
environment variables in the Variable_List attribute of the
batch job: HOME, LANG, LOGNAME, PATH, MAIL, SHELL, and TZ.
The name of the environment variable shall be the current
name prefixed with the string PBS_O_.</p>

<p>Note: If the current value of the HOME variable in the
environment space of the qsub utility is /aa/bb/cc, then
qsub shall place PBS_O_HOME = /aa/bb/cc in the Variable_List
attribute of the batch job.</p>

<p>In addition to the variables described above, the qsub
utility shall add the following variables with the indicated
values to the variable list:</p>

<p>PBS_O_WORKDIR The absolute path of the current working
directory of the qsub utility process.</p>

<p>PBS_O_HOST The name of the host on which the qsub
utility is running.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The qsub utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported by the
implementation:</p>

<p>-a date_time Define the time at which a batch job
becomes eligible for execu- tion.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall accept an option-argument that
conforms to the syntax of the time operand of the touch
utility.</p>

<p>Table: Environment Variable Values (Utilities)</p>

<p>Variable Name Value at qsub Time PBS_O_HOME HOME
PBS_O_HOST Client host name PBS_O_LANG LANG PBS_O_LOGNAME
LOGNAME PBS_O_PATH PATH PBS_O_MAIL MAIL PBS_O_SHELL SHELL
PBS_O_TZ TZ PBS_O_WORKDIR Current working directory</p>

<p>Note: The server that initiates execution of the batch
job will add other variables to the batch jobs environment;
see Batch Job Execution .</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall set the Execution_Time attribute
of the batch job to the number of seconds since the Epoch
that is equivalent to the local time expressed by the value
of the date_time option-argument. The Epoch is defined in
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
3.149, Epoch.</p>

<p>If the -a option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the utility shall set the Execution_Time attribute of the
batch job to a time (num- ber of seconds since the Epoch)
that is earlier than the time at which the utility
exits.</p>

<p>-A account_string</p>

<p>Define the account to which the resource consumption of
the batch job should be charged.</p>

<p>The syntax of the account_string option-argument is
unspecified.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall set the Account_Name attribute of
the batch job to the value of the account_string
option-argument.</p>

<p>If the -A option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the utility shall omit the Account_Name attribute from the
attributes of the batch job.</p>

<p>-c interval Define whether the batch job should be
checkpointed, and if so, how often.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall accept a value for the interval
option-argument that is one of the following:</p>

<p>n No checkpointing shall be performed on the batch job
(NO_CHECK- POINT).</p>

<p>s Checkpointing shall be performed only when the batch
server is shut down (CHECKPOINT_AT_SHUTDOWN).</p>

<p>c Automatic periodic checkpointing shall be performed at
the Mini- mum_Cpu_Interval attribute of the batch queue, in
units of CPU minutes (CHECKPOINT_AT_MIN_CPU_INTERVAL).</p>

<p>c=minutes Automatic periodic checkpointing shall be
performed every min- utes of CPU time, or every
Minimum_Cpu_Interval minutes, whichever is greater. The
minutes argument shall conform to the syntax for unsigned
integers and shall be greater than zero.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall set the Checkpoint attribute of
the batch job to the value of the interval
option-argument.</p>

<p>If the -c option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the utility shall set the Checkpoint attribute of the batch
job to the single char- acteru(CHECKPOINT_UNSPECIFIED).</p>

<p>-C directive_prefix</p>

<p>Define the prefix that declares a directive to the qsub
utility within the script.</p>

<p>The directive_prefix is not a batch job attribute; it
affects the behavior of the qsub utility.</p>

<p>If the -C option is presented to the qsub utility, and
the value of the directive_prefix option-argument is the
null string, the utility shall not scan the script file for
directives. If the -C option is not pre- sented to the qsub
utility, then the value of the PBS_DPREFIX environ- ment
variable is used. If the environment variable is not
defined, then #PBS encoded in the portable character set is
the default.</p>

<p>-e path_name Define the path to be used for the standard
error stream of the batch job.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall accept a path_name
option-argument which can be preceded by a host name element
of the form hostname:.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument constitutes an absolute
pathname, the qsub utility shall set the Error_Path
attribute of the batch job to the value of the path_name
option-argument.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument constitutes a relative
pathname and no host name element is specified, the qsub
utility shall set the Error_Path attribute of the batch job
to the value of the absolute pathname derived by expanding
the path_name option-argument relative to the current
directory of the process executing qsub.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument constitutes a relative
pathname and a host name element is specified, the qsub
utility shall set the Error_Path attribute of the batch job
to the value of the path_name option-argument without
expansion. The host name element shall be included.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument does not include a host
name element, the qsub utility shall prefix the pathname
with hostname:, where host- name is the name of the host
upon which the qsub utility is being exe- cuted.</p>

<p>If the -e option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the utility shall set the Error_Path attribute of the batch
job to the host name and path of the current directory of
the submitting process and the default filename.</p>

<p>The default filename for standard error has the
following format:</p>

<p>job_name.esequence_number</p>

<p>-h Specify that a USER hold is applied to the batch
job.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall set the value of the Hold_Types
attribute of the batch job to the value USER.</p>

<p>If the -h option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the utility shall set the Hold_Types attribute of the batch
job to the value NO_HOLD.</p>

<p>-j join_list Define which streams of the batch job are
to be merged. The qsub -j option shall accept a value for
the join_list option-argument that is a string of
alphanumeric characters in the portable character set (see
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
6.1, Portable Character Set).</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall accept a join_list
option-argument that consists of one or more of the
characterseand, or the single character n.</p>

<p>All of the other batch job output streams specified will
be merged into the output stream represented by the
character listed first in the join_list option-argument.</p>

<p>For each unique character in the join_list
option-argument, the qsub utility shall add a value to the
Join_Path attribute of the batch job as follows, each
representing a different batch job stream to join:</p>

<p>e The standard error of the batch job
(JOIN_STD_ERROR).</p>

<p>o The standard output of the batch job
(JOIN_STD_OUTPUT).</p>

<p>An existing Join_Path attribute can be cleared by the
following join type:</p>

<p>n NO_JOIN</p>

<p>If n is specified, then no files are joined. The qsub
utility shall consider it an error if any join type other
thannis combined with join typen.</p>

<p>Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of
the characters e , o, ornwithin the join_list
option-argument. The qsub utility shall permit the
repetition of characters, but shall not assign addi- tional
meaning to the repeated characters.</p>

<p>An implementation may define other join types. The
conformance document for an implementation shall describe
any additional batch job streams, how they are specified,
their internal behavior, and how they affect the behavior of
the utility.</p>

<p>If the -j option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the utility shall set the value of the Join_Path attribute
of the batch job to NO_JOIN.</p>

<p>-k keep_list Define which output of the batch job to
retain on the execution host.</p>

<p>The qsub -k option shall accept a value for the
keep_list option-argu- ment that is a string of alphanumeric
characters in the portable char- acter set (see the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 6.1,
Portable Character Set).</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall accept a keep_list
option-argument that consists of one or more of the
characterseand, or the single character n.</p>

<p>For each unique character in the keep_list
option-argument, the qsub utility shall add a value to the
Keep_Files attribute of the batch job as follows, each
representing a different batch job stream to keep:</p>

<p>e The standard error of the batch job
(KEEP_STD_ERROR).</p>

<p>o The standard output of the batch job
(KEEP_STD_OUTPUT).</p>

<p>If both e and oare specified, then both files are
retained. An existing Keep_Files attribute can be cleared by
the following keep type:</p>

<p>n NO_KEEP</p>

<p>If n is specified, then no files are retained. The qsub
utility shall consider it an error if any keep type other
than n is combined with keep typen.</p>

<p>Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of
the characters ,, orn within the keep_list option-argument.
The qsub utility shall permit the repetition of characters,
but shall not assign addi- tional meaning to the repeated
characters.</p>

<p>An implementation may define other keep types. The
conformance document for an implementation shall describe
any additional keep types, how they are specified, their
internal behavior, and how they affect the behavior of the
utility. If the -k option is not presented to the qsub
utility, the utility shall set the Keep_Files attribute of
the batch job to the value NO_KEEP.</p>

<p>-m mail_options</p>

<p>Define the points in the execution of the batch job at
which the batch server that manages the batch job shall send
mail about a change in the state of the batch job.</p>

<p>The qsub -m option shall accept a value for the
mail_options option- argument that is a string of
alphanumeric characters in the portable character set (see
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
6.1, Portable Character Set).</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall accept a value for the
mail_options option-argu- ment that is a string of one or
more of the characters,b , and , or the single
charactern.</p>

<p>For each unique character in the mail_options
option-argument, the qsub utility shall add a value to the
Mail_Users attribute of the batch job as follows, each
representing a different time during the life of a batch job
at which to send mail:</p>

<p>e MAIL_AT_EXIT</p>

<p>b MAIL_AT_BEGINNING</p>

<p>a MAIL_AT_ABORT</p>

<p>If any of these characters are duplicated in the
mail_options option- argument, the duplicates shall be
ignored.</p>

<p>An existing Mail_Points attribute can be cleared by the
following mail type:</p>

<p>n NO_MAIL</p>

<p>If nis specified, then mail is not sent. The qsub
utility shall con- sider it an error if any mail type other
thannis combined with mail typen.</p>

<p>Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of
the characters ,,, ornwithin the mail_options
option-argument.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall permit the repetition of
characters, but shall not assign additional meaning to the
repeated characters. An implemen- tation may define other
mail types. The conformance document for an implementation
shall describe any additional mail types, how they are
specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect the
behavior of the utility.</p>

<p>If the -m option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the utility shall set the Mail_Points attribute to the value
MAIL_AT_ABORT.</p>

<p>-M mail_list Define the list of users to which a batch
server that executes the batch job shall send mail, if the
server sends mail about the batch job.</p>

<p>The syntax of the mail_list option-argument is
unspecified.</p>

<p>If the implementation of the qsub utility uses a name
service to locate users, the utility should accept the
syntax used by the name service.</p>

<p>If the implementation of the qsub utility does not use a
name service to locate users, the implementation should
accept the following syntax for user names:</p>

<p>mail_address[,,mail_address,, ...]</p>

<p>The interpretation of mail_address is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall set the Mail_Users attribute of
the batch job to the value of the mail_list
option-argument.</p>

<p>If the -M option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the utility shall place only the user name and host name for
the current process in the Mail_Users attribute of the batch
job.</p>

<p>-N name Define the name of the batch job.</p>

<p>The qsub -N option shall accept a value for the name
option-argument that is a string of up to 15 alphanumeric
characters in the portable character set (see the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 6.1,
Portable Character Set) where the first character is
alphabetic.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall set the value of the Job_Name
attribute of the batch job to the value of the name
option-argument.</p>

<p>If the -N option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the utility shall set the Job_Name attribute of the batch
job to the name of the script argument from which the
directory specification if any, has been removed.</p>

<p>If the -N option is not presented to the qsub utility,
and the script is read from standard input, the utility
shall set the Job_Name attribute of the batch job to the
value STDIN.</p>

<p>-o path_name Define the path for the standard output of
the batch job.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall accept a path_name
option-argument that conforms to the syntax of the path_name
element defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, which can be preceded by a host name element of
the form hostname:.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument constitutes an absolute
pathname, the qsub utility shall set the Output_Path
attribute of the batch job to the value of the path_name
option-argument without expansion.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument constitutes a relative
pathname and no host name element is specified, the qsub
utility shall set the Out- put_Path attribute of the batch
job to the pathname derived by expand- ing the value of the
path_name option-argument relative to the current directory
of the process executing the qsub.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument constitutes a relative
pathname and a host name element is specified, the qsub
utility shall set the Out- put_Path attribute of the batch
job to the value of the path_name option-argument without
expansion.</p>

<p>If the path_name option-argument does not specify a host
name element, the qsub utility shall prefix the pathname
with hostname:, where host- name is the name of the host
upon which the qsub utility is executing.</p>

<p>If the -o option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the utility shall set the Output_Path attribute of the batch
job to the host name and path of the current directory of
the submitting process and the default filename.</p>

<p>The default filename for standard output has the
following format:</p>

<p>job_name.osequence_number</p>

<p>-p priority Define the priority the batch job should
have relative to other batch jobs owned by the batch
server.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall set the Priority attribute of the
batch job to the value of the priority option-argument.</p>

<p>If the -p option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the value of the Priority attribute is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall accept a value for the priority
option-argument that conforms to the syntax for signed
decimal integers, and which is not less than -1024 and not
greater than 1023.</p>

<p>-q destination</p>

<p>Define the destination of the batch job.</p>

<p>The destination is not a batch job attribute; it
determines the batch server, and possibly the batch queue,
to which the qsub utility batch queues the batch job.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall submit the script to the batch
server named by the destination option-argument or the
server that owns the batch queue named in the destination
option-argument.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall accept an option-argument for the
-q option that conforms to the syntax for a destination (see
Destination ).</p>

<p>If the -q option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the qsub utility shall submit the batch job to the default
destination. The mechanism for determining the default
destination is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>-r y|n Define whether the batch job is rerunnable.</p>

<p>If the value of the option-argument is y, the qsub
utility shall set the Rerunable attribute of the batch job
to TRUE.</p>

<p>If the value of the option-argument is n, the qsub
utility shall set the Rerunable attribute of the batch job
to FALSE.</p>

<p>If the -r option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the utility shall set the Rerunable attribute of the batch
job to TRUE.</p>

<p>-S path_name_list</p>

<p>Define the pathname to the shell under which the batch
job is to execute.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall accept a path_name_list
option-argument that conforms to the following syntax:</p>

<p>pathname[@host][,,pathname[@host],, ...]</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall allow only one pathname for a
given host name. The qsub utility shall allow only one
pathname that is missing a corre- sponding host name.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall add a value to the
Shell_Path_List attribute of the batch job for each entry in
the path_name_list option-argument.</p>

<p>If the -S option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the utility shall set the Shell_Path_List attribute of the
batch job to the null string.</p>

<p>The conformance document for an implementation shall
describe the mech- anism used to set the default shell and
determine the current value of the default shell. An
implementation shall provide a means for the installation to
set the default shell to the login shell of the user under
which the batch job is to execute. See Multiple
Keyword-Value Pairs for a means of removing keyword= value
(and value@ keyword) pairs and other general rules for
list-oriented batch job attributes.</p>

<p>-u user_list Define the user name under which the batch
job is to execute.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall accept a user_list
option-argument that conforms to the following syntax:</p>

<p>username[@host][,,username[@host],, ...]</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall accept only one user name that is
missing a cor- responding host name. The qsub utility shall
accept only one user name per named host.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall add a value to the User_List
attribute of the batch job for each entry in the user_list
option-argument.</p>

<p>If the -u option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the utility shall set the User_List attribute of the batch
job to the user name from which the utility is executing.
See Multiple Keyword-Value Pairs for a means of removing
keyword= value (and value@ keyword) pairs and other general
rules for list-oriented batch job attributes.</p>

<p>-v variable_list</p>

<p>Add to the list of variables that are exported to the
session leader of the batch job.</p>

<p>A variable_list is a set of strings of either the form
&lt; variable&gt; or &lt; variable= value&gt;, delimited by
commas.</p>

<p>If the -v option is presented to the qsub utility, the
utility shall also add, to the environment Variable_List
attribute of the batch job, every variable named in the
environment variable_list option-argument and, optionally,
values of specified variables.</p>

<p>If a value is not provided on the command line, the qsub
utility shall set the value of each variable in the
environment Variable_List attribute of the batch job to the
value of the corresponding environ- ment variable for the
process in which the utility is executing; see Environment
Variable Values (Utilities) .</p>

<p>A conforming application shall not repeat a variable in
the environment variable_list option-argument.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall not repeat a variable in the
environment Vari- able_List attribute of the batch job. See
Multiple Keyword-Value Pairs for a means of removing
keyword= value (and value@ keyword) pairs and other general
rules for list-oriented batch job attributes.</p>

<p>-V Specify that all of the environment variables of the
process are exported to the context of the batch job.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall place every environment variable
in the process in which the utility is executing in the list
and shall set the value of each variable in the attribute to
the value of that variable in the process.</p>

<p>-z Specify that the utility does not write the batch
job_identifier of the created batch job to standard
output.</p>

<p>If the -z option is presented to the qsub utility, the
utility shall not write the batch job_identifier of the
created batch job to standard output.</p>

<p>If the -z option is not presented to the qsub utility,
the utility shall write the identifier of the created batch
job to standard output.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The qsub utility shall accept a script operand
that indicates the path to the script of the batch job.</p>

<p>If the script operand is not presented to the qsub
utility, or if the operand is the single-character string,
the utility shall read the script from standard input.</p>

<p>If the script represents a partial path, the qsub
utility shall expand the path relative to the current
directory of the process executing the utility.</p>

<p>STDIN The qsub utility reads the script of the batch job
from standard input if the script operand is omitted or is
the single character-.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES In addition to binding the file indicated by
the script operand to the batch job, the qsub utility reads
the script file and acts on direc- tives in the script.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of qsub:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>LOGNAME Determine the login name of the user.</p>

<p>PBS_DPREFIX</p>

<p>Determine the default prefix for directives within the
script.</p>

<p>SHELL Determine the pathname of the preferred command
language inter- preter of the user.</p>

<p>TZ Determine the timezone used to interpret the
date-time option- argument. If TZ is unset or null, an
unspecified default time- zone shall be used.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Once created, a batch job exists
until it exits, aborts, or is deleted.</p>

<p>After a batch job is created by the qsub utility, batch
servers might route, execute, modify, or delete the batch
job.</p>

<p>STDOUT The qsub utility writes the batch job_identifier
assigned to the batch job to standard output, unless the -z
option is specified.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION Script Preservation The qsub
utility shall make the script available to the server
execut- ing the batch job in such a way that the server
executes the script as it exists at the time of
submission.</p>

<p>The qsub utility can send a copy of the script to the
server with the Queue Job Request or store a temporary copy
of the script in a location specified to the server.</p>

<p>Option Specification A script can contain directives to
the qsub utility.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall scan the lines of the script for
directives, skipping blank lines, until the first line that
begins with a string other than the directive string; if
directives occur on subsequent lines, the utility shall
ignore those directives.</p>

<p>Lines are separated by a &lt;newline&gt;. If the first
line of the script begins with &quot;#!&quot; or a colon
(:), then it is skipped. The qsub util- ity shall process a
line in the script as a directive if and only if the string
of characters from the first non-white-space character on
the line until the first &lt;space&gt; or &lt;tab&gt; on the
line match the direc- tive prefix. If a line in the script
contains a directive and the final characters of the line
are backslash ) and &lt;newline&gt;, then the next line
shall be interpreted as a continuation of that
directive.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall process the options and
option-arguments con- tained on the directive prefix line
using the same syntax as if the options were input on the
qsub utility.</p>

<p>The qsub utility shall continue to process a directive
prefix line until after a &lt;newline&gt; is encountered. An
implementation may ignore lines which, according to the
syntax of the shell that will interpret the script, are
comments. An implementation shall describe in the con-
formance document the format of any shell comments that it
will recog- nize.</p>

<p>If an option is present in both a directive and the
arguments to the qsub utility, the utility shall ignore the
option and the corresponding option-argument, if any, in the
directive.</p>

<p>If an option that is present in the directive is not
present in the arguments to the qsub utility, the utility
shall process the option and the option-argument, if
any.</p>

<p>In order of preference, the qsub utility shall select
the directive prefix from one of the following sources:</p>

<p>* If the -C option is presented to the utility, the
value of the directive_prefix option-argument</p>

<p>* If the environment variable PBS_DPREFIX is defined,
the value of that variable</p>

<p>* The four-character string &quot;#PBS&quot; encoded in
the portable character set</p>

<p>If the -C option is present in the script file it shall
be ignored.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The qsub utility allows users to create a
batch job that will process the script specified as the
operand of the utility.</p>

<p>The options of the qsub utility allow users to control
many aspects of the queuing and execution of a batch
job.</p>

<p>The -a option allows users to designate the time after
which the batch job will become eligible to run. By
specifying an execution time, users can take advantage of
resources at off-peak hours, synchronize jobs with
chronologically predictable events, and perhaps take
advantage of off-peak pricing of computing time. For these
reasons and others, a timing option is existing practice on
the part of almost every batch system, including NQS.</p>

<p>The -A option allows users to specify the account that
will be charged for the batch job. Support for account is
not mandatory for conforming batch servers.</p>

<p>The -C option allows users to prescribe the prefix for
directives within the script file. The default prefix
&quot;#PBS&quot; may be inappropriate if the script will be
interpreted with an alternate shell, as specified by the -S
option.</p>

<p>The -c option allows users to establish the
checkpointing interval for their jobs. A checkpointing
system, which is not defined by this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, allows recovery of a batch job at the most
recent checkpoint in the event of a crash. Checkpointing is
typically used for jobs that consume expensive computing
time or must meet a critical schedule. Users should be
allowed to make the tradeoff between the overhead of
checkpointing and the risk to the timely completion of the
batch job; therefore, this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
provides the checkpointing interval option. Support for
checkpointing is optional for batch servers.</p>

<p>The -e option allows users to redirect the standard
error streams of their jobs to a non-default path. For
example, if the submitted script generally produces a great
deal of useless error output, a user might redirect the
standard error output to the null device. Or, if the file
system holding the default location (the home directory of
the user) has too little free space, the user might redirect
the standard error stream to a file in another file
system.</p>

<p>The -h option allows users to create a batch job that is
held until explicitly released. The ability to create a held
job is useful when some external event must complete before
the batch job can execute. For example, the user might
submit a held job and release it when the sys- tem load has
dropped.</p>

<p>The -j option allows users to merge the standard error
of a batch job into its standard output stream, which has
the advantage of showing the sequential relationship between
output and error messages.</p>

<p>The -m option allows users to designate those points in
the execution of a batch job at which mail will be sent to
the submitting user, or to the account(s) indicated by the
-M option. By requesting mail notifi- cation at points of
interest in the life of a job, the submitting user, or other
designated users, can track the progress of a batch job.</p>

<p>The -N option allows users to associate a name with the
batch job. The job name in no way affects the processing of
the batch job, but rather serves as a mnemonic handle for
users. For example, the batch job name can help the user
distinguish between multiple jobs listed by the qstat
utility.</p>

<p>The -o option allows users to redirect the standard
output stream. A user might, for example, wish to redirect
to the null device the stan- dard output stream of a job
that produces copious yet superfluous out- put.</p>

<p>The -P option allows users to designate the relative
priority of a batch job for selection from a queue.</p>

<p>The -q option allows users to specify an initial queue
for the batch job. If the user specifies a routing queue,
the batch server routes the batch job to another queue for
execution or further routing. If the user specifies a
non-routing queue, the batch server of the queue even-
tually executes the batch job.</p>

<p>The -r option allows users to control whether the
submitted job will be rerun if the controlling batch node
fails during execution of the batch job. The -r option
likewise allows users to indicate whether or not the batch
job is eligible to be rerun by the qrerun utility. Some jobs
can- not be correctly rerun because of changes they make in
the state of databases or other aspects of their
environment. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 specifies
that the default, if the -r option is not presented to the
utility, will be that the batch job cannot be rerun, since
the result of rerunning a non-rerunnable job might be
catastrophic.</p>

<p>The -S option allows users to specify the program
(usually a shell) that will be invoked to process the script
of the batch job. This option has been modified to allow a
list of shell names and locations associated with different
hosts.</p>

<p>The -u option is useful when the submitting user is
authorized to use more than one account on a given host, in
which case the -u option allows the user to select from
among those accounts. The option-argu- ment is a list of
user-host pairs, so that the submitting user can pro- vide
different user identifiers for different nodes in the event
the batch job is routed. The -u option provides a lot of
flexibility to accommodate sites with complex account
structures. Users that have the same user identifier on all
the hosts they are authorized to use will not need to use
the -u option.</p>

<p>The -V option allows users to export all their current
environment variables, as of the time the batch job is
submitted, to the context of the processes of the batch
job.</p>

<p>The -v option allows users to export specific
environment variables from their current process to the
processes of the batch job.</p>

<p>The -z option allows users to suppress the writing of
the batch job identifier to standard output. The -z option
is an existing NQS prac- tice that has been
standardized.</p>

<p>Historically, the qsub utility has served the batch
job-submission function in the NQS system, the existing
practice on which it is based. Some changes and additions
have been made to the qsub utility in this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, vis-a-vis NQS, as a result of the grow- ing
pool of experience with distributed batch systems.</p>

<p>The set of features of the qsub utility as defined in
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 appears to incorporate
all the common existing practice on potentially conforming
platforms.</p>
