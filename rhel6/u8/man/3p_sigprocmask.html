<p>PTHREAD_SIGMASK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_SIGMASK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_sigmask, sigprocmask - examine and change
blocked signals</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_sigmask(int how, const sigset_t *restrict
set, sigset_t *restrict oset);</p>

<p>int sigprocmask(int how, const sigset_t *restrict set,
sigset_t *restrict oset);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_sigmask() function shall examine
or change (or both) the calling threads signal mask,
regardless of the number of threads in the process. The
function shall be equivalent to sigprocmask(), without the
restriction that the call be made in a single-threaded
process.</p>

<p>In a single-threaded process, the sigprocmask() function
shall examine or change (or both) the signal mask of the
calling thread.</p>

<p>If the argument set is not a null pointer, it points to
a set of sig- nals to be used to change the currently
blocked set.</p>

<p>The argument how indicates the way in which the set is
changed, and the application shall ensure it consists of one
of the following values:</p>

<p>SIG_BLOCK The resulting set shall be the union of the
current set and the signal set pointed to by set.</p>

<p>SIG_SETMASK The resulting set shall be the signal set
pointed to by set.</p>

<p>SIG_UNBLOCK The resulting set shall be the intersection
of the current set and the complement of the signal set
pointed to by set.</p>

<p>If the argument oset is not a null pointer, the previous
mask shall be stored in the location pointed to by oset. If
set is a null pointer, the value of the argument how is not
significant and the process sig- nal mask shall be
unchanged; thus the call can be used to enquire about
currently blocked signals.</p>

<p>If there are any pending unblocked signals after the
call to sigproc- mask(), at least one of those signals shall
be delivered before the call to sigprocmask() returns.</p>

<p>It is not possible to block those signals which cannot
be ignored. This shall be enforced by the system without
causing an error to be indicated.</p>

<p>If any of the SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGSEGV, or SIGBUS signals
are generated while they are blocked, the result is
undefined, unless the signal was generated by the kill()
function, the sigqueue() function, or the raise()
function.</p>

<p>If sigprocmask() fails, the threads signal mask shall
not be changed.</p>

<p>The use of the sigprocmask() function is unspecified in
a multi- threaded process.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion
pthread_sigmask() shall return 0; otherwise, it shall return
the corresponding error number.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, sigprocmask() shall return
0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned, errno shall be set to
indicate the error, and the process signal mask shall be
unchanged.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_sigmask() and sigprocmask() functions
shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the how argument is not equal to one
of the defined values.</p>

<p>The pthread_sigmask() function shall not return an error
code of [EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE When a process signal mask is changed in a
signal-catching function that is installed by sigaction(),
the restoration of the signal mask on return from the
signal-catching function overrides that change (see
sigaction()). If the signal-catching function was installed
with sig- nal(), it is unspecified whether this occurs.</p>

<p>See kill() for a discussion of the requirement on
delivery of signals.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
