<p>CWEB(1) CWEB(1)</p>

<p>NAME ctangle, cweave - translate CWEB to C and/or
TeX</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ctangle [ -bhp ] [ +s ] webfile[.w]
[changefile[.ch]] [outputfile[.c]] cweave [ -befhpx ] [ +s ]
webfile[.w] [changefile[.ch]] [output- file[.tex]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ctangle program converts a CWEB source
document into a C program that may be compiled in the usual
way. The output file includes #line specifications so that
debugging can be done in terms of the CWEB source file.</p>

<p>The cweave program converts the same CWEB file into a
TeX file that may be formatted and printed in the usual way.
It takes appropriate care of typographic details like page
layout and the use of indentation, italics, boldface, etc.,
and it supplies extensive cross-index informa- tion that it
gathers automatically.</p>

<p>CWEB allows you to prepare a single document containing
all the infor- mation that is needed both to produce a
compilable C program and to produce a well-formatted
document describing the program in as much detail as the
writer may desire. The user of CWEB ought to be familiar
with TeX as well as C.</p>

<p>The command line should have one, two, or three names on
it. The first is taken as the CWEB file (and .w is added if
there is no extension). If that file cannot be opened, the
extension .web is tried instead. (But .w is recommended,
since .web usually implies Pascal.) If there is a second
name, it is a change file (and .ch is added if there is no
extension). The change file overrides parts of the WEB file,
as described in the documentation. If there is a third name,
it overrides the default name of the output file, which is
ordinarily the same as the name of the input file (but on
the current directory) with the extension .c or .tex.</p>

<p>Options in the command line may be either turned off
with - (if they are on by default) or turned on with + (if
they are off by default). In fact, the options are processed
from left to right, so a sequence like -f +f corresponds to
+f (which is the default).</p>

<p>The -b option suppresses the banner line that normally
appears on your terminal when ctangle or cweave begins. The
-h option suppresses the happy message that normally appears
if the processing was successful. The -p option suppresses
progress reports (starred module numbers) as the processing
takes place. If you say -bhp, you get nothing but error
messages.</p>

<p>The +s option prints statistics about memory usage at
the end of a run (assuming that the programs have been
compiled with the -DSTAT switch).</p>

<p>There are three other options applicable to cweave only:
-f means do not force a newline after every statement in the
formatted output. -e inhibits the enclosure of C material
formatted by cweave in brackets PB{...}. Such brackets are
normally inserted so that special hooks can be used by
cweb-latex and similar programs. -x means omit the index and
table of contents.</p>

<p>FILES The location of the files mentioned below varies
from system to system. Use the kpsewhich utility to find
their locations.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Don Knuth wrote WEB for TeX and Pascal. Silvio
Levy designed and developed CWEB by adapting the WEB
conventions to C and by recoding everything in CWEB. Knuth
began using CWEB and made further refine- ments. Many other
helpers are acknowledged in the CWEB manual.</p>
