<p>SYSTEM-AUTH(5) Linux-PAM Manual SYSTEM-AUTH(5)</p>

<p>NAME system-auth - Common configuration file for
PAMified services</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/pam.d/system-auth /etc/pam.d/password-auth
/etc/pam.d/fingerprint- auth /etc/pam.d/smartcard-auth</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The purpose of these configuration files are
to provide a common inter- face for all applications and
service daemons calling into the PAM library.</p>

<p>The system-auth configuration file is included from
nearly all individ- ual service configuration files with the
help of the include directive.</p>

<p>The password-auth fingerprint-auth smartcard-auth
configuration files are for applications which handle
authentication from different types of devices via
simultaneously running individual conversations instead of
one aggregate conversation.</p>

<p>NOTES There should be no sufficient modules in the
session part of system- auth file because individual
services may add session modules after include of the
system-auth file. Execution of these modules would be
skipped if there were sufficient modules in system-auth
file.</p>

<p>Conversely there should not be any modules after include
directive in the individual service files in authaccount and
password sections oth- erwise they could be bypassed.</p>

<p>BUGS None known.</p>

module develop- ers, and application developers.</p>
