<p>SHOWMOUNT(8) SHOWMOUNT(8)</p>

<p>NAME showmount - show mount information for an NFS
server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS showmount [ -adehv ] [ --all ] [ --directories
] [ --exports ] [ --help ] [ --version ] [ host ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION showmount queries the mount daemon on a
remote host for information about the state of the NFS
server on that machine. With no options showmount lists the
set of clients who are mounting from that host. The output
from showmount is designed to appear as though it were pro-
cessed through sort -u.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a or --all List both the client hostname or IP
address and mounted direc- tory in host:dir format. This
info should not be considered reliable. See the notes on
rmtab in rpc.mountd(8).</p>

<p>-d or --directories List only the directories mounted by
some client.</p>

<p>-e or --exports Show the NFS servers export list.</p>

<p>-h or --help Provide a short help summary.</p>

<p>-v or --version Report the current version number of the
program.</p>

<p>--no-headers Suppress the descriptive headings from the
output.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO rpc.mountd(8), rpc.nfsd(8)</p>

<p>BUGS The completeness and accuracy of the information
that showmount dis- plays varies according to the NFS
servers implementation.</p>

<p>Because showmount sorts and uniqs the output, it is
impossible to determine from the output whether a client is
mounting the same direc- tory more than once.</p>
