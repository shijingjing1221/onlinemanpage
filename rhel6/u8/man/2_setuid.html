<p>SETUID(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SETUID(2)</p>

<p>NAME setuid - set user identity</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setuid(uid_t uid);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION setuid() sets the effective user ID of the
calling process. If the effective UID of the caller is root,
the real UID and saved set-user-ID are also set.</p>

<p>Under Linux, setuid() is implemented like the POSIX
version with the _POSIX_SAVED_IDS feature. This allows a
set-user-ID (other than root) program to drop all of its
user privileges, do some un-privileged work, and then
re-engage the original effective user ID in a secure
manner.</p>

<p>If the user is root or the program is set-user-ID-root,
special care must be taken. The setuid() function checks the
effective user ID of the caller and if it is the superuser,
all process-related user IDs are set to uid. After this has
occurred, it is impossible for the pro- gram to regain root
privileges.</p>

<p>Thus, a set-user-ID-root program wishing to temporarily
drop root priv- ileges, assume the identity of a non-root
user, and then regain root privileges afterwards cannot use
setuid(). You can accomplish this with the (non-POSIX, BSD)
call seteuid(2).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN The uid does not match the current uid and
uid brings process over its RLIMIT_NPROC resource limit.</p>

<p>EPERM The user is not privileged (Linux: does not have
the CAP_SETUID capability) and uid does not match the real
UID or saved set- user-ID of the calling process.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001. Not quite compatible
with the 4.4BSD call, which sets all of the real, saved, and
effective user IDs.</p>

<p>NOTES Linux Notes Linux has the concept of file system
user ID, normally equal to the effective user ID. The
setuid() call also sets the file system user ID of the
calling process. See setfsuid(2).</p>

<p>If uid is different from the old effective uid, the
process will be forbidden from leaving core dumps.</p>
