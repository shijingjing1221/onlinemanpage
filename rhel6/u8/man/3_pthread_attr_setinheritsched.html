<p>PTHREAD_ATTR_SETINHERITSCHELinux Programmer s
MPTHREAD_ATTR_SETINHERITSCHED(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_attr_setinheritsched,
pthread_attr_getinheritsched - set/get inherit scheduler
attribute in thread attributes object</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_attr_setinheritsched(pthread_attr_t *attr,
int inheritsched); int
pthread_attr_getinheritsched(pthread_attr_t *attr, int
*inheritsched);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_attr_setinheritsched() function
sets the inherit scheduler attribute of the thread
attributes object referred to by attr to the value specified
in inheritsched. The inherit scheduler attribute determines
whether a thread created using the thread attributes object
attr will inherit its scheduling attributes from the calling
thread or whether it will take them from attr.</p>

<p>The following values may be specified in
inheritsched:</p>

<p>PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED Threads that are created using
attr inherit scheduling attributes from the creating thread;
the scheduling attributes in attr are ignored.</p>

<p>PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED Threads that are created using
attr take their scheduling attributes from the values
specified by the attributes object.</p>

<p>The default setting of the inherit scheduler attribute
in a newly ini- tialized thread attributes object is
PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED.</p>

<p>The pthread_attr_getinheritsched() returns the inherit
scheduler attribute of the thread attributes object attr in
the buffer pointed to by inheritsched.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these functions return 0; on
error, they return a non-zero error number.</p>

<p>ERRORS pthread_attr_setinheritsched() can fail with the
following error:</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid value in inheritsched.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 also documents an optional ENOTSUP error
(&quot;attempt was made to set the attribute to an
unsupported value&quot;) for
pthread_attr_setinheritsched().</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE See pthread_setschedparam(3).</p>

<p>BUGS As at glibc 2.8, if a thread attributes object is
initialized using pthread_attr_init(3), then the scheduling
policy of the attributes object is set to SCHED_OTHER and
the scheduling priority is set to 0. However, if the inherit
scheduler attribute is then set to PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED,
then a thread created using the attribute object wrongly
inherits its scheduling attributes from the creating thread.
This bug does not occur if either the scheduling policy or
scheduling priority attribute is explicitly set in the
thread attributes object before calling
pthread_create(3).</p>
