<p>LOGNAME(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual LOGNAME(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME logname - return the users login name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS logname</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The logname utility shall write the users
login name to standard out- put. The login name shall be the
string that would be returned by the getlogin() function
defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001. Under the conditions where the getlogin() func-
tion would fail, the logname utility shall write a
diagnostic message to standard error and exit with a
non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS None.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of log- name:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The logname utility output shall be a single line
consisting of the users login name:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;login name&gt;</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The logname utility explicitly ignores
the LOGNAME environment variable because environment changes
could produce erroneous results.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The passwd file is not listed as required
because the implementation may have other means of mapping
login names.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
