<p>CALLOC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CALLOC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME calloc - a memory allocator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *calloc(size_t nelem, size_t elsize);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The calloc() function shall allocate unused
space for an array of nelem elements each of whose size in
bytes is elsize. The space shall be ini- tialized to all
bits 0.</p>

<p>The order and contiguity of storage allocated by
successive calls to calloc() is unspecified. The pointer
returned if the allocation suc- ceeds shall be suitably
aligned so that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type
of object and then used to access such an object or an array
of such objects in the space allocated (until the space is
explicitly freed or reallocated). Each such allocation shall
yield a pointer to an object disjoint from any other object.
The pointer returned shall point to the start (lowest byte
address) of the allo- cated space. If the space cannot be
allocated, a null pointer shall be returned. If the size of
the space requested is 0, the behavior is
implementation-defined: the value returned shall be either a
null pointer or a unique pointer.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion with both nelem
and elsize non-zero, cal- loc() shall return a pointer to
the allocated space. If either nelem or elsize is 0, then
either a null pointer or a unique pointer value that can be
successfully passed to free() shall be returned. Otherwise,
it shall return a null pointer and set errno to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The calloc() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory is available.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE There is now no requirement for the
implementation to support the inclusion of
&lt;malloc.h&gt;.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
