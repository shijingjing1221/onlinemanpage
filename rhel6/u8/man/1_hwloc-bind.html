<p>HWLOC-BIND(1) hwloc HWLOC-BIND(1)</p>

<p>NAME hwloc-bind - Launch a command that is bound to
specific processors and/or memory.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS hwloc-bind [options] &lt;location1&gt;
[&lt;location2&gt; [...] ] [--] &lt;command&gt; ...</p>

<p>OPTIONS See below for a description of valid
&lt;location&gt; formats.</p>

<p>--cpubind Use following arguments for CPU binding
(default).</p>

<p>--membind Use following arguments for memory binding. If
--mempolicy is not also given, the default policy is
bind.</p>

<p>--mempolicy &lt;policy&gt; Change the memory binding
policy. The available policies are default, firsttouch,
bind, interleave replicate and next- touch. This option is
only meaningful when an actual binding is also given with
--membind. If --membind is given without --mempolicy, the
default policy is bind.</p>

<p>--get Report the current bindings. When combined with
--membind, report the memory binding instead of CPU
binding.</p>

<p>--get-last-cpu-location Report the last processors where
the process ran. Note that the result may already be
outdated when reported since the operating system may move
the process to other processors at any time according to the
binding. This option cannot be combined with --membind.</p>

<p>--single Bind on a single CPU to prevent migration.</p>

<p>--strict Require strict binding.</p>

<p>--pid &lt;pid&gt; Operate on pid &lt;pid&gt;</p>

<p>-p --physical take OS/physical indexes instead of
logical indexes</p>

<p>-l --logical take logical indexes instead of physical/OS
indexes (default)</p>

<p>--taskset Display CPU set strings in the format
recognized by the taskset command-line program instead of
hwloc-specific CPU set string format. This option has no
impact on the format of input CPU set strings, both formats
are always accepted.</p>

<p>-v Verbose output.</p>

<p>--version Report version and exit.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION hwloc-bind execs an executable (with
optional command line arguments) that is bound to the
specified location (or list of locations). Upon successful
execution, hwloc-bind simply sets bindings and then execs
the executable over itself.</p>

<p>NOTE: It is highly recommended that you read the
hwloc(7) overview page before reading this man page. Most of
the concepts described in hwloc(7) directly apply to the
hwloc-bind utility.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES hwloc-bind s operation is best described
through several examples. More details about how locations
are specified on the hwloc-bind com- mand line are described
in hwloc(7).</p>

<p>To run the echo command on the first logical processor
of the second socket:</p>

<p>hwloc-bind socket:1.pu:0 -- echo hello</p>

<p>which is exactly equivalent to</p>

<p>hwloc-bind socket:1.pu:0 echo hello</p>

<p>To bind the &quot;echo&quot; command to the first core
of the second socket and the second core of the first
socket:</p>

<p>hwloc-bind socket:1.core:0 socket:0.core:1 echo
hello</p>

<p>Note that binding the &quot;echo&quot; command to
multiple processors is probably meaningless (because
&quot;echo&quot; is likely implemented as a single-threaded
application); these examples just serve to show what
hwloc-bind can do.</p>

<p>To run on the first three sockets on the second and
third nodes:</p>

<p>hwloc-bind node:1-2.socket:0:3 echo hello</p>

<p>which is also equivalent to:</p>

<p>hwloc-bind node:1-2.socket:0-2 echo hello</p>

<p>Note that if you attempt to bind to objects that do not
exist, hwloc- bind will not warn unless -v was
specified.</p>

<p>To run on processor with physical index 2 in socket with
physical index 1:</p>

<p>hwloc-bind --physical socket:1.core:2 echo hello</p>

<p>To run on odd cores within even sockets:</p>

<p>hwloc-bind socket:even.core:odd echo hello</p>

<p>To run on the first socket, except on its second and
fifth cores:</p>

<p>hwloc-bind socket:0 ~socket:0.core:1 ~socket:0.core:4
echo hello</p>

<p>To run anywhere except on the first socket:</p>

<p>hwloc-bind all ~socket:0 echo hello</p>

<p>To run on a core near the network interface named
eth0:</p>

<p>hwloc-bind os=eth0 echo hello</p>

<p>To run on a core near the PCI device whose bus ID is
0000:01:02.0:</p>

<p>hwloc-bind pci=0000:01:02.0 echo hello</p>

<p>To bind memory on second memory node and run on first
node (when sup- ported by the OS):</p>

<p>hwloc-bind --cpubind node:1 --membind node:0 echo
hello</p>

<p>The --get option can report current bindings. This
example shows nest- ing hwloc-bind invocations to set a
binding and then report it:</p>

<p>hwloc-bind node:1.socket:2 hwloc-bind --get</p>

<p>On one of the hwloc developer s machines, this example
reports &quot;0x00004444,0x44000000&quot;. The mask reported
on your machine may be dif- ferent.</p>

<p>Locations may also be specified as a hex bit mask
(typically generated by hwloc-calc). For example:</p>

<p>hwloc-bind 0x00004444,0x44000000 echo hello hwloc-bind
hwloc-calc node:1.socket:2 echo hello</p>

<p>Memory binding may also be reported:</p>

<p>hwloc-bind --membind node:1 --mempolicy interleave --
hwloc-bind --get --membind</p>

<p>This returns a string describing the memory binding,
such as &quot;0x000000f0 (interleave)&quot;. Note that if
the system does not contain any NUMA nodes, the reported
string will indicate that the process is bound to the entire
system memory (e.g., &quot;0xf...f&quot;).</p>

<p>HINT If the graphics-enabled lstopo is available, use
for instance</p>

<p>hwloc-bind core:2 -- lstopo --pid 0</p>

<p>to check what the result of your binding command
actually is. lstopo will graphically show where it is bound
to by hwloc-bind.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful execution, hwloc-bind execs
the command over itself. The return value is therefore
whatever the return value of the command is.</p>

<p>hwloc-bind will return nonzero if any kind of error
occurs, such as (but not limited to): failure to parse the
command line, failure to retrieve process bindings, or lack
of a command to execute.</p>
