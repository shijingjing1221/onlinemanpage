<p>NAME gjarsigner - Java ARchive (JAR) file signing and
verification tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jarsigner [OPTION]... FILE ALIAS</p>

<p>jarsigner -verify [OPTION]... FILE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When the first form is used, the tool signs
the designated JAR file. The second form, on the other hand,
is used to verify a previously signed JAR file.</p>

<p>FILE is the .JAR file to process; i.e., to sign if the
first syntax form is used, or to verify if the second syntax
form is used instead.</p>

<p>ALIAS must be a known Alias of a Key Entry in the
designated Key Store. The private key material associated
with this Alias is then used for signing the designated .JAR
file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Common options</p>

<p>The following options may be used when the tool is used
for either signing, or verifying, a .JAR file.</p>

<p>-verbose Use this option to force the tool to generate
more verbose messages, during its processing.</p>

<p>-internalsf When present, the tool will include --which
otherwise it does not-- the &quot;.SF&quot; file in the
&quot;.DSA&quot; generated file.</p>

<p>-sectionsonly When present, the tool will include in the
&quot;.SF&quot; generated file --which otherwise it does
not-- a header containing a hash of the whole manifest file.
When that header is included, the tool can quickly check,
during verification, if the hash (in the header) matches or
not the manifest file.</p>

<p>-provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME A fully qualified class
name of a Security Provider to add to the current list of
Security Providers already installed in the JVM in- use. If
a provider class is specified with this option, and was
successfully added to the runtime --i.e. it was not already
installed-- then the tool will attempt to remove this
Security Provider before exiting.</p>

<p>-help Prints a help text similar to this one.</p>

<p>Signing options</p>

<p>The following options may be specified when using the
tool for signing purposes.</p>

<p>-keystore URL Use this option to specify the location of
the key store to use. The default value is a file URL
referencing the file named .keystore located in the path
returned by the call to
&quot;java.lang.System#getProperty(String)&quot; using
&quot;user.home&quot; as argument.</p>

<p>If a URL was specified, but was found to be malformed
--e.g. missing protocol element-- the tool will attempt to
use the URL value as a file-name (with absolute or relative
path-name) of a key store --as if the protocol was
&quot;file:&quot;.</p>

<p>-storetype STORE_TYPE Use this option to specify the
type of the key store to use. The default value, if this
option is omitted, is that of the property
&quot;keystore.type&quot; in the security properties file,
which is obtained by invoking the static method call
&quot;getDefaultType()&quot; in
&quot;java.security.KeyStore&quot;.</p>

<p>-storepass PASSWORD Use this option to specify the
password which will be used to unlock the key store. If this
option is missing, the User will be prompted to provide a
password.</p>

<p>-keypass PASSWORD Use this option to specify the
password which the tool will use to unlock the Key Entry
associated with the designated Alias.</p>

<p>If this option is omitted, the tool will first attempt
to unlock the Key Entry using the same password protecting
the key store. If this fails, you will then be prompted to
provide a password.</p>

<p>-sigfile NAME Use this option to designate a literal
that will be used to construct file names for both the
&quot;.SF&quot; and &quot;.DSA&quot; signature files. These
files will be generated, by the tool, and placed in the
META-INF directory of the signed JAR. Permissible characters
for NAME must be in the range &quot;a-zA-Z0-9_-&quot;. All
characters will be converted to upper-case ones.</p>

<p>If this option is missing, the first eight characters of
the ALIAS argument will be used. When this is the case, any
character in ALIAS that is outside the permissible range of
characters will be replaced by an underscore.</p>

<p>-signedjar FILE Use this option to specify the file name
of the signed JAR. If this option is omitted, then the
signed JAR will be named the same as FILE; i.e., the input
JAR file will be replaced with the signed copy.</p>

<p>Verification options</p>

<p>The following options may be specified when using the
tool for verification purposes.</p>

<p>-verify Use this option to indicate that the tool is to
be used for verification purposes.</p>

<p>-certs This option is used in conjunction with the
-verbose option. When present, along with the -verbose
option, the tool will print more detailed information about
the certificates of the signer(s) being processed.</p>
