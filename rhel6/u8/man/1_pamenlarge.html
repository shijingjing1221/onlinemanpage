<p>NAME pamenlarge - Enlarge a Netpbm image N times</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamenlarge N [pnmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamenlarge reads a Netpbm image as input, replicates its
pixels N times, and produces a Netpbm image as output. The
output is the same type of image as the input.</p>

<p>If you enlarge by a factor of 3 or more, you should
probably add a pnmsmooth step; otherwise, you can see the
original pixels in the resulting image.</p>

<p>pamenlarge can enlarge only by integer factors. The
slower but more general pamscale can enlarge or reduce by
arbitrary factors. pamscale allows you to enlarge by
resampling, which gives you smoother enlarge- ments. But it
is much slower.</p>

<p>pamstretch is another enlarging program that enlarges by
integer fac- tors. It does a simple kind of resampling that
gives you a smoothed enlargement with less computational
cost.</p>

<p>pbmreduce can reduce by integer factors, but only for
PBM images.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamenlarge was new in Netpbm 10.25 (October
2004). It is designed as a replacement for pnmenlarge by Jef
Poskanzer, which was in Pbmplus as far back as 1989. The
major difference is that pamenlarge can enlarge PAM format
images in addition to PNM.</p>
