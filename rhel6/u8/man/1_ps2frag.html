<p>NAME ps2frag - obsolete shell script for the PSfrag
system.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE The new PSfrag system no longer
requires the ps2frag script; instead, it handles the
processing entirely within TeX/LaTeX and DVIPS. Im sure you
will agree that never needing to run ps2frag again is a nice
conve- nience!</p>

<p>However, there are two significant differences in the
way this new ver- sion of PSfrag works. Please make yourself
aware of them:</p>

<p>1) XDvi is no longer able to determine where your PSfrag
replacements should go, so instead it lines them up in a
vertical list to the left of the figure. This allows you to
confirm that they have been typeset properly, at least.
However, to confirm that PSfrag positions your replacements
properly, you will have to view the PostScript version of
your file with a viewer like GhostView, or print it out.
This seems to be the only disadvantage to the elimination of
the pre-processing step.</p>

<p>2) If you embed ex commands inside your figures, you now
need to explicitly _tell_ PSfrag to process these commands.
To do so, use sepackage[scanall]{psfrag} instead of
sepackage{psfrag} at the beginning of your LaTeX file.</p>

<p>If you only use ex commands in a small number of
figures, then a more efficient might be to turn on
ex-scanning only for those fig- ures. To do that, add the
command sfragscanon immediately before each relevant
includegraphics or \psfbox command.</p>

information.</p>
