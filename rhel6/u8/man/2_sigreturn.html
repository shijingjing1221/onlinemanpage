<p>SIGRETURN(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SIGRETURN(2)</p>

<p>NAME sigreturn - return from signal handler and cleanup
stack frame</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int sigreturn(unsigned long __unused);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When the Linux kernel creates the stack
frame for a signal handler, a call to sigreturn() is
inserted into the stack frame so that upon return from the
signal handler, sigreturn() will be called.</p>

<p>This sigreturn() call undoes everything that was done
changing the pro- cesss signal mask, switching stacks (see
sigaltstack(2))in order to invoke the signal handler: it
restores the process s signal mask, switches stacks, and
restores the process s context (registers, proces- sor
flags), so that the process directly resumes execution at
the point where it was interrupted by the signal.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE sigreturn() never returns.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/signal.c
/usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/kernel/entry.S</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO sigreturn() is specific to Linux and
should not be used in programs intended to be portable.</p>

<p>NOTES The sigreturn() call is used by the kernel to
implement signal han- dlers. It should never be called
directly. Better yet, the specific use of the __unused
argument varies depending on the architecture.</p>
