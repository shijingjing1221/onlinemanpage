<p>AMADMIN(8) System Administration Commands AMADMIN(8)</p>

<p>NAME amadmin - administrative interface to control
Amanda backups</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amadmin config command [command_options...] [-o
configoption]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Amadmin performs various administrative
tasks on the config Amanda configuration.</p>

<p>See the amanda(8) man page for more details about
Amanda.</p>

<p>COMMANDS Commands that take a hostname [ disks ]
parameter pair operate on all disks in the disklist(5) for
that hostname if no disks are specified. Where hostname is
also marked as being optional, the command operates on all
hosts and disks in the disklist(5). Both hostname and disks
are special expressions; see the &quot;HOST &amp; DISK
EXPRESSION&quot; section of amanda(8) for a description.</p>

<p>Commands that take one or more dumpspec parameters
operate on the set of dumps specified by all of the
expressions. See the &quot;DUMP SPECIFICATIONS&quot; section
of amanda(8) for a description.</p>

<p>version Show the current version and some compile time
and runtime parameters. The config parameter must be present
but is ignored.</p>

<p>force-bump [ hostname [ disks ]* ]+ Force the disks on
hostname to bump to a new incremental level during the next
Amanda run.</p>

<p>force-no-bump [ hostname [ disks ]* ]+ Force the disks
on hostname to not bump to a new incremental level during
the next Amanda run.</p>

<p>unforce-bump [ hostname [ disks ]* ]+ Undo a previous
force-bump or force-no-bump command.</p>

<p>force [ hostname [ disks ]* ]+ Force the disks on
hostname to do a full (level 0) backup during the next
Amanda run.</p>

<p>unforce [ hostname [ disks ]* ]+ Undo a previous force
command.</p>

<p>reuse tapelabel [ ... ] The tapes listed will be
available for reuse at their point in the tape cycle.</p>

<p>no-reuse tapelabel [ ... ] The tapes listed will not be
reused when their turn comes up again in the tape cycle.
Note that if this causes the number of reusable tapes to
drop below the amanda.conf tapecycle value, Amanda will
request new tapes until the count is satisfied again.</p>

<p>Tape marked no-reuse are available for recovery, marking
them no-reuse is a security to be sure amanda will not
overwrite them.</p>

<p>due [ hostname [ disks ]* ]* Show when the next full
dump is due.</p>

<p>find [ --sort hkdlpbfw ] [ hostname [ disks ]* ]*
Display all backups currently on tape or in the holding
disk. The tape label or holding disk filename, file number,
and status are displayed.</p>

<p>The --sort option changes the sort order using the
following flags:</p>

<p>h: host name k: disk name d: dump timestamp l: backup
level p: dump part b: tape label f: filenum on tape w: write
timestamp</p>

<p>An uppercase letter reverses the sort order for that
key. The default sort order is hkdlpbfw.</p>

<p>holding delete hostname [ disk [ datestamp [ .. ] ] ]
Delete holding files matching the given specification. At
least a hostname must be provided.</p>

<p>holding list [-l] [-d] [ hostname [ disk [ datestamp [
.. ] ] ] ] List holding files matching the given
specification, or all holding files if no specification is
provided. With &acute;-l&acute;, additional information
(size, level, and whether the dump is outdated) is provided.
With &acute;-d&acute;, only outdated dumps are shown.</p>

<p>An outdated holding file is one which is not required
for a restore of the most recent dump. Note that outdated
dumps may still be required for restores at earlier dates.
For example, assume that a DLE had a level 0 on Monday,
level 1&acute;s Tuesday through Thursday, and a level 2 on
Friday. Then the files required for a restore of Fridays
(the most recent) dump are those from Monday (level 0),
Thursday (level 1), and Friday (level 2). Tuesday and
Wednesday&acute;s files are outdated.</p>

<p>delete [ hostname [ disks ]* ]+ Delete the specified
disks on hostname from the Amanda database.</p>

<p>Note If you do not also remove the disk from the
disklist(5) file, Amanda will treat it as a new disk during
the next run.</p>

<p>tape Display the tape(s) Amanda expects to write to
during the next run. See also amcheck(8).</p>

<p>bumpsize Display the current bump threshold parameters,
calculated for all backup levels.</p>

<p>balance [ --days &lt;num&gt; ] Display the distribution
of full backups throughout the dump schedule.</p>

<p>export [ hostname [ disks ]* ]* Convert records from the
Amanda database to a text format that may be transmitted to
another Amanda machine and imported.</p>

<p>import Convert exported records read from standard input
to a form Amanda uses and insert them into the database on
this machine.</p>

<p>disklist [ hostname [ disks ]* ]* Display the
disklist(5) information for each of the disks on hostname
(or all hosts). Mostly used for debugging.</p>

<p>info [ hostname [ disks ]* ]* Display the database
record for each of the disks on hostname (or all hosts).
Mostly used for debugging.</p>

<p>-o configoption See the &quot;CONFIGURATION
OVERRIDE&quot; section in amanda(8).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Request three specific file systems on
machine-a get a full level 0 backup during the next Amanda
run. $ amadmin daily force machine-a / /var /usr amadmin:
machine-a:/ is set to a forced level 0 tonight. amadmin:
machine-a:/var is set to a forced level 0 tonight. amadmin:
machine-a:/usr is set to a forced level 0 tonight.</p>

<p>Request all file systems on machine-b get a full level 0
backup during the next Amanda run. $ amadmin daily force
machine-b amadmin: machine-b:/ is set to a forced level 0
tonight. amadmin: machine-b:/var is set to a forced level 0
tonight. amadmin: machine-b:/usr is set to a forced level 0
tonight. amadmin: machine-b:/home is set to a forced level 0
tonight.</p>

<p>Undo the previous force request for /home on machine-b.
The other file systems will still get a full level 0 backup.
$ amadmin daily unforce machine-b /home amadmin: force
command for machine-b:/home cleared.</p>

<p>Locate backup images of /var from machine-c. The tape or
file column displays either a tape label or a filename
depending on whether the image is on tape or is still in the
holding disk. If the image is on tape, the file column tells
you which file on the tape has the image (file number zero
is a tape label). This column shows zero and is not
meaningful if the image is still in the holding disk. The
status column tells you whether the backup was successful or
had some type of error. $ amadmin daily find machine-c /var
date host disk lv tape or file file part status 2000-11-09
machine-c /var 0 000110 9 -- OK 2000-11-08 machine-c /var 2
000109 2 -- OK 2000-11-07 machine-c /var 2
/amanda/20001107/machine-c._var.2 0 OK 2000-11-06 machine-c
/var 2 000107 2 -- OK 2000-11-05 machine-c /var 2 000106 3
-- OK 2000-11-04 machine-c /var 2 000105 2 -- OK 2000-11-03
machine-c /var 2 000104 2 -- OK 2000-11-02 machine-c /var 2
000103 2 -- OK 2000-11-01 machine-c /var 1 000102 5 -- OK
2000-10-31 machine-c /var 1 000101 3 -- OK</p>

<p>Forget about the /workspace disk on machine-d. If you do
not also remove the disk from the disklist(5) file, Amanda
will treat it as a new disk during the next run. $ amadmin
daily delete machine-d /workspace amadmin:
machine-d:/workspace deleted from database. amadmin: NOTE:
you&acute;ll have to remove these from the disklist(5)
yourself.</p>

<p>Find the next tape Amanda will use (in this case,
123456). $ amadmin daily tape The next Amanda run should go
onto tape 123456 or a new tape.</p>

<p>Show how well full backups are balanced across the dump
cycle. The due-date column is the day the backups are due
for a full backup. #fs shows the number of filesystems doing
full backups that night, and orig KB and out KB show the
estimated total size of the backups before and after any
compression, respectively.</p>

<p>The balance column shows how far off that night&acute;s
backups are from the average size (shown at the bottom of
the balance column). Amanda tries to keep the backups within
+/- 5%, but since the amount of data on each filesystem is
always changing, and Amanda will never delay backups just to
rebalance the schedule, it is common for the schedule to
fluctuate by larger percentages. In particular, in the case
of a tape or backup failure, a bump will occur the following
night, which will not be smoothed out until the next pass
through the schedule.</p>

<p>The last line also shows an estimate of how many Amanda
runs will be made between full backups for a file system. In
the example, a file system will probably have a full backup
done every eight times Amanda is run (e.g. every eight
days). $ amadmin daily balance due-date #fs orig KB out KB
