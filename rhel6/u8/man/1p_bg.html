<p>BG(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual BG(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME bg - run jobs in the background</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS bg [job_id ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If job control is enabled (see the
description of set -m), the bg util- ity shall resume
suspended jobs from the current environment (see Shell
Execution Environment ) by running them as background jobs.
If the job specified by job_id is already a running
background job, the bg utility shall have no effect and
shall exit successfully.</p>

<p>Using bg to place a job into the background shall cause
its process ID to become &quot;known in the current shell
execution environment&quot;, as if it had been started as an
asynchronous list; see Asynchronous Lists .</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>job_id Specify the job to be resumed as a background
job. If no job_id operand is given, the most recently
suspended job shall be used. The format of job_id is
described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 3.203, Job Control Job ID.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of bg:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The output of bg shall consist of a line in the
format:</p>

<p>&quot;[%d] %n&quot;, &lt;job-number&gt;,
&lt;command&gt;</p>

<p>where the fields are as follows:</p>

<p>&lt;job-number&gt; A number that can be used to identify
the job to the wait, fg, and kill utilities. Using these
utilities, the job can be iden- tified by prefixing the job
number with%.</p>

<p>&lt;command&gt; The associated command that was given to
the shell.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS If job control is disabled, the
bg utility shall exit with an error and no job shall be
placed in the background.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE A job is generally suspended by typing
the SUSP character (&lt;control&gt;-Z on most systems); see
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter
11, General Terminal Interface. At that point, bg can put
the job into the background. This is most effective when the
job is expecting no terminal input and its output has been
redirected to non-terminal files. A background job can be
forced to stop when it has terminal output by issuing the
command:</p>

<p>stty tostop</p>

<p>A background job can be stopped with the command:</p>

<p>kill -s stop job ID</p>

<p>The bg utility does not work as expected when it is
operating in its own utility execution environment because
that environment has no sus- pended jobs. In the following
examples:</p>

<p>... | xargs bg (bg)</p>

<p>each bg operates in a different environment and does not
share its par- ent shell s understanding of jobs. For this
reason, bg is generally implemented as a shell regular
built-in.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The extensions to the shell specified in this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 have mostly been based on
features provided by the KornShell. The job control features
provided by bg, fg, and jobs are also based on the
KornShell. The standard developers examined the char-
acteristics of the C shell versions of these utilities and
found that differences exist. Despite widespread use of the
C shell, the KornShell versions were selected for this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 to main- tain a degree of
uniformity with the rest of the KornShell features selected
(such as the very popular command line editing
features).</p>

<p>The bg utility is expected to wrap its output if the
output exceeds the number of display columns.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
