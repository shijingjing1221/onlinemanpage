<p>NAME pulse-daemon.conf - PulseAudio daemon configuration
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ~/.pulse/daemon.conf</p>

<p>/etc/pulse/daemon.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The PulseAudio sound server reads
configuration directives from a file ~/.pulse/daemon.conf on
startup and when that file doesnt exist from
/etc/pulse/daemon.conf. Please note that the server also
reads a con- figuration script on startup default.pa which
also contains runtime configuration directives.</p>

<p>The configuration file is a simple collection of
variable declarations. If the configuration file parser
encounters either ; or # it ignores the rest of the line
until its end.</p>

<p>For the settings that take a boolean argument the values
true, yes, on and 1 are equivalent, resp. false, no, off,
0.</p>

<p>GENERAL DIRECTIVES daemonize= Daemonize after startup.
Takes a boolean value, defaults to &quot;no&quot;. The
--daemonize command line option takes precedence.</p>

<p>fail= Fail to start up if any of the directives in the
configuration script default.pa fail. Takes a boolean
argument, defaults to &quot;yes&quot;. The --fail command
line option takes precedence.</p>

<p>allow-module-loading= Allow/disallow module loading
after startup. This is a security feature that if dsabled
makes sure that no further mod- ules may be loaded into the
PulseAudio server after startup completed. It is recommended
to disable this when system-instance is enabled. Please note
that certain features like automatic hot-plug support will
not work if this option is enabled. Takes a boolean
argument, defaults to yes. The --disallow-module-loading
command line option takes prece- dence.</p>

<p>allow-exit= Allow/disallow exit on user request.
Defaults to yes.</p>

<p>resample-method= The resampling algorithm to use. Use
one of src-sinc- best-quality, src-sinc-medium-quality,
src-sinc-fastest, src-zero- order-hold, src-linear, trivial,
speex-float-N, speex-fixed-N, ffmpeg. See the documentation
of libsamplerate for an explanation for the dif- ferent src-
methods. The method trivial is the most basic algorithm
implemented. If youre tight on CPU consider using this. On
the other hand it has the worst quality of them all. The
Speex resamplers take an integer quality setting in the
range 0..9 (bad...good). They exist in two flavours: fixed
and float. The former uses fixed point numbers, the latter
relies on floating point numbers. On most desktop CPUs the
float point resmampler is a lot faster, and it also offers
slightly better quality. See the output of
dump-resample-methods for a complete list of all available
resamplers. Defaults to speex-float-3. The --resample-
method command line option takes precedence. Note that some
modules overwrite or allow overwriting of the resampler to
use.</p>

<p>enable-remixing= If disabled never upmix or downmix
channels to differ- ent channel maps. Instead, do a simple
name-based matching only. Defaults to yes.</p>

<p>enable-lfe-remixing= if disabeld when upmixing or
downmixing ignore LFE channels. When this option is dsabled
the output LFE channel will only get a signal when an input
LFE channel is available as well. If no input LFE channel is
available the output LFE channel will always be 0. If no
output LFE channel is available the signal on the input LFE
chan- nel will be ignored. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>use-pid-file= Create a PID file in /tmp/pulse-$USER/pid.
Of this is enabled you may use commands like --kill or
--check. If you are plan- ning to start more than one
PulseAudio process per user, you better disable this option
since it effectively disables multiple instances. Takes a
boolean argument, defaults to yes. The --no-cpu-limit
command line option takes precedence.</p>

<p>cpu-limit= If disabled do not install the CPU load
limiter, even on platforms where it is supported. This
option is useful when debug- ging/profiling PulseAudio to
disable disturbing SIGXCPU signals. Takes a boolean
argument, defaults to no. The --no-cpu-limit command line
argument takes precedence.</p>

<p>system-instance= Run the daemon as system-wide instance,
requires root priviliges. Takes a boolean argument, defaults
to no. The --system com- mand line argument takes
precedence.</p>

<p>enable-shm= Enable data transfer via POSIX shared
memory. Takes a boolean argument, defaults to yes. The
--disable-shm command line argu- ment takes precedence.</p>

<p>shm-size-bytes= Sets the shared memory segment size for
the daemon, in bytes. If left unspecified or is set to 0 it
will default to some sys- tem-specific default, usually 64
MiB. Please note that usually there is no need to change
this value, unless you are running an OS kernel that does
not do memory overcommit.</p>

<p>lock-memory= Locks the entire PulseAudio process into
memory. While this might increase drop-out safety when used
in conjunction with real- time scheduling this takes away a
lot of memory from other processes and might hence
considerably slow down your system. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>flat-volumes= Enable flat volumes, i.e. where possible
let the sink volume equal the maximum of the volumes of the
inputs connected to it. Takes a boolean argument, defaults
to yes.</p>

<p>SCHEDULING high-priority= Renice the daemon after
startup to become a high-prior- ity process. This a good
idea if you experience drop-outs during play- back. However,
this is a certain security issue, since it works when called
SUID root only, or RLIMIT_NICE is used. root is dropped
immedi- ately after gaining the nice level on startup, thus
it is presumably safe. See pulseaudio(1) for more
information. Takes a boolean argument, defaults to
&quot;yes&quot;. The --high-priority command line option
takes prece- dence.</p>

<p>realtime-scheduling= Try to acquire SCHED_FIFO
scheduling for the IO threads. The same security concerns as
mentioned above apply. However, if PA enters an endless
loop, realtime scheduling causes a system lockup. Thus,
realtime scheduling should only be enabled on trusted
machines for now. Please not that only the IO threads of
PulseAudio are made real-time. The controlling thread is
left a normally scheduled thread. Thus enabling the
high-priority option is orthogonal. See pulseaudio(1) for
more information. Takes a boolean argument, defaults to
&quot;yes&quot;. The --realtime command line option takes
precedence.</p>

<p>realtime-priority= The realtime priority to acquire, if
realtime- scheduling is enabled. Note: JACK uses 10 by
default, 9 for clients. Thus it is recommended to choose the
PulseAudio real-time priorities lower. Some PulseAudio
threads might choose a priority a little lower or higher
than the specified value. Defaults to &quot;5&quot;.</p>

<p>nice-level= The nice level to acquire for the daemon, if
high-priority is enabled. Note: on some distributions X11
uses -10 by default. Defaults to -11.</p>

<p>IDLE TIMES exit-idle-time= Terminate the daemon after
the last client quit and this time in seconds passed. Use a
negative value to disable this fea- ture. Defaults to 20.
The --exit-idle-time command line option takes
precedence.</p>

<p>scache-idle-time= Unload autoloaded sample cache entries
after being idle for this time in seconds. Defaults to 20.
The --scache-idle-time command line option takes
precedence.</p>

<p>PATHS dl-search-path= The path were to look for dynamic
shared objects (DSOs/plugins). You may specify more than one
path seperated by colons. The default path depends on
compile time settings. The --dl-search-path command line
option takes precedence.</p>

<p>default-script-file= The default configuration script
file to load. Specify an empty string for not loading a
default script file. The default behaviour is to load
~/.pulse/default.pa, and if that file does not exist fall
back to the system wide installed version
/etc/pulse/default.pa. If run in system-wide mode the file
/etc/pulse/system.pa is used instead. If -n is passed on the
command line or default-script-file= is disabled the default
configuration script is ignored.</p>

<p>load-default-script-file= Load the default configuration
script file as specified in default-script-file=. Defaults
to yes.</p>

<p>LOGGING log-target= The default log target. Use either
stderr, syslog or auto. The latter is equivalent to sylog in
case daemonize is enabled, other- wise to stderr. Defaults
to auto. The --log-target command line option takes
precedence.</p>

<p>log-level= Log level, one of debug, info, notice,
warning, error. Log messages with a lower log level than
specified here are not logged. Defaults to notice. The
--log-level command line option takes prece- dence. The -v
command line option might alter this setting.</p>

<p>log-meta= With each logged message log the code location
the message was generated from. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>log-time= With each logged messages log the relative
time since startup. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>log-backtrace= When greater than 0, with each logged
message log a code stack trace up the the specified number
of stack frames. Defaults to 0.</p>

<p>RESOURCE LIMITS See getrlimit(2) for more information.
Set to -1 if PulseAudio shall not touch the resource limit.
Not all resource limits are available on all operating
systems.</p>

<p>rlimit-as Defaults to -1.</p>

<p>rlimit-rss Defaults to -1.</p>

<p>rlimit-core Defaults to -1.</p>

<p>rlimit-data Defaults to -1.</p>

<p>rlimit-fsize Defaults to -1.</p>

<p>rlimit-nofile Defaults to 256.</p>

<p>rlimit-stack Defaults to -1.</p>

<p>rlimit-nproc Defaults to -1.</p>

<p>rlimit-locks Defaults to -1.</p>

<p>rlimit-sigpending Defaults to -1.</p>

<p>rlimit-msgqueue Defaults to -1.</p>

<p>rlimit-memlock Defaults to 16 KiB. Please note that the
JACK client libraries may require more locked memory.</p>

<p>rlimit-nice Defaults to 31. Please make sure that the
default nice level as configured with nice-level fits in
this resource limit, if high-priority is enabled.</p>

<p>rlimit-rtprio Defaults to 9. Please make sure that the
default real- time priority level as configured with
realtime-priority= fits in this resource limit, if
realtime-scheduling is enabled. The JACK client libraries
require a real-time prority of 9 by default.</p>

<p>rlimit-rttime Defaults to 1000000.</p>

<p>DEFAULT DEVICE SETTINGS Most drivers try to open the
audio device with these settings and then fall back to lower
settings. The default settings are CD quality: 16bit native
endian, 2 channels, 44100 Hz sampling.</p>

<p>default-sample-format= The default sampling format.
Specify one of u8, s16le, s16be, s24le, s24be, s24-32le,
s24-32be, s32le, s32be float32le, float32be, ulaw, alaw.
Depending on the endianess of the CPU the for- mats s16ne,
s16re, s24ne, s24re, s24-32ne, s24-32re, s32ne, s32re,
float32ne, float32re (for native, resp. reverse endian) are
available as aliases.</p>

<p>default-sample-rate= The default sample frequency.</p>

<p>default-sample-channels The default number of
channels.</p>

<p>default-channel-map The default channel map.</p>

<p>DEFAULT FRAGMENT SETTINGS Some hardware drivers require
the hardware playback buffer to be subdi- vided into several
fragments. It is possible to change these buffer metrics for
machines with high scheduling latencies. Not all possible
values that may be configured here are available in all
hardware. The driver will to find the nearest setting
supported. Modern drivers that support timer-based
scheduling ignore these options.</p>

<p>default-fragments= The default number of fragments.
Defaults to 4.</p>

<p>default-fragment-size-msec=The duration of a single
fragment. Defaults to 25ms (i.e. the total buffer is thus
100ms long).</p>
