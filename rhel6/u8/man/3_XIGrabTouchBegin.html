<p>XIGRABBUTTON(3) XIGRABBUTTON(3)</p>

<p>NAME XIGrabButton, XIUngrabButton, XIGrabKeycode,
XIUngrabKeycode, XIGrabTouchBegin, XIUngrabTouchBegin -
grab/ungrab buttons or keys</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput2.h&gt;</p>

<p>int XIGrabButton( Display *display, int deviceid, int
button, Window grab_window, Cursor cursor, int grab_mode,
int paired_device_mode, Bool owner_events, XIEventMask
*mask, int num_modifiers, XIGrabModifiers
*modifiers_inout);</p>

<p>int XIUngrabButton( Display *display, int deviceid, int
button, Window grab_window, int num_modifiers,
XIGrabModifiers *modifiers);</p>

<p>int XIGrabKeycode( Display *display, int deviceid, int
keycode, Window grab_window, int grab_mode, int
paired_device_mode, Bool owner_events, XIEventMask *mask,
int num_modifiers, XIGrabModifiers *modifiers_inout);</p>

<p>int XIUngrabKeycode( Display *display, int deviceid, int
keycode, Window grab_window, int num_modifiers,
XIGrabModifiers *modifiers);</p>

<p>int XIGrabTouchBegin( Display *display, int deviceid,
Window grab_window, Bool owner_events, XIEventMask *mask,
int num_modifiers, XIGrabModifiers *modifiers_inout);</p>

<p>int XIUngrabTouchBegin( Display *display, int deviceid,
Window grab_window, int num_modifiers, XIGrabModifiers
*modifiers);</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>device Specifies the device that is to be grabbed or
released</p>

<p>button Specifies the device button that is to be grabbed
or released or XIAnyButton.</p>

<p>keycode Specifies the keycode that is to be grabbed or
released or XIAnyKeycode.</p>

<p>num_modifiers Number of elements in modifiers or
modifiers_inout.</p>

<p>modifiers Specifies the set of latched and base
modifiers or XIAnyModifier to ungrab. The data type is for
consistency with the respective grab request and the status
code of the XIGrabModifiers struct is ignored.</p>

<p>modifiers_inout Specifies the set of latched and base
modifiers or XIAnyModifier to grab. Returns the modifiers
that could not be grabbed and their error code.</p>

<p>grab_window Specifies the grab window.</p>

<p>owner_events Specifies a Boolean value that indicates
whether the are to be reported as usual or reported with
respect to the grab window.</p>

<p>mask Specifies the event mask.</p>

<p>grab_mode Specifies further processing of events from
this device. You can pass XIGrabModeSync or
XIGrabModeAsync.</p>

<p>paired_device_mode Specifies further processing of
events from the paired master device. You can pass
XIGrabModeSync or XIGrabModeAsync. If deviceid specifies a
floating slave device, this parameter is ignored.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XIGrabButton, XIGrabKeycode and
XIGrabTouchBegin establish a passive grab. The modifier
device for a button grab is the paired master device if
deviceid specifies a master pointer. Otherwise, the modifier
device is the device specified with deviceid. In the future,
the device is actively grabbed (as for XIGrabDevice, the
last-grab time is set to the time at which the button or
keycode was pressed and the XI_ButtonPress or XI_KeyPress
event is reported if all of the following conditions are
true: * The device is not grabbed, and the specified button
or keycode is logically pressed or a touch event occurs when
the specified modifier keys are logically down on the
modifier device and no other buttons or modifier keys are
logically down. * Either the grab window is an ancestor of
(or is) the focus window, OR the grab window is a descendent
of the focus window and contains the device. * A passive
grab on the same button/modifier combination does not exist
on any ancestor of grab_window.</p>

<p>The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for
XIGrabDevice. The active grab is terminated automatically
when the logical state of the device has all buttons or keys
released (independent of the logical state of the modifier
keys).</p>

<p>If the device is an attached slave device, the device is
automatically detached from the master device when the grab
activates and reattached to the same master device when the
grab deactivates. If the master device is removed while the
device is floating as a result of a grab, the device remains
floating once the grab deactivates.</p>

<p>Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by
client applications) may lag the physical state if device
event processing is frozen.</p>

<p>This request overrides all previous grabs by the same
client on the same button/modifier or keycode/modifier
combinations on the same window. A modifiers of
XIAnyModifier is equivalent to issuing the grab request for
all possible modifier combinations (including the
combination of no modifiers). It is not required that all
modifiers specified have currently assigned KeyCodes. A
button of XIAnyButton is equivalent to issuing the request
for all possible buttons. Otherwise, it is not required that
the specified button currently be assigned to a physical
button.</p>

<p>If some other client has already issued a XIGrabButton
or XIGrabKeycode with the same button/modifier or
keycode/modifier combination on the same window, a BadAccess
error results. When using XIAnyModifier or XIAnyButton , the
request fails completely, and a XIBadAccess error results
(no grabs are established) if there is a conflicting grab
for any combination. XIGrabButton and XIGrabKeycode have no
effect on an active grab.</p>

<p>On success, XIGrabButton, XIGrabKeycode and
XIGrabTouchBegin return 0; If one or more modifier
combinations could not be grabbed, XIGrabButton,
XIGrabKeycode and XIGrabTouchBegin return the number of
failed combinations and modifiers_inout contains the failed
combinations and their respective error codes.</p>

<p>XIGrabButton, XIGrabKeycode and XIGrabTouchBegin can
generate BadClass, BadDevice, BadMatch, BadValue, and
BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>XIUngrabButton, XIUngrabKeycode and XIUngrabTouchBegin
release the passive grab for a button/modifier,
keycode/modifier or touch/modifier combination on the
specified window if it was grabbed by this client. A
modifier of XIAnyModifier is equivalent to issuing the
ungrab request for all possible modifier combinations,
including the combination of no modifiers. A button of
XIAnyButton is equivalent to issuing the request for all
possible buttons. XIUngrabButton and XIUngrabKeycode have no
effect on an active grab.</p>

<p>XIUngrabButton, XIUngrabKeycode and XIUngrabTouchBegin
can generate BadDevice, BadMatch, BadValue and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE XIGrabButton, XIGrabKeycode and
XIGrabTouchBegin return the number of modifier combination
that could not establish a passive grab. The modifiers are
returned in modifiers_inout, along with the respective error
for this modifier combination. If XIGrabButton,
XIGrabKeycode or XIGrabTouchBegin return zero, passive grabs
with all requested modifier combinations were established
successfully.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid deviceid was
specified.</p>

<p>BadMatch This error may occur if XIGrabButton specified
a device that has no buttons, or XIGrabKeycode specified a
device that has no keys, or XIGrabTouchBegin specified a
device that is not touch-capable.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument&rsquo;s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
set of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>

<p>BUGS The protocol headers for XI 2.0 did not provide
XIGrabModeAsync or XIGrabModeSync. Use GrabModeSync and
GrabModeAsync instead, respectively.</p>
