<p>NAME ibacm - address and route resolution services for
InfiniBand.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ibacm [-D] [-P] [-A addr_file] [-O
option_file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The IB ACM implements and provides a
framework for name, address, and route (path) resolution
services over InfiniBand. It is intended to address
connection setup scalability issues running MPI applications
on large clusters. The IB ACM provides information needed to
establish a connection, but does not implement the CM
protocol.</p>

<p>A primary user of the ibacm service is the librdmacm
library. This enables applications to make use of the ibacm
service without code changes or needing to be aware that the
service is in use. librdmacm versions 1.0.12 - 1.0.15 can
invoke IB ACM services when built using the --with-ib_acm
option. Version 1.0.16 and newer of librdmacm will
automatically use the IB ACM if it is installed. The IB ACM
services tie in under the rdma_resolve_addr,
rdma_resolve_route, and rdma_getad- drinfo routines. For
maximum benefit, the rdma_getaddrinfo routine should be
used, however existing applications should still see
signifi- cant connection scaling benefits using the calls
available in librdmacm 1.0.11 and previous releases.</p>

<p>The IB ACM is focused on being scalable and efficient.
The current implementation limits network traffic, SA
interactions, and centralized services. ACM supports
multiple resolution protocols in order to han- dle different
fabric topologies.</p>

<p>The IB ACM package is comprised of two components: the
ibacm service and a test/configuration utility - ib_acme.
Both are userspace compo- nents and are available for Linux
and Windows. Additional details are given below.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -D run in daemon mode (default)</p>

<p>-P run as standard process</p>

<p>-A addr_file address configuration file</p>

<p>-O option_file option configuration file</p>

<p>QUICK START GUIDE 1. Prerequisites: libibverbs and
libibumad must be installed. The IB stack should be running
with IPoIB configured. These steps assume that the user has
administrative privileges.</p>

<p>2. Install the IB ACM package. This installs ibacm,
ib_acme, and init.d scripts.</p>

<p>3. Run ibacm as administrator to start the ibacm
daemon.</p>

<p>4. Optionally, run ib_acme -d &lt;dest_ip&gt; -v to
verify that the ibacm service is running.</p>

<p>5. Install librdmacm, using the build option
--with-ib_acm if needed. This build option is not needed
with librdmacm 1.0.17 or newer. The librdmacm will
automatically use the ibacm service. On failures, the
librdmacm will fall back to normal resolution.</p>

<p>6. You can use ib_acme -P to gather performance
statistics from the local ibacm daemon to see if the service
is working correctly.</p>

<p>NOTES ib_acme:</p>

<p>The ib_acme program serves a dual role. It acts as a
utility to test ibacm operation and help verify if the ibacm
service and selected pro- tocol is usable for a given
cluster configuration. Additionally, it automatically
generates ibacm configuration files to assist with or
eliminate manual setup.</p>

<p>ibacm configuration files:</p>

<p>The ibacm service relies on two configuration files.</p>

<p>The ibacm_addr.cfg file contains name and address
mappings for each IB &lt;device, port, pkey&gt; endpoint.
Although the names in the ibacm_addr.cfg file can be
anything, ib_acme maps the host name and IP addresses to the
IB endpoints. If the address file cannot be found, the ibacm
service will attempt to create one using default values.</p>

<p>The ibacm_opts.cfg file provides a set of configurable
options for the ibacm service, such as timeout, number of
retries, logging level, etc. ib_acme generates the
ibacm_opts.cfg file using static information. If an option
file cannot be found, ibacm will use default values.</p>

<p>ibacm:</p>

<p>The ibacm service is responsible for resolving names and
addresses to InfiniBand path information and caching such
data. It should execute with administrative privileges.</p>

<p>The ibacm implements a client interface over TCP
sockets, which is abstracted by the librdmacm library. One
or more back-end protocols are used by the ibacm service to
satisfy user requests. Although the ibacm supports standard
SA path record queries on the back-end, it also supports a
resolution protocol based on multicast traffic. The latter
is not usable on all fabric topologies, specifically ones
that may not have reversible paths or fabrics using torus
routing. Users should use the ib_acme utility to verify that
multicast protocol is usable before running other
applications.</p>

<p>Conceptually, the ibacm service implements an ARP like
protocol and either uses IB multicast records to construct
path record data or queries the SA directly, depending on
the selected route protocol. By default, the ibacm services
uses and caches SA path record queries.</p>

<p>Specifically, all IB endpoints join a number of
multicast groups. Mul- ticast groups differ based on rates,
mtu, sl, etc., and are priori- tized. All participating
endpoints must be able to communicate on the lowest priority
multicast group. The ibacm assigns one or more
names/addresses to each IB endpoint using the ibacm_addr.cfg
file. Clients provide source and destination names or
addresses as input to the service, and receive as output
path record data.</p>

<p>The service maps a clients source name/address to a
local IB endpoint. If a client does not provide a source
address, then the ibacm service will select one based on the
destination and local routing tables. If the destination
name/address is not cached locally, it sends a multi- cast
request out on the lowest priority multicast group on the
local endpoint. The request carries a list of multicast
groups that the sender can use. The recipient of the request
selects the highest pri- ority multicast group that it can
use as well and returns that information directly to the
sender. The request data is cached by all endpoints that
receive the multicast request message. The source end- point
also caches the response and uses the multicast group that
was selected to construct or obtain path record data, which
is returned to the client.</p>

<p>The current implementation of the IB ACM has several
additional restrictions:</p>

<p>- The ibacm is limited in its handling of dynamic
changes. ibacm must be stopped and restarted if a cluster is
reconfigured.</p>

<p>- Cached data does not timed out and is only updated if
a new resolu- tion request is received from a different QPN
than a cached request.</p>

<p>- Support for IPv6 has not been verified.</p>

<p>- The number of addresses that can be assigned to a
single endpoint is limited to 4.</p>

<p>- The number of multicast groups that an endpoint can
support is lim- ited to 2.</p>

<p>The ibacm contains several internal caches. These
include caches for GID and LID destination addresses. These
caches can be optionally preloaded. ibacm supports the
OpenSM dump_pr plugin &quot;full&quot; PathRecord format
which is used to preload these caches. The file format is
spec- ified in the ibacm_opts.cfg file via the route_preload
setting which should be set to full_opensm_v1 for this file
format. Default format is none which does not preload these
caches. See dump_pr.notes.txt in dump_pr for more
information on the full_opensm_v1 file format and how to
configure OpenSM to generate this file.</p>

<p>Additionally, the name, IPv4, and IPv6 caches can be be
preloaded by using the addr_preload option. The default is
none which does not preload these caches. To preload these
caches, set this option to acm_hosts and configure the
addr_data_file appropriately.</p>
