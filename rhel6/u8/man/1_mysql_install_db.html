<p>MYSQL_INSTALL_DB() MYSQL_INSTALL_DB()</p>

<p>NAME mysql_install_db - initialize MySQL data
directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysql_install_db [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mysql_install_db initializes the MySQL data
directory and creates the system tables that it contains, if
they do not exist. mysql_install_db is a shell script and is
available only on Unix platforms.</p>

<p>To invoke mysql_install_db, use the following
syntax:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql_install_db [options]</p>

<p>Because the MySQL server, mysqld, needs to access the
data directory when it runs later, you should either run
mysql_install_db from the same system account that will be
used for running mysqld or run it as root and use the --user
option to indicate the user name that mysqld will run as. It
might be necessary to specify other options such as
--basedir or --datadir if mysql_install_db does not use the
correct locations for the installation directory or data
directory. For example:</p>

<p>shell&gt; bin/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
--basedir=/opt/mysql/mysql
--datadir=/opt/mysql/mysql/data</p>

<p>mysql_install_db needs to invoke mysqld with the
--bootstrap and --skip-grant-tables options. If MySQL was
configured with the --disable-grant-options option,
--bootstrap and --skip-grant-tables will be disabled (see
Section 2.11.4, MySQL Source-Configuration Options ). To
handle this, set the MYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP environment variable
to the full path name of a server that has all options
enabled. mysql_install_db will use that server.</p>

<p>Note If you have set a custom TMPDIR environment
variable when performing the installation, and the specified
directory is not accessible, mysql_install_db may fail. If
so, unset TMPDIR or set TMPDIR to point to the system
temporary directory (usually /tmp).</p>

<p>mysql_install_db supports the following options, which
can be specified on the command line or in the
[mysql_install_db] group of an option file. (Options that
are common to mysqld can also be specified in the [mysqld]
group.) Other options are passed to mysqld. For information
about option files, see Section 4.2.3.3, Using Option Files.
mysql_install_db also supports the options for processing
option files described at Section 4.2.3.4, Command-Line
Options that Affect Option- File Handling.</p>

<p>&middot; --basedir=path</p>

<p>The path to the MySQL installation directory.</p>

<p>&middot; --datadir=path, --ldata=path</p>

<p>The path to the MySQL data directory.</p>

<p>&middot; --force</p>

<p>Cause mysql_install_db to run even if DNS does not work.
Grant table entries that normally use host names will use IP
addresses.</p>

<p>&middot; --rpm</p>

<p>For internal use. This option is used during the MySQL
installation process for install operations performed using
RPM packages.</p>

<p>&middot; --skip-name-resolve</p>

<p>Use IP addresses rather than host names when creating
grant table entries. This option can be useful if your DNS
does not work.</p>

<p>&middot; --srcdir=path</p>

<p>For internal use. This option specifies the directory
under which mysql_install_db looks for support files such as
the error message file and the file for populating the help
tables. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.14.</p>

<p>&middot; --user=user_name</p>

<p>The system (login) user name to use for running mysqld.
Files and directories created by mysqld will be owned by
this user. You must be root to use this option. By default,
mysqld runs using your current login name and files and
directories that it creates will be owned by you.</p>

<p>&middot; --verbose</p>

<p>Verbose mode. Print more information about what the
program does.</p>

<p>&middot; --windows</p>

<p>For internal use. This option is used for creating
Windows distributions.</p>
