<p>The XRRScreenSize structure contains a possible root
size in pixels and in millimeters.</p>

<p>A XRRScreenChangeNotifyEvent is sent to a client that
has requested notification whenever the screen configuration
is changed. A client can perform this request by calling
XRRSelectInput, passing the display, the root window, and
the RRScreenChangeNotifyMask mask.</p>

<p>XRRScreenConfiguration is an opaque data type containing
the configura- tion information for a screen.</p>

<p>Timestamps</p>

<p>Time stamps are included and must be used to ensure the
client is play- ing with a full deck: the screen may change
properties on the fly and this ensures its knowledge of the
configuration is up to date. This is to help issues when
screens may become hot-pluggable in the future.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xrandr is a simple library designed to
interface the X Resize and Rotate Extension. This allows
clients to change the size and rotation of the root window
of a screen, along with the ability to reflect the screen
about either axis (if supported by the implementation).
Rota- tion and reflection may be implemented by software and
may result in slower performance if rotation and reflection
are implemented in this fashion (as are all implementations
as of October 2002).</p>

<p>The Xrandr library does some minimal caching to avoid
roundtrips to provide clients frequently used information.
See &quot;The X Resize and Rotate Extension&quot; for a
detailed description; also note that depth switching, as
described in the document is not implemented, and may (or
may not) ever be implemented, as display memory is growing
rapidly, and toolkits are already beginning to support
migration, mitigating the need for depth switching. If it is
implemented in the future, we expect to do so via an upward
compatible extension to the current library/protocol;
functionality described here should continue to work.</p>

<p>Rotation and reflection and how they interact can be
confusing. In Randr, the coordinate system is rotated in a
counter-clockwise direc- tion relative to the normal
orientation. Reflection is along the win- dow system
coordinate system, not the physical screen X and Y axis, so
that rotation and reflection do not interact. The other way
to con- sider reflection is to treat it as specified in the
&quot;normal&quot; orienta- tion, before rotation.</p>

<p>The XRRScreenChangeNotify event is sent to clients that
ask to be informed whenever the root window configuration
changes. Configuration changes may include resolution,
physical size, subpixel order (see XRender(3)), and
rotation. Note that changes to any or all of these could
occur due to external events (user control in the X server,
a different monitor/flat panel display being hot-plugged)
and is not only the result of a protocol/library request to
the X server.</p>

<p>Additionally, to eliminate a potential race condition,
this event may be generated immediately upon selecting for
notification if the screen has changed since the client of
Xrandr connected to the X server, to enable reliable screen
resolution changing when a user may log in and change the
configuration while one or many clients are starting up.</p>

<p>Xlib notification</p>

<p>Clients must call back into Xlib using
XRRUpdateConfiguration when screen configuration change
notify events are generated (or root window configuration
changes occur, to update Xlibs view of the resolution, size,
rotation, reflection or subpixel order. Generally, toolkits
will perform this operation on behalf of applications; we
did not want to change display structure data behind the
back of toolkits, as in multi- threaded clients, various
race conditions might occur. Toolkits should provide clients
some mechanism for notification of screen change, of
course.</p>

<p>FUNCTIONS There are two classes of interfaces: those
which can be safely called even if RandR is not implemented
on a screen (to make common idioms not dependent on the
server having support), and those which will return errors
if the extension is not present.</p>

<p>XRRRotations returns both the possible set of
rotations/reflections supported (as a bitmask) as the value
of the function, along with the current rotation/reflection
of the screen.</p>

<p>XRRSizes returns the size and a pointer to the current
sizes supported by the specified screen. The first size
specified is the default size of the server. If RandR is not
supported, it returns 0 for the number of sizes.</p>

<p>XRRRates returns a pointer to the rates supported by the
specified size. If RandR is not supported, it returns 0 for
the number of rates.</p>

<p>XRRTimes returns the time last reported by the server
along with the timestamp the last configuration changed. If
the configuration has changed since the client last updated
its view of the server time, requests to change the
configuration will fail until the client has an up to date
timestamp.</p>

<p>XRRRootToScreen returns the screen number given a root
window (for example, from an
XRRScreenChangeNotifyEvent).</p>

<p>The rest of the functions will fail if applied to
screens not imple- menting the RandR extension.
XRRSetScreenConfig sets the screen size and rotation and
reflection to the desired values on the screen speci- fied
by draw, or returns a BadValue error. size_index specifies
which size configuration is to be used, rotation specifies
which rotation or reflection is to be used (or a BadValue
error is returned). The times- tamp is used by the server to
make sure the client has up to date con- figuration
information. Status is returned to indicate success or
failure; a client must refresh its configuration information
if it fails and try the call again (by calling
XRRGetScreenInfo).</p>

<p>XRRSetScreenConfigAndRate is like XRRSetScreenConfig but
also sets the refresh rate. If specified rate is not
supported a BadValue error is returned.</p>

<p>XRRConfigRotations, XRRConfigSizes,
XRRConfigCurrentConfiguration, XRRConfigTimes,
XRRConfigRates, and XRRConfigCurrentRate are used to get
specific configuration information out of a screen
configuration.</p>

<p>XRRGetScreenInfo returns a screen configuration for
later use; the information is private to the library. Call
XRRFreeScreenConfigInfo to free this information when you
are finished with it. It forces a round trip to the
server.</p>

<p>Other functions include: XRRQueryExtension which returns
the event and error base codes, XRRQueryVersion , which
returns the current version of the extension (this
information is cached by the library).</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS Xrandr will remain upward compatible after
the current 1.0 release.</p>
