<p>unbound-control(8) unbound 1.4.20 unbound-control(8)</p>

<p>NAME unbound-control, unbound-control-setup - Unbound
remote server control utility.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS unbound-control [-hq] [-c cfgfile] [-s server]
command</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Unbound-control performs remote
administration on the unbound(8) DNS server. It reads the
configuration file, contacts the unbound server over SSL
sends the command and displays the result.</p>

<p>The available options are:</p>

<p>-h Show the version and commandline option help.</p>

<p>-c cfgfile The config file to read with settings. If not
given the default config file /etc/unbound/unbound.conf is
used.</p>

<p>-s server[@port] IPv4 or IPv6 address of the server to
contact. If not given, the address is read from the config
file.</p>

<p>-q quiet, if the option is given it does not print
anything if it works ok.</p>

<p>COMMANDS There are several commands that the server
understands.</p>

<p>start Start the server. Simply execs unbound(8). The
unbound exe- cutable is searched for in the PATH set in the
environment. It is started with the config file specified
using -c or the default config file.</p>

<p>stop Stop the server. The server daemon exits.</p>

<p>reload Reload the server. This flushes the cache and
reads the config file fresh.</p>

<p>verbosity number Change verbosity value for logging.
Same values as verbosity keyword in unbound.conf(5). This
new setting lasts until the server is issued a reload (taken
from config file again), or the next verbosity control
command.</p>

<p>log_reopen Reopen the logfile, close and open it. Useful
for logrotation to make the daemon release the file it is
logging to. If you are using syslog it will attempt to close
and open the syslog (which may not work if chrooted).</p>

<p>stats Print statistics. Resets the internal counters to
zero, this can be controlled using the statistics-cumulative
config statement. Statistics are printed with one [name]:
[value] per line.</p>

<p>stats_noreset Peek at statistics. Prints them like the
stats command does, but does not reset the internal counters
to zero.</p>

<p>status Display server status. Exit code 3 if not running
(the connec- tion to the port is refused), 1 on error, 0 if
running.</p>

<p>local_zone name type Add new local zone with name and
type. Like local-zone config statement. If the zone already
exists, the type is changed to the given argument.</p>

<p>local_zone_remove name Remove the local zone with the
given name. Removes all local data inside it. If the zone
does not exist, the command suc- ceeds.</p>

<p>local_data RR data... Add new local data, the given
resource record. Like local-data config statement, except
for when no covering zone exists. In that case this remote
control command creates a transparent zone with the same
name as this record. This command is not good at returning
detailed syntax errors.</p>

<p>local_data_remove name Remove all RR data from local
name. If the name already has no items, nothing happens.
Often results in NXDOMAIN for the name (in a static zone),
but if the name has become an empty nonter- minal (there is
still data in domain names below the removed name), NOERROR
nodata answers are the result for that name.</p>

<p>dump_cache The contents of the cache is printed in a
text format to stdout. You can redirect it to a file to
store the cache in a file.</p>

<p>load_cache The contents of the cache is loaded from
stdin. Uses the same format as dump_cache uses. Loading the
cache with old, or wrong data can result in old or wrong
data returned to clients. Load- ing data into the cache in
this way is supported in order to aid with debugging.</p>

<p>lookup name Print to stdout the name servers that would
be used to look up the name specified.</p>

<p>flush name Remove the name from the cache. Removes the
types A, AAAA, NS, SOA, CNAME, DNAME, MX, PTR, SRV and
NAPTR. Because that is fast to do. Other record types can be
removed using flush_type or flush_zone.</p>

<p>flush_type name type Remove the name, type information
from the cache.</p>

<p>flush_zone name Remove all information at or below the
name from the cache. The rrsets and key entries are removed
so that new lookups will be performed. This needs to walk
and inspect the entire cache, and is a slow operation.</p>

<p>flush_bogus Remove all bogus data from the cache.</p>

<p>flush_stats Reset statistics to zero.</p>

<p>flush_requestlist Drop the queries that are worked on.
Stops working on the queries that the server is working on
now. The cache is unaf- fected. No reply is sent for those
queries, probably making those users request again later.
Useful to make the server restart working on queries with
new settings, such as a higher verbosity level.</p>

<p>dump_requestlist Show what is worked on. Prints all
queries that the server is currently working on. Prints the
time that users have been waiting. For internal requests, no
time is printed. And then prints out the module status.</p>

<p>flush_infra all|IP If all then entire infra cache is
emptied. If a specific IP address, the entry for that
address is removed from the cache. It contains EDNS, ping
and lameness data.</p>

<p>dump_infra Show the contents of the infra cache.</p>

<p>set_option opt: val Set the option to the given value
without a reload. The cache is therefore not flushed. The
option must end with a : and whitespace must be between the
option and the value. Some val- ues may not have an effect
if set this way, the new values are not written to the
config file, not all options are supported. This is
different from the set_option call in libunbound, where all
values work because unbound has not been inited.</p>

<p>The values that work are: statistics-interval,
statistics-cumu- lative, do-not-query-localhost,
harden-short-bufsize, harden-large-queries, harden-glue,
harden-dnssec-stripped, harden-below-nxdomain,
harden-referral-path, prefetch, prefetch-key, log-queries,
hide-identity, hide-version, iden- tity, version,
val-log-level, val-log-squelch, ignore-cd-flag,
add-holddown, del-holddown, keep-missing, tcp-upstream,
ssl-upstream.</p>

<p>get_option opt Get the value of the option. Give the
option name without a trailing :. The value is printed. If
the value is &quot;&quot;, noth- ing is printed and the
connection closes. On error error ... is printed (it gives a
syntax error on unknown option). For some options a list of
values, one on each line, is printed. The options are shown
from the config file as modified with set_option. For some
options an override may have been taken that does not show
up with this command, not results from e.g. the verbosity
and forward control commands. Not all options work, see
list_stubs, list_forwards, list_local_zones and
list_local_data for those.</p>

<p>list_stubs List the stub zones in use. These are printed
one by one to the output. This includes the root hints in
use.</p>

<p>list_forwards List the forward zones in use. These are
printed zone by zone to the output.</p>

<p>list_local_zones List the local zones in use. These are
printed one per line with zone type.</p>

<p>list_local_data List the local data RRs in use. The
resource records are printed.</p>

<p>forward_add [+i] zone addr ... Add a new forward zone to
running unbound. With +i option also adds a domain-insecure
for the zone (so it can resolve insecurely if you have a
DNSSEC root trust anchor configured for other names). The
addr can be IP4, IP6 or nameserver names, like forward-zone
config in unbound.conf.</p>

<p>forward_remove [+i] zone Remove a forward zone from
running unbound. The +i also removes a domain-insecure for
the zone.</p>

<p>stub_add [+ip] zone addr ... Add a new stub zone to
running unbound. With +i option also adds a domain-insecure
for the zone. With +p the stub zone is set to prime, without
it it is set to notprime. The addr can be IP4, IP6 or
nameserver names, like the stub-zone config in
unbound.conf.</p>

<p>stub_remove [+i] zone Remove a stub zone from running
unbound. The +i also removes a domain-insecure for the
zone.</p>

<p>forward [off | addr ... ] Setup forwarding mode.
Configures if the server should ask other upstream
nameservers, should go to the internet root name- servers
itself, or show the current config. You could pass the
nameservers after a DHCP update.</p>

<p>Without arguments the current list of addresses used to
forward all queries to is printed. On startup this is from
the for- ward-zone &quot;.&quot; configuration. Afterwards
it shows the status. It prints off when no forwarding is
used.</p>

<p>If off is passed, forwarding is disabled and the root
name- servers are used. This can be used to avoid to avoid
buggy or non-DNSSEC supporting nameservers returned from
DHCP. But may not work in hotels or hotspots.</p>

<p>If one or more IPv4 or IPv6 addresses are given, those
are then used to forward queries to. The addresses must be
separated with spaces. With @port the port number can be set
explicitly (default port is 53 (DNS)).</p>

<p>By default the forwarder information from the config
file for the root &quot;.&quot; is used. The config file is
not changed, so after a reload these changes are gone. Other
forward zones from the config file are not affected by this
command.</p>

<p>EXIT CODE The unbound-control program exits with status
code 1 on error, 0 on success.</p>

<p>SET UP The setup requires a self-signed certificate and
private keys for both the server and client. The script
unbound-control-setup generates these in the default run
directory, or with -d in another directory. If you change
the access control permissions on the key files you can
decide who can use unbound-control, by default owner and
group but not all users. Run the script under the same
username as you have config- ured in unbound.conf or as
root, so that the daemon is permitted to read the files, for
example with: sudo -u unbound unbound-control-setup If you
have not configured a username in unbound.conf, the keys
need read permission for the user credentials under which
the daemon is started. The script preserves private keys
present in the directory. After running the script as root,
turn on control-enable in unbound.conf.</p>

<p>STATISTIC COUNTERS The stats command shows a number of
statistic counters.</p>

<p>threadX.num.queries number of queries received by
thread</p>

<p>threadX.num.cachehits number of queries that were
successfully answered using a cache lookup</p>

<p>threadX.num.cachemiss number of queries that needed
recursive processing</p>

<p>threadX.num.prefetch number of cache prefetches
performed. This number is included in cachehits, as the
original query had the unprefetched answer from cache, and
resulted in recursive processing, taking a slot in the
requestlist. Not part of the recursivereplies (or the
histogram thereof) or cachemiss, as a cache response was
sent.</p>

<p>threadX.num.recursivereplies The number of replies sent
to queries that needed recursive pro- cessing. Could be
smaller than threadX.num.cachemiss if due to timeouts no
replies were sent for some queries.</p>

<p>threadX.requestlist.avg The average number of requests
in the internal recursive pro- cessing request list on
insert of a new incoming recursive pro- cessing query.</p>

<p>threadX.requestlist.max Maximum size attained by the
internal recursive processing request list.</p>

<p>threadX.requestlist.overwritten Number of requests in
the request list that were overwritten by newer entries.
This happens if there is a flood of queries that recursive
processing and the server has a hard time.</p>

<p>threadX.requestlist.exceeded Queries that were dropped
because the request list was full. This happens if a flood
of queries need recursive processing, and the server can not
keep up.</p>

<p>threadX.requestlist.current.all Current size of the
request list, includes internally generated queries (such as
priming queries and glue lookups).</p>

<p>threadX.requestlist.current.user Current size of the
request list, only the requests from client queries.</p>

<p>threadX.recursion.time.avg Average time it took to
answer queries that needed recursive processing. Note that
queries that were answered from the cache are not in this
average.</p>

<p>threadX.recursion.time.median The median of the time it
took to answer queries that needed recursive processing. The
median means that 50% of the user queries were answered in
less than this time. Because of big outliers (usually
queries to non responsive servers), the aver- age can be
bigger than the median. This median has been calcu- lated by
interpolation from a histogram.</p>

<p>total.num.queries summed over threads.</p>

<p>total.num.cachehits summed over threads.</p>

<p>total.num.cachemiss summed over threads.</p>

<p>total.num.prefetch summed over threads.</p>

<p>total.num.recursivereplies summed over threads.</p>

<p>total.requestlist.avg averaged over threads.</p>

<p>total.requestlist.max the maximum of the thread
requestlist.max values.</p>

<p>total.requestlist.overwritten summed over threads.</p>

<p>total.requestlist.exceeded summed over threads.</p>

<p>total.requestlist.current.all summed over threads.</p>

<p>total.recursion.time.median averaged over threads.</p>

<p>time.now current time in seconds since 1970.</p>

<p>time.up uptime since server boot in seconds.</p>

<p>time.elapsed time since last statistics printout, in
seconds.</p>

<p>EXTENDED STATISTICS mem.total.sbrk If sbrk(2) is
available, an estimate of the heap size of the program in
number of bytes. Close to the total memory used by the
program, as reported by top and ps. Could be wrong if the OS
allocates memory non-contiguously.</p>

<p>mem.cache.rrset Memory in bytes in use by the RRset
cache.</p>

<p>mem.cache.message Memory in bytes in use by the message
cache.</p>

<p>mem.mod.iterator Memory in bytes in use by the iterator
module.</p>

<p>mem.mod.validator Memory in bytes in use by the
validator module. Includes the key cache and negative
cache.</p>


<p>histogram.&lt;sec&gt;.&lt;usec&gt;.to.&lt;sec&gt;.&lt;usec&gt;
Shows a histogram, summed over all threads. Every element
counts the recursive queries whose reply time fit between
the lower and upper bound. Times larger or equal to the
lowerbound, and smaller than the upper bound. There are 40
buckets, with bucket sizes doubling.</p>

<p>num.query.type.A The total number of queries over all
threads with query type A. Printed for the other query types
as well, but only for the types for which queries were
received, thus =0 entries are omit- ted for brevity.</p>

<p>num.query.type.other Number of queries with query types
256-65535.</p>

<p>num.query.class.IN The total number of queries over all
threads with query class IN (internet). Also printed for
other classes (such as CH (CHAOS) sometimes used for
debugging), or NONE, ANY, used by dynamic update.
num.query.class.other is printed for classes 256-65535.</p>

<p>num.query.opcode.QUERY The total number of queries over
all threads with query opcode QUERY. Also printed for other
opcodes, UPDATE, ...</p>

<p>num.query.tcp Number of queries that were made using TCP
towards the unbound server.</p>

<p>num.query.ipv6 Number of queries that were made using
IPv6 towards the unbound server.</p>

<p>num.query.flags.RD The number of queries that had the RD
flag set in the header. Also printed for flags QR, AA, TC,
RA, Z, AD, CD. Note that queries with flags QR, AA or TC may
have been rejected because of that.</p>

<p>num.query.edns.present number of queries that had an
EDNS OPT record present.</p>

<p>num.query.edns.DO number of queries that had an EDNS OPT
record with the DO (DNSSEC OK) bit set. These queries are
also included in the num.query.edns.present number.</p>

<p>num.answer.rcode.NXDOMAIN The number of answers to
queries, from cache or from recursion, that had the return
code NXDOMAIN. Also printed for the other return codes.</p>

<p>num.answer.rcode.nodata The number of answers to queries
that had the pseudo return code nodata. This means the
actual return code was NOERROR, but additionally, no data
was carried in the answer (making what is called a
NOERROR/NODATA answer). These queries are also included in
the num.answer.rcode.NOERROR number. Common for AAAA lookups
when an A record exists, and no AAAA.</p>

<p>num.answer.secure Number of answers that were secure.
The answer validated cor- rectly. The AD bit might have been
set in some of these answers, where the client signalled
(with DO or AD bit in the query) that they were ready to
accept the AD bit in the answer.</p>

<p>num.answer.bogus Number of answers that were bogus.
These answers resulted in SERVFAIL to the client because the
answer failed validation.</p>

<p>num.rrset.bogus The number of rrsets marked bogus by the
validator. Increased for every RRset inspection that
fails.</p>

<p>unwanted.queries Number of queries that were refused or
dropped because they failed the access control settings.</p>

<p>unwanted.replies Replies that were unwanted or
unsolicited. Could have been ran- dom traffic, delayed
duplicates, very late answers, or could be spoofing
attempts. Some low level of late answers and delayed
duplicates are to be expected with the UDP protocol. Very
high values could indicate a threat (spoofing).</p>

<p>FILES /etc/unbound/unbound.conf unbound configuration
file.</p>

<p>/etc/unbound directory with private keys
(unbound_server.key and unbound_con- trol.key) and
self-signed certificates (unbound_server.pem and
unbound_control.pem).</p>
