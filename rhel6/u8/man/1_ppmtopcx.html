<p>NAME ppmtopcx - convert a PPM image to a PCX file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtopcx</p>

<p>[-24bit]</p>

<p>[-8bit]</p>

<p>[-packed]</p>

<p>[-stdpalette]</p>

<p>[-palette=palettefile]</p>

<p>[-planes=planes]</p>

<p>[-xpos=cols]</p>

<p>[-ypos=rows]</p>

<p>[ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtopcx reads a PPM image as input and produces a PCX
file as output. The type of the PCX file depends on the
number of colors in the input image:</p>

<p>16 colors or fewer: 1 bit/pixel, 1-4 planes.</p>

<p>more than 16 colors, but no more than 256: 8 bits/pixel,
1 plane, colormap at the end of the file.</p>

<p>More than 256 colors: 24bit truecolor file (8
bits/pixel, 3 planes).</p>

<p>You can override some of that and explicitly choose the
format with the options below.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -24bit Produce a 24bit truecolor PCX file, even
if the image has 256 colors or fewer.</p>

<p>-8bit Produce an 8bit (256 colors) PCX file, even if the
image has 16 colors or fewer.</p>

<p>This option was added in Netpbm 10.18 (August 2003).</p>

<p>-packed Use packed pixel format for files with 16 colors
or fewer: 1, 2, or 4 bits/pixel, 1 plane.</p>

<p>-stdpalette Instead of computing a palette from the
colors in the image, use a standard, built-in 16 color
palette. If the image contains a color that is not in the
standard palette, ppmtopcx fails.</p>

<p>The standard palette is not only a set of colors, but a
specific mapping of palette indexes to colors. E.g. red is
4.</p>

<p>You can use pnmremap with a suitable PPM image of the
standard palette to adapt your image to use exactly those
colors in the palette so that ppmtopcx -stdpalette will work
on it.</p>

<p>The file pcxstd.ppm, part of Netpbm, contains the
standard palette.</p>

<p>Although the PCX header tells exactly what palette is
used in the file, some older PCX interpreters do not use
that informa- tion. They instead assume the standard
palette. If you dont use the -stdpalette option, ppmtopcx,
ppmtopcx may create an image that uses a different palette
(a rearrangement of the same colors) and then one of these
older interpreters would interpret the colors in the image
wrong.</p>

<p>You cannot specify this option along with -palette.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004).</p>

<p>-palette=palettefile Instead of computing the palette
from the colors in the image, use the palette from the file
palettefile. If the palette con- tains a color that is not
in that palette, ppmtopcx fails.</p>

<p>The palette file must be a PPM image that contains one
pixel for each color in the palette. It doesnt matter what
the aspect ratio of the palette image is. The order of the
colors in the PCX palette is the order of the pixels in the
PPM image in stan- dard western reading order (left to
right, top to bottom). If there is a duplicate color in the
palette, ppmtopcx chooses between them arbitrarily in
building the PCX raster.</p>

<p>You would need this only if you have a PCX reader that
cant read the palette that is in the PCX file and instead
assumes some particular palette. See also the -stdpalette
option.</p>

<p>If your input image might contain colors other than
those in your palette, you can convert the input image to
one that con- tains only those colors in your palette with
pnmremap.</p>

<p>You cannot specify this along with -stdpalette.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbhm 10.25 (October 2004).</p>

<p>-planes=planes Generate a PCX file with planes planes,
even though the number of colors in the image could be
represented in fewer. This makes the file larger, but some
PCX interpreters are capable of processing only certain
numbers of planes.</p>

<p>This is meaningful only when ppmtopcx generates an image
in the 16 color palette format without packed pixels.
Consequently, you cannot specify this option together with
-24bit or -8bit or -packed.</p>

<p>The valid values for planes are 1, 2, 3, and 4. By
default, ppmtopcx chooses the smallest number of planes that
can repre- sent the colors in the image. E.g. if there are 5
colors, ppm- topcx chooses 3 planes.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.21 (March 2004).</p>

<p>-xpos=cols</p>

<p>-ypos=rows These options set the position of the image
in some field (e.g. on a screen) in columns to the right of
the left edge and rows below the top edge. The PCX format
contains image position information. Don t confuse this with
the position of an area of interest within the image. For
example, using pnmpad to add a 10 pixel left border to an
image and then converting that image to PCX with xpos = 0 is
not the same as converting the original image to PCX and
setting xpos = 10.</p>

<p>The values may be from -32767 to 32768.</p>

<p>The default for each is zero.</p>
