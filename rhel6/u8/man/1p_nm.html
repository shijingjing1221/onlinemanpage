<p>NM(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual NM(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME nm - write the name list of an object file
(DEVELOPMENT)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nm [-APv][-efox][ -g| -u][-t format]
file...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This utility shall be provided on systems
that support both the User Portability Utilities option and
the Software Development Utilities option. On other systems
it is optional. Certain options are only available on
XSI-conformant systems.</p>

<p>The nm utility shall display symbolic information
appearing in the object file, executable file, or
object-file library named by file. If no symbolic
information is available for a valid input file, the nm
utility shall report that fact, but not consider it an error
condition.</p>

<p>The default base used when numeric values are written is
unspecified. On XSI-conformant systems, it shall be
decimal.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The nm utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-A Write the full pathname or library name of an object
on each line.</p>

<p>-e Write only external (global) and static symbol
information.</p>

<p>-f Produce full output. Write redundant symbols ( .text,
.data, and .bss), normally suppressed.</p>

<p>-g Write only external (global) symbol information.</p>

<p>-o Write numeric values in octal (equivalent to -t
o).</p>

<p>-P Write information in a portable output format, as
specified in the STDOUT section.</p>

<p>-t format Write each numeric value in the specified
format. The format shall be dependent on the single
character used as the format option-argument:</p>

<p>d The offset is written in decimal (default).</p>

<p>o The offset is written in octal.</p>

<p>x The offset is written in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-u Write only undefined symbols.</p>

<p>-v Sort output by value instead of alphabetically.</p>

<p>-x Write numeric values in hexadecimal (equivalent to -t
x).</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of an object file, executable file, or
object-file library.</p>

<p>STDIN See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input file shall be an object file, an
object-file library whose format is the same as those
produced by the ar utility for link edit- ing, or an
executable file. The nm utility may accept additional imple-
mentation-defined object library formats for the input
file.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of nm:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for character collation information
for the symbol-name and symbol-value collation
sequences.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If symbolic information is present in the input
files, then for each file or for each member of an archive,
the nm utility shall write the following information to
standard output. By default, the format is unspecified, but
the output shall be sorted alphabetically by symbol
name:</p>

<p>* Library or object name, if -A is specified</p>

<p>* Symbol name</p>

<p>* Symbol type, which shall either be one of the
following single char- acters or an implementation-defined
type represented by a single character:</p>

<p>A Global absolute symbol.</p>

<p>a Local absolute symbol.</p>

<p>B Global &quot;bss&quot; (that is, uninitialized data
space) symbol.</p>

<p>b Local bss symbol.</p>

<p>D Global data symbol.</p>

<p>d Local data symbol.</p>

<p>T Global text symbol.</p>

<p>t Local text symbol.</p>

<p>U Undefined symbol.</p>

<p>* Value of the symbol</p>

<p>* The size associated with the symbol, if applicable</p>

<p>This information may be supplemented by additional
information specific to the implementation.</p>

<p>If the -P option is specified, the previous information
shall be dis- played using the following portable format.
The three versions differ depending on whether -t d, -t o,
or -t x was specified, respectively:</p>

<p>&quot;%s%s %s %d %n&quot;, &lt;library/object name&gt;,
&lt;name&gt;, &lt;type&gt;, &lt;value&gt;, &lt;size&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;%s%s %s %o %n&quot;, &lt;library/object name&gt;,
&lt;name&gt;, &lt;type&gt;, &lt;value&gt;, &lt;size&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;%s%s %s %x %n&quot;, &lt;library/object name&gt;,
&lt;name&gt;, &lt;type&gt;, &lt;value&gt;, &lt;size&gt;
where &lt;library/object name&gt; shall be formatted as
follows:</p>

<p>* If -A is not specified, &lt;library/object name&gt;
shall be an empty string.</p>

<p>* If -A is specified and the corresponding file operand
does not name a library:</p>

<p>&quot;%s: &quot;, &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>* If -A is specified and the corresponding file operand
names a library. In this case, &lt;object file&gt; shall
name the object file in the library containing the symbol
being described:</p>

<p>&quot;%s[%s]: &quot;, &lt;file&gt;, &lt;object
file&gt;</p>

<p>If -A is not specified, then if more than one file
operand is specified or if only one file operand is
specified and it names a library, nm shall write a line
identifying the object containing the following sym- bols
before the lines containing those symbols, in the form:</p>

<p>* If the corresponding file operand does not name a
library:</p>

<p>&quot;%sn&quot;, &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>* If the corresponding file operand names a library; in
this case, &lt;object file&gt; shall be the name of the file
in the library contain- ing the following symbols:</p>

<p>&quot;%s[%s]n&quot;, &lt;file&gt;, &lt;object
file&gt;</p>

<p>If -P is specified, but -t is not, the format shall be
as if -t x had been specified.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Mechanisms for dynamic linking make
this utility less meaningful when applied to an executable
file because a dynamically linked executable may omit
numerous library routines that would be found in a
statically linked executable.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Historical implementations of nm have used
different bases for numeric output and supplied different
default types of symbols that were reported. The -t format
option, similar to that used in od and strings, can be used
to specify the numeric base; -g and -u can be used to
restrict the amount of output or the types of symbols
included in the output.</p>

<p>The compromise of using -t format versus using -d, -o,
and other simi- lar options was necessary because of
differences in the meaning of -o between implementations.
The -o option from BSD has been provided here as -A to avoid
confusion with the -o from System V (which has been pro-
vided here as -t and as -o on XSI-conformant systems).</p>

<p>The option list was significantly reduced from that
provided by histor- ical implementations.</p>

<p>The nm description is a subset of both the System V and
BSD nm utili- ties with no specified default output.</p>

<p>It was recognized that mechanisms for dynamic linking
make this utility less meaningful when applied to an
executable file (because a dynami- cally linked executable
file may omit numerous library routines that would be found
in a statically linked executable file), but the value of nm
during software development was judged to outweigh other
limita- tions.</p>

<p>The default output format of nm is not specified because
of differences in historical implementations. The -P option
was added to allow some type of portable output format.
After a comparison of the different formats used in SunOS,
BSD, SVR3, and SVR4, it was decided to create one that did
not match the current format of any of these four systems.
The format devised is easy to parse by humans, easy to parse
in shell scripts, and does not need to vary depending on
locale (because no English descriptions are included). All
of the systems currently have the information available to
use this format.</p>

<p>The format given in nm STDOUT uses spaces between the
fields, which may be any number of &lt;blank&gt;s required
to align the columns. The single- character types were
selected to match historical practice, and the requirement
that implementation additions also be single characters made
parsing the information easier for shell scripts.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
