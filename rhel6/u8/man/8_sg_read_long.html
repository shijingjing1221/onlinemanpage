<p>SG_READ_LONG(8) SG3_UTILS SG_READ_LONG(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_read_long - send a SCSI READ LONG command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_read_long [--16] [--correct] [--help]
[--lba=LBA] [--out=OF] [--pblock] [--verbose] [--version]
[--xfer_len=BTL] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Send SCSI READ LONG command to DEVICE. The
read buffer is output in hex and ASCII to stdout or placed
in a file. Note that the data returned includes the logical
block data (typically 512 bytes for a disk) plus ECC
information (whose format is proprietary) plus optionally
other proprietary data.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-S, --16 uses a SCSI READ LONG(16) command. The default
action is to use a SCSI READ LONG(10) command. The READ
LONG(10) command has a 32 bit field for the lba while READ
LONG(16) has a 64 bit field.</p>

<p>-c, --correct sets the CORRCT bit in the SCSI READ LONG
command. When set the data is corrected by the ECC before
being transferred back to this utility. The default is to
leave the CORRCT bit clear in which case the data is not
corrected.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-l, --lba=LBA where LBA is the logical block address of
the sector to read. Assumed to be in decimal unless prefixed
with 0x (or has a trailing h ). Defaults to lba 0. If the
lba is larger than can fit in 32 bits then the --16 option
should be used.</p>

<p>-o, --out=OF instead of outputting ASCII hex to stdout,
send it in binary to the file called OF. If - is given for
OF then the (binary) output is sent to stdout. Note that all
informative and error output is sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-p, --pblock sets the PBLOCK bit in the SCSI READ LONG
command. When set the physical block (plus ECC data)
containing the requested log- ical block address is read.
The default is to leave the PBLOCK bit clear in which case
the logical block (plus any ECC data) is read.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output).</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>-x, --xfer_len=BTL where BTL is the byte transfer length
(default to 520). If the given value (or the default) does
not match the &quot;long&quot; block size of the device, the
appropriate BTL is deduced from the error response and
printed (to stderr). The idea is that the user will retry
this utility with the correct transfer length.</p>

<p>NOTES If a defective block is found and its contents, if
any, has been retrieved then &quot;sg_reassign&quot; could
be used to map out the defective block. Associated with such
an action the number of elements in the &quot;grown&quot;
defect list could be monitored (with &quot;sg_reassign
--grown&quot;) as the disk could be nearing the end of its
useful lifetime.</p>

<p>Various numeric arguments (e.g. LBA) may include
multiplicative suf- fixes or be given in hexadecimal. See
the &quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the
sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p>As a data point, Fujitsu uses a 54 byte ECC (per block)
which is capa- ble of correcting up to a single burst error
or 216 bits &quot;on the fly&quot;. [Information obtained
from MAV20xxrc product manual.]</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_read_long is 0 when it
is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
