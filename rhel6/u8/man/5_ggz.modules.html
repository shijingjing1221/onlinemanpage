<p>NAME ggz.modules - GGZ Gaming Zone module configuration
file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The GGZ Gaming Zone uses the file
ggz.modules in order to configure which game modules are
properly installed. The only approved method of altering
this file is using the ggz-config utility, however the file
structure is documented here in order to facilitate manual
repairs if necessary.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS The ggz.modules file is formattted in
sections, each of which begins with a [SectionID] line. The
first (required) section is [Games]. This section is
followed by any number of game-specific sections named
[g#].</p>

<p>The [Games] section is formatted as follows:</p>

<p>[Games] *GameList* = GameName1 GameName2 ... GameName1 =
g1 g2 ... GameName2 = g3 ...</p>

<p>*GameList* Should be set to a list of all the game names
which are cur- rently installed. Each name should appear
once and only once, and should be the internal game name
(eg: NetSpades) and not the full descriptive name of the
game.</p>

<p>GameNameX Should equal a game name from the *GameList*,
a real world exam- ple would be NetSpades. It should be set
to a list of unique game section ID s of the form g#. Each
game section ID must be the name of a section ID which
follows in the file. The IDs need not be in any specific
order, and ID numbers may be skipped but NOT repeated.</p>

<p>A game section is formatted as follows:</p>

<p>[g#] Author = Games Author CommandLine =
/path/to/command [optionlist] Frontend = FECODE Homepage =
URL to Games homepage Name = GameName Protocol =
ProtocolVersion Version = GameVersion</p>

<p>Most of these parameters are self explanatory, however
the following may need clarification:</p>

<p>[g#] This section code ID must be present in one of the
game lists in the [Games] section above.</p>

<p>FECODE The frontend code should be set to either gtk or
kde depending on which user interface the game was designed
for. Note that the game is expected to work with either the
GTK+ or KDE clients, assuming that the user has the proper
windowing system installed.</p>

<p>GameName This must equal the game name (in the [Games]
section) which properly points to this [g#] section.</p>

<p>ProtocolVersion This will be used to match an installed
game client with the protocol version currently used by the
game server. This allows a new game client to be installed,
while retaining the old client for backwards compatibility
with older servers.</p>

<p>GameVersion This is simply the version of the game
client itself. It need not be the same version as the game
server as long as the Proto- colVersion ID matches.</p>
