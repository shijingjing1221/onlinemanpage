<p>PTHREAD_MUTEX_DESTROY(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_MUTEX_DESTROY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_mutex_destroy, pthread_mutex_init - destroy
and initialize a mutex</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_mutex_destroy(pthread_mutex_t *mutex); int
pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *restrict mutex, const
pthread_mutexattr_t *restrict attr); pthread_mutex_t mutex =
PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_mutex_destroy() function shall
destroy the mutex object referenced by mutex; the mutex
object becomes, in effect, uninitial- ized. An
implementation may cause pthread_mutex_destroy() to set the
object referenced by mutex to an invalid value. A destroyed
mutex object can be reinitialized using
pthread_mutex_init(); the results of otherwise referencing
the object after it has been destroyed are unde- fined.</p>

<p>It shall be safe to destroy an initialized mutex that is
unlocked. Attempting to destroy a locked mutex results in
undefined behavior.</p>

<p>The pthread_mutex_init() function shall initialize the
mutex referenced by mutex with attributes specified by attr.
If attr is NULL, the default mutex attributes are used; the
effect shall be the same as passing the address of a default
mutex attributes object. Upon success- ful initialization,
the state of the mutex becomes initialized and unlocked.</p>

<p>Only mutex itself may be used for performing
synchronization. The result of referring to copies of mutex
in calls to pthread_mutex_lock(), pthread_mutex_trylock(),
pthread_mutex_unlock(), and pthread_mutex_destroy() is
undefined.</p>

<p>Attempting to initialize an already initialized mutex
results in unde- fined behavior.</p>

<p>In cases where default mutex attributes are appropriate,
the macro PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER can be used to
initialize mutexes that are statically allocated. The effect
shall be equivalent to dynamic ini- tialization by a call to
pthread_mutex_init() with parameter attr spec- ified as
NULL, except that no error checks are performed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the pthread_mutex_destroy()
and pthread_mutex_init() functions shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>The [EBUSY] and [EINVAL] error checks, if implemented,
act as if they were performed immediately at the beginning
of processing for the func- tion and shall cause an error
return prior to modifying the state of the mutex specified
by mutex.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_mutex_destroy() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EBUSY The implementation has detected an attempt to
destroy the object referenced by mutex while it is locked or
referenced (for exam- ple, while being used in a
pthread_cond_timedwait() or pthread_cond_wait()) by another
thread.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by mutex is invalid.</p>

<p>The pthread_mutex_init() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The system lacked the necessary resources (other
than memory) to initialize another mutex.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to initialize the
mutex.</p>

<p>EPERM The caller does not have the privilege to perform
the operation.</p>

<p>The pthread_mutex_init() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EBUSY The implementation has detected an attempt to
reinitialize the object referenced by mutex, a previously
initialized, but not yet destroyed, mutex.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Alternate Implementations Possible This volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 supports several alternative imple-
mentations of mutexes. An implementation may store the lock
directly in the object of type pthread_mutex_t.
Alternatively, an implementation may store the lock in the
heap and merely store a pointer, handle, or unique ID in the
mutex object. Either implementation has advantages or may be
required on certain hardware configurations. So that
portable code can be written that is invariant to this
choice, this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not define
assignment or equality for this type, and it uses the term
&quot;initialize&quot; to reinforce the (more restric- tive)
notion that the lock may actually reside in the mutex object
itself.</p>

<p>Note that this precludes an over-specification of the
type of the mutex or condition variable and motivates the
opaqueness of the type.</p>

<p>An implementation is permitted, but not required, to
have pthread_mutex_destroy() store an illegal value into the
mutex. This may help detect erroneous programs that try to
lock (or otherwise ref- erence) a mutex that has already
been destroyed.</p>

<p>Tradeoff Between Error Checks and Performance Supported
Many of the error checks were made optional in order to let
implementa- tions trade off performance versus degree of
error checking according to the needs of their specific
applications and execution environment. As a general rule,
errors or conditions caused by the system (such as
insufficient memory) always need to be reported, but errors
due to an erroneously coded application (such as failing to
provide adequate syn- chronization to prevent a mutex from
being deleted while in use) are made optional.</p>

<p>A wide range of implementations is thus made possible.
For example, an implementation intended for application
debugging may implement all of the error checks, but an
implementation running a single, provably cor- rect
application under very tight performance constraints in an
embed- ded computer might implement minimal checks. An
implementation might even be provided in two versions,
similar to the options that compilers provide: a
full-checking, but slower version; and a limited-checking,
but faster version. To forbid this optionality would be a
disservice to users.</p>

<p>By carefully limiting the use of &quot;undefined
behavior&quot; only to things that an erroneous (badly
coded) application might do, and by defining that
resource-not-available errors are mandatory, this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 ensures that a fully-conforming
application is portable across the full range of
implementations, while not forcing all implementations to
add overhead to check for numerous things that a correct
program never does.</p>

<p>Why No Limits are Defined Defining symbols for the
maximum number of mutexes and condition vari- ables was
considered but rejected because the number of these objects
may change dynamically. Furthermore, many implementations
place these objects into application memory; thus, there is
no explicit maximum.</p>

<p>Static Initializers for Mutexes and Condition Variables
Providing for static initialization of statically allocated
synchro- nization objects allows modules with private static
synchronization variables to avoid runtime initialization
tests and overhead. Further- more, it simplifies the coding
of self-initializing modules. Such mod- ules are common in C
libraries, where for various reasons the design calls for
self-initialization instead of requiring an explicit module
initialization function to be called. An example use of
static initial- ization follows.</p>

<p>Without static initialization, a self-initializing
routine foo() might look as follows:</p>

<p>static pthread_once_t foo_once = PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT;
static pthread_mutex_t foo_mutex;</p>

<p>void foo_init() { pthread_mutex_init(&amp;foo_mutex,
NULL); }</p>

<p>void foo() { pthread_once(&amp;foo_once, foo_init);
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;foo_mutex); /* Do work. */
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;foo_mutex); }</p>

<p>With static initialization, the same routine could be
coded as follows:</p>

<p>static pthread_mutex_t foo_mutex =
PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;</p>

<p>void foo() { pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;foo_mutex); /* Do
work. */ pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;foo_mutex); }</p>

<p>Note that the static initialization both eliminates the
need for the initialization test inside pthread_once() and
the fetch of &amp;foo_mutex to learn the address to be
passed to pthread_mutex_lock() or
pthread_mutex_unlock().</p>

<p>Thus, the C code written to initialize static objects is
simpler on all systems and is also faster on a large class
of systems; those where the (entire) synchronization object
can be stored in application memory.</p>

<p>Yet the locking performance question is likely to be
raised for machines that require mutexes to be allocated out
of special memory. Such machines actually have to have
mutexes and possibly condition variables contain pointers to
the actual hardware locks. For static initialization to work
on such machines, pthread_mutex_lock() also has to test
whether or not the pointer to the actual lock has been allo-
cated. If it has not, pthread_mutex_lock() has to initialize
it before use. The reservation of such resources can be made
when the program is loaded, and hence return codes have not
been added to mutex locking and condition variable waiting
to indicate failure to complete initializa- tion.</p>

<p>This runtime test in pthread_mutex_lock() would at first
seem to be extra work; an extra test is required to see
whether the pointer has been initialized. On most machines
this would actually be implemented as a fetch of the
pointer, testing the pointer against zero, and then using
the pointer if it has already been initialized. While the
test might seem to add extra work, the extra effort of
testing a register is usually negligible since no extra
memory references are actually done. As more and more
machines provide caches, the real expenses are memory
references, not instructions executed.</p>

<p>Alternatively, depending on the machine architecture,
there are often ways to eliminate all overhead in the most
important case: on the lock operations that occur after the
lock has been initialized. This can be done by shifting more
overhead to the less frequent operation: initial- ization.
Since out-of-line mutex allocation also means that an
address has to be dereferenced to find the actual lock, one
technique that is widely applicable is to have static
initialization store a bogus value for that address; in
particular, an address that causes a machine fault to occur.
When such a fault occurs upon the first attempt to lock such
a mutex, validity checks can be done, and then the correct
address for the actual lock can be filled in. Subsequent
lock operations incur no extra overhead since they do not
&quot;fault&quot;. This is merely one technique that can be
used to support static initialization, while not adversely
affecting the performance of lock acquisition. No doubt
there are other techniques that are highly
machine-dependent.</p>

<p>The locking overhead for machines doing out-of-line
mutex allocation is thus similar for modules being
implicitly initialized, where it is improved for those doing
mutex allocation entirely inline. The inline case is thus
made much faster, and the out-of-line case is not signifi-
cantly worse.</p>

<p>Besides the issue of locking performance for such
machines, a concern is raised that it is possible that
threads would serialize contending for initialization locks
when attempting to finish initializing stati- cally
allocated mutexes. (Such finishing would typically involve
taking an internal lock, allocating a structure, storing a
pointer to the structure in the mutex, and releasing the
internal lock.) First, many implementations would reduce
such serialization by hashing on the mutex address. Second,
such serialization can only occur a bounded number of times.
In particular, it can happen at most as many times as there
are statically allocated synchronization objects.
Dynamically allocated objects would still be initialized via
pthread_mutex_init() or pthread_cond_init().</p>

<p>Finally, if none of the above optimization techniques
for out-of-line allocation yields sufficient performance for
an application on some implementation, the application can
avoid static initialization alto- gether by explicitly
initializing all synchronization objects with the
corresponding pthread_*_init() functions, which are
supported by all implementations. An implementation can also
document the tradeoffs and advise which initialization
technique is more efficient for that par- ticular
implementation.</p>

<p>Destroying Mutexes A mutex can be destroyed immediately
after it is unlocked. For example, consider the following
code:</p>

<p>struct obj { pthread_mutex_t om; int refcnt; ... };</p>

<p>obj_done(struct obj *op) {
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;op-&gt;om); if (--op-&gt;refcnt ==
0) { pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;op-&gt;om); (A)
pthread_mutex_destroy(&amp;op-&gt;om); (B) free(op); } else
(C) pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;op-&gt;om); }</p>

<p>In this case obj is reference counted and obj_done() is
called whenever a reference to the object is dropped.
Implementations are required to allow an object to be
destroyed and freed and potentially unmapped (for example,
lines A and B) immediately after the object is unlocked
(line C).</p>
