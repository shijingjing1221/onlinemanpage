<p>LSTAT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual LSTAT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME lstat - get symbolic link status</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int lstat(const char *restrict path, struct stat
*restrict buf);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The lstat() function shall be equivalent to
stat(), except when path refers to a symbolic link. In that
case lstat() shall return informa- tion about the link,
while stat() shall return information about the file the
link references.</p>

<p>For symbolic links, the st_mode member shall contain
meaningful infor- mation when used with the file type
macros, and the st_size member shall contain the length of
the pathname contained in the symbolic link. File mode bits
and the contents of the remaining members of the stat
structure are unspecified. The value returned in the st_size
mem- ber is the length of the contents of the symbolic link,
and does not count any trailing null.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, lstat() shall
return 0. Otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The lstat() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES A component of the path prefix denies search
permission.</p>

<p>EIO An error occurred while reading from the file
system.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}
or a pathname compo- nent is longer than {NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing
file or path is an empty string.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW The file size in bytes or the number of blocks
allocated to the file or the file serial number cannot be
represented correctly in the structure pointed to by
buf.</p>

<p>The lstat() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG As a result of encountering a symbolic link
in resolution of the path argument, the length of the
substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW One of the members is too large to store into
the structure pointed to by the buf argument.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Obtaining Symbolic Link Status Information The
following example shows how to obtain status information for
a sym- bolic link named /modules/pass1. The structure
variable buffer is defined for the stat structure. If the
path argument specified the filename for the file pointed to
by the symbolic link ( /home/cnd/mod1), the results of
calling the function would be the same as those returned by
a call to the stat() function.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct stat buffer; int status; ... status =
lstat(&quot;/modules/pass1&quot;, &amp;buffer);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The lstat() function is not required to update
the time-related fields if the named file is not a symbolic
link. While the st_uid, st_gid, st_atime, st_mtime, and
st_ctime members of the stat structure may apply to a
symbolic link, they are not required to do so. No functions
in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 are required to maintain any of
these time fields.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
