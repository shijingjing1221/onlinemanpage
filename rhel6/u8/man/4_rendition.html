<p>NAME rendition - Rendition video driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;rendition&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rendition is an Xorg driver for
Rendition/Micron based video cards. The driver supports
following framebuffer depths: 8, 15 (Verite V1000 only), 16
and 24. Acceleration and multi-head configurations are not
supported yet, but are work in progress.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE The rendition driver supports PCI and
AGP video cards based on the fol- lowing Rendition/Micron
chips:</p>

<p>V1000 Verite V1000 based cards.</p>

<p>V2100 Verite V2100 based cards. Diamond Stealth II S220
is the only known such card.</p>

<p>V2200 Verite V2200 based cards.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the
following ChipSet names may optionally be specified in the
config file &quot;Device&quot; section, and will override
the auto-detection:</p>

<p>&quot;v1000&quot;, &quot;v2x00&quot;.</p>

<p>The driver will auto-detect the amount of video memory
present for all chips. If the amount of memory is detected
incorrectly, the actual amount of video memory should be
specified with a VideoRam entry in the config file
&quot;Device&quot; section.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disables
use of the hardware cursor. Default: use HW-cursor.</p>

<p>Option &quot;OverclockMem&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Increases the Mem/Sys clock to 125MHz/60MHz from standard
110MHz/50MHz. Default: Not overclocked.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DacSpeed&quot; &quot;MHz&quot; Run the
memory at a higher clock. Useful on some cards with dis-
play glitches at higher resolutions. But adds the risk to
damage the hardware. Use with caution.</p>

<p>Option &quot;FramebufferWC&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; If
writecombine is disabled in BIOS, and you add this option in
configuration file, then the driver will try to request
write- combined access to the framebuffer. This can
drastically increase the performance on unaccelerated
server. Requires that &quot;MTRR&quot;-support is compiled
into the OS-kernel. Default: Disabled for V1000, enabled for
V2100/V2200.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoDDC&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
probing of DDC-information from your monitor. This
information is not used yet and is only there for
informational purposes. Safe to disable if you experience
problems during startup of X-server. Default: Probe DDC.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; If this
option is enabled, the driver will cause the CPU to do each
drawing operation first into a shadow frame buffer in sys-
tem virtual memory and then copy the result into video
memory. If this option is not active, the CPU will draw
directly into video memory. Enabling this option is
beneficial for those sys- tems where reading from video
memory is, on average, slower than the corresponding
read/modify/write operation in system virtual memory. This
is normally the case for PCI or AGP adapters, and, so, this
option is enabled by default unless acceleration is enabled.
Default: Enabled unless acceleration is used.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CW&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;CCW&quot; Rotate the
display clockwise or counterclockwise. This mode is
unaccelerated. Default: no rotation.</p>

<p>Notes For the moment the driver defaults to not request
write-combine for any chipset as there has been indications
of problems with it. Use Option &quot;MTRR&quot; to let the
driver request write-combining of memory access on the video
board.</p>
