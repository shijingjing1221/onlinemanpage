<p>WVDIAL.CONF(5) WVDIAL.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME wvdial.conf - wvdial configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When wvdial starts, it first loads its
configuration from /etc/wvdial.conf, which contains basic
information about the modem port, speed, and init string,
along with information about your Inter- net Service
Provider (ISP), such as the phone number, your username, and
your password.</p>

<p>The configuration file /etc/wvdial.conf is in Windows
&quot;ini&quot; file for- mat, with sections named in square
brackets and a number of variable = value pairs within each
section.</p>

<p>Here is a sample configuration file:</p>

<p>[Dialer Defaults] Modem = /dev/ttyS2 Baud = 57600 Init =
ATZ Init2 = AT S11=50 Phone = 555-4242 Username = apenwarr
Password = my-password</p>

<p>[Dialer phone2] Phone = 555-4243</p>

<p>[Dialer shh] Init3 = ATM0</p>

<p>[Dialer pulse] Dial Command = ATDP</p>

<p>The sample configuration file above contains all of the
options neces- sary to run the two sample command lines
given above. Here is a com- plete list of settings that
wvdial understands:</p>

<p>Modem The location of the device that wvdial should use
as your modem. The default is /dev/modem.</p>

<p>Baud The speed at which wvdial will communicate with
your modem. The default is 57600 baud.</p>

<p>Init1 ... Init9 wvdial can use up to nine initialization
strings to set up your modem. Before dialing, these strings
are sent to the modem in numerical order. These are
particularly useful when specifying multiple sections. See
above for an example that uses Init3 to turn the modems
speaker off. The default is &quot;ATZ&quot; for Init1.</p>

<p>Phone The phone number you want wvdial to dial. You can
add up to 9 other phone numbers that wvdial will dial in
order, by adding:</p>

<p>Phone1</p>

<p>Phone2</p>

<p>Phone3</p>

<p>Phone4</p>

<p>Phone5</p>

<p>Phone6</p>

<p>Phone7</p>

<p>Phone8</p>

<p>Phone9</p>

<p>Dial Prefix wvdial will insert this string after the
dial command and before the phone number. For example, to
disable call waiting (in North America, anyway) set this to
&quot;*70,&quot;.</p>

<p>Dial Command wvdial will use this string to tell the
modem to dial. The default is &quot;ATDT&quot;.</p>

<p>Username You must set this to the username you use at
your ISP.</p>

<p>Login Prompt If your ISP has an unusual login procedure
that wvdial is unable to figure out, you can use this option
to specify a login prompt. When this prompt is received from
your ISP, wvdial will send the Login string.</p>

<p>Password You must set this to the password you use at
your ISP.</p>

<p>Ask Password By setting this option wvdial will prompt
for your password on every dialin. Thus you dont have to
save your password in /etc/wvdial.conf. (Option added by
SuSE.)</p>

<p>Password Prompt If your ISP has an unusual login
procedure that wvdial is unable to figure out, you can use
this option to specify a password prompt. When this prompt
is received from you ISP, wvdial will send the Password
string.</p>

<p>PPPD Path If your system has pppd somewhere other than
/usr/sbin/pppd, you will need to set this option.</p>

<p>Auto DNS Try to get the Domain Nameserver (DNS) from the
provider. This option is &quot;on&quot; by default. (Option
added by SuSE.)</p>

<p>Check DNS Check the Domain Nameserver (DNS) after the
connection has been set up. This option is &quot;on&quot; by
default. (Option added by SuSE.)</p>

<p>DNS Test1 First DNS lookup for DNS check. (Option added
by SuSE.)</p>

<p>DNS Test2 Second DNS lookup for DNS check. (Option added
by SuSE.)</p>

<p>Check Def Route Check the default route after the
connection has been set up. This option is &quot;on&quot; by
default. (Option added by SuSE.)</p>

<p>Force Address This option only applies if you have a
static IP address at your ISP, and even then you probably
dont need it. Some ISPs dont send the IP address as part of
the PPP negotiation. This option forces pppd to use the
address you give it.</p>

<p>Remote Name If your ISP uses PAP or CHAP authentication,
you might need to change this to your ISPs authentication
name. In most cases, however, its safe to use the default
value, &quot;*&quot;.</p>

<p>Carrier Check wvdial checks your modem during the
connection process to ensure that it is actually online. If
you have a weird modem that insists its carrier line is
always down, you can disable the carrier check by setting
this option to &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>Stupid Mode When wvdial is in Stupid Mode, it does not
attempt to interpret any prompts from the terminal server.
It starts pppd immedi- ately after the modem connects.
Apparently there are ISPs that actually give you a login
prompt, but work only if you start PPP, rather than logging
in. Go figure. Stupid Mode is (natu- rally) disabled by
default.</p>

<p>New PPPD You need this option if you have pppd version
2.3.0 or newer, to make wvdial create the file
/etc/ppp/peers/wvdial. This option is enabled by default,
thus if you have older pppd you need to set it to no (or
upgrade pppd).</p>

<p>Default Reply When wvdial detects a prompt, and it hasnt
seen any clues that indicate what it should send as a
response to the prompt, it defaults to sending
&quot;ppp&quot;. Sometimes this is inadequate. Use this
option to override wvdial s default prompt response.</p>

<p>Auto Reconnect If enabled, wvdial will attempt to
automatically reestablish a connection if you are randomly
disconnected by the other side. This option is
&quot;on&quot; by default.</p>

<p>Idle Seconds Set the hangup timeout in seconds. If there
is inactivity for the given time the connection is shut
down. A hangup timeout of 0 disables this feature.</p>

<p>Abort on Busy If enabled, wvdial will not retry the
connection if the modem says that the line is busy. This
option is &quot;off&quot; by default.</p>

<p>Abort on No Dialtone If enabled, wvdial will not retry
the connection if the modem says that there is no dialtone.
This option is &quot;on&quot; by default.</p>

<p>Dial Attempts If value is set, wvdial will quit after
that many tries .If set to 0, wvdial will happily keep
dialling forever.</p>

<p>Dial Timeout The maximum time in seconds that wvdial
will wait for a connec- tion to be made. Default value is 60
seconds.</p>

<p>The wvdialconf(1) program can be used to detect your
modem and fill in the Modem, Baud, and Init/Init2 options
automatically.</p>
