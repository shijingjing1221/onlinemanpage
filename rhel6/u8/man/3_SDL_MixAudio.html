<p>SDL_MixAudio(3) SDL API Reference SDL_MixAudio(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_MixAudio - Mix audio data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;</p>

<p>void SDL_MixAudio(Uint8 *dst, Uint8 *src, Uint32 len,
int volume);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function takes two audio buffers of len
bytes each of the playing audio format and mixes them,
performing addition, volume adjustment, and overflow
clipping. The volume ranges from 0 to SDL_MIX_MAXVOLUME and
should be set to the maximum value for full audio volume.
Note this does not change hardware volume. This is provided
for convenience -- you can mix your own audio data.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>Do not use this function for mixing together more than
two streams of sample data. The output from repeated
application of this function may be distorted by clipping,
because there is no accumulator with greater range than the
input (not to mention this being an inefficient way of doing
it). Use mixing functions from SDL_mixer, OpenAL, or write
your own mixer instead.</p>
