<p>MYSQL_TZINFO_TO_S(1) MySQL Database System
MYSQL_TZINFO_TO_S(1)</p>

<p>NAME mysql_tzinfo_to_sql - load the time zone tables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysql_tzinfo_to_sql arguments</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mysql_tzinfo_to_sql program loads the
time zone tables in the mysql database. It is used on
systems that have a zoneinfo database (the set of files
describing time zones). Examples of such systems are Linux,
FreeBSD, Solaris, and Mac OS X. One likely location for
these files is the /usr/share/zoneinfo directory
(/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo on Solaris). If your system does
not have a zoneinfo database, you can use the downloadable
package described in Section 10.6, MySQL Server Time Zone
Support.</p>

<p>mysql_tzinfo_to_sql can be invoked several ways:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql_tzinfo_to_sql tz_dir shell&gt;
mysql_tzinfo_to_sql tz_file tz_name shell&gt;
mysql_tzinfo_to_sql --leap tz_file</p>

<p>For the first invocation syntax, pass the zoneinfo
directory path name to mysql_tzinfo_to_sql and send the
output into the mysql program. For example:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo |
mysql -u root mysql</p>

<p>mysql_tzinfo_to_sql reads your system&rsquo;s time zone
files and generates SQL statements from them. mysql
processes those statements to load the time zone tables.</p>

<p>The second syntax causes mysql_tzinfo_to_sql to load a
single time zone file tz_file that corresponds to a time
zone name tz_name:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql_tzinfo_to_sql tz_file tz_name | mysql -u
root mysql</p>

<p>If your time zone needs to account for leap seconds,
invoke mysql_tzinfo_to_sql using the third syntax, which
initializes the leap second information. tz_file is the name
of your time zone file:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql_tzinfo_to_sql --leap tz_file | mysql -u
root mysql</p>

<p>After running mysql_tzinfo_to_sql, it is best to restart
the server so that it does not continue to use any
previously cached time zone data.</p>
