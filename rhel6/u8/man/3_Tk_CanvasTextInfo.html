<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_CanvasTextInfo - additional information for
managing text items in canvases</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_CanvasTextInfo * Tk_CanvasGetTextInfo(canvas)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_Canvas canvas (in) A token that identifies
a particular canvas widget.

<p>DESCRIPTION Textual canvas items are somewhat more
complicated to manage than other items, due to things like
the selection and the input focus. Tk_Can- vasGetTextInfo
may be invoked by a type manager to obtain additional
information needed for items that display text. The return
value from Tk_CanvasGetTextInfo is a pointer to a structure
that is shared between Tk and all the items that display
text. The structure has the follow- ing form: typedef struct
Tk_CanvasTextInfo { Tk_3DBorder selBorder; int
selBorderWidth; XColor *selFgColorPtr; Tk_Item *selItemPtr;
int selectFirst; int selectLast; Tk_Item *anchorItemPtr; int
selectAnchor; Tk_3DBorder insertBorder; int insertWidth; int
insertBorderWidth; Tk_Item *focusItemPtr; int gotFocus; int
cursorOn; } Tk_CanvasTextInfo; The selBorder field
identifies a Tk_3DBorder that should be used for drawing the
background under selected text. selBorderWidth gives the
width of the raised border around selected text, in pixels.
selFgCol- orPtr points to an XColor that describes the
foreground color to be used when drawing selected text.
selItemPtr points to the item that is currently selected, or
NULL if there is no item selected or if the can- vas does
not have the selection. selectFirst and selectLast give the
indices of the first and last selected characters in
selItemPtr, as returned by the indexProc for that item.
anchorItemPtr points to the item that currently has the
selection anchor; this is not necessarily the same as
selItemPtr. selectAnchor is an index that identifies the
anchor position within anchorItemPtr. insertBorder contains
a Tk_3DBorder to use when drawing the insertion cursor;
insertWidth gives the total width of the insertion cursor in
pixels, and insertBor- derWidth gives the width of the
raised border around the insertion cursor. focusItemPtr
identifies the item that currently has the input focus, or
NULL if there is no such item. gotFocus is 1 if the canvas
widget has the input focus and 0 otherwise. cursorOn is 1 if
the insertion cursor should be drawn in focusItemPtr and 0
if it should not be drawn; this field is toggled on and off
by Tk to make the cursor blink.</p>

<p>The structure returned by Tk_CanvasGetTextInfo is shared
between Tk and the type managers; typically the type manager
calls Tk_CanvasGetTex- tInfo once when an item is created
and then saves the pointer in the item s record. Tk will
update information in the Tk_CanvasTextInfo; for example, a
configure widget command might change the selBorder field,
or a select widget command might change the selectFirst
field, or Tk might change cursorOn in order to make the
insertion cursor flash on and off during successive
redisplays.</p>

<p>Type managers should treat all of the fields of the
Tk_CanvasTextInfo structure as read-only, except for
selItemPtr, selectFirst, selectLast, and selectAnchor. Type
managers may change selectFirst, selectLast, and
selectAnchor to adjust for insertions and deletions in the
item (but only if the item is the current owner of the
selection or anchor, as determined by selItemPtr or
anchorItemPtr). If all of the selected text in the item is
deleted, the item should set selItemPtr to NULL to indicate
that there is no longer a selection.</p>
