<p>XInstallColormap(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XInstallColormap(3)</p>

<p>NAME XInstallColormap, XUninstallColormap,
XListInstalledColormaps - control colormaps</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XInstallColormap(Display *display, Colormap
colormap);</p>

<p>int XUninstallColormap(Display *display, Colormap
colormap);</p>

<p>Colormap *XListInstalledColormaps(Display *display,
Window w, int *num_return);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS colormap Specifies the colormap.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>num_return Returns the number of currently installed
colormaps.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window that determines the screen.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XInstallColormap function installs the
specified colormap for its associated screen. All windows
associated with this colormap immedi- ately display with
true colors. You associated the windows with this colormap
when you created them by calling XCreateWindow, XCreateSim-
pleWindow, XChangeWindowAttributes, or
XSetWindowColormap.</p>

<p>If the specified colormap is not already an installed
colormap, the X server generates a ColormapNotify event on
each window that has that colormap. In addition, for every
other colormap that is installed as a result of a call to
XInstallColormap, the X server generates a Col- ormapNotify
event on each window that has that colormap.</p>

<p>XInstallColormap can generate a BadColor error.</p>

<p>The XUninstallColormap function removes the specified
colormap from the required list for its screen. As a result,
the specified colormap might be uninstalled, and the X
server might implicitly install or uninstall additional
colormaps. Which colormaps get installed or unin- stalled is
server dependent except that the required list must remain
installed.</p>

<p>If the specified colormap becomes uninstalled, the X
server generates a ColormapNotify event on each window that
has that colormap. In addi- tion, for every other colormap
that is installed or uninstalled as a result of a call to
XUninstallColormap, the X server generates a Col-
ormapNotify event on each window that has that colormap.</p>

<p>XUninstallColormap can generate a BadColor error.</p>

<p>The XListInstalledColormaps function returns a list of
the currently installed colormaps for the screen of the
specified window. The order of the colormaps in the list is
not significant and is no explicit indication of the
required list. When the allocated list is no longer needed,
free it by using XFree.</p>

<p>XListInstalledColormaps can generate a BadWindow
error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadColor A value for a Colormap argument
does not name a defined Col- ormap.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
