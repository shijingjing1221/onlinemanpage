<p>SAID DESCRIPTION Where &lt;SAID&gt; is --af (inet |
inet6) --edst edst --spi spi --proto proto OR --said said OR
--said (%passthrough | %passthrough4 | %passthrough6 | %drop
| %reject | %trap | %hold | %pass )</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Eroute manages the IPSEC extended routing
tables, which control what (if any) processing is applied to
non-encrypted packets arriving for IPSEC processing and
forwarding. The form with no additional arguments lists the
contents of /proc/net/ipsec_eroute. The --add form adds a
table entry, the --replace form replaces a table entry,
while the --del form deletes one. The --clear form deletes
the entire table.</p>

<p>A table entry consists of:</p>

<p>+ source and destination addresses, with masks, source
and destination ports and protocol for selection of packets.
The source and destination ports are only legal if the
transport protocol is TCP or UDP. A port can be specified as
either decimal, hexadecimal (leading 0x), octal (leading 0)
or a name listed in the first column of /etc/services. A
transport protocol can be specified as either decimal,
hexadecimal (leading 0x), octal (leading 0) or a name listed
in the first column of /etc/protocols. If a transport
protocol or port is not specified then it defaults to 0
which means all protocols or all ports respectively.</p>

<p>+ Security Association IDentifier, comprised of:</p>

<p>+ protocol (proto), indicating (together with the
effective destination and the security parameters index)
which Security Association should be used to process the
packet</p>

<p>+ address family (af),</p>

<p>+ Security Parameters Index (spi), indicating (together
with the effective destination and protocol) which Security
Association should be used to process the packet (must be
larger than or equal to 0x100)</p>

<p>+ effective destination (edst), where the packet should
be forwarded after processing (normally the other security
gateway)</p>

<p>+ OR</p>

<p>+ SAID (said), indicating which Security Association
should be used to process the packet</p>

<p>Addresses are written as IPv4 dotted quads or IPv6
coloned hex, protocol is one of &quot;ah&quot;,
&quot;esp&quot;, &quot;comp&quot; or &quot;tun&quot; and
SPIs are prefixed hexadecimal numbers where &acute;.&acute;
represents IPv4 and &acute;:&acute; stands for IPv6.</p>

<p>SAIDs are written as &quot;protoafSPI@address&quot;.
There are also 5 &quot;magic&quot; SAIDs which have special
meaning:</p>

<p>+ %drop means that matches are to be dropped</p>

<p>+ %reject means that matches are to be dropped and an
ICMP returned, if possible to inform</p>

<p>+ %trap means that matches are to trigger an ACQUIRE
message to the Key Management daemon(s) and a hold eroute
will be put in place to prevent subsequent packets also
triggering ACQUIRE messages.</p>

<p>+ %hold means that matches are to stored until the
eroute is replaced or until that eroute gets reaped</p>

<p>+ %pass means that matches are to allowed to pass
without IPSEC processing</p>

<p>The format of /proc/net/ipsec_eroute is listed in
ipsec_eroute(5).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES ipsec eroute --add --eraf inet --src
192.168.0.1/32 --dst 192.168.2.0/24 --af inet --edst
192.168.0.2 --spi 0x135 --proto tun</p>

<p>sets up an eroute on a Security Gateway to protect
traffic between the host 192.168.0.1 and the subnet
192.168.2.0 with 24 bits of subnet mask via Security Gateway
192.168.0.2 using the Security Association with address
192.168.0.2, Security Parameters Index 0x135 and protocol
tun (50, IPPROTO_ESP).</p>

<p>ipsec eroute --add --eraf inet6 --src 3049:1::1/128
--dst 3049:2::/64 --af inet6 --edst 3049:1::2 --spi 0x145
--proto tun</p>

<p>sets up an eroute on a Security Gateway to protect
traffic between the host 3049:1::1 and the subnet 3049:2::
with 64 bits of subnet mask via Security Gateway 3049:1::2
using the Security Association with address 3049:1::2,
Security Parameters Index 0x145 and protocol tun (50,
IPPROTO_ESP).</p>

<p>ipsec eroute --replace --eraf inet --src company.com/24
--dst ftp.ngo.org/32 --said tun.135@gw.ngo.org</p>

<p>replaces an eroute on a Security Gateway to protect
traffic between the subnet company.com with 24 bits of
subnet mask and the host ftp.ngo.org via Security Gateway
gw.ngo.org using the Security Association with Security
Association ID tun0x135@gw.ngo.org</p>

<p>ipsec eroute --del --eraf inet --src company.com/24
--dst www.ietf.org/32 --said %passthrough4</p>

<p>deletes an eroute on a Security Gateway that allowed
traffic between the subnet company.com with 24 bits of
subnet mask and the host www.ietf.org to pass in the clear,
unprocessed.</p>

<p>ipsec eroute --add --eraf inet --src company.com/24
--dst mail.ngo.org/32 --transport-proto 6 --dst-port 110
--said tun.135@mail.ngo.org</p>

<p>sets up an eroute on on a Security Gateway to protect
only TCP traffic on port 110 (pop3) between the subnet
company.com with 24 bits of subnet mask and the host
ftp.ngo.org via Security Gateway mail.ngo.org using the
Security Association with Security Association ID
tun0x135@mail.ngo.org. Note that any other traffic bound for
mail.ngo.org that is routed via the ipsec device will be
dropped. If you wish to allow other traffic to pass through
then you must add a %pass rule. For example the following
rule when combined with the above will ensure that POP3
messages read from mail.ngo.org will be encrypted but all
other traffic to/from mail.ngo.org will be in clear
text.</p>

<p>ipsec eroute --add --eraf inet --src company.com/24
--dst mail.ngo.org/32 --said %pass</p>
