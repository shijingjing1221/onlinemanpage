<p>PERLVAR(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLVAR(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlvar - Perl predefined variables</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Predefined Names The following names have
special meaning to Perl. Most punctuation names have
reasonable mnemonics, or analogs in the shells.
Nevertheless, if you wish to use long variable names, you
need only say</p>

<p>use English;</p>

<p>at the top of your program. This aliases all the short
names to the long names in the current package. Some even
have medium names, generally borrowed from awk. In general,
its best to use the</p>

<p>use English &rsquo;-no_match_vars&rsquo;;</p>

<p>invocation if you don t need $PREMATCH, $MATCH, or
$POSTMATCH, as it avoids a certain performance hit with the
use of regular expressions. See English.</p>

<p>Variables that depend on the currently selected
filehandle may be set by calling an appropriate object
method on the IO::Handle object, although this is less
efficient than using the regular built-in variables.
(Summary lines below for this contain the word HANDLE.)
First you must say</p>

<p>use IO::Handle;</p>

<p>after which you may use either</p>

<p>method HANDLE EXPR</p>

<p>or more safely,</p>

<p>HANDLE-&gt;method(EXPR)</p>

<p>Each method returns the old value of the IO::Handle
attribute. The methods each take an optional EXPR, which, if
supplied, specifies the new value for the IO::Handle
attribute in question. If not supplied, most methods do
nothing to the current value--except for autoflush(), which
will assume a 1 for you, just to be different.</p>

<p>Because loading in the IO::Handle class is an expensive
operation, you should learn how to use the regular built-in
variables.</p>

<p>A few of these variables are considered
&quot;read-only&quot;. This means that if you try to assign
to this variable, either directly or indirectly through a
reference, youll raise a run-time exception.</p>

<p>You should be very careful when modifying the default
values of most special variables described in this document.
In most cases you want to localize these variables before
changing them, since if you dont, the change may affect
other modules which rely on the default values of the
special variables that you have changed. This is one of the
correct ways to read the whole file at once:</p>

<p>open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die
$!; local $/; # enable localized slurp mode my $content =
&lt;$fh&gt;; close $fh;</p>

<p>But the following code is quite bad:</p>

<p>open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die
$!; undef $/; # enable slurp mode my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
close $fh;</p>

<p>since some other module, may want to read data from some
file in the default &quot;line mode&quot;, so if the code we
have just presented has been executed, the global value of
$/ is now changed for any other code running inside the same
Perl interpreter.</p>

<p>Usually when a variable is localized you want to make
sure that this change affects the shortest scope possible.
So unless you are already inside some short &quot;{}&quot;
block, you should create one yourself. For example:</p>

<p>my $content = &rsquo;&rsquo;; open my $fh,
&quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!; { local $/;
$content = &lt;$fh&gt;; } close $fh;</p>

<p>Here is an example of how your own code can go
broken:</p>

<p>for (1..5){ nasty_break(); print &quot;$_ &quot;; } sub
nasty_break { $_ = 5; # do something with $_ }</p>

<p>You probably expect this code to print:</p>

<p>1 2 3 4 5</p>

<p>but instead you get:</p>

<p>5 5 5 5 5</p>

<p>Why? Because nasty_break() modifies $_ without
localizing it first. The fix is to add local():</p>

<p>local $_ = 5;</p>

<p>It s easy to notice the problem in such a short example,
but in more complicated code you are looking for trouble if
you don t localize changes to the special variables.</p>

<p>The following list is ordered by scalar variables first,
then the arrays, then the hashes.</p>

<p>$ARG $_ The default input and pattern-searching space.
The following pairs are equivalent:</p>

<p>while (&lt;&gt;) {...} # equivalent only in while! while
(defined($_ = &lt;&gt;)) {...}</p>

<p>/^Subject:/ $_ =~ /^Subject:/</p>

<p>tr/a-z/A-Z/ $_ =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/</p>

<p>chomp chomp($_)</p>

<p>Here are the places where Perl will assume $_ even if
you dont use it:</p>

<p>&middot; The following functions:</p>

<p>abs, alarm, chomp, chop, chr, chroot, cos, defined,
eval, exp, glob, hex, int, lc, lcfirst, length, log, lstat,
mkdir, oct, ord, pos, print, quotemeta, readlink, readpipe,
ref, require, reverse (in scalar context only), rmdir, sin,
split (on its second argument), sqrt, stat, study, uc,
ucfirst, unlink, unpack.</p>

<p>&middot; All file tests (&quot;-f&quot;, &quot;-d&quot;)
except for &quot;-t&quot;, which defaults to STDIN. See
&quot;-X&quot; in perlfunc</p>

<p>&middot; The pattern matching operations
&quot;m//&quot;, &quot;s///&quot; and &quot;tr///&quot; (aka
&quot;y///&quot;) when used without an &quot;=~&quot;
operator.</p>

<p>&middot; The default iterator variable in a
&quot;foreach&quot; loop if no other variable is
supplied.</p>

<p>&middot; The implicit iterator variable in the grep()
and map() functions.</p>

<p>&middot; The implicit variable of given().</p>

<p>&middot; The default place to put an input record when a
&quot;&lt;FH&gt;&quot; operations result is tested by itself
as the sole criterion of a &quot;while&quot; test. Outside a
&quot;while&quot; test, this will not happen.</p>

<p>As $_ is a global variable, this may lead in some cases
to unwanted side-effects. As of perl 5.9.1, you can now use
a lexical version of $_ by declaring it in a file or in a
block with &quot;my&quot;. Moreover, declaring &quot;our
$_&quot; restores the global $_ in the current scope.</p>

<p>(Mnemonic: underline is understood in certain
operations.)</p>

<p>$a $b Special package variables when using sort(), see
&quot;sort&quot; in perlfunc. Because of this specialness $a
and $b dont need to be declared (using use vars, or our())
even when using the &quot;strict &rsquo;vars&rsquo;&quot;
pragma. Dont lexicalize them with &quot;my $a&quot; or
&quot;my $b&quot; if you want to be able to use them in the
sort() comparison block or function.</p>

<p>$&lt;digits&gt; Contains the subpattern from the
corresponding set of capturing parentheses from the last
pattern match, not counting patterns matched in nested
blocks that have been exited already. (Mnemonic: like
igits.) These variables are all read-only and dynamically
scoped to the current BLOCK.</p>

<p>$MATCH $&amp; The string matched by the last successful
pattern match (not counting any matches hidden within a
BLOCK or eval() enclosed by the current BLOCK). (Mnemonic:
like &amp; in some editors.) This variable is read-only and
dynamically scoped to the current BLOCK.</p>

<p>The use of this variable anywhere in a program imposes a
considerable performance penalty on all regular expression
matches. See &quot;BUGS&quot;.</p>

<p>See &quot;@-&quot; for a replacement.</p>

<p>${^MATCH} This is similar to $&amp; ($MATCH) except that
it does not incur the performance penalty associated with
that variable, and is only guaranteed to return a defined
value when the pattern was compiled or executed with the
&quot;/p&quot; modifier.</p>

<p>$PREMATCH &quot;$&lsquo;&quot; The string preceding
whatever was matched by the last successful pattern match
(not counting any matches hidden within a BLOCK or eval
enclosed by the current BLOCK). (Mnemonic:
&quot;&lsquo;&quot; often precedes a quoted string.) This
variable is read-only.</p>

<p>The use of this variable anywhere in a program imposes a
considerable performance penalty on all regular expression
matches. See &quot;BUGS&quot;.</p>

<p>See &quot;@-&quot; for a replacement.</p>

<p>${^PREMATCH} This is similar to &quot;$&lsquo;&quot;
($PREMATCH) except that it does not incur the performance
penalty associated with that variable, and is only
guaranteed to return a defined value when the pattern was
compiled or executed with the &quot;/p&quot; modifier.</p>

<p>$POSTMATCH &quot;$&rsquo;&quot; The string following
whatever was matched by the last successful pattern match
(not counting any matches hidden within a BLOCK or eval()
enclosed by the current BLOCK). (Mnemonic:
&quot;&rsquo;&quot; often follows a quoted string.)
Example:</p>

<p>local $_ = &rsquo;abcdefghi&rsquo;; /def/; print
&quot;$&lsquo;:$&amp;:$&rsquo;0; # prints abc:def:ghi</p>

<p>This variable is read-only and dynamically scoped to the
current BLOCK.</p>

<p>The use of this variable anywhere in a program imposes a
considerable performance penalty on all regular expression
matches. See &quot;BUGS&quot;.</p>

<p>See &quot;@-&quot; for a replacement.</p>

<p>${^POSTMATCH} This is similar to &quot;$&rsquo;&quot;
($POSTMATCH) except that it does not incur the performance
penalty associated with that variable, and is only
guaranteed to return a defined value when the pattern was
compiled or executed with the &quot;/p&quot; modifier.</p>

<p>$LAST_PAREN_MATCH $+ The text matched by the last
bracket of the last successful search pattern. This is
useful if you don t know which one of a set of alternative
patterns matched. For example:</p>

<p>/Version: (.*)|Revision: (.*)/ &amp;&amp; ($rev =
$+);</p>

<p>(Mnemonic: be positive and forward looking.) This
variable is read-only and dynamically scoped to the current
BLOCK.</p>

<p>$LAST_SUBMATCH_RESULT $^N The text matched by the used
group most-recently closed (i.e. the group with the
rightmost closing parenthesis) of the last successful search
pattern. (Mnemonic: the (possibly) Nested parenthesis that
most recently closed.)</p>

<p>This is primarily used inside &quot;(?{...})&quot;
blocks for examining text recently matched. For example, to
effectively capture text to a variable (in addition to $1,
$2, etc.), replace &quot;(...)&quot; with</p>

<p>(?:(...)(?{ $var = $^N }))</p>

<p>By setting and then using $var in this way relieves you
from having to worry about exactly which numbered set of
parentheses they are.</p>

<p>This variable is dynamically scoped to the current
BLOCK.</p>

<p>@LAST_MATCH_END @+ This array holds the offsets of the
ends of the last successful submatches in the currently
active dynamic scope. $+[0] is the offset into the string of
the end of the entire match. This is the same value as what
the &quot;pos&quot; function returns when called on the
variable that was matched against. The nth element of this
array holds the offset of the nth submatch, so $+[1] is the
offset past where $1 ends, $+[2] the offset past where $2
ends, and so on. You can use $#+ to determine how many
subgroups were in the last successful match. See the
examples given for the &quot;@-&quot; variable.</p>

<p>%LAST_PAREN_MATCH %+ Similar to &quot;@+&quot;, the
&quot;%+&quot; hash allows access to the named capture
buffers, should they exist, in the last successful match in
the currently active dynamic scope.</p>

<p>For example, $+{foo} is equivalent to $1 after the
following match:</p>

<p>&rsquo;foo&rsquo; =~ /(?&lt;foo&gt;foo)/;</p>

<p>The keys of the &quot;%+&quot; hash list only the names
of buffers that have captured (and that are thus associated
to defined values).</p>

<p>The underlying behaviour of &quot;%+&quot; is provided
by the Tie::Hash::NamedCapture module.</p>

<p>Note: &quot;%-&quot; and &quot;%+&quot; are tied views
into a common internal hash associated with the last
successful regular expression. Therefore mixing iterative
access to them via &quot;each&quot; may have unpredictable
results. Likewise, if the last successful match changes,
then the results may be surprising.</p>

<p>HANDLE-&gt;input_line_number(EXPR) $INPUT_LINE_NUMBER
$NR $. Current line number for the last filehandle
accessed.</p>

<p>Each filehandle in Perl counts the number of lines that
have been read from it. (Depending on the value of $/, Perls
idea of what constitutes a line may not match yours.) When a
line is read from a filehandle (via readline() or
&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;), or when tell() or seek() is called on
it, $. becomes an alias to the line counter for that
filehandle.</p>

<p>You can adjust the counter by assigning to $., but this
will not actually move the seek pointer. Localizing $. will
not localize the filehandles line count. Instead, it will
localize perls notion of which filehandle $. is currently
aliased to.</p>

<p>$. is reset when the filehandle is closed, but not when
an open filehandle is reopened without an intervening
close(). For more details, see &quot;I/O Operators&quot; in
perlop. Because &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; never does an explicit
close, line numbers increase across ARGV files (but see
examples in &quot;eof&quot; in perlfunc).</p>

<p>You can also use
&quot;HANDLE-&gt;input_line_number(EXPR)&quot; to access the
line counter for a given filehandle without having to worry
about which handle you last accessed.</p>

<p>(Mnemonic: many programs use &quot;.&quot; to mean the
current line number.)</p>

<p>IO::Handle-&gt;input_record_separator(EXPR)
$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR $RS $/ The input record separator,
newline by default. This influences Perls idea of what a
&quot;line&quot; is. Works like awks RS variable, including
treating empty lines as a terminator if set to the null
string. (An empty line cannot contain any spaces or tabs.)
You may set it to a multi-character string to match a
multi-character terminator, or to &quot;undef&quot; to read
through the end of file. Setting it to &quot;0 means
something slightly different than setting to &quot;&quot;,
if the file contains consecutive empty lines. Setting to
&quot;&quot; will treat two or more consecutive empty lines
as a single empty line. Setting to &quot;0 will blindly
assume that the next input character belongs to the next
paragraph, even if its a newline. (Mnemonic: / delimits line
boundaries when quoting poetry.)</p>

<p>local $/; # enable &quot;slurp&quot; mode local $_ =
&lt;FH&gt;; # whole file now here s/]+/ /g;</p>

<p>Remember: the value of $/ is a string, not a regex. awk
has to be better for something. :-)</p>

<p>Setting $/ to a reference to an integer, scalar
containing an integer, or scalar thats convertible to an
integer will attempt to read records instead of lines, with
the maximum record size being the referenced integer. So
this:</p>

<p>local $/ = 32768; # or open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;,
$myfile or die $!; local $_ = &lt;$fh&gt;;</p>

<p>will read a record of no more than 32768 bytes from
FILE. If you re not reading from a record-oriented file (or
your OS doesnt have record-oriented files), then you ll
likely get a full chunk of data with every read. If a record
is larger than the record size youve set, youll get the
record back in pieces. Trying to set the record size to zero
or less will cause reading in the (rest of the) whole
file.</p>

<p>On VMS, record reads are done with the equivalent of
&quot;sysread&quot;, so its best not to mix record and
non-record reads on the same file. (This is unlikely to be a
problem, because any file you d want to read in record mode
is probably unusable in line mode.) Non-VMS systems do
normal I/O, so its safe to mix record and non-record reads
of a file.</p>

<p>See also &quot;Newlines&quot; in perlport. Also see
$..</p>

<p>HANDLE-&gt;autoflush(EXPR) $OUTPUT_AUTOFLUSH $| If set
to nonzero, forces a flush right away and after every write
or print on the currently selected output channel. Default
is 0 (regardless of whether the channel is really buffered
by the system or not; $| tells you only whether youve asked
Perl explicitly to flush after each write). STDOUT will
typically be line buffered if output is to the terminal and
block buffered otherwise. Setting this variable is useful
primarily when you are outputting to a pipe or socket, such
as when you are running a Perl program under rsh and want to
see the output as its happening. This has no effect on input
buffering. See &quot;getc&quot; in perlfunc for that. See
&quot;select&quot; in perldoc on how to select the output
channel. See also IO::Handle. (Mnemonic: when you want your
pipes to be piping hot.)</p>

<p>IO::Handle-&gt;output_field_separator EXPR
$OUTPUT_FIELD_SEPARATOR $OFS $, The output field separator
for the print operator. If defined, this value is printed
between each of prints arguments. Default is
&quot;undef&quot;. (Mnemonic: what is printed when there is
a &quot;,&quot; in your print statement.)</p>

<p>IO::Handle-&gt;output_record_separator EXPR
$OUTPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR $ORS $ The output record separator
for the print operator. If defined, this value is printed
after the last of prints arguments. Default is
&quot;undef&quot;. (Mnemonic: you set &quot;$ instead of
adding &quot;0 at the end of the print. Also, its just like
$/, but its what you get &quot;back&quot; from Perl.)</p>

<p>$LIST_SEPARATOR $&quot; This is like $, except that it
applies to array and slice values interpolated into a
double-quoted string (or similar interpreted string).
Default is a space. (Mnemonic: obvious, I think.)</p>

<p>$SUBSCRIPT_SEPARATOR $SUBSEP $; The subscript separator
for multidimensional array emulation. If you refer to a hash
element as</p>

<p>$foo{$a,$b,$c}</p>

<p>it really means</p>

<p>$foo{join($;, $a, $b, $c)}</p>

<p>But dont put</p>

<p>@foo{$a,$b,$c} # a slice--note the @</p>

<p>which means</p>

<p>($foo{$a},$foo{$b},$foo{$c})</p>

<p>Default is &quot; 34&quot;, the same as SUBSEP in awk.
If your keys contain binary data there might not be any safe
value for $;. (Mnemonic: comma (the syntactic subscript
separator) is a semi- semicolon. Yeah, I know, its pretty
lame, but $, is already taken for something more
important.)</p>

<p>Consider using &quot;real&quot; multidimensional arrays
as described in perllol.</p>

<p>HANDLE-&gt;format_page_number(EXPR) $FORMAT_PAGE_NUMBER
$% The current page number of the currently selected output
channel. Used with formats. (Mnemonic: % is page number in
nroff.)</p>

<p>HANDLE-&gt;format_lines_per_page(EXPR)
$FORMAT_LINES_PER_PAGE $= The current page length (printable
lines) of the currently selected output channel. Default is
60. Used with formats. (Mnemonic: = has horizontal
lines.)</p>

<p>HANDLE-&gt;format_lines_left(EXPR) $FORMAT_LINES_LEFT $-
The number of lines left on the page of the currently
selected output channel. Used with formats. (Mnemonic:
lines_on_page - lines_printed.)</p>

<p>@LAST_MATCH_START @- $-[0] is the offset of the start of
the last successful match. &quot;$-[&quot;n&quot;]&quot; is
the offset of the start of the substring matched by n-th
subpattern, or undef if the subpattern did not match.</p>

<p>Thus after a match against $_, $&amp; coincides with
&quot;substr $_, $-[0], $+[0] - $-[0]&quot;. Similarly, $n
coincides with &quot;substr $_, $-[n], $+[n] - $-[n]&quot;
if &quot;$-[n]&quot; is defined, and $+ coincides with
&quot;substr $_, $-[$#-], $+[$#-] - $-[$#-]&quot;. One can
use &quot;$#-&quot; to find the last matched subgroup in the
last successful match. Contrast with $#+, the number of
subgroups in the regular expression. Compare with
&quot;@+&quot;.</p>

<p>This array holds the offsets of the beginnings of the
last successful submatches in the currently active dynamic
scope. &quot;$-[0]&quot; is the offset into the string of
the beginning of the entire match. The nth element of this
array holds the offset of the nth submatch, so
&quot;$-[1]&quot; is the offset where $1 begins,
&quot;$-[2]&quot; the offset where $2 begins, and so on.</p>

<p>After a match against some variable $var:</p>

<p>&quot;$&lsquo;&quot; is the same as &quot;substr($var,
0, $-[0])&quot; $&amp; is the same as &quot;substr($var,
$-[0], $+[0] - $-[0])&quot; &quot;$&rsquo;&quot; is the same
as &quot;substr($var, $+[0])&quot; $1 is the same as
&quot;substr($var, $-[1], $+[1] - $-[1])&quot; $2 is the
same as &quot;substr($var, $-[2], $+[2] - $-[2])&quot; $3 is
the same as &quot;substr($var, $-[3], $+[3] - $-[3])&quot;
%- Similar to &quot;%+&quot;, this variable allows access to
the named capture buffers in the last successful match in
the currently active dynamic scope. To each capture buffer
name found in the regular expression, it associates a
reference to an array containing the list of values captured
by all buffers with that name (should there be several of
them), in the order where they appear.</p>

<p>Heres an example:</p>

<p>if (&rsquo;1234&rsquo; =~
/(?&lt;A&gt;1)(?&lt;B&gt;2)(?&lt;A&gt;3)(?&lt;B&gt;4)/) {
foreach my $bufname (sort keys %-) { my $ary = $-{$bufname};
foreach my $idx (0..$#$ary) { print &quot;{$bufname}[$idx] :
&quot;, (defined($ary-&gt;[$idx]) ?
&quot;&rsquo;$ary-&gt;[$idx]&rsquo;&quot; :
&quot;undef&quot;), &quot;0; } } }</p>

<p>would print out:</p>

<p>$-{A}[0] : &rsquo;1&rsquo; $-{A}[1] : &rsquo;3&rsquo;
$-{B}[0] : &rsquo;2&rsquo; $-{B}[1] : &rsquo;4&rsquo;</p>

<p>The keys of the &quot;%-&quot; hash correspond to all
buffer names found in the regular expression.</p>

<p>The behaviour of &quot;%-&quot; is implemented via the
Tie::Hash::NamedCapture module.</p>

<p>Note: &quot;%-&quot; and &quot;%+&quot; are tied views
into a common internal hash associated with the last
successful regular expression. Therefore mixing iterative
access to them via &quot;each&quot; may have unpredictable
results. Likewise, if the last successful match changes,
then the results may be surprising.</p>

<p>HANDLE-&gt;format_name(EXPR) $FORMAT_NAME $~ The name of
the current report format for the currently selected output
channel. Default is the name of the filehandle. (Mnemonic:
brother to $^.)</p>

<p>HANDLE-&gt;format_top_name(EXPR) $FORMAT_TOP_NAME $^ The
name of the current top-of-page format for the currently
selected output channel. Default is the name of the
filehandle with _TOP appended. (Mnemonic: points to top of
page.)</p>

<p>IO::Handle-&gt;format_line_break_characters EXPR
$FORMAT_LINE_BREAK_CHARACTERS $: The current set of
characters after which a string may be broken to fill
continuation fields (starting with ^) in a format. Default
is &quot; 0, to break on whitespace or hyphens. (Mnemonic: a
&quot;colon&quot; in poetry is a part of a line.)</p>

<p>IO::Handle-&gt;format_formfeed EXPR $FORMAT_FORMFEED $^L
What formats output as a form feed. Default is</p>

<p>$ACCUMULATOR $^A The current value of the write()
accumulator for format() lines. A format contains formline()
calls that put their result into $^A. After calling its
format, write() prints out the contents of $^A and empties.
So you never really see the contents of $^A unless you call
formline() yourself and then look at it. See perlform and
&quot;formline()&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>$CHILD_ERROR $? The status returned by the last pipe
close, backtick (&quot;&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;) command,
successful call to wait() or waitpid(), or from the system()
operator. This is just the 16-bit status word returned by
the traditional Unix wait() system call (or else is made up
to look like it). Thus, the exit value of the subprocess is
really (&quot;$? &gt;&gt; 8&quot;), and &quot;$? &amp;
127&quot; gives which signal, if any, the process died from,
and &quot;$? &amp; 128&quot; reports whether there was a
core dump. (Mnemonic: similar to sh and ksh.)</p>

<p>Additionally, if the &quot;h_errno&quot; variable is
supported in C, its value is returned via $? if any
&quot;gethost*()&quot; function fails.</p>

<p>If you have installed a signal handler for
&quot;SIGCHLD&quot;, the value of $? will usually be wrong
outside that handler.</p>

<p>Inside an &quot;END&quot; subroutine $? contains the
value that is going to be given to &quot;exit()&quot;. You
can modify $? in an &quot;END&quot; subroutine to change the
exit status of your program. For example:</p>

<p>END { $? = 1 if $? == 255; # die would make it 255 }</p>

<p>Under VMS, the pragma &quot;use vmsish
&rsquo;status&rsquo;&quot; makes $? reflect the actual VMS
exit status, instead of the default emulation of POSIX
status; see &quot;$?&quot; in perlvms for details.</p>

<p>Also see &quot;Error Indicators&quot;.</p>

<p>${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE} The native status returned by the
last pipe close, backtick (&quot;&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;)
command, successful call to wait() or waitpid(), or from the
system() operator. On POSIX-like systems this value can be
decoded with the WIFEXITED, WEXITSTATUS, WIFSIGNALED,
WTERMSIG, WIFSTOPPED, WSTOPSIG and WIFCONTINUED functions
provided by the POSIX module.</p>

<p>Under VMS this reflects the actual VMS exit status; i.e.
it is the same as $? when the pragma &quot;use vmsish
&rsquo;status&rsquo;&quot; is in effect.</p>

<p>${^ENCODING} The object reference to the Encode object
that is used to convert the source code to Unicode. Thanks
to this variable your perl script does not have to be
written in UTF-8. Default is undef. The direct manipulation
of this variable is highly discouraged.</p>

<p>$OS_ERROR $ERRNO $! If used numerically, yields the
current value of the C &quot;errno&quot; variable, or in
other words, if a system or library call fails, it sets this
variable. This means that the value of $! is meaningful only
immediately after a failure:</p>

<p>if (open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, $filename) { # Here
$! is meaningless. ... } else { # ONLY here is $!
meaningful. ... # Already here $! might be meaningless. } #
Since here we might have either success or failure, # here
$! is meaningless.</p>

<p>In the above meaningless stands for anything: zero,
non-zero, &quot;undef&quot;. A successful system or library
call does not set the variable to zero.</p>

<p>If used as a string, yields the corresponding system
error string. You can assign a number to $! to set errno if,
for instance, you want &quot;$!&quot; to return the string
for error n, or you want to set the exit value for the die()
operator. (Mnemonic: What just went bang?)</p>

<p>Also see &quot;Error Indicators&quot;.</p>

<p>%OS_ERROR %ERRNO %! Each element of &quot;%!&quot; has a
true value only if $! is set to that value. For example,
$!{ENOENT} is true if and only if the current value of $! is
&quot;ENOENT&quot;; that is, if the most recent error was
&quot;No such file or directory&quot; (or its moral
equivalent: not all operating systems give that exact error,
and certainly not all languages). To check if a particular
key is meaningful on your system, use &quot;exists
$!{the_key}&quot;; for a list of legal keys, use &quot;keys
%!&quot;. See Errno for more information, and also see above
for the validity of $!.</p>

<p>$EXTENDED_OS_ERROR $^E Error information specific to the
current operating system. At the moment, this differs from
$! under only VMS, OS/2, and Win32 (and for MacPerl). On all
other platforms, $^E is always just the same as $!.</p>

<p>Under VMS, $^E provides the VMS status value from the
last system error. This is more specific information about
the last system error than that provided by $!. This is
particularly important when $! is set to EVMSERR.</p>

<p>Under OS/2, $^E is set to the error code of the last
call to OS/2 API either via CRT, or directly from perl.</p>

<p>Under Win32, $^E always returns the last error
information reported by the Win32 call
&quot;GetLastError()&quot; which describes the last error
from within the Win32 API. Most Win32-specific code will
report errors via $^E. ANSI C and Unix-like calls set
&quot;errno&quot; and so most portable Perl code will report
errors via $!.</p>

<p>Caveats mentioned in the description of $! generally
apply to $^E, also. (Mnemonic: Extra error explanation.)</p>

<p>Also see &quot;Error Indicators&quot;.</p>

<p>$EVAL_ERROR $@ The Perl syntax error message from the
last eval() operator. If $@ is the null string, the last
eval() parsed and executed correctly (although the
operations you invoked may have failed in the normal
fashion). (Mnemonic: Where was the syntax error
&quot;at&quot;?)</p>

<p>Warning messages are not collected in this variable. You
can, however, set up a routine to process warnings by
setting $SIG{__WARN__} as described below.</p>

<p>Also see &quot;Error Indicators&quot;.</p>

<p>$PROCESS_ID $PID $$ The process number of the Perl
running this script. You should consider this variable
read-only, although it will be altered across fork() calls.
(Mnemonic: same as shells.)</p>

<p>Note for Linux users: on Linux, the C functions
&quot;getpid()&quot; and &quot;getppid()&quot; return
different values from different threads. In order to be
portable, this behavior is not reflected by $$, whose value
remains consistent across threads. If you want to call the
underlying &quot;getpid()&quot;, you may use the CPAN module
&quot;Linux::Pid&quot;.</p>

<p>$REAL_USER_ID $UID $&lt; The real uid of this process.
(Mnemonic: its the uid you came from, if youre running
setuid.) You can change both the real uid and the effective
uid at the same time by using POSIX::setuid(). Since changes
to $&lt; require a system call, check $! after a change
attempt to detect any possible errors.</p>

<p>$EFFECTIVE_USER_ID $EUID $&gt; The effective uid of this
process. Example:</p>

<p>$&lt; = $&gt;; # set real to effective uid ($&lt;,$&gt;)
= ($&gt;,$&lt;); # swap real and effective uid</p>

<p>You can change both the effective uid and the real uid
at the same time by using POSIX::setuid(). Changes to $&gt;
require a check to $! to detect any possible errors after an
attempted change.</p>

<p>(Mnemonic: it s the uid you went to, if youre running
setuid.) $&lt; and $&gt; can be swapped only on machines
supporting setreuid().</p>

<p>$REAL_GROUP_ID $GID $( The real gid of this process. If
you are on a machine that supports membership in multiple
groups simultaneously, gives a space separated list of
groups you are in. The first number is the one returned by
getgid(), and the subsequent ones by getgroups(), one of
which may be the same as the first number.</p>

<p>However, a value assigned to $( must be a single number
used to set the real gid. So the value given by $( should
not be assigned back to $( without being forced numeric,
such as by adding zero. Note that this is different to the
effective gid ($)) which does take a list.</p>

<p>You can change both the real gid and the effective gid
at the same time by using POSIX::setgid(). Changes to $(
require a check to $! to detect any possible errors after an
attempted change.</p>

<p>(Mnemonic: parentheses are used to group things. The
real gid is the group you left, if youre running
setgid.)</p>

<p>$EFFECTIVE_GROUP_ID $EGID $) The effective gid of this
process. If you are on a machine that supports membership in
multiple groups simultaneously, gives a space separated list
of groups you are in. The first number is the one returned
by getegid(), and the subsequent ones by getgroups(), one of
which may be the same as the first number.</p>

<p>Similarly, a value assigned to $) must also be a space-
separated list of numbers. The first number sets the
effective gid, and the rest (if any) are passed to
setgroups(). To get the effect of an empty list for
setgroups(), just repeat the new effective gid; that is, to
force an effective gid of 5 and an effectively empty
setgroups() list, say &quot; $) = &quot;5 5&quot;
&quot;.</p>

<p>You can change both the effective gid and the real gid
at the same time by using POSIX::setgid() (use only a single
numeric argument). Changes to $) require a check to $! to
detect any possible errors after an attempted change.</p>

<p>(Mnemonic: parentheses are used to group things. The
effective gid is the group thats right for you, if youre
running setgid.)</p>

<p>$&lt;, $&gt;, $( and $) can be set only on machines that
support the corresponding set[re][ug]id() routine. $( and $)
can be swapped only on machines supporting setregid().</p>

<p>$PROGRAM_NAME $0 Contains the name of the program being
executed.</p>

<p>On some (read: not all) operating systems assigning to
$0 modifies the argument area that the &quot;ps&quot;
program sees. On some platforms you may have to use special
&quot;ps&quot; options or a different &quot;ps&quot; to see
the changes. Modifying the $0 is more useful as a way of
indicating the current program state than it is for hiding
the program you re running. (Mnemonic: same as sh and
ksh.)</p>

<p>Note that there are platform specific limitations on the
maximum length of $0. In the most extreme case it may be
limited to the space occupied by the original $0.</p>

<p>In some platforms there may be arbitrary amount of
padding, for example space characters, after the modified
name as shown by &quot;ps&quot;. In some platforms this
padding may extend all the way to the original length of the
argument area, no matter what you do (this is the case for
example with Linux 2.2).</p>

<p>Note for BSD users: setting $0 does not completely
remove &quot;perl&quot; from the ps(1) output. For example,
setting $0 to &quot;foobar&quot; may result in &quot;perl:
foobar (perl)&quot; (whether both the &quot;perl: &quot;
prefix and the &quot; (perl)&quot; suffix are shown depends
on your exact BSD variant and version). This is an operating
system feature, Perl cannot help it.</p>

<p>In multithreaded scripts Perl coordinates the threads so
that any thread may modify its copy of the $0 and the change
becomes visible to ps(1) (assuming the operating system
plays along). Note that the view of $0 the other threads
have will not change since they have their own copies of
it.</p>

<p>If the program has been given to perl via the switches
&quot;-e&quot; or &quot;-E&quot;, $0 will contain the string
&quot;-e&quot;.</p>

<p>$[ The index of the first element in an array, and of
the first character in a substring. Default is 0, but you
could theoretically set it to 1 to make Perl behave more
like awk (or Fortran) when subscripting and when evaluating
the index() and substr() functions. (Mnemonic: [ begins
subscripts.)</p>

<p>As of release 5 of Perl, assignment to $[ is treated as
a compiler directive, and cannot influence the behavior of
any other file. (That s why you can only assign compile-time
constants to it.) Its use is highly discouraged.</p>

<p>Note that, unlike other compile-time directives (such as
strict), assignment to $[ can be seen from outer lexical
scopes in the same file. However, you can use local() on it
to strictly bind its value to a lexical block.</p>

<p>$] The version + patchlevel / 1000 of the Perl
interpreter. This variable can be used to determine whether
the Perl interpreter executing a script is in the right
range of versions. (Mnemonic: Is this version of perl in the
right bracket?) Example:</p>

<p>warn &quot;No checksumming!0 if $] &lt; 3.019;</p>

<p>See also the documentation of &quot;use VERSION&quot;
and &quot;require VERSION&quot; for a convenient way to fail
if the running Perl interpreter is too old.</p>

<p>The floating point representation can sometimes lead to
inaccurate numeric comparisons. See $^V for a more modern
representation of the Perl version that allows accurate
string comparisons.</p>

<p>$COMPILING $^C The current value of the flag associated
with the -c switch. Mainly of use with -MO=... to allow code
to alter its behavior when being compiled, such as for
example to AUTOLOAD at compile time rather than normal,
deferred loading. Setting &quot;$^C = 1&quot; is similar to
calling &quot;B::minus_c&quot;.</p>

<p>$DEBUGGING $^D The current value of the debugging flags.
(Mnemonic: value of -D switch.) May be read or set. Like its
command-line equivalent, you can use numeric or symbolic
values, eg &quot;$^D = 10&quot; or &quot;$^D =
&quot;st&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>${^RE_DEBUG_FLAGS} The current value of the regex
debugging flags. Set to 0 for no debug output even when the
re debug module is loaded. See re for details.</p>

<p>${^RE_TRIE_MAXBUF} Controls how certain regex
optimisations are applied and how much memory they utilize.
This value by default is 65536 which corresponds to a 512kB
temporary cache. Set this to a higher value to trade memory
for speed when matching large alternations. Set it to a
lower value if you want the optimisations to be as
conservative of memory as possible but still occur, and set
it to a negative value to prevent the optimisation and
conserve the most memory. Under normal situations this
variable should be of no interest to you.</p>

<p>$SYSTEM_FD_MAX $^F The maximum system file descriptor,
ordinarily 2. System file descriptors are passed to exec()ed
processes, while higher file descriptors are not. Also,
during an open(), system file descriptors are preserved even
if the open() fails. (Ordinary file descriptors are closed
before the open() is attempted.) The close-on-exec status of
a file descriptor will be decided according to the value of
$^F when the corresponding file, pipe, or socket was opened,
not the time of the exec().</p>

<p>$^H WARNING: This variable is strictly for internal use
only. Its availability, behavior, and contents are subject
to change without notice.</p>

<p>This variable contains compile-time hints for the Perl
interpreter. At the end of compilation of a BLOCK the value
of this variable is restored to the value when the
interpreter started to compile the BLOCK.</p>

<p>When perl begins to parse any block construct that
provides a lexical scope (e.g., eval body, required file,
subroutine body, loop body, or conditional block), the
existing value of $^H is saved, but its value is left
unchanged. When the compilation of the block is completed,
it regains the saved value. Between the points where its
value is saved and restored, code that executes within BEGIN
blocks is free to change the value of $^H.</p>

<p>This behavior provides the semantic of lexical scoping,
and is used in, for instance, the &quot;use strict&quot;
pragma.</p>

<p>The contents should be an integer; different bits of it
are used for different pragmatic flags. Here s an
example:</p>

<p>sub add_100 { $^H |= 0x100 }</p>

<p>sub foo { BEGIN { add_100() } bar-&gt;baz($boon); }</p>

<p>Consider what happens during execution of the BEGIN
block. At this point the BEGIN block has already been
compiled, but the body of foo() is still being compiled. The
new value of $^H will therefore be visible only while the
body of foo() is being compiled.</p>

<p>Substitution of the above BEGIN block with:</p>

<p>BEGIN { require strict;
strict-&gt;import(&rsquo;vars&rsquo;) }</p>

<p>demonstrates how &quot;use strict
&rsquo;vars&rsquo;&quot; is implemented. Heres a conditional
version of the same lexical pragma:</p>

<p>BEGIN { require strict;
strict-&gt;import(&rsquo;vars&rsquo;) if $condition }</p>

<p>%^H The %^H hash provides the same scoping semantic as
$^H. This makes it useful for implementation of lexically
scoped pragmas. See perlpragma.</p>

<p>$INPLACE_EDIT $^I The current value of the inplace-edit
extension. Use &quot;undef&quot; to disable inplace editing.
(Mnemonic: value of -i switch.)</p>

<p>$^M By default, running out of memory is an untrappable,
fatal error. However, if suitably built, Perl can use the
contents of $^M as an emergency memory pool after die()ing.
Suppose that your Perl were compiled with
&quot;-DPERL_EMERGENCY_SBRK&quot; and used Perls malloc.
Then</p>

<p>$^M = &rsquo;a&rsquo; x (1 &lt;&lt; 16);</p>

<p>would allocate a 64K buffer for use in an emergency. See
the INSTALL file in the Perl distribution for information on
how to add custom C compilation flags when compiling perl.
To discourage casual use of this advanced feature, there is
no English long name for this variable.</p>

<p>$OSNAME $^O The name of the operating system under which
this copy of Perl was built, as determined during the
configuration process. The value is identical to
$Config{&rsquo;osname&rsquo;}. See also Config and the -V
command-line switch documented in perlrun.</p>

<p>In Windows platforms, $^O is not very helpful: since it
is always &quot;MSWin32&quot;, it doesnt tell the difference
between 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/CE/.NET. Use Win32::GetOSName()
or Win32::GetOSVersion() (see Win32 and perlport) to
distinguish between the variants.</p>

<p>${^OPEN} An internal variable used by PerlIO. A string
in two parts, separated by a &quot; &quot; byte, the first
part describes the input layers, the second part describes
the output layers.</p>

<p>$PERLDB $^P The internal variable for debugging support.
The meanings of the various bits are subject to change, but
currently indicate:</p>

<p>0x01 Debug subroutine enter/exit.</p>

<p>0x02 Line-by-line debugging. Causes DB::DB() subroutine
to be called for each statement executed. Also causes saving
source code lines (like 0x400).</p>

<p>0x04 Switch off optimizations.</p>

<p>0x08 Preserve more data for future interactive
inspections.</p>

<p>0x10 Keep info about source lines on which a subroutine
is defined.</p>

<p>0x20 Start with single-step on.</p>

<p>0x40 Use subroutine address instead of name when
reporting.</p>

<p>0x80 Report &quot;goto &amp;subroutine&quot; as
well.</p>

<p>0x100 Provide informative &quot;file&quot; names for
evals based on the place they were compiled.</p>

<p>0x200 Provide informative names to anonymous subroutines
based on the place they were compiled.</p>

<p>0x400 Save source code lines into
&quot;@{&quot;_&lt;$filename&quot;}&quot;.</p>

<p>Some bits may be relevant at compile-time only, some at
run- time only. This is a new mechanism and the details may
change. See also perldebguts.</p>

<p>$LAST_REGEXP_CODE_RESULT $^R The result of evaluation of
the last successful &quot;(?{ code })&quot; regular
expression assertion (see perlre). May be written to.</p>

<p>$EXCEPTIONS_BEING_CAUGHT $^S Current state of the
interpreter.</p>

<p>$^S State --------- ------------------- undef Parsing
module/eval true (1) Executing an eval false (0)
Otherwise</p>

<p>The first state may happen in $SIG{__DIE__} and
$SIG{__WARN__} handlers.</p>

<p>$BASETIME $^T The time at which the program began
running, in seconds since the epoch (beginning of 1970). The
values returned by the -M, -A, and -C filetests are based on
this value.</p>

<p>${^TAINT} Reflects if taint mode is on or off. 1 for on
(the program was run with -T), 0 for off, -1 when only taint
warnings are enabled (i.e. with -t or -TU). This variable is
read-only.</p>

<p>${^UNICODE} Reflects certain Unicode settings of Perl.
See perlrun documentation for the &quot;-C&quot; switch for
more information about the possible values. This variable is
set during Perl startup and is thereafter read-only.</p>

<p>${^UTF8CACHE} This variable controls the state of the
internal UTF-8 offset caching code. 1 for on (the default),
0 for off, -1 to debug the caching code by checking all its
results against linear scans, and panicking on any
discrepancy.</p>

<p>${^UTF8LOCALE} This variable indicates whether an UTF-8
locale was detected by perl at startup. This information is
used by perl when its in adjust-utf8ness-to-locale mode (as
when run with the &quot;-CL&quot; command-line switch); see
perlrun for more info on this.</p>

<p>$PERL_VERSION $^V The revision, version, and subversion
of the Perl interpreter, represented as a
&quot;version&quot; object.</p>

<p>This variable first appeared in perl 5.6.0; earlier
versions of perl will see an undefined value. Before perl
5.10.0 $^V was represented as a v-string.</p>

<p>$^V can be used to determine whether the Perl
interpreter executing a script is in the right range of
versions. (Mnemonic: use ^V for Version Control.)
Example:</p>

<p>warn &quot;Hashes not randomized!0 if !$^V or $^V lt
v5.8.1</p>

<p>To convert $^V into its string representation use
sprintf()s &quot;%vd&quot; conversion:</p>

<p>printf &quot;version is v%vd0, $^V; # Perl&rsquo;s
version</p>

<p>See the documentation of &quot;use VERSION&quot; and
&quot;require VERSION&quot; for a convenient way to fail if
the running Perl interpreter is too old.</p>

<p>See also $] for an older representation of the Perl
version.</p>

<p>$WARNING $^W The current value of the warning switch,
initially true if -w was used, false otherwise, but directly
modifiable. (Mnemonic: related to the -w switch.) See also
warnings.</p>

<p>${^WARNING_BITS} The current set of warning checks
enabled by the &quot;use warnings&quot; pragma. See the
documentation of &quot;warnings&quot; for more details.</p>

<p>${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT} If this variable is set to a true
value, then stat() on Windows will not try to open the file.
This means that the link count cannot be determined and file
attributes may be out of date if additional hardlinks to the
file exist. On the other hand, not opening the file is
considerably faster, especially for files on network
drives.</p>

<p>This variable could be set in the sitecustomize.pl file
to configure the local Perl installation to use
&quot;sloppy&quot; stat() by default. See perlrun for more
information about site customization.</p>

<p>$EXECUTABLE_NAME $^X The name used to execute the
current copy of Perl, from Cs &quot;argv[0]&quot; or (where
supported) /proc/self/exe.</p>

<p>Depending on the host operating system, the value of $^X
may be a relative or absolute pathname of the perl program
file, or may be the string used to invoke perl but not the
pathname of the perl program file. Also, most operating
systems permit invoking programs that are not in the PATH
environment variable, so there is no guarantee that the
value of $^X is in PATH. For VMS, the value may or may not
include a version number.</p>

<p>You usually can use the value of $^X to re-invoke an
independent copy of the same perl that is currently running,
e.g.,</p>

<p>@first_run = &lsquo;$^X -le &quot;print int rand 100 for
1..100&quot;&lsquo;;</p>

<p>But recall that not all operating systems support
forking or capturing of the output of commands, so this
complex statement may not be portable.</p>

<p>It is not safe to use the value of $^X as a path name of
a file, as some operating systems that have a mandatory
suffix on executable files do not require use of the suffix
when invoking a command. To convert the value of $^X to a
path name, use the following statements:</p>

<p># Build up a set of file names (not command names). use
Config; $this_perl = $^X; if ($^O ne &rsquo;VMS&rsquo;)
{$this_perl .= $Config{_exe} unless $this_perl =~
m/$Config{_exe}$/i;}</p>

<p>Because many operating systems permit anyone with read
access to the Perl program file to make a copy of it, patch
the copy, and then execute the copy, the security-conscious
Perl programmer should take care to invoke the installed
copy of perl, not the copy referenced by $^X. The following
statements accomplish this goal, and produce a pathname that
can be invoked as a command or referenced as a file.</p>

<p>use Config; $secure_perl_path = $Config{perlpath}; if
($^O ne &rsquo;VMS&rsquo;) {$secure_perl_path .=
$Config{_exe} unless $secure_perl_path =~
m/$Config{_exe}$/i;}</p>

<p>ARGV The special filehandle that iterates over
command-line filenames in @ARGV. Usually written as the null
filehandle in the angle operator &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;. Note
that currently &quot;ARGV&quot; only has its magical effect
within the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; operator; elsewhere it is
just a plain filehandle corresponding to the last file
opened by &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;. In particular, passing
&quot;RGV&quot; as a parameter to a function that expects a
filehandle may not cause your function to automatically read
the contents of all the files in @ARGV.</p>

<p>$ARGV contains the name of the current file when reading
from &lt;&gt;.</p>

<p>@ARGV The array @ARGV contains the command-line
arguments intended for the script. $#ARGV is generally the
number of arguments minus one, because $ARGV[0] is the first
argument, not the programs command name itself. See $0 for
the command name.</p>

<p>ARGVOUT The special filehandle that points to the
currently open output file when doing edit-in-place
processing with -i. Useful when you have to do a lot of
inserting and dont want to keep modifying $_. See perlrun
for the -i switch.</p>

<p>@F The array @F contains the fields of each line read in
when autosplit mode is turned on. See perlrun for the -a
switch. This array is package-specific, and must be declared
or given a full package name if not in package main when
running under &quot;strict &rsquo;vars&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p>@INC The array @INC contains the list of places that the
&quot;do EXPR&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot;
constructs look for their library files. It initially
consists of the arguments to any -I command-line switches,
followed by the default Perl library, probably
/usr/local/lib/perl, followed by &quot;.&quot;, to represent
the current directory. (&quot;.&quot; will not be appended
if taint checks are enabled, either by &quot;-T&quot; or by
&quot;-t&quot;.) If you need to modify this at runtime, you
should use the &quot;use lib&quot; pragma to get the
machine-dependent library properly loaded also:</p>

<p>use lib &rsquo;/mypath/libdir/&rsquo;; use SomeMod;</p>

<p>You can also insert hooks into the file inclusion system
by putting Perl code directly into @INC. Those hooks may be
subroutine references, array references or blessed objects.
See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc for details.</p>

<p>@ARG @_ Within a subroutine the array @_ contains the
parameters passed to that subroutine. See perlsub.</p>

<p>%INC The hash %INC contains entries for each filename
included via the &quot;do&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, or
&quot;use&quot; operators. The key is the filename you
specified (with module names converted to pathnames), and
the value is the location of the file found. The
&quot;require&quot; operator uses this hash to determine
whether a particular file has already been included.</p>

<p>If the file was loaded via a hook (e.g. a subroutine
reference, see &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc for a
description of these hooks), this hook is by default
inserted into %INC in place of a filename. Note, however,
that the hook may have set the %INC entry by itself to
provide some more specific info.</p>

<p>%ENV $ENV{expr} The hash %ENV contains your current
environment. Setting a value in &quot;ENV&quot; changes the
environment for any child processes you subsequently fork()
off.</p>

<p>%SIG $SIG{expr} The hash %SIG contains signal handlers
for signals. For example:</p>

<p>sub handler { # 1st argument is signal name my($sig) =
@_; print &quot;Caught a SIG$sig--shutting down0;
close(LOG); exit(0); }</p>

<p>$SIG{&rsquo;INT&rsquo;} = handler;
$SIG{&rsquo;QUIT&rsquo;} = handler; ...
$SIG{&rsquo;INT&rsquo;} = &rsquo;DEFAULT&rsquo;; # restore
default action $SIG{&rsquo;QUIT&rsquo;} =
&rsquo;IGNORE&rsquo;; # ignore SIGQUIT</p>

<p>Using a value of &rsquo;IGNORE&rsquo; usually has the
effect of ignoring the signal, except for the
&quot;CHLD&quot; signal. See perlipc for more about this
special case.</p>

<p>Here are some other examples:</p>

<p>$SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = &quot;Plumber&quot;; # assumes
main::Plumber (not recommended) $SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} =
Plumber; # just fine; assume current Plumber
$SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = *Plumber; # somewhat esoteric
$SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = Plumber(); # oops, what did
Plumber() return??</p>

<p>Be sure not to use a bareword as the name of a signal
handler, lest you inadvertently call it.</p>

<p>If your system has the sigaction() function then signal
handlers are installed using it. This means you get reliable
signal handling.</p>

<p>The default delivery policy of signals changed in Perl
5.8.0 from immediate (also known as &quot;unsafe&quot;) to
deferred, also known as &quot;safe signals&quot;. See
perlipc for more information.</p>

<p>Certain internal hooks can be also set using the %SIG
hash. The routine indicated by $SIG{__WARN__} is called when
a warning message is about to be printed. The warning
message is passed as the first argument. The presence of a
&quot;__WARN__&quot; hook causes the ordinary printing of
warnings to &quot;STDERR&quot; to be suppressed. You can use
this to save warnings in a variable, or turn warnings into
fatal errors, like this:</p>

<p>local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { die $_[0] }; eval
$proggie;</p>

<p>As the &rsquo;IGNORE&rsquo; hook is not supported by
&quot;__WARN__&quot;, you can disable warnings using the
empty subroutine:</p>

<p>local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub {};</p>

<p>The routine indicated by $SIG{__DIE__} is called when a
fatal exception is about to be thrown. The error message is
passed as the first argument. When a &quot;__DIE__&quot;
hook routine returns, the exception processing continues as
it would have in the absence of the hook, unless the hook
routine itself exits via a &quot;goto&quot;, a loop exit, or
a &quot;die()&quot;. The &quot;__DIE__&quot; handler is
explicitly disabled during the call, so that you can die
from a &quot;__DIE__&quot; handler. Similarly for
&quot;__WARN__&quot;.</p>

<p>Due to an implementation glitch, the $SIG{__DIE__} hook
is called even inside an eval(). Do not use this to rewrite
a pending exception in $@, or as a bizarre substitute for
overriding &quot;CORE::GLOBAL::die()&quot;. This strange
action at a distance may be fixed in a future release so
that $SIG{__DIE__} is only called if your program is about
to exit, as was the original intent. Any other use is
deprecated.</p>

<p>&quot;__DIE__&quot;/&quot;__WARN__&quot; handlers are
very special in one respect: they may be called to report
(probable) errors found by the parser. In such a case the
parser may be in inconsistent state, so any attempt to
evaluate Perl code from such a handler will probably result
in a segfault. This means that warnings or errors that
result from parsing Perl should be used with extreme
caution, like this:</p>

<p>require Carp if defined $^S;
Carp::confess(&quot;Something wrong&quot;) if defined
&amp;Carp::confess; die &quot;Something wrong, but could not
load Carp to give backtrace... To see backtrace try starting
Perl with -MCarp switch&quot;;</p>

<p>Here the first line will load Carp unless it is the
parser who called the handler. The second line will print
backtrace and die if Carp was available. The third line will
be executed only if Carp was not available.</p>

<p>See &quot;die&quot; in perlfunc, &quot;warn&quot; in
perlfunc, &quot;eval&quot; in perlfunc, and warnings for
additional information.</p>

<p>Error Indicators The variables $@, $!, $^E, and $?
contain information about different types of error
conditions that may appear during execution of a Perl
program. The variables are shown ordered by the
&quot;distance&quot; between the subsystem which reported
the error and the Perl process. They correspond to errors
detected by the Perl interpreter, C library, operating
system, or an external program, respectively.</p>

<p>To illustrate the differences between these variables,
consider the following Perl expression, which uses a
single-quoted string:</p>

<p>eval q{ open my $pipe, &quot;/cdrom/install |&quot; or
die $!; my @res = &lt;$pipe&gt;; close $pipe or die
&quot;bad pipe: $?, $!&quot;; };</p>

<p>After execution of this statement all 4 variables may
have been set.</p>

<p>$@ is set if the string to be &quot;eval&quot;-ed did
not compile (this may happen if &quot;open&quot; or
&quot;close&quot; were imported with bad prototypes), or if
Perl code executed during evaluation die()d . In these cases
the value of $@ is the compile error, or the argument to
&quot;die&quot; (which will interpolate $! and $?). (See
also Fatal, though.)</p>

<p>When the eval() expression above is executed, open(),
&quot;&lt;PIPE&gt;&quot;, and &quot;close&quot; are
translated to calls in the C run-time library and thence to
the operating system kernel. $! is set to the C library s
&quot;errno&quot; if one of these calls fails.</p>

<p>Under a few operating systems, $^E may contain a more
verbose error indicator, such as in this case, &quot;CDROM
tray not closed.&quot; Systems that do not support extended
error messages leave $^E the same as $!.</p>

<p>Finally, $? may be set to non-0 value if the external
program /cdrom/install fails. The upper eight bits reflect
specific error conditions encountered by the program (the
programs exit() value). The lower eight bits reflect mode of
failure, like signal death and core dump information See
wait(2) for details. In contrast to $! and $^E, which are
set only if error condition is detected, the variable $? is
set on each &quot;wait&quot; or pipe &quot;close&quot;,
overwriting the old value. This is more like $@, which on
every eval() is always set on failure and cleared on
success.</p>

<p>For more details, see the individual descriptions at $@,
$!, $^E, and $?.</p>

<p>Technical Note on the Syntax of Variable Names Variable
names in Perl can have several formats. Usually, they must
begin with a letter or underscore, in which case they can be
arbitrarily long (up to an internal limit of 251 characters)
and may contain letters, digits, underscores, or the special
sequence &quot;::&quot; or &quot;&rsquo;&quot;. In this
case, the part before the last &quot;::&quot; or
&quot;&rsquo;&quot; is taken to be a package qualifier; see
perlmod.</p>

<p>Perl variable names may also be a sequence of digits or
a single punctuation or control character. These names are
all reserved for special uses by Perl; for example, the
all-digits names are used to hold data captured by
backreferences after a regular expression match. Perl has a
special syntax for the single-control-character names: It
understands &quot;^X&quot; (caret &quot;X&quot;) to mean the
control-&quot;X&quot; character. For example, the notation
$^W (dollar-sign caret &quot;W&quot;) is the scalar variable
whose name is the single character control-&quot;W&quot;.
This is better than typing a literal control-&quot;W&quot;
into your program.</p>

<p>Finally, new in Perl 5.6, Perl variable names may be
alphanumeric strings that begin with control characters (or
better yet, a caret). These variables must be written in the
form &quot;${^Foo}&quot;; the braces are not optional.
&quot;${^Foo}&quot; denotes the scalar variable whose name
is a control-&quot;F&quot; followed by two &quot;o&quot;s.
These variables are reserved for future special uses by
Perl, except for the ones that begin with &quot;^_&quot;
(control-underscore or caret-underscore). No
control-character name that begins with &quot;^_&quot; will
acquire a special meaning in any future version of Perl;
such names may therefore be used safely in programs. $^_
itself, however, is reserved.</p>

<p>Perl identifiers that begin with digits, control
characters, or punctuation characters are exempt from the
effects of the &quot;package&quot; declaration and are
always forced to be in package &quot;main&quot;; they are
also exempt from &quot;strict &rsquo;vars&rsquo;&quot;
errors. A few other names are also exempt in these ways:</p>

<p>ENV STDIN INC STDOUT ARGV STDERR ARGVOUT _ SIG</p>

<p>In particular, the new special &quot;${^_XYZ}&quot;
variables are always taken to be in package
&quot;main&quot;, regardless of any &quot;package&quot;
declarations presently in scope.</p>

<p>BUGS Due to an unfortunate accident of Perl s
implementation, &quot;use English&quot; imposes a
considerable performance penalty on all regular expression
matches in a program, regardless of whether they occur in
the scope of &quot;use English&quot;. For that reason,
saying &quot;use English&quot; in libraries is strongly
discouraged. See the Devel::SawAmpersand module
documentation from CPAN (
http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Devel/ ) for more
information. Writing &quot;use English
&rsquo;-no_match_vars&rsquo;;&quot; avoids the performance
penalty.</p>

<p>Having to even think about the $^S variable in your
exception handlers is simply wrong. $SIG{__DIE__} as
currently implemented invites grievous and difficult to
track down errors. Avoid it and use an &quot;END{}&quot; or
CORE::GLOBAL::die override instead.</p>
