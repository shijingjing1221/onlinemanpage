<p>DESCRIPTION The xdg-desktop-menu program can be used to
install new menu entries to the desktops application
menu.</p>

<p>The application menu works according to the XDG Desktop
Menu Specification at
http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/menu-spec</p>

<p>COMMANDS install Install one or more applications in a
submenu of the desktop menu system.</p>

<p>desktop-file: A desktop file represents a single menu
entry in the menu. Desktop files are defined by the
freedesktop.org Desktop Entry Specification. The most
important aspects of *.desktop files are summarized
below.</p>

<p>Menu entries can be added to the menu system in two
different ways. They can either be added to a predefined
submenu in the menu system based on one or more category
keywords, or they can be added to a new submenu.</p>

<p>To add a menu entry to a predefined submenu the desktop
file that represents the menu entry must have a Categories=
entry that lists one or more keywords. The menu item will be
included in an appropriate submenu based on the included
keywords.</p>

<p>To add menu items to a new submenu the desktop-files
must be preceded by a directory-file that describes the
submenu. If multiple desktop-files are specified, all
entries will be added to the same menu. If entries are
installed to a menu that has been created with a previous
call to xdg-desktop-menu the entries will be installed in
addition to any already existing entries.</p>

<p>directory-file: The *.directory file indicated by
directory-file represents a submenu. The directory file
provides the name and icon for a submenu. The name of the
directory file is used to identify the submenu.</p>

<p>If multiple directory files are provided each file will
represent a submenu within the menu that preceeds it,
creating a nested menu hierarchy (sub-sub-menus). The menu
entries themselves will be added to the last submenu.</p>

<p>Directory files follow the syntax defined by the
freedesktop.org Desktop Entry Specification.</p>

<p>uninstall Remove applications or submenus from the
desktop menu system previously installed with
xdg-desktop-menu install.</p>

<p>A submenu and the associated directory file is only
removed when the submenu no longer contains any menu
entries.</p>

<p>forceupdate Force an update of the menu system.</p>

<p>This command is only useful if the last call to
xdg-desktop-menu included the --noupdate option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --noupdate Postpone updating the menu system. If
multiple updates to the menu system are made in sequence
this flag can be used to indicate that additional changes
will follow and that it is not necassery to update the menu
system right away.</p>

<p>--novendor Normally, xdg-desktop-menu checks to ensure
that any *.directory and *.desktop files to be installed has
a vendor prefix. This option can be used to disable that
check.</p>

<p>A vendor prefix consists of alpha characters ([a-zA-Z])
and is terminated with a dash (&quot;-&quot;). Companies and
organizations are encouraged to use a word or phrase,
preferably the organizations name, for which they hold a
trademark as their vendor prefix. The purpose of the vendor
prefix is to prevent name conflicts.</p>

<p>--mode mode mode can be user or system. In user mode the
file is (un)installed for the current user only. In system
mode the file is (un)installed for all users on the system.
Usually only root is allowed to install in system mode.</p>

<p>The default is to use system mode when called by root
and to use user mode when called by a non-root user.</p>

<p>--version Show the xdg-utils version information.</p>

<p>DESKTOP FILES An application item in the application
menu is represented by a *.desktop file. A *.desktop file
consists of a [Desktop Entry] header followed by several
Key=Value lines.</p>

<p>A *.desktop file can provide a name and description for
an application in several different languages. This is done
by adding a language code as used by LC_MESSAGES in square
brackets behind the Key. This way one can specify different
values for the same Key depending on the currently selected
language.</p>

<p>The following keys are often used:</p>

<p>Value=1.0 This is a mandatory field to indicate that the
*.desktop file follows the 1.0 version of the
specification.</p>

<p>Type=Application This is a mandatory field that
indicates that the *.desktop file describes an application
launcher.</p>

<p>Name=Application Name The name of the application. For
example Mozilla</p>

<p>GenericName=Generic Name A generic description of the
application. For example Web Browser</p>

<p>Comment=Comment Optional field to specify a tooltip for
the application. For example Visit websites on the
Internet</p>

<p>Icon=Icon File The icon to use for the application. This
can either be an absolute path to an image file or an
icon-name. If an icon-name is provided an image lookup by
name is done in the users current icon theme. The
xdg-icon-resource command can be used to install image files
into icon themes. The advantage of using an icon-name
instead of an absolute path is that with an icon-name the
application icon can be provided in several different sizes
as well as in several differently themed styles.</p>

<p>Exec=Command Line The command line to start the
application. If the application can open files the %f
placeholder should be specified. When a file is dropped on
the application launcher the %f is replaced with the file
path of the dropped file. If multiple files can be specified
on the command line the %F placeholder should be used
instead of %f. If the application is able to open URLs in
addition to local files then %u or %U can be used instead of
%f or %F.</p>

<p>Categories=Categories A list of categories separated by
semi-colons. A category is a keyword that describes and
classifies the application. By default applications are
organized in the application menu based on category. When
menu entries are explicitly assigned to a new submenu it is
not necassery to list any categories.</p>

<p>When using categories it is recommended to include one
of the following categories: AudioVideo, Development,
Education, Game, Graphics, Network, Office, Settings,
System, Utility.</p>

<p>See Appendix A of the XDG Desktop Menu Specification for
information about additional categories.
http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/menu-spec-1.0.html</p>

<p>MimeType=Mimetypes A list of mimetypes separated by
semi-colons. This field is used to indicate which file types
the application is able to open.</p>

<p>DIRECTORY FILES The appearance of submenu in the
application menu is provided by a *.directory file. In
particular it provides the title of the submenu and a
possible icon. A *.directory file consists of a [Desktop
Entry] header followed by several Key=Value lines.</p>

<p>A *.directory file can provide a title (name) for the
submenu in several different languages. This is done by
adding a language code as used by LC_MESSAGES in square
brackets behind the Key. This way one can specify different
values for the same Key depending on the currently selected
language.</p>

<p>The following keys are relevqnt for submenus:</p>

<p>Value=1.0 This is a mandatory field to indicate that the
*.directory file follows the 1.0 version of the Desktop
Entry specification.</p>

<p>Type=Directory This is a mandatory field that indicates
that the *.directory file describes a submenu.</p>

<p>Name=Menu Name The title of submenu. For example
Mozilla</p>

<p>Comment=Comment Optional field to specify a tooltip for
the submenu.</p>

<p>Icon=Icon File The icon to use for the submenu. This can
either be an absolute path to an image file or an icon-name.
If an icon-name is provided an image lookup by name is done
in the users current icon theme. The xdg-icon-resource
command can be used to install image files into icon themes.
The advantage of using an icon-name instead of an absolute
path is that with an icon-name the submenu icon can be
provided in several different sizes as well as in several
differently themed styles.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES xdg-desktop-menu honours the
following environment variables:</p>

<p>XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL Setting this environment variable
to a non-zero numerical value makes xdg-desktop-menu do more
verbose reporting on stderr. Setting a higher value
increases the verbosity.</p>

<p>XDG_UTILS_INSTALL_MODE This environment variable can be
used by the user or administrator to override the
installation mode. Valid values are user and system.</p>

<p>EXIT CODES An exit code of 0 indicates success while a
non-zero exit code indicates failure. The following failure
codes can be returned:</p>

<p>1 Error in command line syntax.</p>

<p>2 One of the files passed on the command line did not
exist.</p>

<p>3 A required tool could not be found.</p>

<p>4 The action failed.</p>

<p>5 No permission to read one of the files passed on the
command line.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The company ShinyThings Inc. has developed an
application named &quot;WebMirror&quot; and would like to
add it to the application menu. The company will use
&quot;shinythings&quot; as its vendor id. In order to add
the application to the menu there needs to be a .desktop
file with a suitable Categories entry:</p>

<p>shinythings-webmirror.desktop:</p>

<p>[Desktop Entry] Encoding=UTF-8 Type=Application</p>

<p>Exec=webmirror Icon=webmirror</p>

<p>Name=WebMirror Name[nl]=WebSpiegel</p>

<p>Categories=Network;WebDevelopment;</p>

<p>Now the xdg-desktop-menu tool can be used to add the
shinythings-webmirror.desktop file to the desktop
application menu:</p>

<p>xdg-desktop-menu install
./shinythings-webmirror.desktop</p>

<p>Note that for the purpose of this example the menu items
are available in two languages, English and Dutch. The
language code for Dutch is nl.</p>

<p>In the next example the company ShinyThings Inc. will
add its own submenu to the desktop application menu
consisting of a &quot;WebMirror&quot; menu item and a
&quot;WebMirror Admin Tool&quot; menu item.</p>

<p>First the company needs to create two .desktop files
that describe the two menu items. Since the items are to be
added to a new submenu it is not necassery to include a
Categories= line:</p>

<p>shinythings-webmirror.desktop:</p>

<p>[Desktop Entry] Encoding=UTF-8 Type=Application</p>

<p>Exec=webmirror Icon=shinythings-webmirror</p>

<p>Name=WebMirror Name[nl]=WebSpiegel</p>

<p>shinythings-webmirror-admin.desktop:</p>

<p>[Desktop Entry] Encoding=UTF-8 Type=Application</p>

<p>Exec=webmirror-admintool
Icon=shinythings-webmirror-admintool</p>

<p>Name=WebMirror Admin Tool Name[nl]=WebSpiegel
Administratie Tool</p>

<p>In addition a .directory file needs to be created to
provide a title and icon for the sub-menu itself:</p>

<p>shinythings-webmirror.directory:</p>

<p>[Desktop Entry] Encoding=UTF-8</p>

<p>Icon=shinythings-webmirror-menu</p>

<p>Name=WebMirror Name[nl]=WebSpiegel</p>

<p>These file can now be installed with:</p>

<p>xdg-desktop-menu install
./shinythings-webmirror.directory
./shinythings-webmirror.desktop
./shinythings-webmirror-admin.desktop</p>

<p>The menu entries could also be installed one by one:</p>

<p>xdg-desktop-menu install --noupdate
./shinythings-webmirror.directory
./shinythings-webmirror.desktop xdg-desktop-menu install
--noupdate ./shinythings-webmirror.directory
./shinythings-webmirror-admin.desktop xdg-desktop-menu
forceupdate</p>

<p>Although the result is the same it is slightly more
efficient to install all files at the same time.</p>

<p>The *.desktop and *.directory files reference icons with
the names webmirror, webmirror-admin and webmirror-menu
which should also be installed. In this example the icons
are installed in two different sizes, once with a size of
22x22 pixels and once with a size of 64x64 pixels:</p>

<p>xdg-icon-resource install --size 22 ./wmicon-22.png
shinythings-webmirror xdg-icon-resource install --size 22
./wmicon-menu-22.png shinythings-webmirror-menu
xdg-icon-resource install --size 22 ./wmicon-admin-22.png
shinythings-webmirror-admin xdg-icon-resource install --size
64 ./wmicon-64.png shinythings-webmirror xdg-icon-resource
install --size 64 ./wmicon-menu-64.png
shinythings-webmirror-menu xdg-icon-resource install --size
64 ./wmicon-admin-64.png shinythings-webmirror-admin</p>
