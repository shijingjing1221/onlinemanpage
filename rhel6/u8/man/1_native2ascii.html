<p>NAME native2ascii - Creates localizable applications by
converting a file with characters in any supported character
encoding to one with ASCII and/or Unicode escapes or vice
versa.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS native2ascii [ inputfile ] [ outputfile ]</p>

<p>inputfile The encoded file to be converted to ASCII.</p>

<p>outputfile The converted ASCII file.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The native2ascii command converts encoded
files supported by the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to
files encoded in ASCII, using Unicode escapes uxxxx)
notation for all characters that are not part of the ASCII
character set. This process is required for properties files
that contain characters not in ISO-8859-1 character sets.
The tool can also perform the reverse conversion.</p>

<p>If the outputfile value is omitted, then standard output
is used for output. If, in addition, the inputfile value is
omitted, then standard input is used for input.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -reverse Perform the reverse operation: Converts
a file encoded in ISO-8859-1 with Unicode escapes to a file
in any character encoding supported by the JRE.</p>

<p>-encoding encoding_name Specifies the name of the
character encoding to be used by the conversion procedure.
If this option is not present, then the default character
encoding (as determined by the
java.nio.charset.Charset.defaultCharset method) is used. The
encoding_name string must be the name of a character
encoding that is supported by the JRE. See Supported
Encodings at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/intl/encoding.doc.html</p>

<p>-Joption Passes option to the Java Virtual Machine
(JVM), where option is one of the options described on the
reference page for the Java application launcher. For
example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory to 48 MB. See
java(1).</p>
