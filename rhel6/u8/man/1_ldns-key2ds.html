<p>NAME ldns-key2ds - transform a DNSKEY RR to a DS RR</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ldns-key2ds file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ldns-key2ds is used to transform a public
DNSKEY RR to a DS RR. When run it will read file with a
DNSKEY RR in it and it will create a .ds file with the DS RR
in it.</p>

<p>It prints out the basename for this file
(K&lt;name&gt;+&lt;alg&gt;+&lt;id&gt;).</p>

<p>By default it takes a pick of algorithm similar to the
key algorithm, SHA1 for RSASHA1, and so on.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Ignore SEP flag (i.e. make DS records for any
key)</p>

<p>-n Write the result DS Resource Record to stdout instead
of a file</p>

<p>-1 Use SHA1 as the hash function.</p>

<p>-2 Use SHA256 as the hash function</p>

<p>AUTHOR Written by the ldns team as an example for ldns
usage.</p>
