<p>BREAK(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual BREAK(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME break - exit from for, while, or until loop</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS break [n]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The break utility shall exit from the
smallest enclosing for, while, or until loop, if any; or
from the nth enclosing loop if n is specified. The value of
n is an unsigned decimal integer greater than or equal to 1.
The default shall be equivalent to n=1. If n is greater than
the number of enclosing loops, the outermost enclosing loop
shall be exited. Execution shall continue with the command
immediately following the loop.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES None.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 The n value was not an unsigned decimal integer
greater than or equal to 1.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES for i in * do if test -d &quot;$i&quot; then
break fi done</p>

<p>RATIONALE In early proposals, consideration was given to
expanding the syntax of break and continue to refer to a
label associated with the appropriate loop as a preferable
alternative to the n method. However, this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 does reserve the name space of command names
ending with a colon. It is anticipated that a future
implementation could take advantage of this and provide
something like:</p>

<p>outofloop: for i in a b c d e do for j in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 do if test -r &quot;${i}${j}&quot; then break
outofloop fi done done</p>

<p>and that this might be standardized after implementation
experience is achieved.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
