<p>DLCLOSE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual DLCLOSE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME dlclose - close a dlopen object</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;</p>

<p>int dlclose(void *handle);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The dlclose() function shall inform the
system that the object refer- enced by a handle returned
from a previous dlopen() invocation is no longer needed by
the application.</p>

<p>The use of dlclose() reflects a statement of intent on
the part of the process, but does not create any requirement
upon the implementation, such as removal of the code or
symbols referenced by handle. Once an object has been closed
using dlclose() an application should assume that its
symbols are no longer available to dlsym(). All objects
loaded automatically as a result of invoking dlopen() on the
referenced object shall also be closed if this is the last
reference to it.</p>

<p>Although a dlclose() operation is not required to remove
structures from an address space, neither is an
implementation prohibited from doing so. The only
restriction on such a removal is that no object shall be
removed to which references have been relocated, until or
unless all such references are removed. For instance, an
object that had been loaded with a dlopen() operation
specifying the RTLD_GLOBAL flag might provide a target for
dynamic relocations performed in the processing of other
objects-in such environments, an application may assume that
no relocation, once made, shall be undone or remade unless
the object requiring the relocation has itself been
removed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the referenced object was successfully
closed, dlclose() shall return 0. If the object could not be
closed, or if handle does not refer to an open object,
dlclose() shall return a non-zero value. More detailed
diagnostic information shall be available through
dlerror().</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following example illustrates use of
dlopen() and dlclose():</p>

<p>... /* Open a dynamic library and then close it ...
*/</p>

<p>#include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt; void *mylib; int eret;</p>

<p>mylib = dlopen(&quot;mylib.so&quot;, RTLD_LOCAL |
RTLD_LAZY); ... eret = dlclose(mylib); ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE A conforming application should employ
a handle returned from a dlopen() invocation only within a
given scope bracketed by the dlopen() and dlclose()
operations. Implementations are free to use reference
counting or other techniques such that multiple calls to
dlopen() ref- erencing the same object may return the same
object for handle. Imple- mentations are also free to reuse
a handle. For these reasons, the value of a handle must be
treated as an opaque object by the applica- tion, used only
in calls to dlsym() and dlclose().</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
