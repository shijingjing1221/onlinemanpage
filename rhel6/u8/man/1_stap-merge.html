<p>NAME stap-merge - systemtap per-cpu binary merger</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS stap-merge [ OPTIONS ] [ INPUT FILENAMES ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The stap-merge executable applies when the
-b option has been used while running a stap script. The -b
option will generate files per-cpu, based on the timestamp
field. Then stap-merge will merge and sort through the
per-cpu files based on the timestamp field.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The systemtap merge executable supports the
following options.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode, displays three extra fields per set of
collected data.</p>


<p>[cpunumber,sequencenumberofdata,thelengthofthedataset]</p>

<p>-o OUTPUT_FILENAME</p>

<p>Specify the name of the file you would like the output
to be redirected into. If this option is not specified than
the out- put will be pushed to standard out.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES $ stap -v -b -e probe syscall.open {
printf(&quot;%s(%d) open0, execname(), pid()) }</p>

<p>This should result in several stpd_cpu files (each
labled with a number representing which cpu the file was
produced from).</p>

<p>$ stap-merge -v stpd_cpu0 stpd_cpu1</p>

<p>Running the stap-merge program in the same directory as
the stap script earlier in the example, will produce an
ordered sequence of packets with the three part label for
each set of data. This result will be pushed through the
standard output. An output file could have been specified
using the &quot;-o&quot; option.</p>

<p>FILES Important files and their corresponding paths can
be located in the stappaths (7) manual page.</p>
