<p>GETXATTR(2) System calls GETXATTR(2)</p>

<p>NAME getxattr, lgetxattr, fgetxattr - retrieve an
extended attribute value</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;attr/xattr.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t getxattr (const char *path, const char *name,
void *value, size_t size); ssize_t lgetxattr (const char
*path, const char *name, void *value, size_t size); ssize_t
fgetxattr (int filedes, const char *name, void *value,
size_t size);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Extended attributes are name:value pairs
associated with inodes (files, directories, symlinks, etc).
They are extensions to the normal attributes which are
associated with all inodes in the system (i.e. the stat(2)
data). A complete overview of extended attributes concepts
can be found in attr(5).</p>

<p>getxattr retrieves the value of the extended attribute
identified by name and associated with the given path in the
filesystem. The length of the attribute value is
returned.</p>

<p>lgetxattr is identical to getxattr, except in the case
of a symbolic link, where the link itself is interrogated,
not the file that it refers to.</p>

<p>fgetxattr is identical to getxattr, only the open file
pointed to by filedes (as returned by open(2)) is
interrogated in place of path.</p>

<p>An extended attribute name is a simple NULL-terminated
string. The name includes a namespace prefix - there may be
several, disjoint namespaces associated with an individual
inode. The value of an extended attribute is a chunk of
arbitrary textual or binary data of specified length.</p>

<p>An empty buffer of size zero can be passed into these
calls to return the current size of the named extended
attribute, which can be used to estimate the size of a
buffer which is sufficiently large to hold the value
associated with the extended attribute.</p>

<p>The interface is designed to allow guessing of initial
buffer sizes, and to enlarge buffers when the return value
indicates that the buffer provided was too small.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, a positive number is returned
indicating the size of the extended attribute value. On
failure, -1 is returned and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>If the named attribute does not exist, or the process
has no access to this attribute, errno is set to
ENOATTR.</p>

<p>If the size of the value buffer is too small to hold the
result, errno is set to ERANGE.</p>

<p>If extended attributes are not supported by the
filesystem, or are dis- abled, errno is set to ENOTSUP.</p>

<p>The errors documented for the stat(2) system call are
also applicable here.</p>
