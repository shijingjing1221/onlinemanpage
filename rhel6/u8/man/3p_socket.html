<p>SOCKET(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SOCKET(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME socket - create an endpoint for communication</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The socket() function shall create an
unbound socket in a communica- tions domain, and return a
file descriptor that can be used in later function calls
that operate on sockets.</p>

<p>The socket() function takes the following arguments:</p>

<p>domain Specifies the communications domain in which a
socket is to be created.</p>

<p>type Specifies the type of socket to be created.</p>

<p>protocol Specifies a particular protocol to be used with
the socket. Specifying a protocol of 0 causes socket() to
use an unspecified default protocol appropriate for the
requested socket type.</p>

<p>The domain argument specifies the address family used in
the communica- tions domain. The address families supported
by the system are imple- mentation-defined.</p>

<p>Symbolic constants that can be used for the domain
argument are defined in the &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; header.</p>

<p>The type argument specifies the socket type, which
determines the semantics of communication over the socket.
The following socket types are defined; implementations may
specify additional socket types:</p>

<p>SOCK_STREAM Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional,
connection-mode byte streams, and may provide a transmission
mechanism for out- of-band data.</p>

<p>SOCK_DGRAM Provides datagrams, which are
connectionless-mode, unreliable messages of fixed maximum
length.</p>

<p>SOCK_SEQPACKET Provides sequenced, reliable,
bidirectional, connection-mode transmission paths for
records. A record can be sent using one or more output
operations and received using one or more input operations,
but a single operation never transfers part of more than one
record. Record boundaries are visible to the receiver via
the MSG_EOR flag.</p>

<p>If the protocol argument is non-zero, it shall specify a
protocol that is supported by the address family. If the
protocol argument is zero, the default protocol for this
address family and type shall be used. The protocols
supported by the system are implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The process may need to have appropriate privileges to
use the socket() function or to create some sockets.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, socket() shall
return a non-negative inte- ger, the socket file descriptor.
Otherwise, a value of -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The socket() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAFNOSUPPORT</p>

<p>The implementation does not support the specified
address fam- ily.</p>

<p>EMFILE No more file descriptors are available for this
process.</p>

<p>ENFILE No more file descriptors are available for the
system.</p>

<p>EPROTONOSUPPORT</p>

<p>The protocol is not supported by the address family, or
the pro- tocol is not supported by the implementation.</p>

<p>EPROTOTYPE The socket type is not supported by the
protocol.</p>

<p>The socket() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES The process does not have appropriate
privileges.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS Insufficient resources were available in the
system to perform the operation.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the
request.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The documentation for specific address
families specifies which proto- cols each address family
supports. The documentation for specific pro- tocols
specifies which socket types each protocol supports.</p>

<p>The application can determine whether an address family
is supported by trying to create a socket with domain set to
the protocol in question.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
