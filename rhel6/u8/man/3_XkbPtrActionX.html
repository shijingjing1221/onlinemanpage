<p>XkbPtrActionX(3) XKB FUNCTIONS XkbPtrActionX(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbPtrActionX - Returns the high_XXX and low_XXX
fields of act con- verted to a signed int</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int XkbPtrActionX (XkbPtrAction act);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - act action from which to extract X</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Actions associated with the XkbPtrAction
structure move the pointer when keys are pressed and
released.</p>

<p>If the MouseKeys control is not enabled, KeyPress and
KeyRelease events are treated as though the action is
XkbSA_NoAction.</p>

<p>If the MouseKeys control is enabled, a server action of
type XkbSA_MovePtr instructs the server to generate core
pointer MotionNo- tify events rather than the usual KeyPress
event, and the corresponding KeyRelease event disables any
mouse keys timers that were created as a result of handling
the XkbSA_MovePtr action.</p>

<p>The type field of the XkbPtrAction structure is always
XkbSA_MovePtr.</p>

<p>The flags field is a bitwise inclusive OR of the masks
shown in Table 1.</p>

<p>Table 1 Pointer Action Types
----------------------------------------------------------------
Action Type Meaning
----------------------------------------------------------------
XkbSA_NoAcceleration If not set, and the MouseKeysAccel con-
trol is enabled, the KeyPress initiates a mouse keys timer
for this key; every time the timer expires, the cursor
moves. XkbSA_MoveAbsoluteX If set, the X portion of the
structure specifies the new pointer X coordinate. Otherwise,
the X portion is added to the current pointer X coordinate
to deter- mine the new pointer X coordinate.
XkbSA_MoveAbsoluteY If set, the Y portion of the structure
specifies the new pointer Y coordinate. Otherwise, the Y
portion is added to the current pointer Y coordinate to
deter- mine the new pointer Y coordinate.</p>

<p>Each of the X and Y coordinates of the XkbPtrAction
structure is com- posed of two signed 16-bit values, that
is, the X coordinate is com- posed of high_XXX and low_XXX,
and similarly for the Y coordinate. Xkb provides the
following macros, to convert between a signed integer and
two signed 16-bit values in XkbPtrAction structures.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES typedef struct _XkbPtrAction { unsigned char
type; / XkbSA_MovePtr */ unsigned char flags; / determines
type of pointer motion */ unsigned char high_XXX; / x
coordinate, high bits*/ unsigned char low_XXX; / y
coordinate, low bits */ unsigned char high_YYY; / x
coordinate, high bits */ unsigned char low_YYY; / y
coordinate, low bits */ } XkbPtrAction;</p>
