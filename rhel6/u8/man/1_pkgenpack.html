<p>PKGENPACK(1) [FIXME: manual] PKGENPACK(1)</p>

<p>NAME pkgenpack - PackageKit Pack Generator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pkgenpack [--help] [--verbose]
[--with-package-list] [--output] [--package] [--updates]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents briefly the
pkgenpack command.</p>

<p>pkgenpack is the command line client for PackageKit for
creating service packs.</p>

<p>WHAT IS A SERVICE PACK? A service pack is a tarball
which contains a set of packages and their dependencies. The
user can reduce the dependencies to be packed using the
--with-package-list option. Along with the dependencies, a
service pack has a file named metadata.conf which contains
the information about the distribution and creation date of
the pack.</p>

<p>CREATING A SERVICE PACK? A service pack is created using
the command pkgenpack.</p>

<p>OPTIONS This program follows the usual GNU command line
syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (
-&acute;). A summary of options is included below.</p>

<p>--help Show summary of options.</p>

<p>--verbose Show extra debugging information.</p>

<p>--with-package-list Set the filename of dependencies to
be excluded.</p>

<p>Generally, the file list of packages is generated when
doing a PackageKit refresh on the target system. If not
specified, pkgenpack uses
/var/lib/PackageKit/system.package-list by default.</p>

<p>--output The directory to put the pack file, or the
current directory if omitted.</p>

<p>--package The package to be put into the
ServicePack.</p>

<p>--update Put all updates available in the
ServicePack.</p>

<p>NAMING A SERVICE PACK The only valid extension for a
service pack is &quot;.servicepack&quot;.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. Tim is facing problems with his Internet
connection at home. He needs a service pack with valgrind
and it&acute;s dependencies for his system. He asks James to
generate a pack for him. Both know James&acute;s system
should contain similar packages as Tim&acute;s system, as
both of them have installed Fedora 9 two days ago.</p>

<p>James simply runs:</p>

<p>[james@jamesbook:~]$ pkgenpack
--output=/media/USB/TimPacks --package=valgrind</p>

<p>This generates a file
/media/USB/TimPacks/valgrind-fedora-9-i686.servicepack on
the USB key Tim gave to James. Tim can now go home, insert
the USB key and double clicks on the
valgrind-fedora-9-i686.servicepack file to be prompted to
install these packages.</p>

<p>2. Bill wants to create a service pack named
kdegames-fedora-9-i686.servicepack for his new system which
does not have an internet connection. He generates a list of
packages on his system using pkcon list-create and copies
that list to his USB key. He then gives that USB to Rishi
who has a good internet connectivity. Rishi runs the
following command on his system:</p>

<p>[rishi@devils-temple:~]$ pkgenpack
--with-package-list=/media/USB/bill.package-list
--output=/home/rishi/Desktop --program=kdegames</p>

<p>This generates a service pack,
kdegames-fedora-9-i686.servicepack, on Rishi&acute;s
Desktop, which can be distributed to Bill and users with
similar requirements.</p>

<p>INSTALLING A SERVICE PACK Service Packs can be installed
using pkcon. For example:</p>

<p>[hacker@tim-lounge:~]$ pkcon install
/media/USB/TimPacks/valgrind-fedora-9-i686.servicepack</p>
