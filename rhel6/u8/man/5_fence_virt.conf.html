<p>fence_virtd.conf(5) fence_virtd.conf(5)</p>

<p>NAME fence_virt.conf - configuration file for
fence_virtd</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fence_virt.conf file contains
configuration information for fence_virtd, a fencing request
routing daemon for clusters of virtual machines.</p>

<p>The file is tree-structured. There are parent/child
relationships and sibling relationships between the
nodes.</p>

<p>foo { bar { baz = &quot;1&quot;; } }</p>

<p>There are three primary sections of fence_virt.conf.</p>

<p>SECTIONS fence_virtd This section contains global
information about how fence_virtd is to operate. The most
important pieces of information are as follows:</p>

<p>listener the listener plugin for receiving fencing
requests from clients</p>

<p>backend the plugin to be used to carry out fencing
requests</p>

<p>foreground do not fork into the background.</p>

<p>wait_for_backend wait for the backend management layer
to initialize rather than giving up immediately</p>

<p>module_path the module path to search for plugins</p>

<p>listeners This section contains listener-specific
configuration information; see the section about listeners
below.</p>

<p>backends This section contains listener-specific
configuration information; see the section about listeners
below.</p>

<p>groups This section contains static maps of which
virtual machines may fence which other virtual machines; see
the section about groups below.</p>

<p>LISTENERS There are various listeners available for
fence_virtd, each one handles decoding and authentication of
a given fencing request. The following configuration blocks
belong in the listeners section of fence_virt.conf</p>

<p>multicast key_file the shared key file to use (default:
/etc/clus- ter/fence_xvm.key).</p>

<p>hash the weakest hashing algorithm allowed for client
requests. Clients may send packets with stronger hashes than
the one spec- ified, but not weaker ones. (default: sha256,
but could be sha1, sha512, or none)</p>

<p>auth the hashing algorithm to use for the simplistic
challenge- response authentication (default: sha256, but
could be sha1, sha512, or none)</p>

<p>family the IP family to use (default: ipv4, but may be
ipv6)</p>

<p>address the multicast address to listen on (default:
225.0.0.12)</p>

<p>port the multicast port to listen on (default: 1229)</p>

<p>interface interface to listen on. By default,
fence_virtd listens on the default network interface.
However, this causes problems in some environments where the
host computer is used as a gateway.</p>

<p>serial The serial listener plugin utilizes libvirt s
serial (or VMChannel) mapping to listen for requests. When
using the serial listener, it is necessary to add a serial
port (preferably pointing to /dev/ttyS1) or a channel
(preferrably pointing to 10.0.2.179:1229) to the libvirt
domain description. Note that only type unix , mode bind
serial ports and channels are supported. Example libvirt
XML:</p>

<p>&lt;serial type=unix&gt; &lt;source mode= bind path=
/sandbox/guests/fence_socket_molly/&gt; &lt;target
port=1/&gt; &lt;/serial&gt; &lt;channel type=unix&gt;
&lt;source mode= bind path=
/sandbox/guests/fence_molly_vmchannel/&gt; &lt;target
type=guestfwd address=10.0.2.179 port=1229/&gt;
&lt;/channel&gt;</p>

<p>uri the URI to use when connecting to libvirt by the
serial plugin.</p>

<p>path The same directory that is defined for the domain
serial port path (From example above: /sandbox/guests).
Sockets must reside in this directory in order to be
considered valid. This can be used to prevent fence_virtd
from using the wrong sockets.</p>

<p>mode This selects the type of sockets to register. Valid
values are &quot;serial&quot; (default) and
&quot;vmchannel&quot;.</p>

<p>BACKENDS There are various backends available for
fence_virtd, each one handles routing a fencing request to a
hypervisor or management tool. The fol- lowing configuration
blocks belong in the backends section of fence_virt.conf</p>

<p>libvirt The libvirt plugin is the simplest plugin. It is
used in environments where routing fencing requests between
multiple hosts is not required, for example by a user
running a cluster of virtual machines on a single desktop
computer.</p>

<p>uri the URI to use when connecting to libvirt.</p>

<p>libvirt-qpid The libvirt-qpid plugin acts as a QMF
Console to the libvirt-qpid dae- mon in order to route
fencing requests over AMQP to the appropriate computer.
There are currently no configuration options for libvirt-
qpid.</p>

<p>host host or IP address of qpid broker. Defaults to
127.0.0.1.</p>

<p>port IP port of qpid broker. Defaults to 5672.</p>

<p>username Username for GSSAPI, if configured.</p>

<p>service Qpid service to connect to.</p>

<p>gssapi If set to 1, have fence_virtd use GSSAPI for
authentication when communicating with the Qpid broker.
Default is 0 (off).</p>

<p>checkpoint The checkpoint plugin uses CMAN, CPG, and
OpenAIS checkpoints to track virtual machines and route
fencing requests to the appropriate com- puter.</p>

<p>uri the URI to use when connecting to libvirt by the
checkpoint plu- gin.</p>

<p>name_mode The checkpoint plugin, in order to retain
compatibility with fence_xvm, stores virtual machines in a
certain way in the Ope- nAIS checkpoints. The default was to
use name when using fence_xvm and fence_xvmd, and so this is
still the default. However, it is strongly recommended to
use uuid instead of name in all cluster environments
involving more than one physical host in order to avoid the
potential for name colli- sions.</p>

<p>GROUPS Fence_virtd supports static maps which allow
grouping of VMs. The groups are arbitrary and are checked at
fence time. Any member of a group may fence any other
member. Hosts may be assigned to multiple groups if
desired.</p>

<p>group This defines a group.</p>

<p>uuid defines UUID as a member of a group.</p>

<p>ip defines an IP which is allowed to send fencing
requests for mem- bers of this group (e.g. for multicast).
It is highly recom- mended that this be used in conjunction
with a key file.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE fence_virtd { listener = &quot;multicast&quot;;
backend = &quot;checkpoint&quot;; }</p>

<p># this is the listeners section</p>

<p>listeners { multicast { key_file =
&quot;/etc/cluster/fence_xvm.key&quot;; } }</p>

<p>backends { libvirt { uri = &quot;qemu:///system&quot;; }
}</p>

<p>groups { group { ip = &quot;192.168.1.1&quot;; uuid =
&quot;44179d3f-6c63-474f-a212-20c8b4b25b16&quot;; uuid =
&quot;1ce02c4b-dfa1-42cb-b5b1-f0b1091ece60&quot;; } }</p>
