_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_CreateImageType is invoked to define a
new kind of image. An image type corresponds to a particular
value of the type argument for the image create command.
There may exist any number of different image types, and new
types may be defined dynamically by calling Tk_CreateIm-
ageType. For example, there might be one type for 2-color
bitmaps, another for multi-color images, another for
dithered images, another for video, and so on.</p>

<p>The code that implements a new image type is called an
image manager. It consists of a collection of procedures
plus three different kinds of data structures. The first
data structure is a Tk_ImageType structure, which contains
the name of the image type and pointers to five proce- dures
provided by the image manager to deal with images of this
type: typedef struct Tk_ImageType { char *name;
Tk_ImageCreateProc *createProc; Tk_ImageGetProc *getProc;
Tk_ImageDisplayProc *displayProc; Tk_ImageFreeProc
*freeProc; Tk_ImageDeleteProc *deleteProc; } Tk_ImageType;
The fields of this structure will be described in later
subsections of this entry.</p>

<p>The second major data structure manipulated by an image
manager is called an image master; it contains overall
information about a par- ticular image, such as the values
of the configuration options speci- fied in an image create
command. There will usually be one of these structures for
each invocation of the image create command.</p>

<p>The third data structure related to images is an image
instance. There will usually be one of these structures for
each usage of an image in a particular widget. It is
possible for a single image to appear simul- taneously in
multiple widgets, or even multiple times in the same wid-
get. Furthermore, different instances may be on different
screens or displays. The image instance data structure
describes things that may vary from instance to instance,
such as colors and graphics contexts for redisplay. There is
usually one instance structure for each -image option
specified for a widget or canvas item.</p>

<p>The following subsections describe the fields of a
Tk_ImageType in more detail.</p>

<p>NAME typePtr-&gt;name provides a name for the image
type. Once Tk_CreateIm- ageType returns, this name may be
used in image create commands to cre- ate images of the new
type. If there already existed an image type by this name
then the new image type replaces the old one.</p>

<p>CREATEPROC typePtr-&gt;createProc provides the address
of a procedure for Tk to call whenever image create is
invoked to create an image of the new type.
typePtr-&gt;createProc must match the following prototype:
typedef int Tk_ImageCreateProc( Tcl_Interp *interp, char
*name, int objc, Tcl_Obj *const objv[], Tk_ImageType
*typePtr, Tk_ImageMaster master, ClientData *masterDataPtr);
The interp argument is the interpreter in which the image
command was invoked, and name is the name for the new image,
which was either spec- ified explicitly in the image command
or generated automatically by the image command. The objc
and objv arguments describe all the configura- tion options
for the new image (everything after the name argument to
image). The master argument is a token that refers to Tks
information about this image; the image manager must return
this token to Tk when invoking the Tk_ImageChanged
procedure. Typically createProc will parse objc and objv and
create an image master data structure for the new image.
createProc may store an arbitrary one-word value at *mas-
terDataPtr, which will be passed back to the image manager
when other callbacks are invoked. Typically the value is a
pointer to the master data structure for the image.</p>

<p>If createProc encounters an error, it should leave an
error message in the interpreter result and return
TCL_ERROR; otherwise it should return TCL_OK.</p>

<p>createProc should call Tk_ImageChanged in order to set
the size of the image and request an initial redisplay.</p>

<p>GETPROC typePtr-&gt;getProc is invoked by Tk whenever a
widget calls Tk_GetImage to use a particular image. This
procedure must match the following prototype: typedef
ClientData Tk_ImageGetProc( Tk_Window tkwin, ClientData
masterData); The tkwin argument identifies the window in
which the image will be used and masterData is the value
returned by createProc when the image master was created.
getProc will usually create a data structure for the new
instance, including such things as the resources needed to
dis- play the image in the given window. getProc returns a
one-word token for the instance, which is typically the
address of the instance data structure. Tk will pass this
value back to the image manager when invoking its
displayProc and freeProc procedures.</p>

<p>DISPLAYPROC typePtr-&gt;displayProc is invoked by Tk
whenever an image needs to be displayed (i.e., whenever a
widget calls Tk_RedrawImage). displayProc must match the
following prototype: typedef void Tk_ImageDisplayProc(
ClientData instanceData, Display *display, Drawable
drawable, int imageX, int imageY, int width, int height, int
drawableX, int drawableY); The instanceData will be the same
as the value returned by getProc when the instance was
created. display and drawable indicate where to dis- play
the image; drawable may be a pixmap rather than the window
speci- fied to getProc (this is usually the case, since most
widgets double- buffer their redisplay to get smoother
visual effects). imageX, imageY, width, and height identify
the region of the image that must be redisplayed. This
region will always be within the size of the image as
specified in the most recent call to Tk_ImageChanged.
drawableX and drawableY indicate where in drawable the image
should be displayed; displayProc should display the given
region of the image so that point (imageX, imageY) in the
image appears at (drawableX, drawableY) in drawable.</p>

<p>FREEPROC typePtr-&gt;freeProc contains the address of a
procedure that Tk will invoke when an image instance is
released (i.e., when Tk_FreeImage is invoked). This can
happen, for example, when a widget is deleted or a image
item in a canvas is deleted, or when the image displayed in
a widget or canvas item is changed. freeProc must match the
following prototype: typedef void Tk_ImageFreeProc(
ClientData instanceData, Display *display); The instanceData
will be the same as the value returned by getProc when the
instance was created, and display is the display containing
the window for the instance. freeProc should release any
resources associ- ated with the image instance, since the
instance will never be used again.</p>

<p>DELETEPROC typePtr-&gt;deleteProc is a procedure that Tk
invokes when an image is being deleted (i.e. when the image
delete command is invoked). Before invoking deleteProc Tk
will invoke freeProc for each of the images instances.
deleteProc must match the following prototype: typedef void
Tk_ImageDeleteProc( ClientData masterData); The masterData
argument will be the same as the value stored in
*masterDataPtr by createProc when the image was created.
deleteProc should release any resources associated with the
image.</p>

<p>TK_GETIMAGEMASTERDATA The procedure
Tk_GetImageMasterData may be invoked to retrieve informa-
tion about an image. For example, an image manager can use
this proce- dure to locate its image master data for an
image. If there exists an image named name in the
interpreter given by interp, then *typePtrPtr is filled in
with type information for the image (the typePtr value
passed to Tk_CreateImageType when the image type was
registered) and the return value is the ClientData value
returned by the createProc when the image was created (this
is typically a pointer to the image master data structure).
If no such image exists then NULL is returned and NULL is
stored at *typePtrPtr.</p>

<p>LEGACY INTERFACE SUPPORT In Tk 8.2 and earlier, the
definition of Tk_ImageCreateProc was incom- patibly
different, with the following prototype: typedef int
Tk_ImageCreateProc( Tcl_Interp *interp, char *name, int
argc, char **argv, Tk_ImageType *typePtr, Tk_ImageMaster
master, ClientData *masterDataPtr); Legacy programs and
libraries dating from those days may still contain code that
defines extended Tk image types using the old interface. The
Tk header file will still support this legacy interface if
the code is compiled with the macro USE_OLD_IMAGE
defined.</p>

<p>When the USE_OLD_IMAGE legacy support is enabled, you
may see the rou- tine Tk_InitImageArgs in use. This was a
migration tool used to create stub-enabled extensions that
could be loaded into interps containing all versions of Tk
8.1 and later. Tk 8.5 no longer provides this rou- tine, but
uses a macro to convert any attempted calls of this routine
into an empty comment. Any stub-enabled extension providing
an extended image type via the legacy interface that is
compiled against Tk 8.5 headers and linked against the Tk
8.5 stub library will produce a file that can be loaded only
into interps with Tk 8.5 or later; that is, the normal
stub-compatibility rules. If a developer needs to gen- erate
from such code a file that is loadable into interps with Tk
8.4 or earlier, they must use Tk 8.4 headers and stub
libraries to do so.</p>

<p>Any new code written today should not make use of the
legacy inter- faces. Expect their support to go away in Tk
9.</p>
