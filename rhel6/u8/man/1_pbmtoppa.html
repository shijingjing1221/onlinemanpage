<p>NAME pbmtoppa - convert PBM image to HP Printer
Performance Architecture (PPA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmtoppa [pbm_file [ppa_file]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pbmtoppa converts page images in PBM format to Hewlett
Packards PPA (Printer Performance Architecture) format,
which is the data stream format expected by some HP
Windows-only printers including the HP Deskjet 820C series,
the HP DeskJet 720 series, and the HP DeskJet 1000
series.</p>

<p>pbm_file is the file specification of the input file or
- for Standard Input. The default is Standard Input.</p>

<p>The input file contains one or more PBM images, with
each one being a single page. Each image must have the exact
dimensions of a page (at 600 pixels per inch in both
directions). Significantly, this is the format that
Ghostscript produces.</p>

<p>ppa_file is the file specification of the output file or
- for Standard Output. The default is Standard Output.</p>

<p>To print Postscript on an HP PPA printer, just use
Ghostscript with the pbmraw (or pbm) device driver.</p>

<p>You can generate a test page for use with this program
with pbmpage.</p>

<p>You can also set up a printer filter so you can submit
PBM input directly to your print queue. See the
documentation for your print spooler for information on how
to do that, or look in hp820install.doc for an example lpd
print filter for Postscript and text files.</p>

<p>Sometimes, pbmtoppa generates a file which the printer
will not print (because pbmtoppa s input is unprintable).
When this happens, all three lights blink to signal the
error. This is usually because there is material outside of
the printers printable area. To make the file print,
increase the margins via pbmtoppa options or a configuration
file. See the section on calibration below.</p>

<p>About PPA The PPA printer language is a far lower level
language than most. When you use a PPA printer, most of the
processing that a conventional printer does is done instead
on the computer end of the wire. In par- ticular, pbmtoppa
has to do swath cutting, and sweep formatting, which other
printers do themselves. There is very little intelligence
inside a PPA printer; pbmtoppa generates direct controls for
the printers hardware.</p>

<p>The design goal of PPA was to reduce the cost of a
printer by exploit- ing computing resources already present
in the computer that requests the printing. CPU power, ROM,
and RAM requirements inside the printer are all reduced
compared to a conventional printer.</p>

<p>PPA was new in 1997. It was preceded by Hewlett Packard
s PCL (Printer Control Language) language. HP manufactured
PPA printers for only a few years, and no one else ever
did.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v version printer version (720, 820, or
1000)</p>

<p>-x xoff horizontal offset adjustment in 1/600
inches.</p>

<p>-y yoff vertical offset adjustment in 1/600 inches.</p>

<p>-t topmarg top margin in 1/600 inches (default: 150 =
0.25 inch)</p>

<p>-l leftmarg left margin in 1/600 inches (default: 150 =
0.25 inch)</p>

<p>-r rightmarg right margin in 1/600 inches (default: 150
= 0.25 inch)</p>

<p>-b botmarg bottom margin in 1/600 inches (default: 150 =
0.25 inch)</p>

<p>-s paper paper size: us or a4. Default is us.</p>

<p>-d dpi Print resolution in dots per inch.</p>

<p>-f cfgfile Read parameters from the configuration file
named cfgfile. See CONFIGURATION FILES</p>

<p>The offset adjustments you specify with -x and -y
accumulate. I.e. if you specify them multiple times, the
total offset adjustment is the sum of the adjustments you
specify. -x 60 -x 120 is the same as -x 180.</p>

<p>The -v option undoes any preceding -x and -y options,
leaving the hori- zontal and vertical adjustments their
default values.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILES You can use a configuration file to
specify parameters rather than use invocation options.
pbmtoppa processes the file /etc/pbmtoppa.conf, if it
exists, before processing any options. It then processes
each con- figuration file named by a -f option in order,
applying the parameters from the configuration file as if
they were invocation options used in the place of the -f
option.</p>

<p>Configuration files have the following format:</p>

<p>#Comment key1 value1 key2 value2 [etc.]</p>

<p>Valid keys are version, xoffset, yoffset, topmargin,
leftmargin, right- margin, bottommargin, papersize, or any
non-null prefix of these words. Valid values are the same as
with the corresponding invocation parame- ters.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Print a test pattern: pbmpage | pbmppa
&gt;/dev/lp1</p>

<p>Print three pages: cat page1.pbm page2.pbm page3.pbm |
pbmppa &gt;/dev/lp1</p>

<p>Print the Postscript file myfile.ps: gs -sDEVICE=rawpbm
-q -dNOPAUSE -r600 -sOutputFile=- myfile.ps ; | pbmtoppa |
lpr</p>

<p>CALIBRATION To be able to print successfully and
properly, you need to tell pbm- toppa an X and a Y offset
appropriate for your printer to use when gen- erating the
page. You can specify these offsets with the -x and -y
invocation options or with the xoff and yoff parameters in a
pbmtoppa configuration file.</p>

<p>To determine the correct offsets, use the pbmpage
program.</p>

<p>If while trying to do this calibration, the printer
refuses to print a page, but just blinks all three lights,
specify large margins (e.g. 600 pixels -- one inch) via
pbmpage invocation options while doing the cal-
ibration.</p>

<p>For example: pbmpage | pbmtoppa &gt;/dev/lp1 or pbmpage
| pbmtoppa | lpr -l</p>

<p>(if your printer filter recognizes the -l (direct
output) parameter).</p>

<p>In the test pattern, the grid is marked off in pixel
coordinate num- bers. Unfortunately, these coordinates are
probably cut off before the edge of the paper. You ll have
to use a ruler to estimate the pixel coordinate of the left
and top edges of the actual sheet of paper (should be within
+/- 300, may be negative; there are 600 pixels per
inch).</p>

<p>Add these coordinates to the X and Y offsets by either
editing the con- figuration file or using the -x and -y
command-line parameters.</p>

<p>When pbmtoppa is properly calibrated, the center mark
should be in the center of the paper. Also, the margins
should be able to be as small as 1/4 inch without causing
the printer to choke with blinking lights syndrome.</p>

<p>REDHAT LINUX INSTALLATION RedHat users may find the
following tip from Panayotis Vryonis &lt;vry- pan@hol.gr&gt;
helpful. The same should work for the 820 and 1000, but it
hasn t been tested. Also, use the pbmraw GSDriver if you
have it; its faster.</p>

<p>Here is a tip to intergrate HP720C support in RedHat s
printtool:</p>

<p>Install pbmtoppa. Copy pbmtoppa to /usr/bin.</p>

<p>Edit printerdb (in my system it is found in
/usr/lib/rhs/rhs-print- filters ) and append the following
lines:</p>

<p>----------------------Cut
here-----------------------</p>

<p>StartEntry: DeskJet720C GSDriver: pbm Description: {HP
DeskJet 720C} About: { This driver supports the HP DeskJet
720C inkjet printer. It does does not support color
printing. IMPORTANT! Insert - | pbm2ppa - in the Extra GS
Otions field. }</p>

<p>Resolution: {600} {600} {}</p>

<p>EndEntry
----------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Now you can add an HP720C printer just like any other,
using printtool.</p>

<p>This program was derived from pbm2ppa. pbm2ppa is
obsolete and has been replaced by pnm2ppa, which does the
same things as pbmtoppa except it also works with color and
has lots more features. See http://pnm2ppa.sourceforge.net
for more information about the PPA pro- tocol and the
separately distributed pnm2ppa program.</p>

<p>The file INSTALL-MORE in the pbmtoppa directory of the
Netpbm source code contains detailed instructions on setting
up a system to use pbm- toppa to allow convenient printing
on HP PPA printers. It was written by Michael Buehlmann.</p>
