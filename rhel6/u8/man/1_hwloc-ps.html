<p>NAME hwloc-ps - List currently-running processes or
threads that are bound.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS hwloc-ps [options]</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a list all processes, even those that are not
bound to any spe- cific part of the machine.</p>

<p>-p --physical report OS/physical indexes instead of
logical indexes</p>

<p>-l --logical report logical indexes instead of
physical/OS indexes (default)</p>

<p>-c --cpuset show process bindings as cpusets instead of
objects.</p>

<p>-t --threads show threads inside processes. If -a is
given as well, list all threads within each process.
Otherwise, show all threads inside each process where at
least one thread is bound.</p>

<p>--whole-system Do not consider administration
limitations.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION By default, hwloc-ps lists only those
currently-running processes that are bound. If -t is given,
processes that are not bound but contain at least one bound
thread are also displayed, as well as all their threads.</p>

<p>hwloc-ps displays process identifier, command-line and
binding. The binding may be reported as objects or
cpusets.</p>

<p>By default, process bindings are restricted to the
currently available topology. If some processes are bound to
processors that are not avail- able to the current process,
they are ignored unless --whole-system is given.</p>

<p>The output is a plain list. If you wish to annotate the
hierarchical topology with processes so as to see how they
are actual distributed on the machine, you might want to use
lstopo --ps instead (which also only shows processes that
are bound).</p>

<p>The -a switch can be used to show all processes, if
desired.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES If a process is bound, it appears in the
default output:</p>

<p>$ utils/hwloc-ps 4759 Core:0 myprogram</p>

<p>If a process is not bound but 3 of his 4 threads are
bound, it only appears in the thread-aware output:</p>

<p>$ utils/hwloc-ps</p>

<p>$ utils/hwloc-ps -t 4759 Machine:0 myprogram 4759
Machine:0 4761 PU:0 4762 PU:2 4765 PU:1</p>
