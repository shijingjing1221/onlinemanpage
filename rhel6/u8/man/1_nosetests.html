<p>NAME nosetests - unit testing for Python software</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nosetests [options] [names]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION nose provides extended test discovery and
running features for unittest.</p>

<p>nose collects tests automatically from python source
files, directories and packages found in its working
directory (which defaults to the cur- rent working
directory). Any python source file, directory or package
that matches the testMatch regular expression (by default: .
- ] ) [ T t ] e s t ) w i l l b e c o l l e c t (?:^|[e d a
s a t e s t ( o r s o u r c e f o r c o l - lection of
tests). In addition, all other packages found in the working
directory will be examined for python source files or
directories that match testMatch. Package discovery descends
all the way down the tree, so package.tests and
package.sub.tests and package.sub.sub2.tests will all be
collected.</p>

<p>Within a test directory or package, any python source
file matching testMatch will be examined for test cases.
Within a test module, func- tions and classes whose names
match testMatch and TestCase subclasses with any name will
be loaded and executed as tests. Tests may use the assert
keyword or raise AssertionErrors to indicate test failure.
Test- Case subclasses may do the same or use the various
TestCase methods available.</p>

<p>Selecting Tests</p>

<p>To specify which tests to run, pass test names on the
command line:</p>

<p>nosetests only_test_this.py</p>

<p>Test names specified may be file or module names, and
may optionally indicate the test case to run by separating
the module or file name from the test case name with a
colon. Filenames may be relative or absolute. Examples:</p>

<p>nosetests test.module nosetests
another.test:TestCase.test_method nosetests a.test:TestCase
nosetests /path/to/test/file.py:test_function</p>

<p>You may also change the working directory where nose
looks for tests, use the -w switch:</p>

<p>nosetests -w /path/to/tests</p>

<p>Note however that support for multiple -w arguments is
deprecated in this version and will be removed in a future
release, since as of nose 0.10 you can get the same behavior
by specifying the target directories *without* the -w
switch:</p>

<p>nosetests /path/to/tests /another/path/to/tests</p>

<p>Further customization of test selection and loading is
possible through the use of plugins.</p>

<p>Test result output is identical to that of unittest,
except for the additional features (error classes, and
plugin-supplied features such as output capture and assert
introspection) detailed in the options below.</p>

<p>Configuration</p>

<p>In addition to passing command-line options, you may
also put configu- ration options in a .noserc or nose.cfg
file in your home directory. These are standard .ini-style
config files. Put your nosetests configu- ration in a
[nosetests] section, with the -- prefix removed:</p>

<p>[nosetests] verbosity=3 with-doctest=1</p>

<p>All configuration files that are found will be loaded
and their options combined.</p>

<p>options: -h, --help show this help message and exit</p>

<p>-V, --version Output nose version and exit</p>

<p>-p, --plugins Output list of available plugins and exit.
Combine with higher verbosity for greater detail</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Be more verbose. [NOSE_VERBOSE]</p>

<p>--verbosity=VERBOSITY Set verbosity; --verbosity=2 is
the same as -v</p>

<p>-q, --quiet</p>

<p>-c FILES, --config=FILES Load configuration from config
file(s). May be specified multi- ple times; in that case,
all config files will be loaded and combined</p>

<p>-w WHERE, --where=WHERE Look for tests in this
directory. May be specified multiple times. The first
directory passed will be used as the working directory, in
place of the current working directory, which is the
default. Others will be added to the list of tests to exe-
cute. [NOSE_WHERE]</p>

<p>-m TESTMATCH, --match=TESTMATCH, --testmatch=TESTMATCH
Use this regular expression to find tests
[NOSE_TESTMATCH]</p>

<p>--tests=TESTNAMES Run these tests (comma-separated
list). This argument is useful mainly from configuration
files; on the command line, just pass the tests to run as
additional arguments with no switch.</p>

<p>-l DEBUG, --debug=DEBUG Activate debug logging for one
or more systems. Available debug loggers: nose,
nose.importer, nose.inspector, nose.plugins, nose.result and
nose.selector. Separate multiple names with a comma.</p>

<p>--debug-log=DEBUGLOG Log debug messages to this file
(default: sys.stderr)</p>

<p>--logging-config=LOGGINGCONFIG,
--log-config=LOGGINGCONFIG Load logging config from this
file -- bypasses all other logging config settings.</p>

<p>-e EXCLUDE, --exclude=EXCLUDE Don t run tests that match
regular expression [NOSE_EXCLUDE]</p>

<p>-i INCLUDE, --include=INCLUDE Also run tests that match
regular expression [NOSE_INCLUDE]</p>

<p>-x, --stop Stop running tests after the first error or
failure</p>

<p>-P, --no-path-adjustment Dont make any changes to
sys.path when loading tests [NOSE_NOPATH]</p>

<p>--exe Look for tests in python modules that are
executable. Normal behavior is to exclude executable
modules, since they may not be import-safe
[NOSE_INCLUDE_EXE]</p>

<p>--noexe DO NOT look for tests in python modules that are
executable. (The default on the windows platform is to do
so.)</p>

<p>--with-html-output Enable plugin HtmlOutput: Output test
results as ugly, unstyled html. [NOSE_WITH_HTML-OUTPUT]</p>

<p>--with-watch Enable plugin NoseWatch: watch failing
tests, retesting when modified [NOSE_WITH_WATCH]</p>

<p>--with-stopwatch Enable plugin Stopwatch: (no help
available) [NOSE_WITH_STOP- WATCH]</p>

<p>--faster-than=FASTER_THAN Run only tests that are faster
than FASTER_THAN seconds.</p>

<p>--stopwatch-file=STOPWATCH_FILE Store test timing
results in this file.</p>

<p>--with-figleafsections Enable plugin FigleafSections:
(no help available) [NOSE_WITH_FIGLEAFSECTIONS]</p>

<p>--figleaf-file=FIGLEAF_FILE Store figleaf section
coverage in this file</p>

<p>--decorator-file=DECORATOR_FILE Apply attributes in this
file to matching functions, classes, and methods</p>

<p>--with-tty Enable plugin NoseTTY: run nosetests more
interactively [NOSE_WITH_TTY]</p>

<p>--tty Enable plugin NoseTTY: run nosetests more
interactively [NOSE_TTY]</p>

<p>--tty-editor=NOSE_TTY_EDITOR editor program
[NOSE_TTY_EDITOR or EDITOR] (currently: None)</p>

<p>--tty-edit-cmd=NOSE_TTY_EDIT_CMD template to invoke edit
command. [NOSE_TTY_EDIT_CMD] (cur- rently: %(editor)s
%(filename)s --line %(lineno)s)</p>

<p>-a ATTR, --attr=ATTR Run only tests that have attributes
specified by ATTR [NOSE_ATTR]</p>

<p>-A EXPR, --eval-attr=EXPR Run only tests for whose
attributes the Python expression EXPR evaluates to True
[NOSE_EVAL_ATTR]</p>

<p>-s, --nocapture Don t capture stdout (any stdout output
will be printed immedi- ately) [NOSE_NOCAPTURE]</p>

<p>--with-coverage Enable plugin Coverage: If you have Ned
Batchelders coverage module installed, you may activate a
coverage report. The cover- age report will cover any python
source module imported after the start of the test run,
excluding modules that match test- Match. If you want to
include those modules too, use the --covertests switch, or
set the NOSE_COVER_TESTS environment variable to a true
value. To restrict the coverage report to modules from a
particular package or packages, use the --cover-packages
switch or the NOSE_COVER_PACKAGES environment variable.
[NOSE_WITH_COVERAGE]</p>

<p>--cover-package=COVER_PACKAGES Restrict coverage output
to selected packages [NOSE_COVER_PACK- AGE]</p>

<p>--cover-erase Erase previously collected coverage
statistics before run</p>

<p>--cover-tests Include test modules in coverage report
[NOSE_COVER_TESTS]</p>

<p>--cover-inclusive Include all python files under working
directory in coverage report. Useful for discovering holes
in test coverage if not all files are imported by the test
suite. [NOSE_COVER_INCLUSIVE]</p>

<p>--pdb Drop into debugger on errors</p>

<p>--pdb-failures Drop into debugger on failures</p>

<p>--no-deprecated Disable special handling of
DeprecatedTest exceptions.</p>

<p>--with-doctest Enable plugin Doctest: Activate doctest
plugin to find and run doctests in non-test modules.
[NOSE_WITH_DOCTEST]</p>

<p>--doctest-tests Also look for doctests in test modules
[NOSE_DOCTEST_TESTS]</p>

<p>--doctest-extension=DOCTESTEXTENSION Also look for
doctests in files with this extension
[NOSE_DOCTEST_EXTENSION]</p>

<p>--with-isolation Enable plugin IsolationPlugin: Activate
the isolation plugin to isolate changes to external modules
to a single test module or package. The isolation plugin
resets the contents of sys.modules after each test module or
package runs to its state before the test. PLEASE NOTE that
this plugin should not be used with the coverage plugin in
any other case where module reloading may produce
undesirable side-effects. [NOSE_WITH_ISOLATION]</p>

<p>-d, --detailed-errors, --failure-detail Add detail to
error output by attempting to evaluate failed asserts
[NOSE_DETAILED_ERRORS]</p>

<p>--with-profile Enable plugin Profile: Use this plugin to
run tests using the hotshot profiler.
[NOSE_WITH_PROFILE]</p>

<p>--profile-sort=PROFILE_SORT Set sort order for profiler
output</p>

<p>--profile-stats-file=PROFILE_STATS_FILE Profiler stats
file; default is a new temp file on each run</p>

<p>--profile-restrict=PROFILE_RESTRICT Restrict profiler
output. See help for pstats.Stats for details</p>

<p>--no-skip Disable special handling of SkipTest
exceptions.</p>

<p>--with-id Enable plugin TestId: Activate to add a test
id (like #1) to each test name output. After youve run once
to generate test ids, you can re-run individual tests by
activating the plugin and passing the ids (with or without
the # prefix) instead of test names. [NOSE_WITH_ID]</p>

<p>--id-file=TESTIDFILE Store test ids found in test runs
in this file.</p>
