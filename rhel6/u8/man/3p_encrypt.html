<p>ENCRYPT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ENCRYPT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME encrypt - encoding function (CRYPT)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>void encrypt(char block[64], int edflag);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The encrypt() function shall provide access
to an implementation- defined encoding algorithm. The key
generated by setkey() is used to encrypt the string block
with encrypt().</p>

<p>The block argument to encrypt() shall be an array of
length 64 bytes containing only the bytes with values of 0
and 1. The array is modified in place to a similar array
using the key set by setkey(). If edflag is 0, the argument
is encoded. If edflag is 1, the argument may be decoded (see
the APPLICATION USAGE section); if the argument is not
decoded, errno shall be set to [ENOSYS].</p>

<p>The encrypt() function shall not change the setting of
errno if suc- cessful. An application wishing to check for
error situations should set errno to 0 before calling
encrypt(). If errno is non-zero on return, an error has
occurred.</p>

<p>The encrypt() function need not be reentrant. A function
that is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The encrypt() function shall not return a
value.</p>

<p>ERRORS The encrypt() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>ENOSYS The functionality is not supported on this
implementation.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Historical implementations of the
encrypt() function used a rather primitive encoding
algorithm.</p>

<p>In some environments, decoding might not be implemented.
This is related to some Government restrictions on
encryption and decryption routines. Historical practice has
been to ship a different version of the encryption library
without the decryption feature in the routines supplied.
Thus the exported version of encrypt() does encoding but not
decoding.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
