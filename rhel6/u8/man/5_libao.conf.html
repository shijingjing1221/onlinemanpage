<p>libao.conf(5) libao configuration libao.conf(5)</p>

<p>NAME libao.conf - configuration for libao.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/libao.conf</p>

<p>~/.libao</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION libao.conf and .libao are configuration
files for libao, the audio out- put library. They specify
various options to libao, as described below. libao.conf
sets system-wide options, whereas ~/.libao sets
user-specific options. When an option is set in both places,
the option in ~/.libao takes precedence.</p>

<p>FILE FORMAT The file consists of comments and key-value
pairs. Comments are on separate lines that start with a #
symbol. The key-value pairs are of the form: key=value where
key contains no whitespace and no equal signs. value will be
all of the text after the equal sign until (but not
including) the ending newline. Beware of extra spaces at the
end of the line! They will probably be interpreted as part
of the option value.</p>

<p>Valid option keys are:</p>

<p>default_driver The short name of the driver libao should
use by default. Valid values include (not all are available
on every platform): oss, esd, arts, alsa, alsa05, nas, irix,
and sun. Note that &quot;sun&quot; is used on many BSD
systems as well as Solaris. The &quot;alsa&quot; driver is
for the 0.9.x ALSA API, whereas the &quot;alsa05&quot;
driver is for the 0.5.x API.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Here is an example libao.conf that forces the
OSS driver to be used by default:</p>

<p># This is a comment. default_driver=oss</p>

<p>BUGS libao.conf is missing a number of potentially
useful options.</p>
