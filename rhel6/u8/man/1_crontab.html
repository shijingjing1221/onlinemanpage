<p>CRONTAB(1) Cronie Users Manual CRONTAB(1)</p>

<p>NAME crontab - maintain crontab files for individual
users</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS crontab [-u user] file crontab [-u user] [-l |
-r | -e] [-i] [-s]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Crontab is the program used to install,
remove or list the tables used to drive the cron(8) daemon.
Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are
files in /var/spool/ , they are not intended to be edited
directly. For SELinux in mls mode can be even more crontabs
- for each range. For more see selinux(8).</p>

<p>The cron jobs could be allow or disallow for different
users. For clas- sical crontab there exists cron.allow and
cron.deny files. If cron.allow file exists, then you must be
listed therein in order to be allowed to use this command.
If the cron.allow file does not exist but the cron.deny file
does exist, then you must not be listed in the cron.deny
file in order to use this command. If neither of these files
exists, only the super user will be allowed to use this
command. The second option is using PAM authentication,
where you set up users, which could or couldnt use crontab
and also system cron jobs from /etc/cron.d/.</p>

<p>The temporary directory could be set in enviroment
variables. If its not set by user than /tmp is used.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -u Append the name of the user whose crontab is
to be tweaked. If this option is not given, crontab examines
&quot;your&quot; crontab, i.e., the crontab of the person
executing the command. Note that su(8) can confuse crontab
and that if you are running inside of su(8) you should
always use the -u option for safetys sake. The first form of
this command is used to install a new crontab from some
named file or standard input if the pseudo-filename
&quot;-&quot; is given.</p>

<p>-l The current crontab will be displayed on standard
output.</p>

<p>-r The current crontab will be removed.</p>

<p>-e This option is used to edit the current crontab using
the editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment
variables. After you exit from the editor, the modified
crontab will be installed automatically.</p>

<p>-i This option modifies the -r option to prompt the user
for a y/Y response before actually removing the crontab.</p>

<p>-s It will append the current SELinux security context
string as an MLS_LEVEL setting to the crontab file before
editing / replace- ment occurs - see the documentation of
MLS_LEVEL in crontab(5).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO crontab(5),cron(8)</p>

<p>FILES /etc/cron.allow /etc/cron.deny</p>

<p>STANDARDS The crontab command conforms to IEEE
Std1003.2-1992 ( POSIX). This new command syntax differs
from previous versions of Vixie Cron, as well as from the
classic SVR3 syntax.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS A fairly informative usage message appears
if you run it with a bad command line.</p>
