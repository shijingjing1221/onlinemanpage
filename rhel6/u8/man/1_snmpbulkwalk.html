<p>NAME snmpbulkwalk - retrieve a subtree of management
values using SNMP GET- BULK requests</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS snmpbulkwalk [APPLICATION OPTIONS] [COMMON
OPTIONS] [OID]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION snmpbulkwalk is an SNMP application that
uses SNMP GETBULK requests to query a network entity
efficiently for a tree of information.</p>

<p>An object identifier (OID) may be given on the command
line. This OID specifies which portion of the object
identifier space will be searched using GETBULK requests.
All variables in the subtree below the given OID are queried
and their values presented to the user. Each variable name
is given in the format specified in variables(5). If no OID
argu- ment is present, snmpbulkwalk will search MIB-2.</p>

<p>If the network entity has an error processing the
request packet, an error packet will be returned and a
message will be shown, helping to pinpoint why the request
was malformed.</p>

<p>If the tree search causes attempts to search beyond the
end of the MIB, the message &quot;End of MIB&quot; will be
displayed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -Cc Do not check whether the returned OIDs are
increasing. Some agents (LaserJets are an example) return
OIDs out of order, but can complete the walk anyway. Other
agents return OIDs that are out of order and can cause
snmpbulkwalk to loop indefi- nitely. By default,
snmpbulkwalk tries to detect this behavior and warns you
when it hits an agent acting illegally. Use -Cc to turn off
this behaviour.</p>

<p>-Ci Include the given OID in the search range. Normally
snmpbulk- walk uses GETBULK requests starting with the OID
you specified and returns all results in the MIB tree after
that OID. Some- times, you may wish to include the OID
specified on the command line in the printed results if it
is a valid OID in the tree itself. This option lets you do
this.</p>

<p>-Cn&lt;NUM&gt; Set the non-repeaters field in the
GETBULK PDUs. This speci- fies the number of supplied
variables that should not be iter- ated over. The default is
0.</p>

<p>-Cp Upon completion of the walk, print the number of
variables found.</p>

<p>-Cr&lt;NUM&gt; Set the max-repetitions field in the
GETBULK PDUs. This speci- fies the maximum number of
iterations over the repeating vari- ables. The default is
10.</p>

<p>In addition to these options, snmpbulkwalk takes the
common options described in the snmpcmd(1) manual page.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The command:</p>

<p>snmpbulkwalk -v2c -Os -c public zeus system</p>

<p>will retrieve all of the variables under system:</p>

<p>sysDescr.0 = STRING: &quot;SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu
4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m&quot; sysObjectID.0 = OID:
enterprises.hp.nm.hpsystem.10.1.1 sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks:
(155274552) 17 days, 23:19:05 sysContact.0 = STRING:
&quot;&quot; sysName.0 = STRING:
&quot;zeus.net.cmu.edu&quot; sysLocation.0 = STRING:
&quot;&quot; sysServices.0 = INTEGER: 72</p>

<p>In contrast to snmpwalk, this information will typically
be gathered in a single transaction with the agent, rather
than one transaction per variable found. snmpbulkwalk is
thus more efficient in terms of net- work utilisation, which
may be especially important when retrieving large
tables.</p>

<p>NOTE As the name implies, snmpbulkwalk utilizes the SNMP
GETBULK message, which is not available in SNMP v1.</p>
