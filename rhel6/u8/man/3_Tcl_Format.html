<p>ARGUMENTS const char *bytes (in) Points to the first
byte of an array of UTF-8-encoded bytes used to set or
append to a string object. This byte array may contain
embed- ded null characters unless numChars is nega- tive.
(Applications needing null bytes should represent them as
the two-byte sequence 700600, use Tcl_ExternalToUtf to con-
vert, or Tcl_NewByteAr- rayObj if the string is a collection
of uninter- preted bytes.)</p>

<p>int length (in) The number of bytes to copy from bytes
when ini- tializing, setting, or appending to a string
object. If negative, all bytes up to the first null are
used.</p>

<p>const Tcl_UniChar *unicode (in) Points to the first byte
of an array of Unicode characters used to set or append to a
string object. This byte array may contain embedded null
characters unless num- Chars is negative.</p>

<p>int numChars (in) The number of Unicode characters to
copy from unicode when initializ- ing, setting, or appending
to a string object. If negative, all characters up to the
first null character are used.</p>

<p>int index (in) The index of the Unicode character to
return.</p>

<p>int first (in) The index of the first Unicode character
in the Unicode range to be returned as a new object.</p>

<p>int last (in) The index of the last Unicode character in
the Unicode range to be returned as a new object.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *objPtr (in/out) Points to an object to
manipulate.</p>

string representation.</p>

<p>const char *string (in) Null-terminated string value to
append to objPtr.</p>

<p>va_list argList (in) An argument list which must have
been ini- tialised using va_start, and cleared using
va_end.</p>

<p>int limit (in) Maximum number of bytes to be
appended.</p>

<p>const char *ellipsis (in) Suffix to append when the
limit leads to string truncation. If NULL is passed then the
suffix &quot;...&quot; is used.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The procedures described in this manual
entry allow Tcl objects to be manipulated as string values.
They use the internal representation of the object to store
additional information to make the string manipula- tions
more efficient. In particular, they make a series of append
operations efficient by allocating extra storage space for
the string so that it does not have to be copied for each
append. Also, indexing and length computations are optimized
because the Unicode string repre- sentation is calculated
and cached as needed. When using the Tcl_Append* family of
functions where the interpreters result is the object being
appended to, it is important to call Tcl_ResetResult first
to ensure you are not unintentionally appending to existing
data in the result object.</p>

<p>Tcl_NewStringObj and Tcl_SetStringObj create a new
object or modify an existing object to hold a copy of the
string given by bytes and length. Tcl_NewUnicodeObj and
Tcl_SetUnicodeObj create a new object or modify an existing
object to hold a copy of the Unicode string given by uni-
code and numChars. Tcl_NewStringObj and Tcl_NewUnicodeObj
return a pointer to a newly created object with reference
count zero. All four procedures set the object to hold a
copy of the specified string. Tcl_SetStringObj and
Tcl_SetUnicodeObj free any old string representa- tion as
well as any old internal representation of the object.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetStringFromObj and Tcl_GetString return an objects
string repre- sentation. This is given by the returned byte
pointer and (for Tcl_GetStringFromObj) length, which is
stored in lengthPtr if it is non-NULL. If the objects UTF
string representation is invalid (its byte pointer is NULL),
the string representation is regenerated from the object s
internal representation. The storage referenced by the
returned byte pointer is owned by the object manager. It is
passed back as a writable pointer so that extension author
creating their own Tcl_ObjType will be able to modify the
string representation within the Tcl_UpdateStringProc of
their Tcl_ObjType. Except for that limited purpose, the
pointer returned by Tcl_GetStringFromObj or Tcl_GetString
should be treated as read-only. It is recommended that this
pointer be assigned to a (const char *) variable. Even in
the limited situations where writing to this pointer is
acceptable, one should take care to respect the
copy-on-write semantics required by Tcl_Objs, with appro-
priate calls to Tcl_IsShared and Tcl_DuplicateObj prior to
any in-place modification of the string representation. The
procedure Tcl_GetString is used in the common case where the
caller does not need the length of the string
representation.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetUnicodeFromObj and Tcl_GetUnicode return an
object s value as a Unicode string. This is given by the
returned pointer and (for Tcl_GetUnicodeFromObj) length,
which is stored in lengthPtr if it is non-NULL. The storage
referenced by the returned byte pointer is owned by the
object manager and should not be modified by the caller. The
procedure Tcl_GetUnicode is used in the common case where
the caller does not need the length of the unicode string
representation.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetUniChar returns the index th character in the
objects Unicode representation.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetRange returns a newly created object comprised of
the characters between first and last (inclusive) in the
objects Unicode representa- tion. If the objects Unicode
representation is invalid, the Unicode representation is
regenerated from the object s string representation.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetCharLength returns the number of characters (as
opposed to bytes) in the string object.</p>

<p>Tcl_AppendToObj appends the data given by bytes and
length to the string representation of the object specified
by objPtr. If the object has an invalid string
representation, then an attempt is made to con- vert bytes
is to the Unicode format. If the conversion is successful,
then the converted form of bytes is appended to the objects
Unicode representation. Otherwise, the object s Unicode
representation is invalidated and converted to the UTF
format, and bytes is appended to the objects new string
representation.</p>

<p>Tcl_AppendUnicodeToObj appends the Unicode string given
by unicode and numChars to the object specified by objPtr.
If the object has an invalid Unicode representation, then
unicode is converted to the UTF format and appended to the
objects string representation. Appends are optimized to
handle repeated appends relatively efficiently (it overal-
locates the string or Unicode space to avoid repeated
reallocations and copies of objects string value).</p>

<p>Tcl_AppendObjToObj is similar to Tcl_AppendToObj, but it
appends the string or Unicode value (whichever exists and is
best suited to be appended to objPtr) of appendObjPtr to
objPtr.</p>

<p>Tcl_AppendStringsToObj is similar to Tcl_AppendToObj
except that it can be passed more than one value to append
and each value must be a null- terminated string (i.e. none
of the values may contain internal null characters). Any
number of string arguments may be provided, but the last
argument must be a NULL pointer to indicate the end of the
list.</p>

<p>Tcl_AppendStringsToObjVA is the same as
Tcl_AppendStringsToObj except that instead of taking a
variable number of arguments it takes an argu- ment
list.</p>

<p>Tcl_AppendLimitedToObj is similar to Tcl_AppendToObj
except that it imposes a limit on how many bytes are
appended. This can be handy when the string to be appended
might be very large, but the value being con- structed
should not be allowed to grow without bound. A common usage
is when constructing an error message, where the end result
should be kept short enough to be read. Bytes from bytes are
appended to objPtr, but no more than limit bytes total are
to be appended. If the limit pre- vents all length bytes
that are available from being appended, then the appending
is done so that the last bytes appended are from the string
ellipsis. This allows for an indication of the truncation to
be left in the string. When length is -1, all bytes up to
the first zero byte are appended, subject to the limit. When
ellipsis is NULL, the default string ... is used. When
ellipsis is non-NULL, it must point to a zero-
byte-terminated string in Tcls internal UTF encoding. The
number of bytes appended can be less than the lesser of
length and limit when appending fewer bytes is necessary to
append only whole multi-byte characters.</p>

<p>Tcl_Format is the C-level interface to the engine of the
format com- mand. The actual command procedure for format is
little more than Tcl_Format(interp, Tcl_GetString(objv[1]),
objc-2, objv+2); The objc Tcl_Obj values in objv are
formatted into a string according to the conversion
specification in format argument, following the docu-
mentation for the format command. The resulting formatted
string is converted to a new Tcl_Obj with refcount of zero
and returned. If some error happens during production of the
formatted string, NULL is returned, and an error message is
recorded in interp, if interp is non- NULL.</p>

<p>Tcl_AppendFormatToObj is an appending alternative form
of Tcl_Format with functionality equivalent to Tcl_Obj
*newPtr = Tcl_Format(interp, format, objc, objv); if (newPtr
== NULL) return TCL_ERROR; Tcl_AppendObjToObj(objPtr,
newPtr); return TCL_OK; but with greater convenience and
efficiency when the appending func- tionality is needed.</p>

<p>Tcl_ObjPrintf serves as a replacement for the common
sequence char buf[SOME_SUITABLE_LENGTH]; sprintf(buf,
format, ...); Tcl_NewStringObj(buf, -1); but with greater
convenience and no need to determine SOME_SUIT- ABLE_LENGTH.
The formatting is done with the same core formatting engine
used by Tcl_Format. This means the set of supported
conversion specifiers is that of the format command and not
that of the sprintf routine where the two sets differ. When
a conversion specifier passed to Tcl_ObjPrintf includes a
precision, the value is taken as a number of bytes, as
sprintf does, and not as a number of characters, as format
does. This is done on the assumption that C code is more
likely to know how many bytes it is passing around than the
number of encoded characters those bytes happen to
represent. The variable number of arguments passed in should
be of the types that would be suitable for passing to
sprintf. Note in this example usage, x is of type long. long
x = 5; Tcl_Obj *objPtr = Tcl_ObjPrintf(&quot;Value is
%d&quot;, x); If the value of format contains internal
inconsistencies or invalid specifier formats, the formatted
string result produced by Tcl_ObjPrintf will be an error
message describing the error.</p>

<p>Tcl_AppendPrintfToObj is an appending alternative form
of Tcl_ObjPrintf with functionality equivalent to
Tcl_AppendObjToObj(objPtr, Tcl_ObjPrintf(format, ...)); but
with greater convenience and efficiency when the appending
func- tionality is needed.</p>

<p>The Tcl_SetObjLength procedure changes the length of the
string value of its objPtr argument. If the newLength
argument is greater than the space allocated for the objects
string, then the string space is real- located and the old
value is copied to the new space; the bytes between the old
length of the string and the new length may have arbitrary
val- ues. If the newLength argument is less than the current
length of the object s string, with objPtr-&gt;length is
reduced without reallocating the string space; the original
allocated size for the string is recorded in the object, so
that the string length can be enlarged in a subsequent call
to Tcl_SetObjLength without reallocating storage. In all
cases Tcl_SetObjLength leaves a null character at
objPtr-&gt;bytes[newLength].</p>

<p>Tcl_AttemptSetObjLength is identical in function to
Tcl_SetObjLength except that if sufficient memory to satisfy
the request cannot be allo- cated, it does not cause the Tcl
interpreter to panic. Thus, if newLength is greater than the
space allocated for the objects string, and there is not
enough memory available to satisfy the request,
Tcl_AttemptSetObjLength will take no action and return 0 to
indicate failure. If there is enough memory to satisfy the
request, Tcl_AttemptSetObjLength behaves just like
Tcl_SetObjLength and returns 1 to indicate success.</p>

<p>The Tcl_ConcatObj function returns a new string object
whose value is the space-separated concatenation of the
string representations of all of the objects in the objv
array. Tcl_ConcatObj eliminates leading and trailing white
space as it copies the string representations of the objv
array to the result. If an element of the objv array
consists of nothing but white space, then that object is
ignored entirely. This white-space removal was added to make
the output of the concat command cleaner-looking.
Tcl_ConcatObj returns a pointer to a newly-created object
whose ref count is zero.</p>
