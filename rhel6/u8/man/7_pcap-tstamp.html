<p>NAME pcap-tstamp - packet time stamps in libpcap</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When capturing traffic, each packet is given
a time stamp representing, for incoming packets, the arrival
time of the packet and, for outgoing packets, the
transmission time of the packet. This time is an approxi-
mation of the arrival or transmission time. If it is
supplied by the operating system running on the host on
which the capture is being done, there are several reasons
why it might not precisely represent the arrival or
transmission time:</p>

<p>if the time stamp is applied to the packet when the
networking stack receives the packet, the networking stack
might not see the packet until an interrupt is delivered for
the packet or a timer event causes the networking device
driver to poll for packets, and the time stamp might not be
applied until the packet has had some processing done by
other code in the net- working stack, so there might be a
significant delay between the time when the last bit of the
packet is received by the capture device and when the
networking stack time-stamps the packet;</p>

<p>the timer used to generate the time stamps might have
low reso- lution, for example, it might be a timer updated
once per host operating system timer tick, with the host
operating system timer ticking once every few
milliseconds;</p>

<p>a high-resolution timer might use a counter that runs at
a rate dependent on the processor clock speed, and that
clock speed might be adjusted upwards or downwards over time
and the timer might not be able to compensate for all those
adjustments;</p>

<p>the host operating systems clock might be adjusted over
time to match a time standard to which the host is being
synchronized, which might be done by temporarily slowing
down or speeding up the clock or by making a single
adjustment;</p>

<p>different CPU cores on a multi-core or multi-processor
system might be running at different speeds, or might not
have time counters all synchronized, so packets time-stamped
by different cores might not have consistent time
stamps.</p>

<p>In addition, packets time-stamped by different cores
might be time- stamped in one order and added to the queue
of packets for libpcap to read in another order, so time
stamps might not be monotonically increasing.</p>

<p>Some capture devices on some platforms can provide time
stamps for packets; those time stamps are usually
high-resolution time stamps, and are usually applied to the
packet when the first or last bit of the packet arrives, and
are thus more accurate than time stamps provided by the host
operating system. Those time stamps might not, however, be
synchronized with the host operating system s clock, so
that, for exam- ple, the time stamp of a packet might not
correspond to the time stamp of an event on the host
triggered by the arrival of that packet.</p>

<p>Depending on the capture device and the software on the
host, libpcap might allow different types of time stamp to
be used. The pcap_list_tstamp_types(3PCAP) routine provides,
for a packet capture handle created by pcap_create(3PCAP)
but not yet activated by pcap_activate(3PCAP), a list of
time stamp types supported by the cap- ture device for that
handle. The list might be empty, in which case no choice of
time stamp type is offered for that capture device. If the
list is not empty, the pcap_set_tstamp_type(3PCAP) routine
can be used after a pcap_create() call and before a
pcap_activate() call to specify the type of time stamp to be
used on the device. The time stamp types are listed here;
the first value is the #define to use in code, the second
value is the value returned by
pcap_tstamp_type_val_to_name() and accepted by
pcap_tstamp_name_to_val().</p>

<p>PCAP_TSTAMP_HOST - host Time stamp provided by the host
on which the capture is being done. The precision of this
time stamp is unspecified; it might or might not be
synchronized with the host operating systems clock.</p>

<p>PCAP_TSTAMP_HOST_LOWPREC - host_lowprec Time stamp
provided by the host on which the capture is being done.
This is a low-precision time stamp, synchronized with the
host operating systems clock.</p>

<p>PCAP_TSTAMP_HOST_HIPREC - host_hiprec Time stamp
provided by the host on which the capture is being done.
This is a high-precision time stamp; it might or might not
be synchronized with the host operating systems clock. It
might be more expensive to fetch than
PCAP_TSTAMP_HOST_LOWPREC.</p>

<p>PCAP_TSTAMP_ADAPTER - adapter Time stamp provided by the
network adapter on which the cap- ture is being done. This
is a high-precision time stamp, synchronized with the host
operating system s clock.</p>

<p>PCAP_TSTAMP_ADAPTER_UNSYNCED - adapter_unsynced Time
stamp provided by the network adapter on which the cap- ture
is being done. This is a high-precision time stamp; it is
not synchronized with the host operating systems clock.</p>
