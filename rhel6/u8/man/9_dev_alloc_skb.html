<p>NAME dev_alloc_skb - allocate an skbuff for
receiving</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct sk_buff * dev_alloc_skb(unsigned int
length);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS length length to allocate</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Allocate a new sk_buff and assign it a usage
count of one. The buffer has unspecified headroom built in.
Users should allocate the headroom they think they need
without accounting for the built in space. The built in
space is used for optimisations.</p>

<p>NULL is returned if there is no free memory. Although
this function allocates memory it can be called from an
interrupt.</p>
