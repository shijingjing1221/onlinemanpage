<p>FCHMODAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual FCHMODAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME fchmodat - change permissions of a file relative to
a directory file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _ATFILE_SOURCE #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
/* Definition of AT_* constants */ #include
&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fchmodat(int dirfd, const char *pathname, mode_t
mode, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fchmodat() system call operates in
exactly the same way as chmod(2), except for the differences
described in this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it
is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor dirfd (rather than relative to the current
working directory of the calling process, as is done by
chmod(2) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value
AT_FDCWD, then pathname is interpreted relative to the
current working directory of the calling process (like
chmod(2)).</p>

<p>If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.</p>

<p>flags can either be 0, or include the following
flag:</p>

<p>AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW If pathname is a symbolic link, do
not dereference it: instead operate on the link itself. This
flag is not currently imple- mented.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, fchmodat() returns 0. On error,
-1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for chmod(2) can also
occur for fchmodat(). The following additional errors can
occur for fchmodat():</p>

<p>EBADF dirfd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid flag specified in flags.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR pathname is relative and dirfd is a file
descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.</p>

<p>ENOTSUP flags specified AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW, which is
not supported.</p>

<p>VERSIONS fchmodat() was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2008.</p>

<p>NOTES See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for
fchmodat().</p>
