<p>sane-hpsj5s(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-hpsj5s(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-hpsj5s - SANE backend for HP ScanJet 5S
sheet-fed scanner</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-hpsj5s library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to a
parallel port Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 5S scanner.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: this is alpha code. Dont expect this to work
correctly. Many functions are missing, others contain
errors. In some cases, your computer might even hang. It
cannot be excluded (although I consider it extremely
improbable) that your scanner will be damaged.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS: For now this backend works only on Linux.
This limitation is due to dependence on the libieee1284
library. If your system sup- ports libieee1284 too, this
backend should work. If you ported libieee1284 for your
platform, please let me know. Your system should support EPP
(or EPP+ECP ) mode to operate this scanner. Future versions
will support ECP and SPP (Nibble and Byte) modes also. It s
planned to support scanners not only at daisy-chain position
0, but anywhere. Sup- port for multiple scanners could be
implemented too.</p>

<p>Current version implements only gray scale scanning.
True Color and B/W modes are not supported for now.</p>

<p>That said, TESTERS ARE WELCOME. Send your bug reports
and comments to Max Vorobiev &lt;pcwizard@yandex.ru&gt;.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is the parallel port name in form,
libieee1284 expects. It seems to be system dependent. Under
Linux it s parport0, parport1, etc.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the hpsj5s.conf file is a
list of parport names that correspond to HP ScanJet 5S
scanners. Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark
(#) are ignored. Only one device name can be listed in
hpsj5s.conf for this moment. Future versions will support
daisy chain selection.</p>

<p>TIPS It seems that HP ScanJet 5S scanner uses software
noise correction. This feature is not implemented for now.
So does gamma correction and calibration. I ll handle it in
future versions. Native resolution for this scanner is 300
DPI. Other modes could be jagged in some ways.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/hpsj5s.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-hpsj5s.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-hpsj5s.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>
