<p>LDAP_RENAME(3) LDAP_RENAME(3)</p>

<p>NAME ldap_rename, ldap_rename_s - Renames the specified
entry.</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ldap.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ldap_rename( ld, dn, newrdn, newparent,
deleteoldrdn, sctrls[], cctrls[], msgidp ); LDAP *ld; const
char *dn, *newrdn, *newparent; int deleteoldrdn; LDAPControl
*sctrls[], *cctrls[]; int *msgidp);</p>

<p>int ldap_rename_s( ld, dn, newrdn, newparent,
deleteoldrdn, sctrls[], cctrls[] ); LDAP *ld; const char
*dn, *newrdn, *newparent; int deleteoldrdn; LDAPControl
*sctrls[], *cctrls[];</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These routines are used to perform a LDAP
rename operation. The func- tion changes the leaf component
of an entry s distinguished name and optionally moves the
entry to a new parent container. The ldap_rename_s performs
a rename operation synchronously. The method takes dn, which
points to the distinguished name of the entry whose
attribute is being compared, newparent,the distinguished
name of the entry s new parent. If this parameter is NULL,
only the RDN is changed. The root DN is specified by passing
a zero length string, &quot;&quot;. deleteoldrdn specifies
whether the old RDN should be retained or deleted. Zero
indicates that the old RDN should be retained. If you choose
this option, the attribute will contain both names (the old
and the new). Non-zero indicates that the old RDN should be
deleted. serverctrls points to an array of LDAPControl
structures that list the client controls to use with this
extended operation. Use NULL to specify no client controls.
clientctrls points to an array of LDAPControl structures
that list the client controls to use with the search.</p>

<p>ldap_rename works just like ldap_rename_s, but the
operation is asyn- chronous. It returns the message id of
the request it initiated. The result of this operation can
be obtained by calling ldap_result(3).</p>

<p>ERRORS ldap_rename() returns -1 in case of error
initiating the request, and will set the ld_errno field in
the ld parameter to indicate the error. ldap_rename_s()
returns the LDAP error code resulting from the rename
operation.</p>
