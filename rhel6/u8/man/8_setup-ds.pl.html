<p>SETUP-DS.PL(8) SETUP-DS.PL(8)</p>

<p>NAME setup-ds.pl - Set up an instance of Directory
Server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS setup-ds.pl [--options] -- [args]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Set up a Directory Server instance. Creates
the configuration files for an instance of Directory Server
based on a few parameters like the hostname, port number,
and directory manager information. Can be run in interactive
mode with different levels of verbosity, or in silent mode
with parameters supplied in a .inf format file or on the
command line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS A summary of options is included below:</p>

<p>--help This message</p>

<p>--version Print the version and exit</p>

<p>--debug Turn on debugging</p>

<p>--silent Use silent setup - no user input</p>

<p>--file=name Use the file name in .inf format to supply
the default answers</p>

<p>--keepcache Do not delete the temporary .inf file
generated by this program</p>

<p>--logfile Log setup messages to this file - otherwise, a
temp file will be used</p>

<p>--update Update existing installations - add/update
schema files, add/change configuration, add new instance
scripts, etc. You must run setup-ds.pl -u after upgrading
your packages. You will usually have to restart your servers
in order for all of the changes to take effect (e.g.
adding/changing plug-in configura- tion), so schedule this
when you can afford a little downtime.</p>

<p>--continue (Update only) Keep going even if errors
occur. You will usually not need to use this option unless
your installation is broken and you need to force it to
update in order to fix it.</p>

<p>For all options, you can also use the short name e.g.
-h, -d, etc. For the -d argument, specifying it more than
once will increase the debug level e.g. -ddddd</p>

<p>args: You can supply default .inf data in this
format:</p>

<p>section.param=value</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<p>General.FullMachineName=foo.example.com</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>&quot;slapd.Suffix=dc=example, dc=com&quot;</p>

<p>Values passed in this manner will override values in an
.inf file given with the -f argument.</p>

<p>UPDATES The update process (setup-ds.pl -u) can work in
one of two modes:</p>

<p>Online: Configuration changes are made to the running
directory servers using LDAP. The operations must be
performed as an administrative user. You must provide the
name and password, for each instance if there is more than
one instance of directory server. Some changes (e.g.
plug-ins) may require a directory server restart to take
effect. The update script will notify you if a restart is
required.</p>

<p>Offline: The changes are made to the server
configuration files. The servers MUST FIRST BE SHUTDOWN BY
YOU. The script will not shutdown the servers for you. You
MUST shutdown the servers in order to use this mode. A
username and password are not required to use Offline mode.
If the servers are not shutdown, CHANGES WILL BE LOST.</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<p>Online - servers remain running - you must provide admin
name and pass- word for each server - servers may need to be
restarted</p>

<p>Offline - servers must be shutdown - no username or
password required</p>
