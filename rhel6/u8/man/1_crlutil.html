<p>CRLUTIL(1) NSS Security Tools CRLUTIL(1)</p>

<p>NAME crlutil - List, generate, modify, or delete CRLs
within the NSS security database file(s) and list, create,
modify or delete certificates entries in a particular
CRL.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS crlutil [options] [[arguments]]</p>

<p>STATUS This documentation is still work in progress.
Please contribute to the initial review in Mozilla NSS bug
836477[1]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
Management Tool, crlutil, is a command-line utility that can
list, generate, modify, or delete CRLs within the NSS
security database file(s) and list, create, modify or delete
certificates entries in a particular CRL.</p>

<p>The key and certificate management process generally
begins with creating keys in the key database, then
generating and managing certificates in the certificate
database(see certutil tool) and continues with certificates
expiration or revocation.</p>

<p>This document discusses certificate revocation list
management. For information on security module database
management, see Using the Security Module Database Tool. For
information on certificate and key database management, see
Using the Certificate Database Tool.</p>

<p>To run the Certificate Revocation List Management Tool,
type the command</p>

<p>crlutil option [arguments]</p>

<p>where options and arguments are combinations of the
options and arguments listed in the following section. Each
command takes one option. Each option may take zero or more
arguments. To see a usage string, issue the command without
options, or with the -H option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS Options</p>

<p>Options specify an action. Option arguments modify an
action. The options and arguments for the crlutil command
are defined as follows:</p>

<p>-D Delete Certificate Revocation List from cert
database.</p>

<p>-E Erase all CRLs of specified type from the cert
database</p>

<p>-G Create new Certificate Revocation List (CRL).</p>

<p>-I Import a CRL to the cert database</p>

<p>-L List existing CRL located in cert database file.</p>

<p>-M Modify existing CRL which can be located in cert db
or in arbitrary file. If located in file it should be
encoded in ASN.1 encode format.</p>

<p>-S Show contents of a CRL file which isn&rsquo;t stored
in the database.</p>

<p>Arguments</p>

<p>Option arguments modify an action.</p>

<p>-a Use ASCII format or allow the use of ASCII format for
input and output. This formatting follows RFC #1113.</p>

<p>-B Bypass CA signature checks.</p>

<p>-c crl-gen-file Specify script file that will be used to
control crl generation/modification. See crl-cript-file
format below. If options -M|-G is used and -c
crl-script-file is not specified, crlutil will read script
data from standard input.</p>

<p>-d directory Specify the database directory containing
the certificate and key database files. On Unix the
Certificate Database Tool defaults to $HOME/.netscape (that
is, ~/.netscape). On Windows NT the default is the current
directory.</p>

<p>The NSS database files must reside in the same
directory.</p>

<p>-f password-file Specify a file that will automatically
supply the password to include in a certificate or to access
a certificate database. This is a plain-text file containing
one password. Be sure to prevent unauthorized access to this
file.</p>

<p>-i crl-file Specify the file which contains the CRL to
import or show.</p>

<p>-l algorithm-name Specify a specific signature
algorithm. List of possible algorithms: MD2 | MD4 | MD5 |
SHA1 | SHA256 | SHA384 | SHA512</p>

<p>-n nickname Specify the nickname of a certificate or key
to list, create, add to a database, modify, or validate.
Bracket the nickname string with quotation marks if it
contains spaces.</p>

<p>-o output-file Specify the output file name for new CRL.
Bracket the output-file string with quotation marks if it
contains spaces. If this argument is not used the output
destination defaults to standard output.</p>

<p>-P dbprefix Specify the prefix used on the NSS security
database files (for example, my_cert8.db and my_key3.db).
This option is provided as a special case. Changing the
names of the certificate and key databases is not
recommended.</p>

<p>-t crl-type Specify type of CRL. possible types are: 0 -
SEC_KRL_TYPE, 1 - SEC_CRL_TYPE. This option is obsolete</p>

<p>-u url Specify the url.</p>

<p>-w pwd-string Provide db password in command line.</p>

<p>-Z algorithm Specify the hash algorithm to use for
signing the CRL.</p>

<p>CRL GENERATION SCRIPT SYNTAX CRL generation script file
has the following syntax:</p>

<p>* Line with comments should have # as a first symbol of
a line</p>

<p>* Set &quot;this update&quot; or &quot;next update&quot;
CRL fields:</p>

<p>update=YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ nextupdate=YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ</p>

<p>Field &quot;next update&quot; is optional. Time should
be in GeneralizedTime format (YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ). For example:
20050204153000Z</p>

<p>* Add an extension to a CRL or a crl certificate
entry:</p>

<p>addext extension-name critical/non-critical [arg1[arg2
...]]</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>extension-name: string value of a name of known
extensions. critical/non-critical: is 1 when extension is
critical and 0 otherwise. arg1, arg2: specific to extension
type extension parameters</p>

<p>addext uses the range that was set earlier by addcert
and will install an extension to every cert entries within
the range.</p>

<p>* Add certificate entries(s) to CRL:</p>

<p>addcert range date</p>

<p>range: two integer values separated by dash: range of
certificates that will be added by this command. dash is
used as a delimiter. Only one cert will be added if there is
no delimiter. date: revocation date of a cert. Date should
be represented in GeneralizedTime format
(YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ).</p>

<p>* Remove certificate entry(s) from CRL</p>

<p>rmcert range</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>range: two integer values separated by dash: range of
certificates that will be added by this command. dash is
used as a delimiter. Only one cert will be added if there is
no delimiter.</p>

<p>* Change range of certificate entry(s) in CRL</p>

<p>range new-range</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>new-range: two integer values separated by dash: range
of certificates that will be added by this command. dash is
used as a delimiter. Only one cert will be added if there is
no delimiter.</p>

<p>Implemented Extensions</p>

<p>The extensions defined for CRL provide methods for
associating additional attributes with CRLs of theirs
entries. For more information see RFC #3280</p>

<p>* Add The Authority Key Identifier extension:</p>

<p>The authority key identifier extension provides a means
of identifying the public key corresponding to the private
key used to sign a CRL.</p>

<p>authKeyId critical [key-id | dn cert-serial]</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>authKeyIdent: identifies the name of an extension
critical: value of 1 of 0. Should be set to 1 if this
extension is critical or 0 otherwise. key-id: key identifier
represented in octet string. dn:: is a CA distinguished name
cert-serial: authority certificate serial number.</p>

<p>* Add Issuer Alternative Name extension:</p>

<p>The issuer alternative names extension allows additional
identities to be associated with the issuer of the CRL.
Defined options include an rfc822 name (electronic mail
address), a DNS name, an IP address, and a URI.</p>

<p>issuerAltNames non-critical name-list</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>subjAltNames: identifies the name of an extension should
be set to 0 since this is non-critical extension name-list:
comma separated list of names</p>

<p>* Add CRL Number extension:</p>

<p>The CRL number is a non-critical CRL extension which
conveys a monotonically increasing sequence number for a
given CRL scope and CRL issuer. This extension allows users
to easily determine when a particular CRL supersedes another
CRL</p>

<p>crlNumber non-critical number</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>crlNumber: identifies the name of an extension critical:
should be set to 0 since this is non-critical extension
number: value of long which identifies the sequential number
of a CRL.</p>

<p>* Add Revocation Reason Code extension:</p>

<p>The reasonCode is a non-critical CRL entry extension
that identifies the reason for the certificate
revocation.</p>

<p>reasonCode non-critical code</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>reasonCode: identifies the name of an extension
non-critical: should be set to 0 since this is non-critical
extension code: the following codes are available:</p>

<p>unspecified (0), keyCompromise (1), cACompromise (2),
affiliationChanged (3), superseded (4), cessationOfOperation
(5), certificateHold (6), removeFromCRL (8),
privilegeWithdrawn (9), aACompromise (10)</p>

<p>* Add Invalidity Date extension:</p>

<p>The invalidity date is a non-critical CRL entry
extension that provides the date on which it is known or
suspected that the private key was compromised or that the
certificate otherwise became invalid.</p>

<p>invalidityDate non-critical date</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>crlNumber: identifies the name of an extension
non-critical: should be set to 0 since this is non-critical
extension date: invalidity date of a cert. Date should be
represented in GeneralizedTime format (YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ).</p>

<p>USAGE The Certificate Revocation List Management
Tool&rsquo;s capabilities are grouped as follows, using
these combinations of options and arguments. Options and
arguments in square brackets are optional, those without
square brackets are required.</p>

<p>See &quot;Implemented extensions&quot; for more
information regarding extensions and their parameters.</p>
