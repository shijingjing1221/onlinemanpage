<p>NAME unbound - Unbound DNS validating resolver
1.4.20.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS unbound [-h] [-d] [-v] [-c cfgfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Unbound is an implementation of a DNS
resolver, that does caching and DNSSEC validation.</p>

<p>The available options are:</p>

<p>-h Show the version and commandline option help.</p>

<p>-c cfgfile Set the config file with settings for unbound
to read instead of reading the file at the default location,
/etc/unbound/unbound.conf. The syntax is described in
unbound.conf(5).</p>

<p>-d Debug flag, do not fork into the background, but stay
attached to the console. This flag will also delay writing
to the logfile until the thread-spawn time. So that most
config and setup errors appear on stderr.</p>

<p>-v Increase verbosity. If given multiple times, more
information is logged. This is in addition to the verbosity
(if any) from the config file.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO unbound.conf(5), unbound-checkconf(8).</p>

<p>AUTHORS Unbound developers are mentioned in the CREDITS
file in the distribu- tion.</p>
