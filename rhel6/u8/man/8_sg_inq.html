<p>sg_inq [-36] [-a] [-A] [-b] [-c] [-cl] [-d] [-e] [-h]
[-H] [-i] [-l=LEN] [-m] [-M] [-o=OPCODE_PG] [-p=VPD_PG] [-P]
[-r] [-s] [-v] [-V] [-x] [-36] [-?] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This utility by default sends a SCSI INQUIRY
command to the given device and then outputs the response.
All SCSI devices are meant to respond to a
&quot;standard&quot; INQUIRY command with at least a 36 byte
response (in SCSI 2 and higher). An INQUIRY is termed as
&quot;standard&quot; when both the EVPD and CmdDt (obsolete)
bits are clear.</p>

<p>This utility supports two command line syntaxes, the
preferred one is shown first in the synopsis and explained
in this section. A later sec- tion on the old command line
syntax outlines the second group of options.</p>

<p>An important &quot;non-standard&quot; INQUIRY page is
the Device Identification Vital Product Data (VPD) page
[0x83]. Since SPC-3, support for this page is mandatory. The
--id option decodes this page. To get fine grained decoding
of device identification VPD page and recently added VPD
pages, plus some vendor specific VPD pages, see the
sg_vpd(8) util- ity.</p>

<p>If the DEVICE exists and the SCSI INQUIRY fails (because
the SG_IO ioctl is not supported) then an ATA IDENTIFY
(PACKET) DEVICE is tried. If it succeeds then device
identification strings are output. The --raw and --hex
options can be used to manipulate the output. If the --ata
option is given then the SCSI INQUIRY is not performed and
the DEVICE is assumed to be ATA (or ATAPI).</p>

<p>The reference document used for interpreting an INQUIRY
is T10/1713-D Revision 11 (SPC-4, 14 May 2007) found at
http://www.t10.org . Obso- lete items in the standard
INQUIRY response are displayed in brackets. The reference
document for the ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE command is
ATA8-ACS found at http://www.t13.org .</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well. The options are arranged in
alphabetical order based on the long option name.</p>

<p>-a, --ata Assume given DEVICE is an ATA or ATAPI device
which can receive ATA commands from the host operating
system. Skip the SCSI INQUIRY command and use either the ATA
IDENTIFY DEVICE command (for nonpacket devices) or the ATA
IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE com- mand. To show the response in
hex, add a --verbose option. This option is only available
in Linux.</p>

<p>-c, --cmddt set the Command Support Data (CmdDt) bit
(defaults to clear(0)). Used in conjunction with the
--page=PG option where PG specifies the SCSI command opcode
to query. When used twice (e.g. -cc) this utility forms a
list by looping over all 256 opcodes (0 to 255 inclusive)
only outputting a line for found commands. The CmdDt bit is
now obsolete. It has been replaced by the REPORT SUPPORTED
OPERATION CODES command, see the sg_opcodes(8) util-
ity.</p>

<p>-d, --descriptors decodes and prints the version
descriptors found in a standard INQUIRY response. There are
up to 8 of them. Version descriptors indicate which versions
of standards and/or drafts the DEVICE complies with. The
normal components of a standard INQUIRY are output
(typically from the first 36 bytes of the response) fol-
lowed by the version descriptors if any.</p>

<p>-e see entry below for --vpd.</p>

<p>-E, -x, --extended prints the extended INQUIRY VPD page
[0x86].</p>

<p>-h, --help print out the usage message then exit. When
used twice, after the usage message, there is a list of
available abbreviations than can be given to the --page=PG
option.</p>

<p>-H, --hex rather than decode a standard INQUIRY
response, a VPD page or command support data; print out the
response in hex to stdout. Error messages and warnings are
typically output to stderr. When used twice with the ATA
Information VPD page [0x89] decodes the start of the
response then output the ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE
response in hexadecimal bytes (not 16 bit words). When used
three times with the ATA Information VPD page [0x89] or the
--ata option, this utility outputs the ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET)
DEVICE response in hexadecimal words suitable for input to
hdparm --Istdin. See note below.</p>

<p>-i, --id prints the device identification VPD page
[0x83].</p>

<p>-l, --len=LEN the number LEN is the &quot;allocation
length&quot; field in the INQUIRY cdb. This is the (maximum)
length of the response to be sent by the device. The default
value of LEN is 0 which is interpreted as: first request is
for 36 bytes and if necessary execute another INQUIRY if the
&quot;additional length&quot; field in the response
indicates that more than 36 bytes is available. If LEN is
greater than 0 then only one INQUIRY command is performed.
See paragraph below about &quot;36 byte INQUIRYs&quot;.</p>

<p>-m, --maxlen=LEN this option has the same action as the
--len=LEN option. It has been added for compatibility with
the sg_vpd, sg_modes and sg_logs utilities.</p>

<p>-O, --old switch to older style options.</p>

<p>-p, --page=PG the PG argument can be either a number of
an abbreviation for a VPD page. To enumerate the available
abbreviations for VPD pages use -hh or a bad abbreviation
(e.g, --page=xxx). When the --cmddt option is given (once)
then PG is interpreted as an opcode number (so VPD page
abbreviations make little sense).</p>

<p>-r, --raw output the response in binary to stdout. Error
messages and warnings, if any, are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase level of verbosity. Can be used
multiple times.</p>

<p>-V, --version print out version string then exit.</p>

<p>-e, --vpd set the Enable Vital Product Data (EVPD) bit
(defaults to clear(0)). Used in conjunction with the
--page=PG option where PG specifies the VPD page number to
query. If the --page=PG is not given then PG defaults to
zero which is the &quot;Supported VPD pages&quot; VPD
page.</p>

<p>NOTES Some devices with weak SCSI command set
implementations lock up when they receive commands they don
t understand (or even response lengths that they dont
expect). Such devices need to be treated carefully, use the
--len=36 option. Without this option this utility will issue
an initial standard INQUIRY requesting 36 bytes of response
data. If the device indicates it could have supplied more
data then a second INQUIRY is issued to fetch the longer
response. That second command may lock up faulty
devices.</p>

<p>ATA or ATAPI devices that use a SCSI to ATA Translation
layer (see SAT at www.t10.org) may support the ATA
Information VPD page. This returns the IDENTIFY (PACKET)
DEVICE response amongst other things. The ATA Information
VPD page can be fetched with --page=ai.</p>

<p>In the INQUIRY standard response there is a MultiP flag
which is set when the device has 2 or more ports. Some
vendors use the preceding vendor specific (VS) bit to
indicate which port is being accessed by the INQUIRY command
(0 -&gt; relative port 1 (port &quot;a&quot;), 1 -&gt;
relative port 2 (port &quot;b&quot;)). When the MultiP flag
is set, the preceding vendor specific bit is shown in
parentheses. SPC-3 compliant devices should use the device
identification VPD page (0x83) to show which port is being
used for access and the SCSI ports VPD page (0x88) to show
all available ports on the device.</p>

<p>In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the DEVICE must be a
SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block devices
(e.g. disks and ATAPI DVDs) can also be specified. For
example &quot;sg_inq /dev/sda&quot; will work in the 2.6
series kernels. From lk 2.6.6 other SCSI &quot;char&quot;
device names may be used as well (e.g.
&quot;/dev/st0m&quot;).</p>

<p>ATA DEVICES There are two major types of ATA devices:
non-packet devices (e.g. ATA disks) and packet devices
(ATAPI). The majority of ATAPI devices are CD/DVD/BD drives
in which the ATAPI transport carries the MMC set (i.e. a
SCSI command set). Further, both types of ATA devices can be
con- nected to a host computer via a &quot;SCSI&quot; (or
some other) transport. When an ATA disk is controlled via a
SCSI (or non-ATA) transport then two approaches are commonly
used: tunnelling (e.g. STP in Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)) or
by emulating a SCSI device (e.g. with a SCSI to ATA
translation layer, see SAT at www.t10.org ). Even when the
physical transport to the host computer is ATA (especially
in the case of SATA) the operating system may choose to put
a SAT layer in the driver &quot;stack&quot; (e.g. libata in
Linux).</p>

<p>The main identifying command for any SCSI device is an
INQUIRY. The corresponding command for an ATA non-packet
device is IDENTIFY DEVICE while for an ATA packet device it
is IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE.</p>

<p>When this utility is invoked for an ATAPI device (e.g. a
CD/DVD/BD drive with &quot;sg_inq /dev/hdc&quot;) then a
SCSI INQUIRY is sent to the device and if it responds then
the response to decoded and output and this utility exits.
To see the response for an ATA IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE
command add the --ata option (e.g. &quot;sg_inq --ata
/dev/hdc).</p>

<p>This utility doesn t decode the response to an ATA
IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE command, hdparm does a good job at
that. The -HHH option has been added for use with either the
--ata or --page=ai option to produce a format acceptable to
&quot;hdparm --Istdin&quot;. An example: sg_inq --ata -HHH
/dev/hdc | hdparm --Istdin. See hdparm.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_inq is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p>OLDER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS The options in this section
were the only ones available prior to sg3_utils version 1.23
. In sg3_utils version 1.23 and later these older options
can be selected by either setting the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS
environment variable or using --old (or -O) as the first
option.</p>

<p>-36 only requests 36 bytes of response data for an
INQUIRY. Further- more even if the device indicates in its
response it can supply more data, a second (longer) INQUIRY
is not performed. This is a paranoid setting. Equivalent to
--len=36 in the main descrip- tion.</p>

<p>-a fetch the ATA Information VPD page [0x89]. Equivalent
to --page=ai in the main description. This page is defined
in SAT (see at www.t10.org).</p>

<p>-A Assume given DEVICE is an ATA or ATAPI device.
Equivalent to --ata in the main description.</p>

<p>-b decodes the Block Limits VPD page [0xb0]. Equivalent
to --page=bl in the main description. This page is defined
in SBC-2 (see www.t10.org).</p>

<p>-c set the Command Support Data (CmdDt) bit (defaults to
clear(0)). Used in conjunction with the -o=OPCODE_PG option
to specify the SCSI command opcode to query. Equivalent to
--cmddt in the main description.</p>

<p>-cl lists the command data for all supported commands
(followed by the command name) by looping through all 256
opcodes. This option uses the CmdDt bit which is now
obsolete. See the sg_opcodes(8) utility. Equivalent to
--cmddt --cmddt in the main description.</p>

<p>-d decodes depending on context. If -e option is given,
or any option that implies -e (e.g. -i or -p=80), then this
utility attempts to decode the indicated VPD page. Otherwise
the ver- sion descriptors (if any) are listed following a
standard INQUIRY response. In the version descriptors sense,
equivalent to --descriptors in the main description.</p>

<p>-e enable (i.e. sets) the Vital Product Data (EVPD) bit
(defaults to clear(0)). Used in conjunction with the
-p=VPD_PG option to specify the VPD page to fetch. If
-p=VPD_PG is not given then VPD page 0 (list supported VPD
pages) is assumed.</p>

<p>-h outputs INQUIRY response in hex rather than trying to
decode it. Equivalent to --hex in the main description.</p>

<p>-H same action as -h. Equivalent to --hex in the main
description.</p>

<p>-i decodes the Device Identification VPD page [0x83].
Equivalent to --id in the main description. This page is
made up of several &quot;designation descriptors&quot;. If
-h is given then each descriptor header is decoded and the
identifier itself is output in hex. To see the whole VPD
0x83 page response in hex use -p=83 -h.</p>

<p>-m decodes the Management network addresses VPD page
[0x85]. Equiv- alent to --page=mna in the main
description.</p>

<p>-M decodes the Mode page policy VPD page [0x87].
Equivalent to --page=mpp in the main description.</p>

<p>-N switch to the newer style options.</p>

<p>-o=OPCODE_PG used in conjunction with the -e or -c
option. If neither given then the -e option assumed. When
the -e option is also given (or assumed) then the argument
to this option is the VPD page num- ber. The argument is
interpreted as hexadecimal and is expected to be in the
range 0 to ff inclusive. Only VPD page 0 is decoded and it
lists supported VPD pages and their names (if known). To
decode the mandatory device identification page (0x83) use
the -i option. A now obsolete usage is when the -c option is
given in which case the argument to this option is assumed
to be a command opcode number. Recent SCSI draft standards
have moved this facility to a separate command (see
sg_opcodes(8)). Defaults to 0 so if -e is given without this
option then VPD page 0 is output.</p>

<p>-p=VPD_PG same action as -o=OPCODE_PG option described
in the previous entry. Since the opcode value with the CmdDt
is now obsolete, the main use of this option is to specify
the VPD page number. The argument is interpreted as
hexadecimal and is expected to be in the range 0 to ff
inclusive. Defaults to 0 so if -e is given without this
option then VPD page 0 is output.</p>

<p>-P decodes the Unit Path Report VPD page [0xc0] which is
EMC spe- cific. Equivalent to --page=upr in the main
description.</p>

<p>-r outputs the response in binary to stdout. Equivalent
to --raw in the main description. Can be used twice (i.e.
-rr (and -HHH has same effect)) and if used with the -A or
-a option yields output with the same format as &quot;cat
/proc/ide/hd&lt;x&gt;/iden- tify&quot; so that it can then
be piped to &quot;hdparm --Istdin&quot;.</p>

<p>-s decodes the SCSI Ports VPD page [0x88]. Equivalent to
--page=sp in the main description.</p>

<p>-v increase level of verbosity. Can be used multiple
times.</p>

<p>-V print out version string then exit.</p>

<p>-x decodes the Extended INQUIRY data VPD [0x86] page.
Equivalent to --page=ei in the main description.</p>

<p>-? output usage message and exit. Ignore all other
parameters.</p>
