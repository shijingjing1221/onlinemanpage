<p>FORK(2) Linux Programmer s Manual FORK(2)</p>

<p>NAME fork - create a child process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>pid_t fork(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fork() creates a new process by duplicating
the calling process. The new process, referred to as the
child, is an exact duplicate of the calling process,
referred to as the parent, except for the following
points:</p>

<p>* The child has its own unique process ID, and this PID
does not match the ID of any existing process group
(setpgid(2)).</p>

<p>* The childs parent process ID is the same as the
parents process ID.</p>

<p>* The child does not inherit its parents memory locks
(mlock(2), mlockall(2)).</p>

<p>* Process resource utilizations (getrusage(2)) and CPU
time counters (times(2)) are reset to zero in the child.</p>

<p>* The child s set of pending signals is initially empty
(sigpend- ing(2)).</p>

<p>* The child does not inherit semaphore adjustments from
its parent (semop(2)).</p>

<p>* The child does not inherit record locks from its
parent (fcntl(2)).</p>

<p>* The child does not inherit timers from its parent
(setitimer(2), alarm(2), timer_create(2)).</p>

<p>* The child does not inherit outstanding asynchronous
I/O operations from its parent (aio_read(3), aio_write(3)),
nor does it inherit any asynchronous I/O contexts from its
parent (seeio_setup(2)).</p>

<p>The process attributes in the preceding list are all
specified in POSIX.1-2001. The parent and child also differ
with respect to the following Linux-specific process
attributes:</p>

<p>* The child does not inherit directory change
notifications (dnotify) from its parent (see the description
of F_NOTIFY in fcntl(2)).</p>

<p>* The prctl(2) PR_SET_PDEATHSIG setting is reset so that
the child does not receive a signal when its parent
terminates.</p>

<p>* Memory mappings that have been marked with the
madvise(2) MADV_DONT- FORK flag are not inherited across a
fork().</p>

<p>* The termination signal of the child is always SIGCHLD
(see clone(2)).</p>

<p>Note the following further points:</p>

<p>* The child process is created with a single thread the
one that called fork(). The entire virtual address space of
the parent is replicated in the child, including the states
of mutexes, condition variables, and other pthreads objects;
the use of pthread_atfork(3) may be helpful for dealing with
problems that this can cause.</p>

<p>* The child inherits copies of the parents set of open
file descrip- tors. Each file descriptor in the child refers
to the same open file description (see open(2)) as the
corresponding file descriptor in the parent. This means that
the two descriptors share open file status flags, current
file offset, and signal-driven I/O attributes (see the
description of F_SETOWN and F_SETSIG in fcntl(2)).</p>

<p>* The child inherits copies of the parents set of open
message queue descriptors (see mq_overview(7)). Each
descriptor in the child refers to the same open message
queue description as the correspond- ing descriptor in the
parent. This means that the two descriptors share the same
flags (mq_flags).</p>

<p>* The child inherits copies of the parent s set of open
directory streams (see opendir(3)). POSIX.1-2001 says that
the corresponding directory streams in the parent and child
may share the directory stream positioning; on Linux/glibc
they do not.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, the PID of the child process is
returned in the parent, and 0 is returned in the child. On
failure, -1 is returned in the parent, no child process is
created, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN fork() cannot allocate sufficient memory
to copy the parents page tables and allocate a task
structure for the child.</p>

<p>EAGAIN It was not possible to create a new process
because the callers RLIMIT_NPROC resource limit was
encountered. To exceed this limit, the process must have
either the CAP_SYS_ADMIN or the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE
capability.</p>

<p>ENOMEM fork() failed to allocate the necessary kernel
structures because memory is tight.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Under Linux, fork() is implemented using
copy-on-write pages, so the only penalty that it incurs is
the time and memory required to dupli- cate the parents page
tables, and to create a unique task structure for the
child.</p>

<p>Since version 2.3.3, rather than invoking the kernels
fork() system call, the glibc fork() wrapper that is
provided as part of the NPTL threading implementation
invokes clone(2) with flags that provide the same effect as
the traditional system call. The glibc wrapper invokes any
fork handlers that have been established using
pthread_atfork(3).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE See pipe(2) and wait(2).</p>
