<p>DOT(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual DOT(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME dot - execute commands in the current
environment</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS . file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The shell shall execute commands from the
file in the current environ- ment.</p>

<p>If file does not contain a slash, the shell shall use
the search path specified by PATH to find the directory
containing file. Unlike normal command search, however, the
file searched for by the dot utility need not be executable.
If no readable file is found, a non-interactive shell shall
abort; an interactive shell shall write a diagnostic mes-
sage to standard error, but this condition shall not be
considered a syntax error.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS Returns the value of the last command
executed, or a zero exit status if no command is
executed.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES cat foobar foo=hello bar=world. foobar echo
$foo $bar hello world</p>

<p>RATIONALE Some older implementations searched the
current directory for the file, even if the value of PATH
disallowed it. This behavior was omitted from this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 due to concerns about intro- ducing the
susceptibility to trojan horses that the user might be try-
ing to avoid by leaving dot out of PATH.</p>

<p>The KornShell version of dot takes optional arguments
that are set to the positional parameters. This is a valid
extension that allows a dot script to behave identically to
a function.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
