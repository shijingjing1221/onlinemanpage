<p>NAME ionice - get/set program io scheduling class and
priority</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ionice [[-c class] [-n classdata] [-t]] -p PID
[PID]... ionice [-c class] [-n classdata] [-t] COMMAND
[ARG]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program sets or gets the io scheduling
class and priority for a program. If no arguments or just -p
is given, ionice will query the current io scheduling class
and priority for that process.</p>

<p>As of this writing, a process can be in one of three
scheduling classes:</p>

<p>Idle A program running with idle io priority will only
get disk time when no other program has asked for disk io
for a defined grace period. The impact of idle io processes
on normal system activ- ity should be zero. This scheduling
class does not take a prior- ity argument. Presently, this
scheduling class is permitted for an ordinary user (since
kernel 2.6.25).</p>

<p>Best effort This is the effective scheduling class for
any process that has not asked for a specific io priority.
This class takes a prior- ity argument from 0-7, with lower
number being higher priority. Programs running at the same
best effort priority are served in a round-robin
fashion.</p>

<p>Note that before kernel 2.6.26 a process that has not
asked for an io priority formally uses &quot;none&quot; as
scheduling class, but the io scheduler will treat such
processes as if it were in the best effort class. The
priority within the best effort class will be dynamically
derived from the cpu nice level of the process: io_priority
= (cpu_nice + 20) / 5.</p>

<p>For kernels after 2.6.26 with CFQ io scheduler a process
that has not asked for an io priority inherits CPU
scheduling class. The io priority is derived from the cpu
nice level of the pro- cess (same as before kernel
2.6.26).</p>

<p>Real time The RT scheduling class is given first access
to the disk, regardless of what else is going on in the
system. Thus the RT class needs to be used with some care,
as it can starve other processes. As with the best effort
class, 8 priority levels are defined denoting how big a time
slice a given process will receive on each scheduling
window. This scheduling class is not permitted for an
ordinary (i.e., non-root) user.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c class The scheduling class name or number. 0
for none, 1 for realtime, 2 for best-effort, 3 for idle.</p>

<p>-n classdata The scheduling class data. This defines the
class data, if the class accepts an argument. For real time
and best-effort, 0-7 is valid data.</p>

<p>-p pid Pass in process PID(s) to view or change already
running pro- cesses. If this argument is not given, ionice
will run the listed program with the given parameters.</p>

<p>-t Ignore failure to set requested priority. If COMMAND
or PID(s) is specified, run it even in case it was not
possible to set desired scheduling priority, what can happen
due to insufficient privilegies or old kernel version.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES # ionice -c 3 -p 89</p>

<p>Sets process with PID 89 as an idle io process.</p>

<p># ionice -c 2 -n 0 bash</p>

<p>Runs bash as a best-effort program with highest
priority.</p>

<p># ionice -p 89 91</p>

<p>Prints the class and priority of the processes with PID
89 and 91.</p>

<p>NOTES Linux supports io scheduling priorities and
classes since 2.6.13 with the CFQ io scheduler.</p>
