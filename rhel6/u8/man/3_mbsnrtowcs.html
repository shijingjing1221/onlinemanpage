<p>MBSNRTOWCS(3) Linux Programmer s Manual

<p>NAME mbsnrtowcs - convert a multibyte string to a
wide-character string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t mbsnrtowcs(wchar_t *dest, const char **src,
size_t nms, size_t len, mbstate_t *ps);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mbsnrtowcs() function is like the
mbsrtowcs(3) function, except that the number of bytes to be
converted, starting at *src, is limited to nms.</p>

<p>If dest is not a NULL pointer, the mbsnrtowcs() function
converts at most nms bytes from the multibyte string *src to
a wide-character string starting at dest. At most len wide
characters are written to dest. The shift state *ps is
updated. The conversion is effectively performed by
repeatedly calling mbrtowc(dest, *src, n, ps) where n is
some positive number, as long as this call succeeds, and
then incre- menting dest by one and *src by the number of
bytes consumed. The con- version can stop for three
reasons:</p>

<p>1. An invalid multibyte sequence has been encountered.
In this case *src is left pointing to the invalid multibyte
sequence, (size_t) -1 is returned, and errno is set to
EILSEQ.</p>

<p>2. The nms limit forces a stop, or len non-L&rsquo;
&rsquo; wide characters have been stored at dest. In this
case *src is left pointing to the next multibyte sequence to
be converted, and the number of wide charac- ters written to
dest is returned.</p>

<p>3. The multibyte string has been completely converted,
including the terminating &rsquo; &rsquo; (which has the
side effect of bringing back *ps to the initial state). In
this case *src is set to NULL, and the num- ber of wide
characters written to dest, excluding the terminating
L&rsquo; &rsquo; character, is returned.</p>

<p>If dest is NULL, len is ignored, and the conversion
proceeds as above, except that the converted wide characters
are not written out to mem- ory, and that no destination
length limit exists.</p>

<p>In both of the above cases, if ps is a NULL pointer, a
static anonymous state only known to the mbsnrtowcs function
is used instead.</p>

<p>The programmer must ensure that there is room for at
least len wide characters at dest.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The mbsnrtowcs() function returns the
number of wide characters that make up the converted part of
the wide-character string, not including the terminating
null wide character. If an invalid multibyte sequence was
encountered, (size_t) -1 is returned, and errno set to
EILSEQ.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function is a GNU extension.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of mbsnrtowcs() depends on the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.</p>

<p>Passing NULL as ps is not multithread safe.</p>
