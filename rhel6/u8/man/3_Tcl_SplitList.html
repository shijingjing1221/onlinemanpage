<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_SplitList, Tcl_Merge, Tcl_ScanElement,
Tcl_ConvertElement, Tcl_ScanCountedElement,
Tcl_ConvertCountedElement - manipulate Tcl lists</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tcl_SplitList(interp, list, argcPtr, argvPtr)</p>

<p>char * Tcl_Merge(argc, argv)</p>

<p>int Tcl_ScanElement(src, flagsPtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_ScanCountedElement(src, length, flagsPtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_ConvertElement(src, dst, flags)</p>

<p>int Tcl_ConvertCountedElement(src, length, dst,
flags)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (out) Interpreter to use
for error reporting. If NULL, then no error message is
left.</p>

<p>char *list (in) Pointer to a string with proper list
structure.</p>

<p>int *argcPtr (out) Filled in with number of elements in
list.</p>

<p>const char ***argvPtr (out) *argvPtr will be filled in
with the address of an array of pointers to the strings that
are the extracted ele- ments of list. There will be *argcPtr
valid entries in the array, followed by a NULL entry.</p>

<p>int argc (in) Number of elements in argv.</p>

<p>const char *const *argv (in) Array of strings to merge
together into a single list. Each string will become a
separate element of the list.</p>

<p>const char *src (in) String that is to become an element
of a list.</p>

<p>int *flagsPtr (in) Pointer to word to fill in with
information about src. The value of *flagsPtr must be passed
to Tcl_ConvertEle- ment.</p>

<p>int length (in) Number of bytes in string src.</p>

<p>char *dst (in) Place to copy converted list element.
Must contain enough characters to hold converted string.</p>

<p>int flags (in) Information about src. Must be value
returned by previ- ous call to Tcl_ScanElement, possibly
OR-ed with TCL_DONT_USE_BRACES.

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures may be used to disassemble
and reassemble Tcl lists. Tcl_SplitList breaks a list up
into its constituent elements, returning an array of
pointers to the elements using argcPtr and argvPtr. While
extracting the arguments, Tcl_SplitList obeys the usual
rules for back- slash substitutions and braces. The area of
memory pointed to by *argvPtr is dynamically allocated; in
addition to the array of point- ers, it also holds copies of
all the list elements. It is the callers responsibility to
free up all of this storage. For example, suppose that you
have called Tcl_SplitList with the following code: int argc,
code; char *string; char **argv; ... code =
Tcl_SplitList(interp, string, &amp;argc, &amp;argv); Then
you should eventually free the storage with a call like the
fol- lowing: Tcl_Free((char *) argv);</p>

<p>Tcl_SplitList normally returns TCL_OK, which means the
list was suc- cessfully parsed. If there was a syntax error
in list, then TCL_ERROR is returned and the interpreters
result will point to an error message describing the problem
(if interp was not NULL). If TCL_ERROR is returned then no
memory is allocated and *argvPtr is not modified.</p>

<p>Tcl_Merge is the inverse of Tcl_SplitList: it takes a
collection of strings given by argc and argv and generates a
result string that has proper list structure. This means
that commands like index may be used to extract the original
elements again. In addition, if the result of Tcl_Merge is
passed to Tcl_Eval, it will be parsed into argc words whose
values will be the same as the argv strings passed to
Tcl_Merge. Tcl_Merge will modify the list elements with
braces and/or backslashes in order to produce proper Tcl
list structure. The result string is dynamically allocated
using Tcl_Alloc; the caller must eventually release the
space using Tcl_Free.</p>

<p>If the result of Tcl_Merge is passed to Tcl_SplitList,
the elements returned by Tcl_SplitList will be identical to
those passed into Tcl_Merge. However, the converse is not
true: if Tcl_SplitList is passed a given string, and the
resulting argc and argv are passed to Tcl_Merge, the
resulting string may not be the same as the original string
passed to Tcl_SplitList. This is because Tcl_Merge may use
backslashes and braces differently than the original
string.</p>

<p>Tcl_ScanElement and Tcl_ConvertElement are the
procedures that do all of the real work of Tcl_Merge.
Tcl_ScanElement scans its src argument and determines how to
use backslashes and braces when converting it to a list
element. It returns an overestimate of the number of
characters required to represent src as a list element, and
it stores information in *flagsPtr that is needed by
Tcl_ConvertElement.</p>

<p>Tcl_ConvertElement is a companion procedure to
Tcl_ScanElement. It does the actual work of converting a
string to a list element. Its flags argument must be the
same as the value returned by Tcl_ScanEle- ment.
Tcl_ConvertElement writes a proper list element to memory
start- ing at *dst and returns a count of the total number
of characters writ- ten, which will be no more than the
result returned by Tcl_ScanElement. Tcl_ConvertElement
writes out only the actual list element without any leading
or trailing spaces: it is up to the caller to include spaces
between adjacent list elements.</p>

<p>Tcl_ConvertElement uses one of two different approaches
to handle the special characters in src. Wherever possible,
it handles special char- acters by surrounding the string
with braces. This produces clean- looking output, but cannot
be used in some situations, such as when src contains
unmatched braces. In these situations, Tcl_ConvertElement
handles special characters by generating backslash sequences
for them. The caller may insist on the second approach by
OR-ing the flag value returned by Tcl_ScanElement with
TCL_DONT_USE_BRACES. Although this will produce an uglier
result, it is useful in some special situations, such as
when Tcl_ConvertElement is being used to generate a portion
of an argument for a Tcl command. In this case, surrounding
src with curly braces would cause the command not to be
parsed correctly.</p>

<p>By default, Tcl_ConvertElement will use quoting in its
output to be sure the first character of an element is not
the hash character (#.) This is to be sure the first element
of any list passed to eval is not mis-parsed as the
beginning of a comment. When a list element is not the first
element of a list, this quoting is not necessary. When the
caller can be sure that the element is not the first element
of a list, it can disable quoting of the leading hash
character by OR-ing the flag value returned by
Tcl_ScanElement with TCL_DONT_QUOTE_HASH.</p>

<p>Tcl_ScanCountedElement and Tcl_ConvertCountedElement are
the same as Tcl_ScanElement and Tcl_ConvertElement, except
the length of string src is specified by the length
argument, and the string may contain embed- ded nulls.</p>
