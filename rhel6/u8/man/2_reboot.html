<p>REBOOT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual REBOOT(2)</p>

<p>NAME reboot - reboot or enable/disable Ctrl-Alt-Del</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /* For libc4 and libc5 the library call and the
system call are identical, and since kernel version 2.1.30
there are symbolic names LINUX_REBOOT_* for the constants
and a fourth argument to the call: */</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include
&lt;linux/reboot.h&gt;</p>

<p>int reboot(int magic, int magic2, int cmd, void
*arg);</p>

<p>/* Under glibc some of the constants involved have
gotten symbolic names RB_*, and the library call is a
1-argument wrapper around the 3-argument system call: */</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/reboot.h&gt;</p>

<p>int reboot(int cmd);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The reboot() call reboots the system, or
enables/disables the reboot keystroke (abbreviated CAD,
since the default is Ctrl-Alt-Delete; it can be changed
using loadkeys(1)).</p>

<p>This system call will fail (with EINVAL) unless magic
equals LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC1 (that is, 0xfee1dead) and magic2
equals LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2 (that is, 672274793). However,
since 2.1.17 also LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2A (that is, 85072278)
and since 2.1.97 also LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2B (that is,
369367448) and since 2.5.71 also LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2C (that
is, 537993216) are permitted as value for magic2. (The
hexadecimal values of these constants are meaningful.) The
cmd argument can have the following values:</p>

<p>LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART (RB_AUTOBOOT, 0x1234567). The
message &quot;Restarting system.&quot; is printed, and a
default restart is performed immediately. If not preceded by
a sync(2), data will be lost.</p>

<p>LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_HALT (RB_HALT_SYSTEM, 0xcdef0123; since
1.1.76). The message &quot;System halted.&quot; is printed,
and the system is halted. Control is given to the ROM
monitor, if there is one. If not preceded by a sync(2), data
will be lost.</p>

<p>LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_POWER_OFF (0x4321fedc; since 2.1.30).
The message &quot;Power down.&quot; is printed, the system
is stopped, and all power is removed from the system, if
possible. If not preceded by a sync(2), data will be
lost.</p>

<p>LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART2 (0xa1b2c3d4; since 2.1.30).
The message &quot;Restarting system with command
&rsquo;%s&rsquo;&quot; is printed, and a restart (using the
command string given in arg) is performed immediately. If
not preceded by a sync(2), data will be lost.</p>

<p>LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_CAD_ON (RB_ENABLE_CAD, 0x89abcdef). CAD
is enabled. This means that the CAD keystroke will
immediately cause the action associated with
LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART.</p>

<p>LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_CAD_OFF (RB_DISABLE_CAD, 0). CAD is
disabled. This means that the CAD keystroke will cause a
SIGINT signal to be sent to init (process 1), whereupon this
process may decide upon a proper action (maybe: kill all
processes, sync, reboot).</p>

<p>Only the superuser may call reboot().</p>

<p>The precise effect of the above actions depends on the
architecture. For the i386 architecture, the additional
argument does not do anything at present (2.1.122), but the
type of reboot can be determined by ker- nel command-line
arguments (&quot;reboot=...&quot;) to be either warm or
cold, and either hard or through the BIOS.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE For the values of cmd that stop or restart
the system, a successful call to reboot() does not return.
For the other cmd values, zero is returned on success. In
all cases, -1 is returned on failure, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT Problem with getting userspace data under
LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART2.</p>

<p>EINVAL Bad magic numbers or cmd.</p>

<p>EPERM The calling process has insufficient privilege to
call reboot(); the CAP_SYS_BOOT capability is required.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO reboot() is Linux-specific, and should not
be used in programs intended to be portable.</p>
