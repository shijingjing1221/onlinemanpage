<p>NAME join - join lines of two files on a common
field</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS join [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For each pair of input lines with identical
join fields, write a line to standard output. The default
join field is the first, delimited by whitespace. When FILE1
or FILE2 (not both) is -, read standard input.</p>

<p>-a FILENUM print unpairable lines coming from file
FILENUM, where FILENUM is 1 or 2, corresponding to FILE1 or
FILE2</p>

<p>-e EMPTY replace missing input fields with EMPTY</p>

<p>-i, --ignore-case ignore differences in case when
comparing fields</p>

<p>-j FIELD equivalent to -1 FIELD -2 FIELD</p>

<p>-o FORMAT obey FORMAT while constructing output line</p>

<p>-t CHAR use CHAR as input and output field separator</p>

<p>-v FILENUM like -a FILENUM, but suppress joined output
lines</p>

<p>-1 FIELD join on this FIELD of file 1</p>

<p>-2 FIELD join on this FIELD of file 2</p>

<p>--check-order check that the input is correctly sorted,
even if all input lines are pairable</p>

<p>--nocheck-order do not check that the input is correctly
sorted</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>Unless -t CHAR is given, leading blanks separate fields
and are ignored, else fields are separated by CHAR. Any
FIELD is a field num- ber counted from 1. FORMAT is one or
more comma or blank separated specifications, each being
FILENUM.FIELD or 0 . Default FORMAT out- puts the join
field, the remaining fields from FILE1, the remaining fields
from FILE2, all separated by CHAR.</p>

<p>Important: FILE1 and FILE2 must be sorted on the join
fields. E.g., use sort -k 1b,1 if join has no options. Note,
comparisons honor the rules specified by LC_COLLATE. If the
input is not sorted and some lines cannot be joined, a
warning message will be given.</p>
