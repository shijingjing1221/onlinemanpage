<p>NAME ldap - OpenLDAP Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol API</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ldap.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) (RFC 4510) provides access to X.500 directory
services. These services may be stand-alone or part of a
distributed directory service. This client API supports LDAP
over TCP (RFC 4511), LDAP over TLS/SSL, and LDAP over IPC
(UNIX domain sockets). This API supports SASL (RFC 4513) and
Start TLS (RFC 4513) as well as a number of protocol
extensions. This API is loosely based upon IETF/LDAPEXT C
LDAP API draft specification, a (orphaned) work in
progress.</p>

<p>The OpenLDAP Software package includes a stand-alone
server in slapd(8), various LDAP clients, and an LDAP client
library used to pro- vide programmatic access to the LDAP
protocol. This man page gives an overview of the LDAP
library routines.</p>

<p>Both synchronous and asynchronous APIs are provided.
Also included are various routines to parse the results
returned from these routines. These routines are found in
the -lldap library.</p>

<p>The basic interaction is as follows. A session handle is
created using ldap_initialize(3) and set the protocol
version to 3 by calling ldap_set_option(3). The underlying
session is established first opera- tion is issued. This
would generally be a Start TLS or Bind operation, or a
Search operation to read attributes of the Root DSE. A Start
TLS operation is performed by calling ldap_start_tls_s(3). A
LDAP bind operation is performed by calling
ldap_sasl_bind(3) or one of its friends. A Search operation
is performed by calling ldap_search_ext_s(3) or one of its
friends.</p>

<p>Subsequently, additional operations are performed by
calling one of the synchronous or asynchronous routines
(e.g., ldap_compare_ext_s(3) or ldap_compare_ext(3) followed
by ldap_result(3)). Results returned from these routines are
interpreted by calling the LDAP parsing routines such as
ldap_parse_result(3). The LDAP association and underlying
con- nection is terminated by calling ldap_unbind_ext(3).
Errors can be interpreted by calling ldap_err2string(3).</p>

<p>LDAP versions This library supports version 3 of the
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAPv3) as defined in
RFC 4510. It also supports a variant of version 2 of LDAP as
defined by U-Mich LDAP and, to some degree, RFC 1777.
Version 2 (all variants) are considered obsolete. Version 3
should be used instead.</p>

<p>For backwards compatibility reasons, the library
defaults to version 2. Hence, all new applications (and all
actively maintained applications) should use
ldap_set_option(3) to select version 3. The library manual
pages assume version 3 has been selected.</p>

<p>INPUT and OUTPUT PARAMETERS All character string
input/output is expected to be/is UTF-8 encoded Unicode
(version 3.2).</p>

<p>Distinguished names (DN) (and relative distinguished
names (RDN) to be passed to the LDAP routines should conform
to RFC 4514 UTF-8 string representation.</p>

<p>Search filters to be passed to the search routines are
to be con- structed by hand and should conform to RFC 4515
UTF-8 string represen- tation.</p>

<p>LDAP URLs to be passed to routines are expected to
conform to RFC 4516 format. The ldap_url(3) routines can be
used to work with LDAP URLs.</p>

<p>LDAP controls to be passed to routines can be
manipulated using the ldap_controls(3) routines.</p>

<p>DISPLAYING RESULTS Results obtained from the search
routines can be output by hand, by calling
ldap_first_entry(3) and ldap_next_entry(3) to step through
the entries returned, ldap_first_attribute(3) and
ldap_next_attribute(3) to step through an entrys attributes,
and ldap_get_values(3) to retrieve a given attributes
values. Attribute values may or may not be dis-
playable.</p>

<p>UTILITY ROUTINES Also provided are various utility
routines. The ldap_sort(3) routines are used to sort the
entries and values returned via the ldap search
routines.</p>

<p>DEPRECATED INTERFACES A number of interfaces are now
considered deprecated. For instance, ldap_add(3) is
deprecated in favor of ldap_add_ext(3). Deprecated
interfaces generally remain in the library. The macro
LDAP_DEPRECATED can be defined to a non-zero value (e.g.,
-DLDAP_DEPRECATED=1) when compiling program designed to use
deprecated interfaces. It is recom- mended that developers
writing new programs, or updating old programs, avoid use of
deprecated interfaces. Over time, it is expected that
documentation (and, eventually, support) for deprecated
interfaces to be eliminated.</p>

<p>BER LIBRARY Also included in the distribution is a set
of lightweight Basic Encod- ing Rules routines. These
routines are used by the LDAP library rou- tines to encode
and decode LDAP protocol elements using the (slightly
simplified) Basic Encoding Rules defined by LDAP. They are
not nor- mally used directly by an LDAP application program
except in the han- dling of controls and extended
operations. The routines provide a printf and scanf-like
interface, as well as lower-level access. These routines are
discussed in lber-decode(3), lber-encode(3), lber-mem-
ory(3), and lber-types(3).</p>
