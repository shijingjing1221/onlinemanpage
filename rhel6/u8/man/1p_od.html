<p>OD(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual OD(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME od - dump files in various formats</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS od [-v][-A address_base][-j skip][-N count][-t
type_string]... [file...]</p>

<p>od [-bcdosx][file] [[+]offset[.][b]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The od utility shall write the contents of
its input files to standard output in a user-specified
format.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The od utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines, except that the order of
presentation of the -t options and the -bcdosx options is
significant.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-A address_base</p>

<p>Specify the input offset base. See the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION sec- tion. The application shall ensure that the
address_base option-argument is a character. The characters,
o , andx specify that the offset base shall be written in
decimal, octal, or hexadecimal, respectively. The character
n specifies that the offset shall not be written.</p>

<p>-b Interpret bytes in octal. This shall be equivalent to
-t o1.</p>

<p>-c Interpret bytes as characters specified by the
current setting of the LC_CTYPE category. Certain
non-graphic characters appear b as C escapes:
&quot;NUL0&quot;, &quot;BS&quot;&quot;, &quot;FFf&quot;,
&quot;NLn&quot;,r&quot;, &quot;CR= &quot;HTt&quot; ; others
appear as 3-digit octal numbers.</p>

<p>-d Interpret words (two-byte units) in unsigned decimal.
This shall be equivalent to -t u2.</p>

<p>-j skip Jump over skip bytes from the beginning of the
input. The od utility shall read or seek past the first skip
bytes in the con- catenated input files. If the combined
input is not at least skip bytes long, the od utility shall
write a diagnostic message to standard error and exit with a
non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>By default, the skip option-argument shall be
interpreted as a decimal number. With a leading 0x or 0X,
the offset shall be interpreted as a hexadecimal number;
otherwise, with a leading, the offset shall be interpreted
as an octal number. Appending the character , k , or m to
offset shall cause it to be interpreted as a multiple of
512, 1024, or 1048576 bytes, respectively. If the skip
number is hexadecimal, any appendedbshall be considered to
be the final hex- adecimal digit.</p>

<p>-N count Format no more than count bytes of input. By
default, count shall be interpreted as a decimal number.
With a leading 0x or 0X, count shall be interpreted as a
hexadecimal number; other- wise, with a leading, it shall be
interpreted as an octal number. If count bytes of input
(after successfully skipping, if -j skip is specified) are
not available, it shall not be consid- ered an error; the od
utility shall format the input that is available.</p>

<p>-o Interpret words (two-byte units) in octal. This shall
be equiva- lent to -t o2.</p>

<p>-s Interpret words (two-byte units) in signed decimal.
This shall be equivalent to -t d2.</p>

<p>-t type_string</p>

<p>Specify one or more output types. See the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION section. The application shall ensure that the
type_string option-argument is a string specifying the types
to be used when writing the input data. The string shall
consist of the type specification characters a, c, d, f, o,
u, and x, specifying named character, character, signed
decimal, floating point, octal, unsigned decimal, and
hexadecimal, respectively. The type specification characters
d, f, o, u, and x can be followed by an optional unsigned
decimal integer that specifies the number of bytes to be
transformed by each instance of the output type. The type
specification character f can be followed by an optional F,
D, or L indicating that the conversion should be applied to
an item of type float, double, or long double, respectively.
The type specification characters d, o, u, and x can be
followed by an optional C, S, I, or L indicating that the
conversion should be applied to an item of type char, short,
int, or long, respec- tively. Multiple types can be
concatenated within the same type_string and multiple -t
options can be specified. Output lines shall be written for
each type specified in the order in which the type
specification characters are specified.</p>

<p>-v Write all input data. Without the -v option, any
number of groups of output lines, which would be identical
to the immedi- ately preceding group of output lines (except
for the byte off- sets), shall be replaced with a line
containing only an asterisk (*).</p>

<p>-x Interpret words (two-byte units) in hexadecimal. This
shall be equivalent to -t x2.</p>

<p>Multiple types can be specified by using multiple
-bcdostx options. Output lines are written for each type
specified in the order in which the types are specified.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a file to be read. If no file
operands are speci- fied, the standard input shall be
used.</p>

<p>If there are no more than two operands, none of the -A,
-j, -N, or -t options is specified, and either of the
following is true: the first character of the last operand
is a plus sign (+), or there are two operands and the first
character of the last operand is numeric; the last operand
shall be interpreted as an offset operand on XSI-confor-
mant systems. Under these conditions, the results are
unspecified on systems that are not XSI-conformant
systems.</p>

<p>[+]offset[.][b] The offset operand specifies the offset
in the file where dump- ing is to commence. This operand is
normally interpreted as octal bytes. If .is appended, the
offset shall be interpreted in decimal. Ifbis appended, the
offset shall be interpreted in units of 512 bytes.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied. See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files can be any file type.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of od:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>LC_NUMERIC</p>

<p>Determine the locale for selecting the radix character
used when writing floating-point formatted output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION The od utility shall copy
sequentially each input file to standard out- put,
transforming the input data according to the output types
speci- fied by the -t option or the -bcdosx options. If no
output type is specified, the default output shall be as if
-t oS had been specified.</p>

<p>The number of bytes transformed by the output type
specifier c may be variable depending on the LC_CTYPE
category.</p>

<p>The default number of bytes transformed by output type
specifiers d, f, o, u, and x corresponds to the various
C-language types as follows. If the c99 compiler is present
on the system, these specifiers shall cor- respond to the
sizes used by default in that compiler. Otherwise, these
sizes may vary among systems that conform to IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>* For the type specifier characters d, o, u, and x, the
default number of bytes shall correspond to the size of the
underlying implementa- tions basic integer type. For these
specifier characters, the implementation shall support
values of the optional number of bytes to be converted
corresponding to the number of bytes in the C-lan- guage
types char, short, int, and long. These numbers can also be
specified by an application as the characters,, I , and L,
respectively. The implementation shall also support the
values 1, 2, 4, and 8, even if it provides no C-Language
types of those sizes. The implementation shall support the
decimal value corre- sponding to the C-language type long
long. The byte order used when interpreting numeric values
is implementation-defined, but shall correspond to the order
in which a constant of the corresponding type is stored in
memory on the system.</p>

<p>* For the type specifier character f, the default number
of bytes shall correspond to the number of bytes in the
underlying implemen- tation s basic double precision
floating-point data type. The imple- mentation shall support
values of the optional number of bytes to be converted
corresponding to the number of bytes in the C-language types
float, double, and long double. These numbers can also be
specified by an application as the characters , , and L ,
respectively.</p>

<p>The type specifier character a specifies that bytes
shall be inter- preted as named characters from the
International Reference Version (IRV) of the ISO/IEC
646:1991 standard. Only the least significant seven bits of
each byte shall be used for this type specification. Bytes
with the values listed in the following table shall be
written using the corresponding names for those
characters.</p>

<p>Table: Named Characters in od</p>

<p>Value Name Value Name Value Name Value Name 000 nul 001
soh 002 stx 003 etx 004 eot 005 enq 006 ack 007 bel 010 bs
011 ht 012 lf or nl 013 vt 014 ff 015 cr 016 so 017 si 020
dle 021 dc1 022 dc2 023 dc3 024 dc4 025 nak 026 syn 027 etb
030 can 031 em 032 sub 033 esc 034 fs 035 gs 036 rs 037 us
040 sp 177 del</p>

<p>Note: The 012&quot; value may be written either as lf or
nl.</p>

<p>The type specifier character c specifies that bytes
shall be inter- preted as characters specified by the
current setting of the LC_CTYPE locale category. Characters
listed in the table in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 5, File Format Notation \) shall be
written as the b, corresponding escape sequences, except
that backslash shall be written as a single backslash and a
NUL shall be written a0. Other non- printable characters
shall be written as one three-digit octal number for each
byte in the character. If the size of a byte on the system
is greater than nine bits, the format used for non-printable
characters is implementation-defined. Printable multi-byte
characters shall be writ- ten in the area corresponding to
the first byte of the character; the two-character sequence
&quot;**&quot; shall be written in the area corresponding to
each remaining byte in the character, as an indication that
the character is continued. When either the -j skip or -N
count option is specified along with the c type specifier,
and this results in an attempt to start or finish in the
middle of a multi-byte character, the result is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The input data shall be manipulated in blocks, where a
block is defined as a multiple of the least common multiple
of the number of bytes transformed by the specified output
types. If the least common multiple is greater than 16, the
results are unspecified. Each input block shall be written
as transformed by each output type, one per written line, in
the order that the output types were specified. If the input
block size is larger than the number of bytes transformed by
the output type, the output type shall sequentially
transform the parts of the input block, and the output from
each of the transformations shall be separated by one or
more &lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p>If, as a result of the specification of the -N option or
end-of-file being reached on the last input file, input data
only partially satis- fies an output type, the input shall
be extended sufficiently with null bytes to write the last
byte of the input.</p>

<p>Unless -A n is specified, the first output line produced
for each input block shall be preceded by the input offset,
cumulative across input files, of the next byte to be
written. The format of the input offset is unspecified;
however, it shall not contain any &lt;blank&gt;s, shall
start at the first character of the output line, and shall
be followed by one or more &lt;blank&gt;s. In addition, the
offset of the byte following the last byte written shall be
written after all the input data has been processed, but
shall not be followed by any &lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p>If no -A option is specified, the input offset base is
unspecified.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All input files were processed successfully.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE XSI-conformant applications are warned
not to use filenames starting with + or a first operand
starting with a numeric character so that the old
functionality can be maintained by implementations, unless
they specify one of the -A, -j, or -N options. To guarantee
that one of these filenames is always interpreted as a
filename, an application could always specify the address
base format with the -A option.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES If a file containing 128 bytes with decimal
values zero to 127, in increasing order, is supplied as
standard input to the command:</p>

<p>od -A d -t a</p>

<p>on an implementation using an input block size of 16
bytes, the stan- dard output, independent of the current
locale setting, would be simi- lar to:</p>

<p>0000000 nul soh stx etx eot enq ack bel bs ht nl vt ff
cr so si 0000016 dle dc1 dc2 dc3 dc4 nak syn etb can em sub

s t u v w x y z { | } ~ del 0000128</p>

<p>Note that this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 allows nl
or lf to be used as the name for the ISO/IEC 646:1991
standard IRV character with decimal value 10. The IRV names
this character lf (line feed), but tra- ditional
implementations have referred to this character as newline (
nl) and the POSIX locale character set symbolic name for the
corre- sponding character is a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>The command:</p>

<p>od -A o -t o2x2x -N 18</p>

<p>on a system with 32-bit words and an implementation
using an input block size of 16 bytes could write 18 bytes
in approximately the fol- lowing format:</p>

<p>0000000 032056 031440 041123 042040 052516 044530 020043
031464 342e 3320 4253 4420 554e 4958 2023 3334 342e3320
42534420 554e4958 20233334 0000020 032472 353a 353a0000
0000022</p>

<p>The command:</p>

<p>od -A d -t f -t o4 -t x4 -N 24 -j 0x15</p>

<p>on a system with 64-bit doubles (for example, IEEE Std
754-1985 double precision floating-point format) would skip
21 bytes of input data and then write 24 bytes in
approximately the following format:</p>

<p>0000000 1.00000000000000e+00 1.57350000000000e+01

<p>RATIONALE The od utility went through several names in
early proposals, including hd, xd, and most recently
hexdump. There were several objections to all of these based
on the following reasons:</p>

<p>* The hd and xd names conflicted with historical
utilities that behaved differently.</p>

<p>* The hexdump description was much more complex than
needed for a sim- ple dump utility.</p>

<p>* The od utility has been available on all historical
implementations and there was no need to create a new name
for a utility so similar to the historical od utility.</p>

<p>The original reasons for not standardizing historical od
were also fairly widespread. Those reasons are given below
along with rationale explaining why the standard developers
believe that this version does not suffer from the indicated
problem:</p>

<p>* The BSD and System V versions of od have diverged, and
the intersec- tion of features provided by both does not
meet the needs of the user community. In fact, the System V
version only provides a mecha- nism for dumping octal bytes
and shorts, signed and unsigned decimal shorts, hexadecimal
shorts, and ASCII characters. BSD added the ability to dump
floats, doubles, named ASCII characters, and octal, signed
decimal, unsigned decimal, and hexadecimal longs. The ver-
sion presented here provides more normalized forms for
dumping bytes, shorts, ints, and longs in octal, signed
decimal, unsigned decimal, and hexadecimal; float, double,
and long double; and named ASCII as well as current locale
characters.</p>

<p>* It would not be possible to come up with a compatible
superset of the BSD and System V flags that met the
requirements of the standard developers. The historical
default od output is the specified default output of this
utility. None of the option letters chosen for this version
of od conflict with any of the options to histori- cal
versions of od.</p>

<p>* On systems with different sizes for short, int, and
long, there was no way to ask for dumps of ints, even in the
BSD version. Because of the way options are named, the name
space could not be extended to solve these problems. This is
why the -t option was added (with type specifiers more
closely matched to the printf() formats used in the rest of
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001) and the optional field
sizes were added to the d, f, o, u, and x type specifiers.
It is also one of the reasons why the historical practice
was not mandated as a required obsolescent form of od.
(Although the old versions of od are not listed as an
obsolescent form, implementations are urged to continue to
recognize the older forms for several more years.) The a, c,
f, o, and x types match the meaning of the corresponding
format characters in the historical implementations of od
except for the default sizes of the fields converted. The d
format is signed in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 to
match the printf() notation. (Historical versions of od used
d as a synonym for u in this ver- sion. The System V
implementation uses s for signed decimal; BSD uses i for
signed decimal and s for null-terminated strings.) Other
than d and u, all of the type specifiers match format
characters in the historical BSD version of od.</p>

<p>The sizes of the C-language types char, short, int,
long, float, dou- ble, and long double are used even though
it is recognized that there may be zero or more than one
compiler for the C language on an imple- mentation and that
they may use different sizes for some of these types. (For
example, one compiler might use 2 bytes shorts, 2 bytes
ints, and 4 bytes longs, while another compiler (or an
option to the same compiler) uses 2 bytes shorts, 4 bytes
ints, and 4 bytes longs.) Nonetheless, there has to be a
basic size known by the implementation for these types,
corresponding to the values reported by invocations of the
getconf utility when called with system_var operands
{UCHAR_MAX}, {USHORT_MAX}, {UINT_MAX}, and {ULONG_MAX} for
the types char, short, int, and long, respectively. There
are similar constants required by the ISO C standard, but
not required by the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 or this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. They are
{FLT_MANT_DIG}, {DBL_MANT_DIG}, and {LDBL_MANT_DIG} for the
types float, double, and long double, respectively. If the
optional c99 util- ity is provided by the implementation and
used as specified by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
these are the sizes that would be pro- vided. If an option
is used that specifies different sizes for these types,
there is no guarantee that the od utility is able to
interpret binary data output by such a program
correctly.</p>

<p>This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires that the
numeric values of these lengths be recognized by the od
utility and that symbolic forms also be recognized. Thus, a
conforming application can always look at an array of
unsigned long data elements using od -t uL.</p>

<p>* The method of specifying the format for the address
field based on specifying a starting offset in a file
unnecessarily tied the two together. The -A option now
specifies the address base and the -S option specifies a
starting offset.</p>

<p>* It would be difficult to break the dependence on U.S.
ASCII to achieve an internationalized utility. It does not
seem to be any harder for od to dump characters in the
current locale than it is for the ed or sed l commands. The
c type specifier does this without difficulty and is
completely compatible with the historical imple- mentations
of the c format character when the current locale uses a
superset of the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard as a codeset. The
a type specifier (from the BSD a format character) was left
as a portable means to dump ASCII (or more correctly ISO/IEC
646:1991 standard (IRV)) so that headers produced by pax
could be deciphered even on systems that do not use the
ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard as a subset of their base
codeset.</p>

<p>The use of &quot;**&quot; as an indication of
continuation of a multi-byte char- acter in c specifier
output was chosen based on seeing an implementa- tion that
uses this method. The continuation bytes have to be marked
in a way that is not ambiguous with another single-byte or
multi-byte character.</p>

<p>An early proposal used -S and -n, respectively, for the
-j and -N options eventually selected. These were changed to
avoid conflicts with historical implementations.</p>

<p>The original standard specified -t o2 as the default
when no output type was given. This was changed to -t oS
(the length of a short) to accommodate a supercomputer
implementation that historically used 64 bits as its default
(and that defined shorts as 64 bits). This change should not
affect conforming applications. The requirement to support
lengths of 1, 2, and 4 was added at the same time to address
an histor- ical implementation that had no two-byte data
types in its C compiler.</p>

<p>The use of a basic integer data type is intended to
allow the implemen- tation to choose a word size commonly
used by applications on that architecture.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS All option and operand interfaces
marked as extensions may be withdrawn in a future
version.</p>
