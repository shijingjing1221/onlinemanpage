<p>NAME kmousetool - Accessibility tool to help click the
mouse</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kmousetool [KDE Generic Options] [Qt&amp;#8482;
Generic Options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION KMouseTool clicks the mouse whenever the
mouse cursor pauses briefly. It was designed to help those
with repetitive strain injuries, for whom pressing buttons
hurts.</p>

<p>KMouseTool can also be configured to wait for a
specified time for a drag to begin, before unclicking the
mouse. This way, you can use it for drag and drop operations
as well.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO More detailed user documentation is available
from help:/kmousetool (either enter this URL into Konqueror,
or run khelpcenter help:/kmouse- tool).</p>

<p>There is also further information available at the KDE
accessibility site.: http://accessibility.kde.org</p>
