<p>STRACE(1) STRACE(1)</p>

<p>NAME strace - trace system calls and signals</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS strace [-CdffhiqrtttTvVxxy] [-In] [-bexecve]
[-eexpr]... [-acolumn] [-ofile] [-sstrsize] [-Ppath]...
-ppid... / [-D] [-Evar[=val]]... [-uusername] command
[args]</p>

<p>strace -c[df] [-In] [-bexecve] [-eexpr]... [-Ooverhead]
[-Ssortby] -ppid... / [-D] [-Evar[=val]]... [-uusername]
command [args]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In the simplest case strace runs the
specified command until it exits. It intercepts and records
the system calls which are called by a pro- cess and the
signals which are received by a process. The name of each
system call, its arguments and its return value are printed
on standard error or to the file specified with the -o
option.</p>

<p>strace is a useful diagnostic, instructional, and
debugging tool. Sys- tem administrators, diagnosticians and
trouble-shooters will find it invaluable for solving
problems with programs for which the source is not readily
available since they do not need to be recompiled in order
to trace them. Students, hackers and the overly-curious will
find that a great deal can be learned about a system and its
system calls by tracing even ordinary programs. And
programmers will find that since system calls and signals
are events that happen at the user/kernel interface, a close
examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race
conditions.</p>

<p>Each line in the trace contains the system call name,
followed by its arguments in parentheses and its return
value. An example from strac- ing the command cat /dev/null
is:</p>

<p>open(&quot;/dev/null&quot;, O_RDONLY) = 3</p>

<p>Errors (typically a return value of -1) have the errno
symbol and error string appended.</p>

<p>open(&quot;/foo/bar&quot;, O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No
such file or directory)</p>

<p>Signals are printed as a signal symbol and a signal
string. An excerpt from stracing and interrupting the
command sleep 666 is:</p>

<p>sigsuspend([] &lt;unfinished ...&gt; --- SIGINT
(Interrupt) --- +++ killed by SIGINT +++</p>

<p>If a system call is being executed and meanwhile another
one is being called from a different thread/process then
strace will try to preserve the order of those events and
mark the ongoing call as being unfin- ished. When the call
returns it will be marked as resumed.</p>

<p>[pid 28772] select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL
&lt;unfinished ...&gt; [pid 28779]
clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, {1130322148, 939977000}) = 0
[pid 28772] &lt;... select resumed&gt; ) = 1 (in [3])</p>

<p>Interruption of a (restartable) system call by a signal
delivery is processed differently as kernel terminates the
system call and also arranges its immediate reexecution
after the signal handler completes.</p>

<p>read(0, 0x7ffff72cf5cf, 1) = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be
restarted) --- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) @ 0 (0) ---
rt_sigreturn(0xe) = 0 read(0, &quot;&quot;..., 1) = 0</p>

<p>Arguments are printed in symbolic form with a passion.
This example shows the shell performing &gt;&gt;xyzzy output
redirection:</p>

<p>open(&quot;xyzzy&quot;, O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0666)
= 3</p>

<p>Here the third argument of open is decoded by breaking
down the flag argument into its three bitwise-OR
constituents and printing the mode value in octal by
tradition. Where traditional or native usage differs from
ANSI or POSIX, the latter forms are preferred. In some
cases, strace output has proven to be more readable than the
source.</p>

<p>Structure pointers are dereferenced and the members are
displayed as appropriate. In all cases arguments are
formatted in the most C-like fashion possible. For example,
the essence of the command ls -l /dev/null is captured
as:</p>

<p>lstat(&quot;/dev/null&quot;, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0666,
st_rdev=makedev(1, 3), ...}) = 0</p>

<p>Notice how the struct stat argument is dereferenced and
how each mem- ber is displayed symbolically. In particular,
observe how the st_mode member is carefully decoded into a
bitwise-OR of symbolic and numeric values. Also notice in
this example that the first argument to lstat is an input to
the system call and the second argument is an output. Since
output arguments are not modified if the system call fails,
argu- ments may not always be dereferenced. For example,
retrying the ls -l example with a non-existent file produces
the following line:</p>

<p>lstat(&quot;/foo/bar&quot;, 0xb004) = -1 ENOENT (No such
file or directory)</p>

<p>In this case the porch light is on but nobody is
home.</p>

<p>Character pointers are dereferenced and printed as C
strings. Non- printing characters in strings are normally
represented by ordinary C escape codes. Only the first
strsize (32 by default) bytes of strings are printed; longer
strings have an ellipsis appended following the closing
quote. Here is a line from ls -l where the getpwuid library
routine is reading the password file:</p>

<p>read(3, &quot;root::0:0:System Administrator:/&quot;...,
1024) = 422</p>

<p>While structures are annotated using curly braces,
simple pointers and arrays are printed using square brackets
with commas separating ele- ments. Here is an example from
the command id on a system with supplementary group ids:</p>

<p>getgroups(32, [100, 0]) = 2</p>

<p>On the other hand, bit-sets are also shown using square
brackets but set elements are separated only by a space.
Here is the shell prepar- ing to execute an external
command:</p>

<p>sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD TTOU], []) = 0</p>

<p>Here the second argument is a bit-set of two signals,
SIGCHLD and SIGT- TOU. In some cases the bit-set is so full
that printing out the unset elements is more valuable. In
that case, the bit-set is prefixed by a tilde like this:</p>

<p>sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, ~[], NULL) = 0</p>

<p>Here the second argument represents the full set of all
signals.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Count time, calls, and errors for each system
call and report a summary on program exit. On Linux, this
attempts to show system time (CPU time spent running in the
kernel) independent of wall clock time. If -c is used with
-f or -F (below), only aggregate totals for all traced
processes are kept.</p>

<p>-C Like -c but also print regular output while pro-
cesses are running.</p>

<p>-D Run tracer process as a detached grandchild, not as
parent of the tracee. This reduces the visible effect of
strace by keeping the tracee a direct child of the calling
process.</p>

<p>-d Show some debugging output of strace itself on the
standard error.</p>

<p>-f Trace child processes as they are created by cur-
rently traced processes as a result of the fork(2), vfork(2)
and clone(2) system calls. Note that -p PID -f will attach
all threads of process PID if it is multi-threaded, not only
thread with thread_id = PID.</p>

<p>-ff If the -o filename option is in effect, each pro-
cesses trace is written to filename.pid where pid is the
numeric process id of each process. This is incompatible
with -c, since no per-process counts are kept.</p>

<p>-F This option is now obsolete and it has the same
functionality as -f.</p>

<p>-h Print the help summary.</p>

<p>-i Print the instruction pointer at the time of the
system call.</p>

<p>-q Suppress messages about attaching, detaching etc.
This happens automatically when output is redirected to a
file and the command is run directly instead of
attaching.</p>

<p>-qq If given twice, suppress messages about process exit
status.</p>

<p>-r Print a relative timestamp upon entry to each system
call. This records the time difference between the beginning
of successive system calls.</p>

<p>-t Prefix each line of the trace with the time of
day.</p>

<p>-tt If given twice, the time printed will include the
microseconds.</p>

<p>-ttt If given thrice, the time printed will include the
microseconds and the leading portion will be printed as the
number of seconds since the epoch.</p>

<p>-T Show the time spent in system calls. This records the
time difference between the beginning and the end of each
system call.</p>

<p>-v Print unabbreviated versions of environment, stat,
termios, etc. calls. These structures are very common in
calls and so the default behavior displays a reasonable
subset of structure members. Use this option to get all of
the gory details.</p>

<p>-V Print the version number of strace.</p>

<p>-x Print all non-ASCII strings in hexadecimal string
format.</p>

<p>-xx Print all strings in hexadecimal string format.</p>

<p>-y Print paths associated with file descriptor argu-
ments.</p>

<p>-a column Align return values in a specific column
(default column 40).</p>

<p>-b syscall If specified syscall is reached, detach from
traced process. Currently, only execve syscall is sup-
ported. This option is useful if you want to trace
multi-threaded process and therefore require -f, but don t
want to trace its (potentially very complex) children.</p>

<p>-e expr A qualifying expression which modifies which
events to trace or how to trace them. The format of the
expression is:</p>

<p>[qualifier=][!]value1[,value2]...</p>

<p>where qualifier is one of trace, abbrev, verbose, raw,
signal, read, or write and value is a quali- fier-dependent
symbol or number. The default quali- fier is trace. Using an
exclamation mark negates the set of values. For example, -e
open means lit- erally -e trace=open which in turn means
trace only the open system call. By contrast, -e trace=!open
means to trace every system call except open. In addition,
the special values all and none have the obvious
meanings.</p>

<p>Note that some shells use the exclamation point for
history expansion even inside quoted arguments. If so, you
must escape the exclamation point with a backslash.</p>

<p>-e trace=set Trace only the specified set of system
calls. The -c option is useful for determining which system
calls might be useful to trace. For example,
trace=open,close,read,write means to only trace those four
system calls. Be careful when making inferences about the
user/kernel boundary if only a subset of system calls are
being monitored. The default is trace=all.</p>

<p>-e trace=file Trace all system calls which take a file
name as an argument. You can think of this as an
abbreviation for -e trace=open,stat,chmod,unlink,... which
is useful to seeing what files the process is referenc- ing.
Furthermore, using the abbreviation will ensure that you
dont accidentally forget to include a call like lstat in the
list. Betchya woulda for- got that one.</p>

<p>-e trace=process Trace all system calls which involve
process manage- ment. This is useful for watching the fork,
wait, and exec steps of a process.</p>

<p>-e trace=network Trace all the network related system
calls.</p>

<p>-e trace=signal Trace all signal related system
calls.</p>

<p>-e trace=ipc Trace all IPC related system calls.</p>

<p>-e trace=desc Trace all file descriptor related system
calls.</p>

<p>-e trace=memory Trace all memory mapping related system
calls.</p>

<p>-e abbrev=set Abbreviate the output from printing each
member of large structures. The default is abbrev=all. The
-v option has the effect of abbrev=none.</p>

<p>-e verbose=set Dereference structures for the specified
set of sys- tem calls. The default is verbose=all.</p>

<p>-e raw=set Print raw, undecoded arguments for the
specified set of system calls. This option has the effect of
causing all arguments to be printed in hexadecimal. This is
mostly useful if you dont trust the decod- ing or you need
to know the actual numeric value of an argument.</p>

<p>-e signal=set Trace only the specified subset of
signals. The default is signal=all. For example, signal =!
SIGIO (or signal=!io) causes SIGIO signals not to be
traced.</p>

<p>-e read=set Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump of
all the data read from file descriptors listed in the speci-
fied set. For example, to see all input activity on file
descriptors 3 and 5 use -e read=3,5. Note that this is
independent from the normal tracing of the read(2) system
call which is controlled by the option -e trace=read.</p>

<p>-e write=set Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump
of all the data written to file descriptors listed in the
spec- ified set. For example, to see all output activity on
file descriptors 3 and 5 use -e write=3,5. Note that this is
independent from the normal tracing of the write(2) system
call which is controlled by the option -e trace=write.</p>

<p>-I interruptible When strace can be interrupted by
signals (such as pressing ^C). 1: no signals are blocked; 2:
fatal signals are blocked while decoding syscall (default);
3: fatal signals are always blocked (default if -o FILE
PROG); 4: fatal signals and SIGTSTP (^Z) are always blocked
(useful to make strace -o FILE PROG not stop on ^Z).</p>

<p>-o filename Write the trace output to the file filename
rather than to stderr. Use filename.pid if -ff is used. If
the argument begins with | or with ! then the rest of the
argument is treated as a command and all output is piped to
it. This is convenient for pip- ing the debugging output to
a program without affecting the redirections of executed
programs.</p>

<p>-O overhead Set the overhead for tracing system calls to
over- head microseconds. This is useful for overriding the
default heuristic for guessing how much time is spent in
mere measuring when timing system calls using the -c option.
The accuracy of the heuristic can be gauged by timing a
given program run without tracing (using time(1)) and
comparing the accumu- lated system call time to the total
produced using -c.</p>

<p>-p pid Attach to the process with the process ID pid and
begin tracing. The trace may be terminated at any time by a
keyboard interrupt signal (CTRL-C). strace will respond by
detaching itself from the traced process(es) leaving it
(them) to continue running. Multiple -p options can be used
to attach to many processes. -p &quot;pidof PROG&quot;
syntax is sup- ported.</p>

<p>-P path Trace only system calls accessing path. Multiple
-P options can be used to specify several paths.</p>

<p>-s strsize Specify the maximum string size to print (the
default is 32). Note that filenames are not consid- ered
strings and are always printed in full.</p>

<p>-S sortby Sort the output of the histogram printed by
the -c option by the specified criterion. Legal values are
time, calls, name, and nothing (default is time).</p>

<p>-u username Run command with the user ID, group ID, and
supple- mentary groups of username. This option is only
useful when running as root and enables the correct
execution of setuid and/or setgid binaries. Unless this
option is used setuid and setgid programs are executed
without effective privileges.</p>

<p>-E var=val Run command with var=val in its list of
environment variables.</p>

<p>-E var Remove var from the inherited list of environment
variables before passing it on to the command.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS When command exits, strace exits with the
same exit status. If command is terminated by a signal,
strace terminates itself with the same signal, so that
strace can be used as a wrapper process transparent to the
invoking parent process.</p>

<p>When using -p, the exit status of strace is zero unless
there was an unexpected error in doing the tracing.</p>

<p>SETUID INSTALLATION If strace is installed setuid to
root then the invoking user will be able to attach to and
trace processes owned by any user. In addition setuid and
setgid programs will be executed and traced with the correct
effective privileges. Since only users trusted with full
root privileges should be allowed to do these things, it
only makes sense to install strace as setuid to root when
the users who can execute it are restricted to those users
who have this trust. For example, it makes sense to install
a special version of strace with mode rwsr-xr--, user root
and group trace, where members of the trace group are
trusted users. If you do use this feature, please remember
to install a non- setuid version of strace for ordinary
lusers to use.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ltrace(1), time(1), ptrace(2), proc(5)</p>

<p>NOTES It is a pity that so much tracing clutter is
produced by systems employing shared libraries.</p>

<p>It is instructive to think about system call inputs and
outputs as data-flow across the user/kernel boundary.
Because user- space and kernel-space are separate and
address-protected, it is sometimes possible to make
deductive inferences about process behavior using inputs and
outputs as propositions.</p>

<p>In some cases, a system call will differ from the
documented behavior or have a different name. For example,
on System V- derived systems the true time(2) system call
does not take an argument and the stat function is called
xstat and takes an extra leading argument. These
discrepancies are normal but idiosyncratic characteristics
of the system call interface and are accounted for by C
library wrapper functions.</p>

<p>On some platforms a process that has a system call trace
applied to it with the -p option will receive a SIGSTOP.
This signal may interrupt a system call that is not
restartable. This may have an unpredictable effect on the
process if the process takes no action to restart the system
call.</p>

<p>BUGS Programs that use the setuid bit do not have
effective user ID privileges while being traced.</p>

<p>A traced process runs slowly.</p>

<p>Traced processes which are descended from command may be
left running after an interrupt signal (CTRL-C).</p>

<p>The -i option is weakly supported.</p>

<p>HISTORY strace The original strace was written by Paul
Kranenburg for SunOS and was inspired by its trace utility.
The SunOS version of strace was ported to Linux and enhanced
by Branko Lankester, who also wrote the Linux kernel
support. Even though Paul released strace 2.5 in 1992,
Brankos work was based on Pauls strace 1.5 release from
1991. In 1993, Rick Sladkey merged strace 2.5 for SunOS and
the second release of strace for Linux, added many of the
features of truss(1) from SVR4, and produced an strace that
worked on both platforms. In 1994 Rick ported strace to SVR4
and Solaris and wrote the automatic configuration support.
In 1995 he ported strace to Irix and tired of writing about
himself in the third person.</p>
