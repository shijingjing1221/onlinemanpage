<p>rlm_expr(5) FreeRADIUS Module rlm_expr(5)</p>

<p>NAME rlm_expr - FreeRADIUS Module</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rlm_expr module allows the server to
perform limited mathematical calculations. This module is
not called directly in any section, it is invoked through
the dynamic expansion of strings.</p>

<p>For example, some NAS boxes send a NAS-Port attribute
which is a 32-bit number composed of port, card, and
interface, all in different bytes. To see these attributes
split into pieces, you can have an entry in the users file
like:</p>

<p>DEFAULT Vendor-Interface = %{expr: %{NAS-Port} / (256 *
256)}, Vendor-Card = %{expr: (%{NAS-Port} / 256) %% 256},
Vendor-Port = %{expr: %{NAS-Port} %% 256}</p>

<p>where the attributes Vendor-Interface, Vendor-Card, and
Vendor-Port are attributes created by either you or a
vendor-supplied dictionary.</p>

<p>The methematical operators supported by the expression
module are:</p>

<p>+ addition</p>

<p>- subtraction</p>

<p>/ division</p>

<p>%% modulo remainder</p>

<p>* multiplication</p>

<p>&amp; boolean AND</p>

<p>| boolean OR</p>

<p>() grouping of sub-expressions</p>

<p>NOTE: The modulo remainder operator is %%, and not % .
This is due to the % character being used as a special
character for dynamic translation.</p>

<p>NOTE: These operators do NOT have precedence. The
parsing of the input string, and the calculation of the
answer, is done strictly left to right. If you wish to order
the expressions, you MUST group them into sub-expression, as
shown in the previous example.</p>

<p>All of the calculations are performed as unsigned 32-bit
integers.</p>
