<p>GETRLIMIT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual GETRLIMIT(2)</p>

<p>NAME getrlimit, setrlimit - get/set resource limits</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/resource.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getrlimit(int resource, struct rlimit *rlim); int
setrlimit(int resource, const struct rlimit *rlim);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION getrlimit() and setrlimit() get and set
resource limits respectively. Each resource has an
associated soft and hard limit, as defined by the rlimit
structure (the rlim argument to both getrlimit() and setr-
limit()):</p>

<p>struct rlimit { rlim_t rlim_cur; /* Soft limit */ rlim_t
rlim_max; /* Hard limit (ceiling for rlim_cur) */ };</p>

<p>The soft limit is the value that the kernel enforces for
the corre- sponding resource. The hard limit acts as a
ceiling for the soft limit: an unprivileged process may only
set its soft limit to a value in the range from 0 up to the
hard limit, and (irreversibly) lower its hard limit. A
privileged process (under Linux: one with the
CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability) may make arbitrary changes to
either limit value.</p>

<p>The value RLIM_INFINITY denotes no limit on a resource
(both in the structure returned by getrlimit() and in the
structure passed to setr- limit()).</p>

<p>resource must be one of:</p>

<p>RLIMIT_AS The maximum size of the process s virtual
memory (address space) in bytes. This limit affects calls to
brk(2), mmap(2) and mremap(2), which fail with the error
ENOMEM upon exceeding this limit. Also automatic stack
expansion will fail (and generate a SIGSEGV that kills the
process if no alternate stack has been made available via
sigaltstack(2)). Since the value is a long, on machines with
a 32-bit long either this limit is at most 2 GiB, or this
resource is unlimited.</p>

<p>RLIMIT_CORE Maximum size of core file. When 0 no core
dump files are cre- ated. When non-zero, larger dumps are
truncated to this size.</p>

<p>RLIMIT_CPU CPU time limit in seconds. When the process
reaches the soft limit, it is sent a SIGXCPU signal. The
default action for this signal is to terminate the process.
However, the signal can be caught, and the handler can
return control to the main program. If the process continues
to consume CPU time, it will be sent SIGXCPU once per second
until the hard limit is reached, at which time it is sent
SIGKILL. (This latter point describes Linux 2.2 through 2.6
behavior. Implementations vary in how they treat processes
which continue to consume CPU time after reaching the soft
limit. Portable applications that need to catch this signal
should perform an orderly termination upon first receipt of
SIGXCPU.)</p>

<p>RLIMIT_DATA The maximum size of the processs data
segment (initialized data, uninitialized data, and heap).
This limit affects calls to brk(2) and sbrk(2), which fail
with the error ENOMEM upon encountering the soft limit of
this resource.</p>

<p>RLIMIT_FSIZE The maximum size of files that the process
may create. Attempts to extend a file beyond this limit
result in delivery of a SIGXFSZ signal. By default, this
signal terminates a process, but a process can catch this
signal instead, in which case the relevant system call
(e.g., write(2), truncate(2)) fails with the error
EFBIG.</p>

<p>RLIMIT_LOCKS (Early Linux 2.4 only) A limit on the
combined number of flock(2) locks and fcntl(2) leases that
this process may establish.</p>

<p>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK The maximum number of bytes of memory
that may be locked into RAM. In effect this limit is rounded
down to the nearest multi- ple of the system page size. This
limit affects mlock(2) and mlockall(2) and the mmap(2)
MAP_LOCKED operation. Since Linux 2.6.9 it also affects the
shmctl(2) SHM_LOCK operation, where it sets a maximum on the
total bytes in shared memory segments (see shmget(2)) that
may be locked by the real user ID of the calling process.
The shmctl(2) SHM_LOCK locks are accounted for sepa- rately
from the per-process memory locks established by mlock(2),
mlockall(2), and mmap(2) MAP_LOCKED; a process can lock
bytes up to this limit in each of these two categories. In
Linux kernels before 2.6.9, this limit controlled the amount
of memory that could be locked by a privileged process.
Since Linux 2.6.9, no limits are placed on the amount of
memory that a privileged process may lock, and this limit
instead governs the amount of memory that an unprivileged
process may lock.</p>

<p>RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE (Since Linux 2.6.8) Specifies the limit
on the number of bytes that can be allocated for POSIX
message queues for the real user ID of the calling process.
This limit is enforced for mq_open(3). Each message queue
that the user creates counts (until it is removed) against
this limit according to the formula:</p>

<p>bytes = attr.mq_maxmsg * sizeof(struct msg_msg *) +
attr.mq_maxmsg * attr.mq_msgsize</p>

<p>where attr is the mq_attr structure specified as the
fourth argument to mq_open(3).</p>

<p>The first addend in the formula, which includes
sizeof(struct msg_msg *) (4 bytes on Linux/i386), ensures
that the user cannot create an unlimited number of
zero-length messages (such mes- sages nevertheless each
consume some system memory for bookkeep- ing overhead).</p>

<p>RLIMIT_NICE (since Linux 2.6.12, but see BUGS below)
Specifies a ceiling to which the processs nice value can be
raised using setpriority(2) or nice(2). The actual ceiling
for the nice value is calculated as 20 - rlim_cur. (This
strangeness occurs because negative numbers cannot be
specified as resource limit values, since they typically
have special meanings. For example, RLIM_INFINITY typically
is the same as -1.)</p>

<p>RLIMIT_NOFILE Specifies a value one greater than the
maximum file descriptor number that can be opened by this
process. Attempts (open(2), pipe(2), dup(2), etc.) to exceed
this limit yield the error EMFILE. (Historically, this limit
was named RLIMIT_OFILE on BSD.)</p>

<p>RLIMIT_NPROC The maximum number of processes (or, more
precisely on Linux, threads) that can be created for the
real user ID of the calling process. Upon encountering this
limit, fork(2) fails with the error EAGAIN.</p>

<p>RLIMIT_RSS Specifies the limit (in pages) of the process
s resident set (the number of virtual pages resident in
RAM). This limit only has effect in Linux 2.4.x, x &lt; 30,
and there only affects calls to madvise(2) specifying
MADV_WILLNEED.</p>

<p>RLIMIT_RTPRIO (Since Linux 2.6.12, but see BUGS)
Specifies a ceiling on the real-time priority that may be
set for this process using sched_setscheduler(2) and
sched_set- param(2).</p>

<p>RLIMIT_RTTIME (Since Linux 2.6.25) Specifies a limit on
the amount of CPU time that a process scheduled under a
real-time scheduling policy may consume with- out making a
blocking system call. For the purpose of this limit, each
time a process makes a blocking system call, the count of
its consumed CPU time is reset to zero. The CPU time count
is not reset if the process continues trying to use the CPU
but is preempted, its time slice expires, or it calls
sched_yield(2).</p>

<p>Upon reaching the soft limit, the process is sent a
SIGXCPU sig- nal. If the process catches or ignores this
signal and contin- ues consuming CPU time, then SIGXCPU will
be generated once each second until the hard limit is
reached, at which point the pro- cess is sent a SIGKILL
signal.</p>

<p>The intended use of this limit is to stop a runaway
real-time process from locking up the system.</p>

<p>RLIMIT_SIGPENDING (Since Linux 2.6.8) Specifies the
limit on the number of signals that may be queued for the
real user ID of the calling process. Both standard and
real-time signals are counted for the purpose of checking
this limit. However, the limit is only enforced for
sigqueue(2); it is always possible to use kill(2) to queue
one instance of any of the signals that are not already
queued to the process.</p>

<p>RLIMIT_STACK The maximum size of the process stack, in
bytes. Upon reaching this limit, a SIGSEGV signal is
generated. To handle this sig- nal, a process must employ an
alternate signal stack (sigalt- stack(2)).</p>

<p>Since Linux 2.6.23, this limit also determines the
amount of space used for the processs command-line arguments
and environ- ment variables; for details, see execve(2).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT rlim points outside the accessible address
space.</p>

<p>EINVAL resource is not valid; or, for setrlimit():
rlim-&gt;rlim_cur was greater than rlim-&gt;rlim_max.</p>

<p>EPERM An unprivileged process tried to use setrlimit()
to increase a soft or hard limit above the current hard
limit; the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability is required to do
this. Or, the process tried to use setrlimit() to increase
the soft or hard RLIMIT_NOFILE limit above the current
kernel maximum (NR_OPEN).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001. RLIMIT_MEMLOCK
and RLIMIT_NPROC derive from BSD and are not specified in
POSIX.1-2001; they are present on the BSDs and Linux, but on
few other implementations. RLIMIT_RSS derives from BSD and
is not specified in POSIX.1-2001; it is nevertheless present
on most implementations. RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE, RLIMIT_NICE,
RLIMIT_RTPRIO, RLIMIT_RTTIME, and RLIMIT_SIGPENDING are
Linux-specific.</p>

<p>NOTES A child process created via fork(2) inherits its
parents resource lim- its. Resource limits are preserved
across execve(2).</p>

<p>One can set the resource limits of the shell using the
built-in ulimit command (limit in csh(1)). The shells
resource limits are inherited by the processes that it
creates to execute commands.</p>

<p>BUGS In older Linux kernels, the SIGXCPU and SIGKILL
signals delivered when a process encountered the soft and
hard RLIMIT_CPU limits were deliv- ered one (CPU) second
later than they should have been. This was fixed in kernel
2.6.8.</p>

<p>In 2.6.x kernels before 2.6.17, a RLIMIT_CPU limit of 0
is wrongly treated as &quot;no limit&quot; (like
RLIM_INFINITY). Since Linux 2.6.17, set- ting a limit of 0
does have an effect, but is actually treated as a limit of 1
second.</p>

<p>A kernel bug means that RLIMIT_RTPRIO does not work in
kernel 2.6.12; the problem is fixed in kernel 2.6.13.</p>

<p>In kernel 2.6.12, there was an off-by-one mismatch
between the priority ranges returned by getpriority(2) and
RLIMIT_NICE. This had the effect that actual ceiling for the
nice value was calculated as 19 - rlim_cur. This was fixed
in kernel 2.6.13.</p>

<p>Kernels before 2.4.22 did not diagnose the error EINVAL
for setrlimit() when rlim-&gt;rlim_cur was greater than
rlim-&gt;rlim_max.</p>
