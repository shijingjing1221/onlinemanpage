<p>NAME pnmcomp - composite (overlay) two PNM images
together</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmcomp</p>

<p>[-align={left|center|right| beyondleft|beyondright}]
[-valign={top|mid- dle|bottom| above|below}] [-xoff=X]
[-yoff=Y] [-alpha=alpha-pgmfile] [-invert]
[-opacity=opacity] overlay_file [underlying_file [out-
put_file]]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmcomp was obsoleted by
pamcomp(1),introducedwithNetpbm10.21 (March 2004). pamcomp
is backward compatible with pnmcomp, plus adds many
additional functions, including the ability to process PAM
images, and tends to produce better transparency
results.</p>

<p>pnmcomp remains in the Netpbm package because it may
have fewer bugs for now than pamcomp, and is in some
environments faster (but newer compilers have been seen to
produce code for pamcomp significantly faster than that for
pnmcomp). Some day, pnmcomp will probably become an alias
for pamcomp.</p>

<p>You can use the pamcomp documentation for pnmcomp,
considering the fol- lowing differences:</p>

<p>&middot; pnmcomp options are a subset of pamcomps, as
documented above.</p>

<p>&middot; pnmcomp always assumes the input is linear, as
pamcomp does when you specify its -linear option.</p>

<p>&middot; pnmcomp cannot process PAM images.</p>
