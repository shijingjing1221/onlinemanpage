<p>NAME glutCreateWindow - Create a new top-level
window</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>int glutCreateWindow(const char* title);</p>

<p>PARAMETERS title Title for created window</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function sends a request for a window
to be constructed. OpenGLUT immediately constructs a data
structure to track further events with the window, on the
theory that eventually the window manager will get back to
us with a real window. This allows us to begin registering
callbacks immediately.</p>

<p>In fact, you must register a display callback via
glutDisplayFunc() before you enter glutMainLoop().</p>

<p>For onscreen windows, you should not depend upon the
window concretely existing or being visibile until you are
told that it exists and is visi- ble via a registered
callback.</p>

<p>The return value is an int. It should be positive for
valid windows or 0 if failure occurred for some reason
(Though traditional GLUT tends to bail out and abort rather
than returning errors.) The integer is your window id . Old
GLUT promises that these integers are small; we do not reuse
old id s, but do produce them sequentially.</p>

<p>You can change the title later via
glutSetWindowTitle().</p>
