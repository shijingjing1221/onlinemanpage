<p>NAME systemtap - SystemTap initscript service</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS service systemtap COMMAND [OPTIONS]
[SCRIPT...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The SystemTap initscript aims to provide a
way to run scripts as a ser- vice and easily control them
individually. Scripts can be configured to start upon manual
request, or during system startup. On dracut-based systems,
it is also possible to integrate scripts in the initramfs
and have them start during early-boot.</p>

<p>There are various parameters and options available to
modify global behaviour, as well as script behaviour.
Dependencies between scripts can be established so that
starting one starts others (especially con- venient when
using the -DRELAY_HOST and -DRELAY_GUEST options of
stap(1)).</p>

<p>The configuration file of the initscript is located at
/etc/system- tap/config. Acceptable parameters are detailed
in the GLOBAL PARAMETERS section.</p>

<p>Scripts must be placed in the /etc/systemtap/script.d
directory and must have a .stp extension. When referring to
them on the command-line however, there in no need to
include the .stp extension. Script names can only contain
alphanumeric characters (and _) and must not start with a
number. The scripts directory may be changed by setting the
SCRIPT_PATH parameter in the configuration file.</p>

<p>COMMANDS One of the commands below must be
specified:</p>

<p>start Start SCRIPTs. If no scripts are specified, start
the scripts specified by the DEFAULT_START configuration. If
DEFAULT_START is not set, start all scripts in the script
directory. For scripts already started, the command is
ignored. The command will fail if the scripts fail to start
(see also the PASSALL configuration).</p>

<p>If the AUTOCOMPILE configuration is on, the command will
try to compile or update the specified scripts when one of
the below conditions is true:</p>

<p>- The compiled cache file does not exist.</p>

<p>- The mtime (modified timestamp) of the original script
file is newer than the time of the compiled script
cache.</p>

<p>- The specified stap options used to compile the script
has been changed (see also the SCRIPT PARAMETERS
section).</p>

<p>- The result of uname -a has been changed.</p>

<p>stop Stop SCRIPTs. If no scripts are specified, stop all
running scripts. For scripts already stopped, the command is
ignored. The command will fail if the scripts fail to stop
(see also the PASSALL configuration).</p>

<p>restart Stop and start SCRIPTs.</p>

<p>status Show the state of SCRIPTs and their
dependencies.</p>

<p>compile Compile SCRIPTs but do not start them. If the
scripts have already been compiled, prompt for confirmation
before overwrit- ing cache. Compile for the current kernel,
or the kernel release specified by the -r option.</p>

<p>onboot Make SCRIPTs part of the initramfs so that they
are started ear- lier during the boot process. This command
is only available on dracut-based systems. If no scripts are
specified, create a nor- mal initramfs devoid of any
SystemTap files.</p>

<p>The initramfs is created for the current kernel, or the
kernel release specified by the -r option. The path of the
created initramfs defaults to /boot/initramfs-KVER.img,
where KVER is the output of uname -r. The bootloader is also
updated (using new-kernel-pkg(8)) to make the kernel entry
use the new initramfs file. Use the -o option to specify a
different path (the bootloader will not be updated).</p>

<p>If the output file already exists, it is overwritten,
unless the -b switch is given, in which case the file is
appended .bak rather than overwritten. However, if there is
already a .bak version of the file, the backup will not be
overwritten.</p>

<p>WARNING: do not use the -o option of stap(1) with onboot
scripts because the script is started before the root
filesystem is even mounted. Increase the buffer size if more
space is needed.</p>

<p>cleanup Delete the compiled SCRIPTs from cache. If no
scripts are speci- fied, then all compiled scripts are
deleted. Only the cache for the current kernel is deleted,
or the kernel release specified by the -r option. Prompt for
confirmation before deleting.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Many of the commands can also take options.
However, since users cant pass these options on boot, they
are only meant for managing scripts after boot and for
testing. Available options are:</p>

<p>-c CONFIG_FILE Specify a different configuration file in
place of the default one.</p>

<p>-R When using the start and stop commands, also include
the scripts dependencies (recursively).</p>

<p>-r KERNEL_RELEASE When using the compile, onboot, and
cleanup commands, specify the target kernel version rather
than using the current one. Must be in the same format as
uname -r.</p>

<p>-y Answer yes for all prompts.</p>

<p>-o PATH.IMG When using the onboot command, specify the
output path of the created initramfs. When specified, the
bootloader configuration is not updated.</p>

<p>-b When using the onboot command, backup an existing
initramfs image by adding a .bak extension rather than
overwriting it. Without this option, the initramfs is
overwritten.</p>

<p>GLOBAL PARAMETERS These parameters affect the general
behaviour of the SystemTap initscript service. They can be
specified in the configuration file.</p>

<p>SCRIPT_PATH Specify the absolute path of the script
directory. These are the scripts on which the initscript can
operate. Scripts must have the .stp extension. The default
path is /etc/system- tap/script.d.</p>

<p>CONFIG_PATH Specify the absolute path of the script
configuration directory. These configuration files contain
options for specific scripts. They must have the .conf
extension. The default path is /etc/systemtap/conf.d.</p>

<p>CACHE_PATH Specify the absolute path of the cache
directory. The default path is /var/cache/systemtap.</p>

<p>TEMP_PATH Specify the absolute path of the temporary
directory in which SystemTap makes temporary directories to
compile scripts. The default path is /tmp.</p>

<p>STAT_PATH Specify the absolute path of the directory
containing PID files used to track the status of SystemTap
scripts. The default path is /var/run/systemtap.</p>

<p>LOG_FILE Specify the absolute path of the log file. All
messages are sent to this file, including compilation and
runtime errors. The default path is
/var/log/systemtap.log.</p>

<p>PASSALL If this is set yes, initscript commands that
operate on multiple scripts will report as failed when the
action could not be per- formed on at least one script. If
set to no, only a warning is emitted. The default is
yes.</p>

<p>RECURSIVE If this is set yes, the initscript will always
follow script dependencies recursively. This means that
there is no need to specify the -R option. This flag is
effective only if you spec- ify script(s) from the
command-line. The default is no.</p>

<p>AUTOCOMPILE If this is set yes, the initscript
automatically tries to com- pile specified scripts when
needed if there is no valid cache. Otherwise, the related
command simply fails. The default is yes.</p>

<p>DEFAULT_START Specify scripts which will be started by
default. If omitted (or empty), all scripts in the script
directory will be started. The default is &quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>ALLOW_CACHEONLY If this is set yes, the initscript will
also allow operating on scripts that are located in the
cache directory, but not in the script directory. The
default is no.</p>

<p>WARNING: the initscript may load unexpected obsolete
caches with this option. The cache directory should be
checked before enabling this option.</p>

<p>LOG_BOOT_ERR Because boot-time scripts are run before
the root filesystem is mounted, staprun s stderr cannot be
logged to the LOG_FILE as usual. However, the log can
instead be output to /var/run/sys- temtap/$script.log by
setting LOG_BOOT_ERR to yes. If STAT_PATH is different from
the default, the log files will be moved there upon
executing any of the initscript commands. The default is
no.</p>

<p>Here is a global configuration file example:</p>

<p>SCRIPT_PATH=/var/systemtap/script.d/ PASSALL=yes
RECURSIVE=no</p>

<p>SCRIPT PARAMETERS These parameters affect the
compilation or runtime behaviour of specif- ic SystemTap
scripts. They must be placed in config files located in the
CONFIG_PATH directory.</p>

<p>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;_OPT Specify options passed to the stap(1)
command for the SCRIPT. Here, SCRIPT is the name of the
script file without the .stp ex- tension. Note that the -F
option is always added.</p>

<p>The following options are ignored when compiling
scripts: -p, -m, -r, -c, -x, -e, -s, -o, -h, -V, -k.</p>

<p>The following options are ignored when running starting
scripts: -h, -V, -v, -t, -p, -I, -e, -R, -r, -m, -k, -g, -P,
-D, -b, -u, -q, -w, -l, -d, -L, -F, and all long
options.</p>

<p>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;_REQ Specify script dependencies (i.e.
which script this script re- quires). For example, if
foo.stp requires (or needs to run af- ter) bar.stp, set</p>

<p>foo_REQ=&quot;bar&quot;</p>

<p>Specify multiple scripts by separating their names by
spaces.</p>

<p>Here is a script configuration file example:</p>

<p>script1_OPT=&quot;-o /var/log/script1.out
-DRELAY_HOST=group1&quot;
script2_OPT=&quot;-DRELAY_GUEST=group1&quot;
script2_REQ=&quot;script1&quot;</p>

<p>EXAMPLES INSTALLING SCRIPTS We first copy a SystemTap
script (e.g. &quot;script1.stp&quot;) into the script
directory:</p>

<p># cp script1.stp /etc/systemtap/script.d/</p>

<p>We can then set any script options, for example:</p>

<p># vi /etc/systemtap/conf.d/group1 script1_OPT=&quot;-o
/var/log/group1.out -DRELAY_HOST=group1&quot;</p>

<p>If we then install a script (e.g.
&quot;script2.stp&quot;) which shares a buffer with script1,
there is a dependency. In this case, we can do the
following:</p>

<p># cp script2.stp /etc/systemtap/script.d/ # vi
/etc/systemtap/conf.d/group1
script2_OPT=&quot;-DRELAY_GUEST=group1&quot;
script2_REQ=&quot;script1&quot;</p>

<p>This way, if stap(1) fails to run script1, the
initscript will not even try to run script2.</p>

<p>TESTING After installing scripts, we can test that they
work by simply doing:</p>

<p># service systemtap start # service systemtap stop</p>

<p>We could be more specific as well, for example:</p>

<p># service systemtap start script1 # service systemtap
stop script1</p>

<p>If there were no errors, we are ready to use it.</p>

<p>ENABLING SERVICE After we re satisfied with the scripts
and their tests, we can enable the SystemTap initscript
service:</p>

<p># chkconfig systemtap on</p>

<p>DELETING SCRIPTS Scripts are deleted by simply removing
them from the script di- rectory and removing any
configuration lines specific to them:</p>

<p># rm /etc/systemtap/script.d/script2.stp # vi
/etc/systemtap/conf.d/group1</p>

<p>If the script is still running, we also need to stop
it:</p>

<p># service systemtap stop script2</p>

<p>We can then also remove the cache associated with the
script:</p>

<p># service systemtap cleanup script2</p>

<p>PREPARING FOR KERNEL UPDATES Usually, there is nothing
to do when booting into a new kernel. The initscript will
see that the kernel version is different and will compile
the scripts. The compilation can be done beforehand as well
to avoid having to compile during boot by using the -r
option:</p>

<p># service systemtap compile myscript -r
&lt;NEW_KERNEL_VERSION&gt;</p>

<p>IMPORTING COMPILED SCRIPTS For environments which lack
compilation infrastructure (e.g. no compilers or debuginfo),
such as a production system, the scripts can be compiled on
another (development) machine and then transferred over to
the production system:</p>

<p># service systemtap compile myscript -r &gt;
&lt;KERNEL_VERSION_OF_TARGET_MACHINE&gt; # tar czf
stap-scripts-&lt;kernel-version&gt;.tar.gz &gt;
/var/cache/systemtap/&lt;kernel-version&gt; &gt;
/etc/systemtap/conf.d/&lt;configfile&gt;</p>

<p>And then copy this package to the target machine and
extract it.</p>

<p>STARTING SCRIPTS DURING EARLY-BOOT The initscript also
allows us to start scripts earlier during the boot process
by creating an initramfs containing the scripts module. The
system must be dracut-based for this to work. Starting a
script at this stage gives access to informa- tion otherwise
very hard to obtain.</p>

<p>We first install the script by copying it into the
script direc- tory as usual and setting whatever options wed
like:</p>

<p># cp myscript.stp /etc/systemtap/script.d # vi
/etc/systemtap/conf.d/myscript.conf</p>

<p>To add the script to the initramfs, we use the onboot
command:</p>

<p># service systemtap onboot myscript</p>

<p>If the script is not already compiled and cached, it
will be done at this point. A new initramfs will then be
created at the default location. We can use the -b option to
ensure that the existing initramfs is backed up. We can then
restart the system.</p>

<p>USING A DIFFERENT INITRAMFS If we would prefer to only
start the script for one boot and not others, it might be
easier to instead use the -o option to spec- ify a different
initramfs output file:</p>

<p># service systemtap onboot myscript &gt; -o
/boot/special_initramfs.img</p>

<p>Once the initramfs is created, its simply a matter of
changing the command-line options at boot-time so that the
new image is used rather than the usual one.</p>

<p>CREATING AN INITRAMFS FOR A DIFFERENT KERNEL Just like
the compile command, we can use the -r option to spec- ify
the kernel for which we want to create the initramfs. This
is useful when we are about to upgrade and would like to
prepare in advance. For example:</p>

<p># service systemtap onboot myscript &gt; -r
3.12.6-200.fc19.x86_64</p>

<p>REMOVING SCRIPTS FROM THE INITRAMFS Finally, to remove
all script from the initramfs, we simple run the onboot
command without specifying any scripts:</p>

<p># service systemtap onboot</p>

<p>This will simply create a standard initramfs without any
System- Tap modules inserted.</p>

<p>TROUBLESHOOTING EARLY-BOOT ISSUES There can be many
reasons for which the module didnt insert or did not work as
expected. It may be useful to turn on dracut de- bugging by
adding rdinitdebug to the kernel command-line and checking
dmesg/journalctl -ae. Also, the stderr output of staprun can
be captured by setting the LOG_BOOT_ERR option to yes.</p>
