<p>SYMLINK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SYMLINK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME symlink - make a symbolic link to a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int symlink(const char *path1, const char *path2);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The symlink() function shall create a
symbolic link called path2 that contains the string pointed
to by path1 ( path2 is the name of the sym- bolic link
created, path1 is the string contained in the symbolic
link).</p>

<p>The string pointed to by path1 shall be treated only as
a character string and shall not be validated as a
pathname.</p>

<p>If the symlink() function fails for any reason other
than [EIO], any file named by path2 shall be unaffected.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, symlink() shall
return 0; otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The symlink() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Write permission is denied in the directory where
the symbolic link is being created, or search permission is
denied for a com- ponent of the path prefix of path2.</p>

<p>EEXIST The path2 argument names an existing file or
symbolic link.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurs while reading from or writing to
the file system.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path2 argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path2 argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a path- name component is longer than
{NAME_MAX} or the length of the path1 argument is longer
than {SYMLINK_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path2 does not name an existing
file or path2 is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The directory in which the entry for the new
symbolic link is being placed cannot be extended because no
space is left on the file system containing the directory,
or the new symbolic link cannot be created because no space
is left on the file system which shall contain the link, or
the file system is out of file- allocation resources.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix of path2 is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EROFS The new symbolic link would reside on a read-only
file system.</p>

<p>The symlink() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path2 argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG As a result of encountering a symbolic link
in resolution of the path2 argument, the length of the
substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX} bytes
(including the terminating null byte), or the length of the
string pointed to by path1 exceeded {SYM- LINK_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Like a hard link, a symbolic link
allows a file to have multiple logi- cal names. The presence
of a hard link guarantees the existence of a file, even
after the original name has been removed. A symbolic link
provides no such assurance; in fact, the file named by the
path1 argu- ment need not exist when the link is created. A
symbolic link can cross file system boundaries.</p>

<p>Normal permission checks are made on each component of
the symbolic link pathname during its resolution.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Since IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not require
any association of file times with symbolic links, there is
no requirement that file times be updated by symlink().</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
