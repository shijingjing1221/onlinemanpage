<p>NAME ldns-read-zone - read a zonefile and print it</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ldns-read-zone ZONEFILE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ldns-read-zone reads a DNS zone file and
prints it. The output has 1 resource record per line, and no
pretty-printing makeup.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Canonicalize all resource records in the zone
before printing</p>

<p>-d Only print DNSSEC data from the zone. This option
skips every record that is not of type NSEC, NSEC3, RRSIG or
DNSKEY. DS records are not printed.</p>

<p>-b Include Bubble Babble encoding of DSs.</p>

<p>-0 Print a (null) for the RRSIG inception, expiry and
key data. This option can be used when comparing different
signing systems that use the same DNSKEYs for signing but
would have a slightly different timings/jitter.</p>

<p>-h Show usage and exit</p>

<p>-n Do not print the SOA record</p>

<p>-p Pad the SOA serial number with spaces so the number
and the spaces together take ten characters. This is useful
for in file serial number increments.</p>

<p>-s Strip DNSSEC data from the zone. This option skips
every record that is of type NSEC, NSEC3, RRSIG or DNSKEY.
DS records are still printed.</p>

<p>-S [[+|0]number | YYYYMMDDxx | unixtime ] Set serial
number to the given number, or when preceded by a sign,
offset the exisiting number with it. When giving the lit-
eral strings YYYYMMDDxx or unixtime, the serial number is
tried to be reset in datecounter or in unixtime format
respectively. Though is the updated serial number is smaller
than the original one, the original one is simply increased
by one.</p>

<p>When updating a serial number, records of type NSEC,
NSEC3, RRSIG and DNSKEY will be skipped when printing the
zone.</p>

<p>-v Show the version and exit</p>

<p>-z Sort the zone before printing (this implies -c)</p>
