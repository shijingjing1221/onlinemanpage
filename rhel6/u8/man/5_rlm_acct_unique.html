<p>rlm_acct_unique(5) FreeRADIUS Module
rlm_acct_unique(5)</p>

<p>NAME rlm_acct_unique - FreeRADIUS Module</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rlm_acct_unique module creates a unique
accounting session Id.</p>

<p>Many NAS vendors have their equipment supply an
Acct-Session-Id attribute which is not unique over reboots.
This makes accounting dif- ficult, as there will be many
independent sessions with the same Acct- Session-Id
attribute. This module uses the Acct-Session-Id attribute,
along with other attributes in the request, to create a more
unique session ID, called Acct-Unique-Session-Id.</p>

<p>The main configuration items to be aware of are:</p>

<p>key A list of the attributes used in calculating an MD5
hash which is used as the value for the unique session
id.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION modules { ... acct_unique { key =
&quot;User-Name, Acct-Session-Id, NAS-IP-Address,
NAS-Port&quot; } ... } ... preacct { ... acct_unique ...
}</p>

<p>After generating the MD5 hash, the module adds it to the
accounting request packet received from the client. It will
look something like this in your detail file:</p>

<p>Acct-Unique-Session-Id =
&quot;c66ef57e480b9d26&quot;</p>

<p>NOTE: Any attribute you specify that is not found in the
dictionary file will cause the server to fail and exit with
an error.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you want the Acct-Unique-Session-Id of the
Start and the Stop packet of a particular session to match,
you must use values for the key that will stay the same for
the Start and Stop. The above example is a good start.
Adding Acct-Session-Time, for example, would cause a
mismatch because that value is not the same on the Start and
Stop accounting packets.</p>
