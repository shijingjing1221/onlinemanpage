<p>PS(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual PS(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ps - report process status</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ps [-aA][-defl][-G grouplist][-o format]...[-p
proclist][-t termlist]</p>

<p>[-U userlist][-g grouplist][-n namelist][-u
userlist]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ps utility shall write information about
processes, subject to hav- ing the appropriate privileges to
obtain information about those pro- cesses.</p>

<p>By default, ps shall select all processes with the same
effective user ID as the current user and the same
controlling terminal as the invoker.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The ps utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-a Write information for all processes associated with
terminals. Implementations may omit session leaders from
this list.</p>

<p>-A Write information for all processes.</p>

<p>-d Write information for all processes, except session
leaders.</p>

<p>-e Write information for all processes. (Equivalent to
-A.)</p>

<p>-f Generate a full listing. (See the STDOUT section for
the con- tents of a full listing.)</p>

<p>-g grouplist Write information for processes whose
session leaders are given in grouplist. The application
shall ensure that the grouplist is a single argument in the
form of a &lt;blank&gt; or comma-separated list.</p>

<p>-G grouplist Write information for processes whose real
group ID numbers are given in grouplist. The application
shall ensure that the grou- plist is a single argument in
the form of a &lt;blank&gt; or comma- separated list.</p>

<p>-l Generate a long listing. (See STDOUT for the contents
of a long listing.)</p>

<p>-n namelist Specify the name of an alternative system
namelist file in place of the default. The name of the
default file and the format of a namelist file are
unspecified.</p>

<p>-o format Write information according to the format
specification given in format. This is fully described in
the STDOUT section. Multi- ple -o options can be specified;
the format specification shall be interpreted as the
&lt;space&gt;-separated concatenation of all the format
option-arguments.</p>

<p>-p proclist Write information for processes whose
process ID numbers are given in proclist. The application
shall ensure that the pro- clist is a single argument in the
form of a &lt;blank&gt; or comma- separated list.</p>

<p>-t termlist Write information for processes associated
with terminals given in termlist. The application shall
ensure that the termlist is a single argument in the form of
a &lt;blank&gt; or comma-separated list. Terminal
identifiers shall be given in an implementation- defined
format. On XSI-conformant systems, they shall be given in
one of two forms: the device s filename (for example, tty04)
or, if the devices filename starts with tty, just the
identi- fier following the characters tty (for example,
&quot;04&quot; ).</p>

<p>-u userlist Write information for processes whose user
ID numbers or login names are given in userlist. The
application shall ensure that the userlist is a single
argument in the form of a &lt;blank&gt; or comma-separated
list. In the listing, the numerical user ID shall be written
unless the -f option is used, in which case the login name
shall be written.</p>

<p>-U userlist Write information for processes whose real
user ID numbers or login names are given in userlist. The
application shall ensure that the userlist is a single
argument in the form of a &lt;blank&gt; or comma-separated
list.</p>

<p>With the exception of -o format, all of the options
shown are used to select processes. If any are specified,
the default list shall be ignored and ps shall select the
processes represented by the inclusive OR of all the
selection-criteria options.</p>

<p>OPERANDS None.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of ps:</p>

<p>COLUMNS Override the system-selected horizontal display
line size, used to determine the number of text columns to
display. See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environ- ment Variables for valid
values and results when it is unset or null.</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>LC_TIME Determine the format and contents of the date
and time strings displayed.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>TZ Determine the timezone used to calculate date and
time strings displayed. If TZ is unset or null, an
unspecified default time- zone shall be used.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT When the -o option is not specified, the standard
output format is unspecified.</p>

<p>On XSI-conformant systems, the output format shall be as
follows. The column headings and descriptions of the columns
in a ps listing are given below. The precise meanings of
these fields are implementation- defined. The letters
fandl(below) indicate the option ( full or long) that shall
cause the corresponding heading to appear; all means that
the heading always appears. Note that these two options
determine only what information is provided for a process;
they do not determine which processes are listed.</p>

<p>F (l) Flags (octal and additive) associated with the
process. S (l) The state of the process. UID (f,l) The user
ID number of the process owner; the login name is printed
under the -f option. PID (all) The process ID of the
process; it is possible to kill a process if this datum is
known. PPID (f,l) The process ID of the parent process. C
(f,l) Processor utilization for scheduling. PRI (l) The
priority of the process; higher num- bers mean lower
priority. NI (l) Nice value; used in priority computa- tion.
ADDR (l) The address of the process. SZ (l) The size in
blocks of the core image of the process. WCHAN (l) The event
for which the process is wait- ing or sleeping; if blank,
the process is running.</p>

<p>STIME (f) Starting time of the process. TTY (all) The
controlling terminal for the pro- cess. TIME (all) The
cumulative execution time for the process. CMD (all) The
command name; the full command name and its arguments are
written under the -f option.</p>

<p>A process that has exited and has a parent, but has not
yet been waited for by the parent, shall be marked
defunct.</p>

<p>Under the option -f, ps tries to determine the command
name and argu- ments given when the process was created by
examining memory or the swap area. Failing this, the command
name, as it would appear without the option -f, is written
in square brackets.</p>

<p>The -o option allows the output format to be specified
under user con- trol.</p>

<p>The application shall ensure that the format
specification is a list of names presented as a single
argument, &lt;blank&gt; or comma-separated. Each variable
has a default header. The default header can be overridden
by appending an equals sign and the new text of the header.
The rest of the characters in the argument shall be used as
the header text. The fields specified shall be written in
the order specified on the command line, and should be
arranged in columns in the output. The field widths shall be
selected by the system to be at least as wide as the header
text (default or overridden value). If the header text is
null, such as -o user=, the field width shall be at least as
wide as the default header text. If all header text fields
are null, no header line shall be written.</p>

<p>The following names are recognized in the POSIX
locale:</p>

<p>ruser The real user ID of the process. This shall be the
textual user ID, if it can be obtained and the field width
permits, or a dec- imal representation otherwise.</p>

<p>user The effective user ID of the process. This shall be
the textual user ID, if it can be obtained and the field
width permits, or a decimal representation otherwise.</p>

<p>rgroup The real group ID of the process. This shall be
the textual group ID, if it can be obtained and the field
width permits, or a decimal representation otherwise.</p>

<p>group The effective group ID of the process. This shall
be the textual group ID, if it can be obtained and the field
width permits, or a decimal representation otherwise.</p>

<p>pid The decimal value of the process ID.</p>

<p>ppid The decimal value of the parent process ID.</p>

<p>pgid The decimal value of the process group ID.</p>

<p>pcpu The ratio of CPU time used recently to CPU time
available in the same period, expressed as a percentage. The
meaning of &quot;recently&quot; in this context is
unspecified. The CPU time avail- able is determined in an
unspecified manner.</p>

<p>vsz The size of the process in (virtual) memory in 1024
byte units as a decimal integer.</p>

<p>nice The decimal value of the nice value of the process;
see nice() .</p>

<p>etime In the POSIX locale, the elapsed time since the
process was started, in the form:</p>

<p>[[dd-]hh:]mm:ss</p>

<p>where dd shall represent the number of days, hh the
number of hours, mm the number of minutes, and ss the number
of seconds. The dd field shall be a decimal integer. The hh,
mm, and ss fields shall be two-digit dec- imal integers
padded on the left with zeros.</p>

<p>time In the POSIX locale, the cumulative CPU time of the
process in the form:</p>

<p>[dd-]hh:mm:ss</p>

<p>The dd, hh, mm, and ss fields shall be as described in
the etime speci- fier.</p>

<p>tty The name of the controlling terminal of the process
(if any) in the same format used by the who utility.</p>

<p>comm The name of the command being executed ( argv[0]
value) as a string.</p>

<p>args The command with all its arguments as a string. The
implementa- tion may truncate this value to the field width;
it is implemen- tation-defined whether any further
truncation occurs. It is unspecified whether the string
represented is a version of the argument list as it was
passed to the command when it started, or is a version of
the arguments as they may have been modified by the
application. Applications cannot depend on being able to
modify their argument list and having that modification be
reflected in the output of ps.</p>

<p>Any field need not be meaningful in all implementations.
In such a case a hyphen (-) should be output in place of the
field value.</p>

<p>Only comm and args shall be allowed to contain
&lt;blank&gt;s; all others shall not. Any
implementation-defined variables shall be specified in the
system documentation along with the default header and
indicating whether the field may contain &lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p>The following table specifies the default header to be
used in the POSIX locale corresponding to each format
specifier.</p>

<p>Table: Variable Names and Default Headers in ps</p>

<p>Format Specifier Default Header Format Specifier Default
Header args COMMAND ppid PPID comm COMMAND rgroup RGROUP
etime ELAPSED ruser RUSER group GROUP time TIME nice NI tty
TT pcpu %CPU user USER pgid PGID vsz VSZ pid PID</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Things can change while ps is running;
the snapshot it gives is only true for an instant, and might
not be accurate by the time it is dis- played.</p>

<p>The args format specifier is allowed to produce a
truncated version of the command arguments. In some
implementations, this information is no longer available
when the ps utility is executed.</p>

<p>If the field width is too narrow to display a textual
ID, the system may use a numeric version. Normally, the
system would be expected to choose large enough field
widths, but if a large number of fields were selected to
write, it might squeeze fields to their minimum sizes to fit
on one line. One way to ensure adequate width for the
textual IDs is to override the default header for a field to
make it larger than most or all user or group names.</p>

<p>There is no special quoting mechanism for header text.
The header text is the rest of the argument. If multiple
header changes are needed, multiple -o options can be used,
such as:</p>

<p>ps -o &quot;user=User Name&quot; -o pid=ProcessID</p>

<p>On some implementations, especially multi-level secure
systems, ps may be severely restricted and produce
information only about child pro- cesses owned by the
user.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The command:</p>

<p>ps -o user,pid,ppid=MOM -o args</p>

<p>writes at least the following in the POSIX locale:</p>

<p>USER PID MOM COMMAND helene 34 12 ps -o uid,pid,ppid=MOM
-o args</p>

<p>The contents of the COMMAND field need not be the same
in all implemen- tations, due to possible truncation.</p>

<p>RATIONALE There is very little commonality between BSD
and System V implementa- tions of ps. Many options conflict
or have subtly different usages. The standard developers
attempted to select a set of options for the base standard
that were useful on a wide range of systems and selected
options that either can be implemented on both BSD and
System V-based systems without breaking the current
implementations or where the options are sufficiently
similar that any changes would not be unduly problematic for
users or implementors.</p>

<p>It is recognized that on some implementations,
especially multi-level secure systems, ps may be nearly
useless. The default output has there- fore been chosen such
that it does not break historical implementations and also
is likely to provide at least some useful information on
most systems.</p>

<p>The major change is the addition of the format
specification capabil- ity. The motivation for this
invention is to provide a mechanism for users to access a
wider range of system information, if the system per- mits
it, in a portable manner. The fields chosen to appear in
this vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 were arrived at after
considering what con- cepts were likely to be both
reasonably useful to the &quot;average&quot; user and had a
reasonable chance of being implemented on a wide range of
systems. Again it is recognized that not all systems are
able to pro- vide all the information and, conversely, some
may wish to provide more. It is hoped that the approach
adopted will be sufficiently flexi- ble and extensible to
accommodate most systems. Implementations may be expected to
introduce new format specifiers.</p>

<p>The default output should consist of a short listing
containing the process ID, terminal name, cumulative
execution time, and command name of each process.</p>

<p>The preference of the standard developers would have
been to make the format specification an operand of the ps
command. Unfortunately, BSD usage precluded this.</p>

<p>At one time a format was included to display the
environment array of the process. This was deleted because
there is no portable way to dis- play it.</p>

<p>The -A option is equivalent to the BSD -g and the SVID
-e. Because the two systems differed, a mnemonic compromise
was selected.</p>

<p>The -a option is described with some optional behavior
because the SVID omits session leaders, but BSD does
not.</p>

<p>In an early proposal, format specifiers appeared for
priority and start time. The former was not defined
adequately in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 and was
removed in deference to the defined nice value; the latter
because elapsed time was considered to be more use- ful.</p>

<p>In a new BSD version of ps, a -O option can be used to
write all of the default information, followed by additional
format specifiers. This was not adopted because the default
output is implementation-defined. Nev- ertheless, this is a
useful option that should be reserved for that purpose. In
the -o option for the POSIX Shell and Utilities ps, the
format is the concatenation of each -o. Therefore, the user
can have an alias or function that defines the beginning of
their desired format and add more fields to the end of the
output in certain cases where that would be useful.</p>

<p>The format of the terminal name is unspecified, but the
descriptions of ps, talk, who, and write require that they
all use the same format.</p>

<p>The pcpu field indicates that the CPU time available is
determined in an unspecified manner. This is because it is
difficult to express an algorithm that is useful across all
possible machine architectures. Historical counterparts to
this value have attempted to show percentage of use in the
recent past, such as the preceding minute. Frequently, these
values for all processes did not add up to 100%.
Implementations are encouraged to provide data in this field
to users that will help them identify processes currently
affecting the performance of the sys- tem.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
