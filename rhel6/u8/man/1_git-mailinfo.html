<p>GIT-MAILINFO(1) Git Manual GIT-MAILINFO(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-mailinfo - Extracts patch and authorship from a
single e-mail message</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git mailinfo [-k|-b] [-u |
--encoding=&lt;encoding&gt; | -n] [--scissors] &lt;msg&gt;
&lt;patch&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Reads a single e-mail message from the
standard input, and writes the commit log message in
&lt;msg&gt; file, and the patches in &lt;patch&gt; file. The
author name, e-mail and e-mail subject are written out to
the standard output to be used by git am to create a commit.
It is usually not necessary to use this command directly.
See git-am(1) instead.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -k Usually the program cleans up the Subject:
header line to extract the title line for the commit log
message, among which (1) remove Re: or re:, (2) leading
whitespaces, (3) [ up to ], typically [PATCH], and then
prepends &quot;[PATCH] &quot;. This flag forbids this
munging, and is most useful when used to read back git
format-patch -k output.</p>

<p>-b When -k is not in effect, all leading strings
bracketed with [ and ] pairs are stripped. This option
limits the stripping to only the pairs whose bracketed
string contains the word &quot;PATCH&quot;.</p>

<p>-u The commit log message, author name and author email
are taken from the e-mail, and after minimally decoding MIME
transfer encoding, re-coded in UTF-8 by transliterating
them. This used to be optional but now it is the
default.</p>

<p>Note that the patch is always used as-is without charset
conversion, even with this flag.</p>

<p>--encoding=&lt;encoding&gt; Similar to -u but if the
local convention is different from what is specified by
i18n.commitencoding, this flag can be used to override
it.</p>

<p>-n Disable all charset re-coding of the metadata.</p>

<p>--scissors Remove everything in body before a scissors
line. A line that mainly consists of scissors (either
&quot;&gt;8&quot; or &quot;8&lt;&quot;) and perforation
(dash &quot;-&quot;) marks is called a scissors line, and is
used to request the reader to cut the message at that line.
If such a line appears in the body of the message before the
patch, everything before it (including the scissors line
itself) is ignored when this option is used.</p>

<p>This is useful if you want to begin your message in a
discussion thread with comments and suggestions on the
message you are responding to, and to conclude it with a
patch submission, separating the discussion and the
beginning of the proposed commit log message with a scissors
line.</p>

<p>This can enabled by default with the configuration
option mailinfo.scissors.</p>

<p>--no-scissors Ignore scissors lines. Useful for
overriding mailinfo.scissors settings.</p>

<p>&lt;msg&gt; The commit log message extracted from
e-mail, usually except the title line which comes from
e-mail Subject.</p>

<p>&lt;patch&gt; The patch extracted from e-mail.</p>
