<p>RUSERS(1) BSD General Commands Manual RUSERS(1)</p>

<p>NAME rusers - who is logged in to machines on local
network</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rusers [-al] [host ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rusers command produces output similar
to who, but for the list of hosts or all machines on the
local network. For each host responding to the rusers query,
the hostname with the names of the users currently logged on
is printed on each line. The rusers command will wait for
one minute to catch late responders.</p>

<p>The following options are available:</p>

<p>-a Print all machines responding even if no one is
currently logged in.</p>

<p>-l Print a long format listing. This includes the user
name, host name, tty that the user is logged in to, the date
and time the user logged in, the amount of time since the
user typed on the keyboard, and the remote host they logged
in from (if applica- ble).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS rusers: RPC: Program not registered The
rpc.rusersd(8) daemon has not been started on the remote
host.</p>

<p>rusers: RPC: Timed out A communication error occurred.
Either the network is exces- sively congested, or the
rpc.rusersd(8) daemon has terminated on the remote host.</p>

<p>rusers: RPC: Port mapper failure - RPC: Timed out The
remote host is not running the portmapper (see portmap(8) ),
and cannot accomodate any RPC-based services. The host may
be down.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO rwho(1) users(1), who(1), portmap(8),
rpc.rusersd(8)</p>

<p>HISTORY The rusers command appeared in SunOS.</p>

<p>BUGS The sorting options are not implemented.</p>
