<p>NETREPORT(1) NETREPORT(1)</p>

<p>NAME netreport - request notification of network
interface changes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS netreport [-r]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION netreport tells the network management
scripts to send a SIGIO signal to the process which called
netreport when any network interface status changes
occur.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -r Remove the current request (if any) for the
calling process.</p>

<p>NOTES If a program does not call netreport with the -r
option before it exits, and another process is created with
the same PID before any changes take place in interface
status, it is possible that the new process will receive a
spurious SIGIO.</p>
