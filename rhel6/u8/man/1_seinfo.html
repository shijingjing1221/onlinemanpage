<p>NAME seinfo - SELinux policy query tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS seinfo [OPTIONS] [EXPRESSION] [POLICY ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION seinfo allows the user to query the
components of a SELinux policy.</p>

<p>POLICY seinfo supports loading a SELinux policy in one
of four formats.</p>

<p>source A single text file containing policy source for
versions 12 through 21. This file is usually named
policy.conf.</p>

<p>binary A single file containing a monolithic kernel
binary policy for versions 15 through 21. This file is
usually named by version - for example, policy.20.</p>

<p>modular A list of policy packages each containing a
loadable policy mod- ule. The first module listed must be a
base module.</p>

<p>policy list A single text file containing all the
information needed to load a policy, usually exported by
SETools graphical utilities.</p>

<p>If no policy file is provided, seinfo will search for
the system default policy: checking first for a source
policy, next for a binary policy matching the running
kernels preferred version, and finally for the highest
version that can be found. In the latter case, the policy
will be downgraded to match the running system. If no policy
can be found, seinfo will print an error message and
exit.</p>

<p>EXPRESSIONS One or more of the following component types
can be queried. Each option may only be specified once. If
an option is provided multiple times, the last instance will
be used. Some components support the -x flag to print
expanded information about that component; if a particu- lar
component specified does not support expanded information,
the flag will be ignored for that component (see -x below).
If no expressions are provided, policy statistics will be
printed (see --stats below).</p>

<p>-c[NAME], --class[=NAME] Print a list of object classes
or, if NAME is provided, print the object class NAME. With
-x, print a list of permissions for each displayed object
class.</p>

<p>--sensitivity[=NAME] Print a list of sensitivities or,
if NAME is provided, print the sensitivity NAME. With -x,
print the corresponding level state- ment for each displayed
sensitivity.</p>

<p>--category[=NAME] Print a list of categories or, if NAME
is provided, print the category NAME. With -x, print a list
of sensitivities with which each displayed category may be
associated.</p>

<p>-t[NAME], --type[=NAME] Print a list of types (not
including aliases or attributes) or, if NAME is provided,
print the type NAME. With -x, print a list of attributes
which include each displayed type.</p>

<p>-a[NAME], --attribute[=NAME] Print a list of type
attributes or, if NAME is provided, print the attribute
NAME. With -x, print a list of types assigned to each
displayed attribute.</p>

<p>-r[NAME], --role[=NAME] Print a list of roles or, if
NAME is provided, print the role NAME. With -x, print a list
of types assigned to each displayed role.</p>

<p>-u[NAME], --user[=NAME] Print a list of users or, if
NAME is provided, print the user NAME. With -x, print a list
of roles assigned to each displayed user.</p>

<p>-b[NAME], --bool[=NAME] Print a list of conditional
booleans or, if NAME is provided, print the boolean NAME.
With -x, print the default state of each displayed
conditional boolean.</p>

<p>--initialsid[=NAME] Print a list of initial SIDs or, if
NAME is provided, print the initial SID NAME. With -x, print
the context assigned to each displayed SID.</p>

<p>--fs_use[=TYPE] Print a list of fs_use statements or, if
TYPE is provided, print the statement for filesystem TYPE.
There is no expanded infor- mation for this component.</p>

<p>--genfscon[=TYPE] Print a list of genfscon statements
or, if TYPE is provided, print the statement for the
filesystem TYPE. There is no expanded information for this
component.</p>

<p>--netifcon[=NAME] Print a list of netif contexts or, if
NAME is provided, print the statement for interface NAME.
There is no expanded informa- tion for this component.</p>

<p>--nodecon[=ADDR] Print a list of node contexts or, if
ADDR is provided, print the statement for the node with
address ADDR. There is no expanded information for this
component.</p>

<p>--portcon[=PORT] Print a list of port contexts or, if
PORT is provided, print the statement for port PORT. There
is no expanded information for this component.</p>

<p>--protocol=PROTO Print only portcon statements for the
protocol PROTO. This option is ignored if portcon statements
are not printed or if no statement exists for the requested
port.</p>

<p>--constrain Print a list of constraints. There is no
expanded information for this component.</p>

<p>--all Print all components.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -x, --expand Print additional details for each
component matching the expres- sion. These details include
the types assigned to an attribute or role and the
permissions for an object class. This option is not
available for all component types; see the description of
each component for the details this option will provide.</p>

<p>--stats Print policy statistics including policy type
and version infor- mation and counts of all components and
rules.</p>

<p>-l Print line breaks when displaying constraint
statements.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print help information and exit.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print version information and exit.</p>
