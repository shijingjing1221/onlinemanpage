<p>MQ_SEND(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MQ_SEND(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mq_send, mq_timedsend - send a message to a message
queue (REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;mqueue.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mq_send(mqd_t mqdes, const char *msg_ptr, size_t
msg_len, unsigned msg_prio);</p>

<p>#include &lt;mqueue.h&gt; #include &lt;time.h&gt; int
mq_timedsend(mqd_t mqdes, const char *msg_ptr, size_t
msg_len, unsigned msg_prio, const struct timespec
*abs_timeout);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mq_send() function shall add the message
pointed to by the argument msg_ptr to the message queue
specified by mqdes. The msg_len argument specifies the
length of the message, in bytes, pointed to by msg_ptr. The
value of msg_len shall be less than or equal to the
mq_msgsize attribute of the message queue, or mq_send()
shall fail.</p>

<p>If the specified message queue is not full, mq_send()
shall behave as if the message is inserted into the message
queue at the position indi- cated by the msg_prio argument.
A message with a larger numeric value of msg_prio shall be
inserted before messages with lower values of msg_prio. A
message shall be inserted after other messages in the queue,
if any, with equal msg_prio. The value of msg_prio shall be
less than {MQ_PRIO_MAX}.</p>

<p>If the specified message queue is full and O_NONBLOCK is
not set in the message queue description associated with
mqdes, mq_send() shall block until space becomes available
to enqueue the message, or until mq_send() is interrupted by
a signal. If more than one thread is wait- ing to send when
space becomes available in the message queue and the
Priority Scheduling option is supported, then the thread of
the highest priority that has been waiting the longest shall
be unblocked to send its message. Otherwise, it is
unspecified which waiting thread is unblocked. If the
specified message queue is full and O_NONBLOCK is set in the
message queue description associated with mqdes, the message
shall not be queued and mq_send() shall return an error.</p>

<p>The mq_timedsend() function shall add a message to the
message queue specified by mqdes in the manner defined for
the mq_send() function. However, if the specified message
queue is full and O_NONBLOCK is not set in the message queue
description associated with mqdes, the wait for sufficient
room in the queue shall be terminated when the specified
timeout expires. If O_NONBLOCK is set in the message queue
description, this function shall be equivalent to
mq_send().</p>

<p>The timeout shall expire when the absolute time
specified by abs_time- out passes, as measured by the clock
on which timeouts are based (that is, when the value of that
clock equals or exceeds abs_timeout), or if the absolute
time specified by abs_timeout has already been passed at the
time of the call.</p>

<p>If the Timers option is supported, the timeout shall be
based on the CLOCK_REALTIME clock; if the Timers option is
not supported, the time- out shall be based on the system
clock as returned by the time() func- tion.</p>

<p>The resolution of the timeout shall be the resolution of
the clock on which it is based. The timespec argument is
defined in the &lt;time.h&gt; header.</p>

<p>Under no circumstance shall the operation fail with a
timeout if there is sufficient room in the queue to add the
message immediately. The validity of the abs_timeout
parameter need not be checked when there is sufficient room
in the queue.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the mq_send()
and mq_timedsend() functions shall return a value of zero.
Otherwise, no message shall be enqueued, the functions shall
return -1, and errno shall be set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The mq_send() and mq_timedsend() functions shall
fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The O_NONBLOCK flag is set in the message queue
description associated with mqdes, and the specified message
queue is full.</p>

<p>EBADF The mqdes argument is not a valid message queue
descriptor open for writing.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal interrupted the call to mq_send() or
mq_timedsend().</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of msg_prio was outside the valid
range.</p>

<p>EINVAL The process or thread would have blocked, and the
abs_timeout parameter specified a nanoseconds field value
less than zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.</p>

<p>EMSGSIZE The specified message length, msg_len, exceeds
the message size attribute of the message queue.</p>

<p>ETIMEDOUT The O_NONBLOCK flag was not set when the
message queue was opened, but the timeout expired before the
message could be added to the queue.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The value of the symbol {MQ_PRIO_MAX}
limits the number of priority levels supported by the
application. Message priorities range from 0 to
{MQ_PRIO_MAX}-1.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
