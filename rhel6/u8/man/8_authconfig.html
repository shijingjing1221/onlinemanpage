<p>AUTHCONFIG(8) AUTHCONFIG(8)</p>

<p>NAME authconfig, authconfig-tui - an interface for
configuring system authentication resources</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS authconfig [options]
{--update|--updateall|--test|--probe|--restorebackup
&lt;name&gt;|--savebackup
&lt;name&gt;|--restorelastbackup}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION authconfig provides a simple method of
configuring /etc/sysconfig/net- work to handle NIS, as well
as /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow, the files used for shadow
password support. Basic LDAP, Kerberos 5, and Winbind client
configuration is also provided.</p>

<p>If --test action is specified, authconfig can be run by
users other then root, and any configuration changes are not
saved but printed instead. If --update action is specified,
authconfig must be run by root (or through console helper),
and configuration changes are saved. Only the files affected
by the configuration changes are overwritten. If --updateall
action is specified, authconfig must be run by root (or
through console helper), and all configuration files are
written. The --probe action instructs authconfig to use DNS
and other means to guess at configuration information for
the current host, print its guesses if it finds them to
standard output, and exit.</p>

<p>The --restorebackup, --savebackup, and
--restorelastbackup actions pro- vide a possibility to save
and later restore a backup of configuration files which
authconfig modifies. Authconfig also saves an automatic
backup of configuration files before every configuration
change. This special backup can be restored by the
--restorelastbackup action.</p>

<p>If --nostart is specified (which is what the install
program does), ypbind or other daemons will not be started
or stopped immediately fol- lowing program execution, but
only enabled to start or stop at boot time.</p>

<p>The --enablenis, --enableldap, --enablewinbind, and
--enablehesiod options are used to configure user
information services in /etc/nss- witch.conf, the
--enablecache option is used to configure naming ser- vices
caching, and the --enableshadow, --enableldapauth,
--enablekrb5, and --enablewinbindauth options are used to
configure authentication functions via
/etc/pam.d/system-auth. Each --enable has a matching
--disable option that disables the service if it is already
enabled. The respective services have parameters which
configure their server names etc.</p>

<p>The algorithm used for storing new password hashes can
be specified by the --passalgo option which takes one of the
following possible values as a parameter: descrypt,
bigcrypt, md5, sha256, and sha512.</p>

<p>The --enablelocauthorize option allows to bypass
checking network authentication services for authorization
and the --enablesysnetauth allows authentication of system
accounts (with uid &lt; 500) by these ser- vices.</p>

<p>When the configuration settings allow use of SSSD for
user information services and authentication, SSSD will be
automatically used instead of the legacy services and the
SSSD configuration will be set up so there is a default
domain populated with the settings required to connect the
services. The --enablesssd and --enablesssdauth options
force adding SSSD to /etc/nsswitch.conf and
/etc/pam.d/system-auth, but they do not set up the domain in
the SSSD configuration files. The SSSD configura- tion has
to be set up manually. The allowed configuration of services
for SSSD are: LDAP for user information (--enableldap) and
either LDAP (--enableldapauth), or Kerberos (--enablekrb5)
for authentication.</p>

<p>In case SSSD does not support some feature of the legacy
services that are required for the site configuration, the
use of the legacy services can be forced by setting
FORCELEGACY=yes in /etc/sysconfig/authconfig.</p>

<p>The list of options mentioned here in the manual page is
not exhaus- tive, please refer to authconfig --help for the
complete list of the options.</p>

<p>The authconfig-tui supports all options of authconfig
but it implies --update as the default action. Its window
contains a Cancel button by default. If --back option is
specified at run time, a Back button is presented instead.
If --kickstart is specified, no interactive screens will be
seen. The values the program will use will be those
specified by the other options (--passalgo, --enableshadow,
etc.).</p>

<p>For namelist you may substitute either a single name or
a comma-sepa- rated list of names.</p>

<p>NOTES The authconfig-tui is deprecated. No new
configuration settings will be supported by its text user
interface. Use system-config-authentication GUI application
or the command line options instead.</p>

<p>The SSSD service is enabled and possibly started by
authconfig when at least two of the following three
conditions are met: 1) /etc/sssd/sssd.conf file exists (or
is configured via the implicit SSSD support) 2) SSSD
authentication is enabled (pam_sss.so is used in PAM
configura- tion) 3) SSSD is enabled for user identity
(nsswitch.conf contains sss)</p>

<p>When --update action is used the enablement or
disablement and possible restart of services happens only in
case the changed configuration options affect the service to
be restarted. This means that if for example the ypbind
service is enabled with authconfig --update --nos- tart
--enablenis but not started and you run the same command
without the --nostart later the ypbind service will not be
started because no configuration change affecting ypbind
happened.</p>

<p>RETURN CODES authconfig returns 0 on success, 2 on
error.</p>

<p>authconfig-tui returns 0 on success, 2 on error, and 1
if the user can- celled the program (by using either the
Cancel or Back button).</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sysconfig/authconfig Used to track whether or
not particular authentication mechanisms are enabled.
Currently includes variables named USESHADOW, USEMD5,
USEKERBEROS, USELDAPAUTH, USESM- BAUTH, USEWINBIND,
USEWINBINDAUTH, USEHESIOD, USENIS, USELDAP, and others.
/etc/passwd /etc/shadow Used for shadow password support.
/etc/yp.conf Configuration file for NIS support.
/etc/sysconfig/network Another configuration file for NIS
support. /etc/ldap.conf /etc/nss_ldap.conf
/etc/pam_ldap.conf /etc/nslcd.conf /etc/openldap/ldap.conf
Used to configure nss_ldap, pam_ldap, nslcd, and the
OpenLDAP library. Only the files already existing on the
system are modified. /etc/krb5.conf Used to configure
Kerberos 5. /etc/hesiod.conf Used to configure Hesiod.
/etc/samba/smb.conf Used to configure winbind
authentication. /etc/nsswitch.conf Used to configure user
information services. /etc/login.defs Used to configure
parameters of user accounts (minimum UID of a regular user,
password hashing algorithm). /etc/pam.d/system-auth Common
PAM configuration for system services which include it using
the include directive. It is created as symlink and not
relinked if it points to another file.
/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac Contains the actual PAM
configuration for system services and is the default target
of the /etc/pam.d/system-auth symlink. If a local
configuration of PAM is created (and symlinked from
system-auth file) this file can be included there.</p>
