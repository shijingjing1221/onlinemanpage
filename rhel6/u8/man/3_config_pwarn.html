<p>DESCRIPTION The functions are a fairly extensible system
of parsing various config- uration files at the run time of
an application. The configuration file flow is broken into
the following phases:</p>

<p>1. Registration of handlers.</p>

<p>2. Reading of the configuration files for pre-MIB
parsing require- ments.</p>

<p>3. Reading and parsing of the textual MIB files.</p>

<p>4. Reading of the configuration files for configuration
direc- tives.</p>

<p>5. Optionally re-reading the configuration files at a
future date.</p>

<p>The idea is that the calling application is able to
register handlers for certain tokens specified in certain
named configuration files. The read_configs() function can
then be called to look for all relevant configuration files,
match the first word on each line against the list of
registered tokens and pass the remainder of the line to the
appro- priate registered handler.</p>

<p>REGISTERING A HANDLER register_config_handler()
Registers a configuration handler routine, which should be
called to process configuration directives starting with the
specified token. For example:</p>

<p>register_config_handler(&quot;snmp&quot;,
&quot;exampleToken&quot;, exam- ple_handler, NULL,
&quot;ARG1 [ARG2]&quot;);</p>

<p>would register the example_handler() function so that it
will get called every time the first word of a line in the
snmp.conf configuration file(s) matches
&quot;exampleToken&quot;. Calling the appropriate handlers
to process the configuration file directives is the
responsibility of read_configs() (see below).</p>

<p>register_premib_handler() Similar to the
register_config_handler() function, but the reg- istered
handler routine will be called before the textual MIBs are
read in. This is typically used for tokens that will affect
the configuration of the MIB parser, and will normally only
be used within the SNMP library itself.</p>

<p>register_mib_handlers() Initialisation routine to
register the internal SNMP library configuration
handlers.</p>

<p>unregister_config_handler() Removes the registered
configuration handler for the specified filePrefix and
token.</p>

<p>unregister_all_config_handlers() Removes all registered
configuration handlers.</p>

<p>Token Handlers Handler functions should have the
following signature:</p>

<p>void handler(const char *token, char *line);</p>

<p>The function will be called with two arguments, the
first being the token that triggered the call to this
function (i.e. the token used when registering the handler),
and the second being the remainder of the configuration file
line (i.e. everything following the white space following
the matched token).</p>

<p>Freeing Handlers If the token handler function
dynamically allocates resources when pro- cessing a
configuration entry, then these may need to be released
before re-reading the configuration files. If the fourth
parameter ( releaser ) passed to register_config_handler is
non-NULL, then this specifies a function to be called before
re-reading the configuration files. This function should
free any resources allocated by the token handler function
and reset its notion of the configuration to its default.
The token handler function can then safely be called again.
No arguments are passed to the resource freeing handler.
Note that this function is not called when the handler is
unregistered individually (but is called as part of
unregister_all_config_handlers() ).</p>

<p>Application Handlers register_app_config_handler()</p>

<p>register_app_premib_handler()</p>

<p>unregister_app_config_handler() These functions are
analagous to register_config_handler(), reg-
ister_premib_handler() and unregister_config_handler() but
do not require the file type argument (which is filled in by
the application). It is intended that MIB modules written
for the agent use these functions to allow the agent to have
more con- trol over which configuration files are read
(typically the snmpd.conf files).</p>

<p>READING CONFIGURATION FILES read_premib_configs()</p>

<p>read_configs() These routines process the configuration
files found in the con- figuration search path (see below).
For each entry, the handler registered for that
configuration token is called.</p>

<p>read_premib_configs() is run before the MIB files are
read in, and pro- cesses those configuration tokens
registered using register_premib_han- dler() (or
register_app_premib_handler() ). All other entries are
ignored.</p>

<p>read_configs() is run after the MIB files have been read
in, and pro- cesses those configuration tokens registered
using register_config_han- dler() (or
register_app_config_handler() ). If it encounters a config-
uration token for which no handler has been registered
(either pre- or post-mib), then it will display a warning
message, and continue pro- cessing with the next line of the
configuration file.</p>

<p>Configuration Search Path The configuration files to be
read are found by searching a list of configuration
directories for appropriately named files. In each such
directory, the library will look for files named snmp.conf,
snmp.local.conf, app.conf, app.local.conf, (where app is the
appica- tion-specific filePrefix used to register
configuration handlers). It is not necessary for any or all
of these files to be present in each directory. Missing
files will be silently skipped. The idea behind the two
different suffixes is that the first file can be shared (via
rdist or an NFS mount) across a large number of machines and
the second file can be used to configure local settings for
one particular machine.</p>

<p>The default list of directories to search is /etc/snmp,
followed by /usr/share/snmp, followed by /usr/lib(64)/snmp,
followed by $HOME/.snmp. This list can be changed by setting
the environmental variable SNMPCONFPATH to be a (colon
separated) list of directories to search.</p>

<p>init_snmp() The normal mode of operation would be to
register the application-spe- cific configuration handlers,
and then invoke init_snmp(). This would call the routines
listed above to register the internal library config-
uration handlers, process any configuration tokens
registered with reg- ister_premib_handler(), read in the
textual MIB files using init_mib(), and finally parse the
configuration file tokens registered with regis-
ter_config_handler().</p>

<p>If the init_snmp() function is used, none of these
functions need to be explicitly called by the
application.</p>

<p>HELP STRINGS AND ERRORS The usageLine parameter passed
to register_config_handler() and similar calls, is used to
display help information when the read_con-
fig_print_usage() function is called. This function is used
by all of the applications when the -H flag is passed on the
command line. It prints a summary of all of the
configuration file lines, and the asso- ciated files, that
the configuration system understands. The usageLine
parameter should be a list of arguments expected after the
token, and not a lengthy description (which should go into a
manual page instead). The lead prefix will be prepended to
each line that the function prints to stderr, where it
displays its output.</p>

<p>The init_snmp() function should be called before the
read_con- fig_print_usage() function is called, so that the
library can register its configuration file directives as
well for the read_con- fig_print_usage() function to
display.</p>

<p>Error Handling Functions The two functions
config_pwarn() and config_perror() both take an error string
as an argument and print it to stderr along with the file
and line number that caused the error. A call to the second
function will also force read_configs() to eventually return
with an error code indi- cating to its calling function that
it should abort the operation of the application.</p>
