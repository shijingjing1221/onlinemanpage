<p>DESCRIPTION pidl is an IDL compiler written in Perl that
aims to be somewhat compatible with the midl compiler. IDL
is short for &quot;Interface Definition Language&quot;.</p>

<p>pidl can generate stubs for DCE/RPC server code, DCE/RPC
client code and Wireshark dissectors for DCE/RPC
traffic.</p>

<p>IDL compilers like pidl take a description of an
interface as their input and use it to generate C (though
support for other languages may be added later) code that
can use these interfaces, pretty print data sent using these
interfaces, or even generate Wireshark dissectors that can
parse data sent over the wire by these interfaces.</p>

<p>pidl takes IDL files in the same format as is used by
midl, converts it to a .pidl file (which contains pidl s
internal representation of the interface) and can then
generate whatever output you need. .pidl files should be
used for debugging purposes only. Write your interface
definitions in .idl format.</p>

<p>The goal of pidl is to implement a IDL compiler that can
be used while developing the RPC subsystem in Samba (for
both marshalling/unmarshalling and debugging purposes).</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Show list of available options.</p>

<p>--version Show pidl version</p>

<p>--outputdir OUTNAME Write output files to the specified
directory. Defaults to the current directory.</p>

<p>--includedir DIR Add DIR to the search path used by the
preprocessor. This option can be specified multiple
times.</p>

<p>--parse-idl-tree Read internal tree structure from input
files rather than assuming they contain IDL.</p>

<p>--dump-idl Generate a new IDL file. File will be named
OUTNAME.idl.</p>

<p>--header Generate a C header file for the specified
interface. Filename defaults to OUTNAME.h.</p>

<p>--ndr-parser Generate a C file and C header containing
NDR parsers. The filename for the parser defaults to
ndr_OUTNAME.c. The header filename will be the parser
filename with the extension changed from .c to .h.</p>

<p>--tdr-parser Generate a C file and C header containing
TDR parsers. The filename for the parser defaults to
tdr_OUTNAME.c. The header filename will be the parser
filename with the extension changed from .c to .h.</p>

<p>--typelib Write type information to the specified
file.</p>

<p>--server Generate boilerplate for the RPC server that
implements the interface. Filename defaults to
ndr_OUTNAME_s.c.</p>

<p>--template Generate stubs for a RPC server that
implements the interface. Output will be written to
stdout.</p>

<p>--ws-parser Generate an Wireshark dissector (in C) and
header file. The dissector filename defaults to
packet-dcerpc-OUTNAME.c while the header filename defaults
to packet-dcerpc-OUTNAME.h.</p>

<p>Pidl will read additional data from an Wireshark
conformance file if present. Such a file should have the
same location as the IDL file but with the extension cnf
rather than idl. See Parse::Pidl::Wireshark::Conformance for
details on the format of this file.</p>

<p>--diff Parse an IDL file, generate a new IDL file based
on the internal data structures and see if there are any
differences with the original IDL file. Useful for debugging
pidl.</p>

<p>--dump-idl-tree Tell pidl to dump the internal tree
representation of an IDL file the to disk. Useful for
debugging pidl.</p>

<p>--dump-ndr-tree Tell pidl to dump the internal NDR
information tree it generated from the IDL file to disk.
Useful for debugging pidl.</p>

<p>--samba3-ndr-client Generate client calls for Samba3, to
be placed in rpc_client/. Instead of calling out to the code
in Samba3 s rpc_parse/, this will call out to Samba4s NDR
code instead.</p>

<p>--samba3-ndr-server Generate server calls for Samba3, to
be placed in rpc_server/. Instead of calling out to the code
in Samba3 s rpc_parse/, this will call out to Samba4s NDR
code instead.</p>

<p>IDL SYNTAX IDL files are always preprocessed using the C
preprocessor.</p>

<p>Pretty much everything in an interface (the interface
itself, functions, parameters) can have attributes (or
properties whatever name you give them). Attributes always
prepend the element they apply to and are surrounded by
square brackets ([]). Multiple attributes are separated by
commas; arguments to attributes are specified between
parentheses.</p>

<p>See the section COMPATIBILITY for the list of attributes
that pidl supports.</p>

<p>C-style comments can be used.</p>

<p>CONFORMANT ARRAYS A conformant array is one with that
ends in [*] or []. The strange things about conformant
arrays are that they can only appear as the last element of
a structure (unless there is a pointer to the conformant
array, of course) and the array size appears before the
structure itself on the wire.</p>

<p>So, in this example:</p>

<p>typedef struct { long abc; long count; long foo;
[size_is(count)] long s[*]; } Struct1;</p>

<p>it appears like this:</p>

<p>[size_is] [abc] [count] [foo] [s...]</p>

<p>the first [size_is] field is the allocation size of the
array, and occurs before the array elements and even before
the structure alignment.</p>

<p>Note that size_is() can refer to a constant, but that
doesnt change the wire representation. It does not make the
array a fixed array.</p>

<p>midl.exe would write the above array as the following C
header:</p>

<p>typedef struct { long abc; long count; long foo; long
s[1]; } Struct1;</p>

<p>pidl takes a different approach, and writes it like
this:</p>

<p>typedef struct { long abc; long count; long foo; long
*s; } Struct1;</p>

<p>VARYING ARRAYS A varying array looks like this:</p>

<p>typedef struct { long abc; long count; long foo;
[size_is(count)] long *s; } Struct1;</p>

<p>This will look like this on the wire:</p>

<p>[abc] [count] [foo] [PTR_s] [count] [s...]</p>

<p>FIXED ARRAYS A fixed array looks like this:</p>

<p>typedef struct { long s[10]; } Struct1;</p>

<p>The NDR representation looks just like 10 separate long
declarations. The array size is not encoded on the wire.</p>

<p>pidl also supports &quot;inline&quot; arrays, which are
not part of the IDL/NDR standard. These are declared like
this:</p>

<p>typedef struct { uint32 foo; uint32 count; uint32 bar;
long s[count]; } Struct1;</p>

<p>This appears like this:</p>

<p>[foo] [count] [bar] [s...]</p>

<p>Fixed arrays are an extension added to support some of
the strange embedded structures in security descriptors and
spoolss.</p>

<p>This section is by no means complete. See the OpenGroup
and MSDN documentation for additional information.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY WITH MIDL Missing features in pidl The
following MIDL features are not (yet) implemented in pidl or
are implemented with an incompatible interface:</p>

<p>&middot; Asynchronous communication</p>

<p>&middot; Typelibs (.tlb files)</p>

<p>&middot; Datagram support (ncadg_*)</p>

<p>Supported attributes and statements in, out, ref,
length_is, switch_is, size_is, uuid, case, default, string,
unique, ptr, pointer_default, v1_enum, object, helpstring,
range, local, call_as, endpoint, switch_type, progid,
coclass, iid_is, represent_as, transmit_as, import, include,
cpp_quote.</p>

<p>PIDL Specific properties public The [public] property on
a structure or union is a pidl extension that forces the
generated pull/push functions to be non-static. This allows
you to declare types that can be used between modules. If
you dont specify [public] then pull/push functions for other
than top-level functions are declared static.</p>

<p>noprint The [noprint] property is a pidl extension that
allows you to specify that pidl should not generate a
ndr_print_*() function for that structure or union. This is
used when you wish to define your own print function that
prints a structure in a nicer manner. A good example is the
use of [noprint] on dom_sid, which allows the
pretty-printing of SIDs.</p>

<p>value The [value(expression)] property is a pidl
extension that allows you to specify the value of a field
when it is put on the wire. This allows fields that always
have a well-known value to be automatically filled in, thus
making the API more programmer friendly. The expression can
be any C expression.</p>

<p>relative The [relative] property can be supplied on a
pointer. When it is used it declares the pointer as a
spoolss style &quot;relative&quot; pointer, which means it
appears on the wire as an offset within the current
encapsulating structure. This is not part of normal IDL/NDR,
but it is a very useful extension as it avoids the manual
encoding of many complex structures.</p>

<p>subcontext(length) Specifies that a size of length bytes
should be read, followed by a blob of that size, which will
be parsed as NDR.</p>

<p>subcontext() is deprecated now, and should not be used
in new code. Instead, use represent_as() or
transmit_as().</p>

<p>flag Specify boolean options, mostly used for low-level
NDR options. Several options can be specified using the |
character. Note that flags are inherited by
substructures!</p>

<p>nodiscriminant The [nodiscriminant] property on a union
means that the usual uint16 discriminent field at the start
of the union on the wire is omitted. This is not normally
allowed in IDL/NDR, but is used for some spoolss
structures.</p>

<p>charset(name) Specify that the array or string uses the
specified charset. If this attribute is specified, pidl will
take care of converting the character data from this format
to the host format. Commonly used values are UCS2, DOS and
UTF8.</p>
