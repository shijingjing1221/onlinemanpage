<p>NAME ipsec_look - get a quick summary of Libreswan
status</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipsec look</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Look is used to get a quick overview of what
the status of Libreswan is. It is the equivalent to running
the commands ipsec eroute, ipsec spigrp, ipsec tncfg, ipsec
spi and netstat -rn. However a bit of processing is done to
combine the outputs.</p>

<p>Some of the above commands, and there for ipsec look,
are only supported with the KLIPS or MAST stack, and will
give errors when used on BSD, Windows or Linux with
NETKEY.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ipsec(8), ipsec_tncfg(8), ipsec_spi(8),
ipsec_spigrp(8), ipsec_eroute(5), netstat(8).</p>
