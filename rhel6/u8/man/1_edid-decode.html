<p>NAME edid-decode - Decode EDID data in human-readable
format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS edid-decode [in] [out]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION edid-decode decodes EDID monitor description
data in human-readable format. It takes zero, one, or two
arguments. If invoked with no arguments it reads from
standard input and writes to standard output. With one
argument, the file named by the argument is read instead.
With two arguments, normal output is suppressed, and the
binary EDID blob is written to the file named by the second
argument.</p>

<p>Input files may be raw binaries or ASCII text. ASCII
input is scanned for hex dumps; heuristics are included to
search for hexdumps in xrandr(1) property output and Xorg(1)
log file formats, otherwise the data is treated as a raw
hexdump. EDID blocks for connected monitors can be found in
/sys/class/drm/*/edid on modern Linux systems with ker- nel
modesetting support.</p>

<p>NOTES Not all fields are decoded, or decoded completely.
Some fields decod- ing may appear to corrupt the output (for
example, detailed string sec- tions have their contents
printed literally). edid-decode does attempt to validate its
input against the relevant standards, but its opinions have
not been double-checked with the relevant standards bodies,
so they may be wrong. Do not rely on the output format, as
it will likely change in future versions of the tool as
additional fields and exten- sions are added.</p>
