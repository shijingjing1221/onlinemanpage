<p>CTIME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CTIME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ctime, ctime_r - convert a time value to a date and
time string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *ctime(const time_t *clock);</p>

<p>char *ctime_r(const time_t *clock, char *buf);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For ctime(): The functionality described on
this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any
conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO
C standard is unintentional. This volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 defers to the ISO C standard.</p>

<p>The ctime() function shall convert the time pointed to
by clock, repre- senting time in seconds since the Epoch, to
local time in the form of a string. It shall be equivalent
to:</p>

<p>asctime(localtime(clock))</p>

<p>The asctime(), ctime(), gmtime(), and localtime()
functions shall return values in one of two static objects:
a broken-down time struc- ture and an array of char.
Execution of any of the functions may over- write the
information returned in either of these objects by any of
the other functions.</p>

<p>The ctime() function need not be reentrant. A function
that is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>The ctime_r() function shall convert the calendar time
pointed to by clock to local time in exactly the same form
as ctime() and put the string into the array pointed to by
buf (which shall be at least 26 bytes in size) and return
buf.</p>

<p>Unlike ctime(), the thread-safe version ctime_r() is not
required to set tzname.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The ctime() function shall return the
pointer returned by asctime() with that broken-down time as
an argument.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, ctime_r() shall return a
pointer to the string pointed to by buf. When an error is
encountered, a null pointer shall be returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Values for the broken-down time
structure can be obtained by calling gmtime() or
localtime(). The ctime() function is included for compati-
bility with older implementations, and does not support
localized date and time formats. Applications should use the
strftime() function to achieve maximum portability.</p>

<p>The ctime_r() function is thread-safe and shall return
values in a user-supplied buffer instead of possibly using a
static data area that may be overwritten by each call.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

localtime(), mktime(), strf- time(), strptime(), time(),

1003.1-2001, &lt;time.h&gt;</p>
