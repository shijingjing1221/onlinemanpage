<p>LONGJMP(3) Linux Programmer s Manual LONGJMP(3)</p>

<p>NAME longjmp, siglongjmp - non-local jump to a saved
stack context</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;</p>

<p>void longjmp(jmp_buf env, int val);</p>

<p>void siglongjmp(sigjmp_buf env, int val);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>siglongjmp(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE
|| _POSIX_C_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION longjmp() and setjmp(3) are useful for
dealing with errors and inter- rupts encountered in a
low-level subroutine of a program. longjmp() restores the
environment saved by the last call of setjmp(3) with the
corresponding env argument. After longjmp() is completed,
program exe- cution continues as if the corresponding call
of setjmp(3) had just returned the value val. longjmp()
cannot cause 0 to be returned. If longjmp() is invoked with
a second argument of 0, 1 will be returned instead.</p>

<p>siglongjmp() is similar to longjmp() except for the type
of its env argument. If, and only if, the sigsetjmp(3) call
that set this env used a non-zero savesigs flag,
siglongjmp() also restores the signal mask that was saved by
sigsetjmp(3).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE These functions never return.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C89, C99, and POSIX.1-2001 specify
longjmp(). POSIX.1-2001 specifies siglongjmp().</p>

<p>NOTES POSIX does not specify whether longjmp() will
restore the signal con- text (see setjmp(3) for some more
details). If you want to portably save and restore signal
masks, use sigsetjmp() and siglongjmp().</p>

<p>The values of automatic variables are unspecified after
a call to longjmp() if they meet all the following
criteria:</p>

<p>&middot; they are local to the function that made the
corresponding setjmp(3) call;</p>

<p>&middot; their values are changed between the calls to
setjmp(3) and longjmp(); and</p>

<p>&middot; they are not declared as volatile.</p>

<p>Analogous remarks apply for siglongjmp().</p>

<p>longjmp() and siglongjmp() make programs hard to
understand and main- tain. If possible an alternative should
be used.</p>
