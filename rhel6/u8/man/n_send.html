<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME send - Execute a command in a different
application</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS send ?options? app cmd ?arg arg ...?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command arranges for cmd (and args) to
be executed in the applica- tion named by app. It returns
the result or error from that command execution. App may be
the name of any application whose main window is on the
display containing the senders main window; it need not be
within the same process. If no arg arguments are present,
then the command to be executed is contained entirely within
the cmd argument. If one or more args are present, they are
concatenated to form the com- mand to be executed, just as
for the eval command.</p>

<p>If the initial arguments of the command begin with -
they are treated as options. The following options are
currently defined:</p>

<p>-async Requests asynchronous invocation. In this case
the send command will complete immediately without waiting
for cmd to complete in the target application; no result
will be available and errors in the sent command will be
ignored. If the target application is in the same process as
the sending application then the -async option is
ignored.</p>

<p>-displayof pathName Specifies that the target
applications main window is on the display of the window
given by pathName, instead of the display containing the
applications main window.</p>

<p>-- Serves no purpose except to terminate the list of
options. This option is needed only if app could contain a
leading - charac- ter.</p>

<p>APPLICATION NAMES The name of an application is set
initially from the name of the pro- gram or script that
created the application. You can query and change the name
of an application with the tk appname command.</p>

<p>DISABLING SENDS If the send command is removed from an
application (e.g. with the com- mand rename send {}) then
the application will not respond to incoming send requests
anymore, nor will it be able to issue outgoing requests.
Communication can be reenabled by invoking the tk appname
command.</p>

<p>SECURITY The send command is potentially a serious
security loophole. On Unix, any application that can connect
to your X server can send scripts to your applications.
These incoming scripts can use Tcl to read and write your
files and invoke subprocesses under your name. Host-based
access control such as that provided by xhost is
particularly insecure, since it allows anyone with an
account on particular hosts to connect to your server, and
if disabled it allows anyone anywhere to connect to your
server. In order to provide at least a small amount of
security, Tk checks the access control being used by the
server and rejects incoming sends unless (a) xhost-style
access control is enabled (i.e. only certain hosts can
establish connections) and (b) the list of enabled hosts is
empty. This means that applications cannot connect to your
server unless they use some other form of authorization such
as that provide by xauth. Under Windows, send is currently
disabled. Most of the functionality is provided by the dde
command instead.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE This script fragment can be used to make an
application that only runs once on a particular display. if
{[tk appname FoobarApp] ne &quot;FoobarApp&quot;} { send
-async FoobarApp RemoteStart $argv exit } # The command that
will be called remotely, which raises # the application main
window and opens the requested files proc RemoteStart args {
raise . foreach filename $args { OpenFile $filename } }</p>
