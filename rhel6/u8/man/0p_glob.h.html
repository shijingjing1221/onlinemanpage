<p>NAME glob.h - pathname pattern-matching types</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;glob.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &lt;glob.h&gt; header shall define the
structures and symbolic constants used by the glob()
function.</p>

<p>The structure type glob_t shall contain at least the
following members:</p>

<p>size_t gl_pathc Count of paths matched by pattern. char
**gl_pathv Pointer to a list of matched pathnames. size_t
gl_offs Slots to reserve at the beginning of gl_pathv.</p>

<p>The following constants shall be provided as values for
the flags argu- ment:</p>

<p>GLOB_APPEND Append generated pathnames to those
previously obtained.</p>

<p>GLOB_DOOFFS Specify how many null pointers to add to the
beginning of gl_pathv.</p>

<p>GLOB_ERR Cause glob() to return on error.</p>

<p>GLOB_MARK Each pathname that is a directory that matches
pattern has a slash appended.</p>

<p>GLOB_NOCHECK If pattern does not match any pathname,
then return a list con- sisting of only pattern.</p>

<p>GLOB_NOESCAPE Disable backslash escaping.</p>

<p>GLOB_NOSORT Do not sort the pathnames returned.</p>

<p>The following constants shall be defined as error return
values:</p>

<p>GLOB_ABORTED The scan was stopped because GLOB_ERR was
set or (*errfunc)() returned non-zero.</p>

<p>GLOB_NOMATCH The pattern does not match any existing
pathname, and GLOB_NOCHECK was not set in flags.</p>

<p>GLOB_NOSPACE An attempt to allocate memory failed.</p>

<p>GLOB_NOSYS Reserved.</p>

<p>The following shall be declared as functions and may
also be defined as macros. Function prototypes shall be
provided.</p>

<p>int glob(const char *restrict, int, int (*)(const char
*, int), glob_t *restrict); void globfree (glob_t *);</p>

<p>The implementation may define additional macros or
constants using names beginning with GLOB_.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
