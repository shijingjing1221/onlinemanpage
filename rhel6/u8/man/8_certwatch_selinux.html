<p>certwatch_selinux(8) SELinux Policy certwatch
certwatch_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME certwatch_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the certwatch processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
certwatch processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The certwatch processes execute with the certwatch_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps com- mand with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep certwatch_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The certwatch_t SELinux type can be entered
via the certwatch_exec_t file type.</p>

<p>The default entrypoint paths for the certwatch_t domain
are the follow- ing:</p>

<p>/usr/bin/certwatch</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux certwatch policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their cert- watch processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
certwatch:</p>

<p>certwatch_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a certwatch_t can be used to
make the pro- cess type certwatch_t permissive. SELinux does
not deny access to per- missive process types, but the AVC
(SELinux denials) messages are still generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. cert- watch policy is extremely flexible
and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the
policy and run certwatch with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to use other domains
file descriptors, you must turn on the allow_domain_fd_use
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_domain_fd_use 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all
processes, you must turn on the allow_ptrace boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ptrace 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load
modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to execute in
fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fips_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable reading of urandom for all
domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P global_ssp 1</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type certwatch_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>auth_cache_t</p>

<p>/var/cache/coolkey(/.*)?</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/rhev /misc</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /tmp-inst /var/tmp-inst
/var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux certwatch policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their certwatch processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for certwatch:</p>

<p>certwatch_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the certwatch_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the certwatch_t domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
