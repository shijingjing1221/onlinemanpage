<p>NAME xrdb - X server resource database utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xrdb [-option ...] [filename]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xrdb is used to get or set the contents of
the RESOURCE_MANAGER prop- erty on the root window of screen
0, or the SCREEN_RESOURCES property on the root window of
any or all screens, or everything combined. You would
normally run this program from your X startup file.</p>

<p>Most X clients use the RESOURCE_MANAGER and
SCREEN_RESOURCES properties to get user preferences about
color, fonts, and so on for applications. Having this
information in the server (where it is available to all
clients) instead of on disk, solves the problem in previous
versions of X that required you to maintain defaults files
on every machine that you might use. It also allows for
dynamic changing of defaults without editing files.</p>

<p>The RESOURCE_MANAGER property is used for resources that
apply to all screens of the display. The SCREEN_RESOURCES
property on each screen specifies additional (or overriding)
resources to be used for that screen. (When there is only
one screen, SCREEN_RESOURCES is normally not used, all
resources are just placed in the RESOURCE_MANAGER prop-
erty.)</p>

<p>The file specified by filename (or the contents from
standard input if - or no filename is given) is optionally
passed through the C prepro- cessor with the following
symbols defined, based on the capabilities of the server
being used:</p>

<p>SERVERHOST=hostname the hostname portion of the display
to which you are connected.</p>

<p>SRVR_name the SERVERHOST hostname string turned into a
legal identifier. For example,
&quot;my-dpy.lcs.mit.edu&quot; becomes
SRVR_my_dpy_lcs_mit_edu.</p>

<p>HOST=hostname the same as SERVERHOST.</p>

<p>DISPLAY_NUM=num the number of the display on the server
host.</p>

<p>CLIENTHOST=hostname the name of the host on which xrdb
is running.</p>

<p>CLNT_name the CLIENTHOST hostname string turned into a
legal identifier. For example, &quot;expo.lcs.mit.edu&quot;
becomes CLNT_expo_lcs_mit_edu.</p>

<p>RELEASE=num the vendor release number for the server.
The interpretation of this number will vary depending on
VENDOR.</p>

<p>REVISION=num the X protocol minor version supported by
this server (cur- rently 0).</p>

<p>VERSION=num the X protocol major version supported by
this server (should always be 11).</p>

<p>VENDOR=&quot;vendor&quot; a string literal specifying
the vendor of the server.</p>

<p>VNDR_name the VENDOR name string turned into a legal
identifier. For example, &quot;MIT X Consortium&quot;
becomes VNDR_MIT_X_Consortium.</p>

<p>EXT_name A symbol is defined for each protocol extension
supported by the server. Each extension string name is
turned into a legal identifier. For example,
&quot;X3D-PEX&quot; becomes EXT_X3D_PEX.</p>

<p>NUM_SCREENS=num the total number of screens.</p>

<p>SCREEN_NUM=num the number of the current screen (from
zero).</p>

<p>BITS_PER_RGB=num the number of significant bits in an
RGB color specification. This is the log base 2 of the
number of distinct shades of each primary that the hardware
can generate. Note that it usually is not related to
PLANES.</p>

<p>CLASS=visualclass one of StaticGray, GrayScale,
StaticColor, PseudoColor, True- Color, DirectColor. This is
the visual class of the root win- dow.</p>

<p>CLASS_visualclass=visualid the visual class of the root
window in a form you can #ifdef on. The value is the numeric
id of the visual.</p>

<p>COLOR defined only if CLASS is one of StaticColor,
PseudoColor, True- Color, or DirectColor.</p>

<p>CLASS_visualclass_depth=num A symbol is defined for each
visual supported for the screen. The symbol includes the
class of the visual and its depth; the value is the numeric
id of the visual. (If more than one visual has the same
class and depth, the numeric id of the first one reported by
the server is used.)</p>

<p>HEIGHT=num the height of the root window in pixels.</p>

<p>WIDTH=num the width of the root window in pixels.</p>

<p>PLANES=num the number of bit planes (the depth) of the
root window.</p>

<p>X_RESOLUTION=num the x resolution of the screen in
pixels per meter.</p>

<p>Y_RESOLUTION=num the y resolution of the screen in
pixels per meter.</p>

<p>SRVR_name, CLNT_name, VNDR_name, and EXT_name
identifiers are formed by changing all characters other than
letters and digits into underscores (_).</p>

<p>Lines that begin with an exclamation mark (!) are
ignored and may be used as comments.</p>

<p>Note that since xrdb can read from standard input, it
can be used to the change the contents of properties
directly from a terminal or from a shell script.</p>

<p>OPTIONS xrdb program accepts the following options:</p>

<p>-help This option (or any unsupported option) will cause
a brief description of the allowable options and parameters
to be printed.</p>

<p>-version This option will cause the xrdb version to be
printed and the program to exit without performing any other
operations.</p>

<p>-display display This option specifies the X server to
be used; see X(7). It also specifies the screen to use for
the -screen option, and it specifies the screen from which
preprocessor symbols are derived for the -global option.</p>

<p>-all This option indicates that operation should be
performed on the screen-independent resource property
(RESOURCE_MANAGER), as well as the screen-specific property
(SCREEN_RESOURCES) on every screen of the display. For
example, when used in con- junction with -query, the
contents of all properties are out- put. For -load,
-override and -merge, the input file is pro- cessed once for
each screen. The resources which occur in com- mon in the
output for every screen are collected, and these are applied
as the screen-independent resources. The remaining resources
are applied for each individual per-screen property. This
the default mode of operation.</p>

<p>-global This option indicates that the operation should
only be per- formed on the screen-independent
RESOURCE_MANAGER property.</p>

<p>-screen This option indicates that the operation should
only be per- formed on the SCREEN_RESOURCES property of the
default screen of the display.</p>

<p>-screens This option indicates that the operation should
be performed on the SCREEN_RESOURCES property of each screen
of the display. For -load, -override and -merge, the input
file is processed for each screen.</p>

<p>-n This option indicates that changes to the specified
properties (when used with -load, -override or -merge) or to
the resource file (when used with -edit) should be shown on
the standard output, but should not be performed.</p>

<p>-quiet This option indicates that warning about
duplicate entries should not be displayed.</p>

<p>-cpp filename This option specifies the pathname of the
C preprocessor pro- gram to be used. Although xrdb was
designed to use CPP, any program that acts as a filter and
accepts the -D, -I, and -U options may be used.</p>

<p>-nocpp This option indicates that xrdb should not run
the input file through a preprocessor before loading it into
properties.</p>

<p>-undef This option is passed to the C preprocessor if
used. It pre- vents it from predefining any system specific
macros.</p>

<p>-symbols This option indicates that the symbols that are
defined for the preprocessor should be printed onto the
standard output.</p>

<p>-query This option indicates that the current contents
of the speci- fied properties should be printed onto the
standard output. Note that since preprocessor commands in
the input resource file are part of the input file, not part
of the property, they wont appear in the output from this
option. The -edit option can be used to merge the contents
of properties back into the input resource file without
damaging preprocessor commands.</p>

<p>-load This option indicates that the input should be
loaded as the new value of the specified properties,
replacing whatever was there (i.e. the old contents are
removed). This is the default action.</p>

<p>-override This option indicates that the input should be
added to, instead of replacing, the current contents of the
specified properties. New entries override previous
entries.</p>

<p>-merge This option indicates that the input should be
merged and lexi- cographically sorted with, instead of
replacing, the current contents of the specified
properties.</p>

<p>-remove This option indicates that the specified
properties should be removed from the server.</p>

<p>-retain This option indicates that the server should be
instructed not to reset if xrdb is the first client. This
should never be necessary under normal conditions, since xdm
and xinit always act as the first client.</p>

<p>-edit filename This option indicates that the contents
of the specified prop- erties should be edited into the
given file, replacing any val- ues already listed there.
This allows you to put changes that you have made to your
defaults back into your resource file, preserving any
comments or preprocessor lines.</p>

<p>-backup string This option specifies a suffix to be
appended to the filename used with -edit to generate a
backup file.</p>

<p>-Dname[=value] This option is passed through to the
preprocessor and is used to define symbols for use with
conditionals such as #ifdef.</p>

<p>-Uname This option is passed through to the preprocessor
and is used to remove any definitions of this symbol.</p>

<p>-Idirectory This option is passed through to the
preprocessor and is used to specify a directory to search
for files that are referenced with #include.</p>

<p>FILES Xrdb does not load any files on its own, but many
desktop environments use xrdb to load ~/.Xresources files on
session startup to initialize the resource database, as a
generalized replacement for ~/.Xdefaults files.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO X(7), appres(1), listres(1), Xlib Resource
Manager documentation, Xt resource documentation</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY to figure out which display to
use.</p>

<p>BUGS The default for no arguments should be to query,
not to overwrite, so that it is consistent with other
programs.</p>
