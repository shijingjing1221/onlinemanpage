<p>MASTER(8) MASTER(8)</p>

<p>NAME master - Postfix master process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS master [-Ddtv] [-c config_dir] [-e
exit_time]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The master(8) daemon is the resident process
that runs Postfix daemons on demand: daemons to send or
receive messages via the network, daemons to deliver mail
locally, etc. These daemons are created on demand up to a
configurable maximum number per service.</p>

<p>Postfix daemons terminate voluntarily, either after
being idle for a configurable amount of time, or after
having serviced a configurable number of requests.
Exceptions to this rule are the resident queue man- ager,
address verification server, and the TLS session cache and
pseudo-random number server.</p>

<p>The behavior of the master(8) daemon is controlled by
the master.cf configuration file, as described in
master(5).</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>-c config_dir Read the main.cf and master.cf
configuration files in the named directory instead of the
default configuration directory. This also overrides the
configuration files for other Postfix daemon processes.</p>

<p>-D After initialization, run a debugger on the master
process. The debugging command is specified with the
debugger_command in the main.cf global configuration
file.</p>

<p>-d Do not redirect stdin, stdout or stderr to /dev/null,
and do not discard the controlling terminal. This must be
used for debug- ging only.</p>

<p>-e exit_time Terminate the master process after
exit_time seconds. Child pro- cesses terminate at their
convenience.</p>

<p>-t Test mode. Return a zero exit status when the
master.pid lock file does not exist or when that file is not
locked. This is evidence that the master(8) daemon is not
running.</p>

<p>-v Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. This
option is passed on to child processes. Multiple -v options
make the soft- ware increasingly verbose.</p>

<p>Signals:</p>

<p>SIGHUP Upon receipt of a HUP signal (e.g., after
&quot;postfix reload&quot;), the master process re-reads its
configuration files. If a service has been removed from the
master.cf file, its running processes are terminated
immediately. Otherwise, running processes are allowed to
terminate as soon as is convenient, so that changes in
configuration settings affect only new service requests.</p>

<p>SIGTERM Upon receipt of a TERM signal (e.g., after
&quot;postfix abort&quot;), the master process passes the
signal on to its child processes and terminates. This is
useful for an emergency shutdown. Normally one would
terminate only the master (&quot;postfix stop&quot;) and
allow running processes to finish what they are doing.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems are reported to syslogd(8).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT MAIL_DEBUG After initialization, start a
debugger as specified with the debugger_command
configuration parameter in the main.cf configu- ration
file.</p>

<p>MAIL_CONFIG Directory with Postfix configuration
files.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS Unlike most Postfix daemon
processes, the master(8) server does not automatically pick
up changes to main.cf. Changes to master.cf are never picked
up automatically. Use the &quot;postfix reload&quot; command
after a configuration change.</p>

<p>RESOURCE AND RATE CONTROLS default_process_limit (100)
The default maximal number of Postfix child processes that
pro- vide a given service.</p>

<p>max_idle (100s) The maximum amount of time that an idle
Postfix daemon process waits for an incoming connection
before terminating voluntarily.</p>

<p>max_use (100) The maximal number of incoming connections
that a Postfix daemon process will service before
terminating voluntarily.</p>

<p>service_throttle_time (60s) How long the Postfix
master(8) waits before forking a server that appears to be
malfunctioning.</p>

<p>Available in Postfix version 2.6 and later:</p>

<p>master_service_disable (empty) Selectively disable
master(8) listener ports by service type or by service name
and type.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS CONTROLS config_directory (seepostconf
-doutput) The default location of the Postfix main.cf and
master.cf con- figuration files.</p>

<p>daemon_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The directory
with Postfix support programs and daemon programs.</p>

<p>debugger_command (empty) The external command to execute
when a Postfix daemon program is invoked with the -D
option.</p>

<p>inet_interfaces (all) The network interface addresses
that this mail system receives mail on.</p>

<p>inet_protocols (ipv4) The Internet protocols Postfix
will attempt to use when making or accepting
connections.</p>

<p>import_environment (seepostconf -doutput) The list of
environment parameters that a Postfix process will import
from a non-Postfix parent process.</p>

<p>mail_owner (postfix) The UNIX system account that owns
the Postfix queue and most Postfix daemon processes.</p>

<p>process_id (read-only) The process ID of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>process_name (read-only) The process name of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>queue_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The location of
the Postfix top-level queue directory.</p>

<p>syslog_facility (mail) The syslog facility of Postfix
logging.</p>

<p>syslog_name (seepostconf -doutput) The mail system name
that is prepended to the process name in syslog records, so
that &quot;smtpd&quot; becomes, for example, &quot;post-
fix/smtpd&quot;.</p>

<p>FILES To expand the directory names below into their
actual values, use the command &quot;postconf
config_directory&quot; etc.</p>

$config_directory/master.cf, master server configuration
file. $queue_directory/pid/master.pid, master lock file.
$data_directory/master.lock, master lock file.</p>
