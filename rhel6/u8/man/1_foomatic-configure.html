<p>DESCRIPTION foomatic-configure is a program to set up
and configure print queues for every known spooler (CUPS,
LPRng, LPD, GNUlpr, PPR, PDQ. CPS, no spooler) and every
valid printer/driver combo in the Foomatic database or every
PPD file coming with PostScript printers. As RIP filter
(Raster Image Processor, translation from PostScript to the
native lan- guage of the printer) always foomatic-rip(1)
will be used, except for PPD files of PostScript printers
under CUPS or PPR, they will be used without RIP filter.</p>

<p>It also comprises half of a programatic API for user
tools: you can learn and control everything about the static
properties of print queues here. With the sister program
foomatic-printjob(1), you can do everything related to the
print queues dynamic state: submit jobs, and query, cancel,
reorder, and redirect them.</p>

<p>Options -n queuename Configure this print queue</p>

<p>-N Name/Description Use this proper human-readable
name/description</p>

<p>-L Location Short phrase describing this printers
location</p>

<p>-c connection Printer is connected thusly (ex
file:/dev/lp0)</p>

<p>-d driver Foomatic database name for desired printer
driver</p>

<p>-p printer Foomatic id for printer</p>

<p>--ppd ppdfile PPD file, for example the one supplied by
the manufacturer of a PostScript printer</p>

<p>-s spooler Explicit spooler type (cups, lpd, lprng, pdq,
ppr, direct)</p>

<p>-o option=value Set the default of option to value</p>

<p>-o option Turn on option by default</p>

<p>-D Set this queue as the default queue (just give -n
queuename)</p>

<p>-R Remove this whole queue entirely (just give -n
queuename)</p>

<p>-C [ sourcespooler ] sourcequeue Copy sourcequeue from
sourcespooler (or the current one if sourcespooler is not
given) into the queue given by -n queue- name (of the
current spooler).</p>

<p>-Q Query existing configuration (gives XML summary)</p>

<p>-r List also remotely defined queues (CUPS only)</p>

<p>-P [ index ] Get Perl dump of current configuration (as
a Perl array named QUEUES, the first index is index, or zero
if index is not given)</p>

<p>-O Print XML Overview of all known printer/drivers (this
shows also the Foomatic IDs of the printers)</p>

<p>-X Print XML data for -p printer and/or -d driver
object</p>

<p>-q Run quietly</p>

<p>Commands No commands, just options</p>

<p>SEE ALSO foomatic-printjob(1), foomatic-rip(1)</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS foomatic-configure returns 0 if no errors
occurred.</p>

<p>BUGS foomatic-configure currently cannot handle printcap
files in the lprng style. As lprng can use BSD style
printcaps this is not much of a problem, as long as the GUI
based print manager lprngtool is not used. The difference
between those formats is, that BSD style requires con-
tinuation lines in printer definitions to be ended with a
colon and the newline character to be escaped with a
backslash. Lprng has no such restriction.</p>

<p>To use a printcap file generated or edited with
lprngtool with foomatic-configure it is necessary to add :to
the end of all but the last line of every printer
definition, just as shown below:</p>

<p>#comment # primary printer name lp #alternate names
|lp2|lp3 |Example of a printer :sd=/usr/spool/LPD/lp
:rw:lp=/dev/lp:mx#100 :</p>

<p>must be converted to:</p>

<p>#comment # primary printer name lp |lp2|lp3 |Example of
a printer :sd=/usr/spool/LPD/lp: :rw:lp=/dev/lp:mx#100:</p>
