<p>NAME luac - Lua compiler</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS luac [ options ] [ filenames ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION luac is the Lua compiler. It translates
programs written in the Lua programming language into binary
files that can be later loaded and executed.</p>

<p>The main advantages of precompiling chunks are: faster
loading, pro- tecting source code from accidental user
changes, and off-line syntax checking.</p>

<p>Pre-compiling does not imply faster execution because in
Lua chunks are always compiled into bytecodes before being
executed. luac simply allows those bytecodes to be saved in
a file for later execution.</p>

<p>Pre-compiled chunks are not necessarily smaller than the
corresponding source. The main goal in pre-compiling is
faster loading.</p>

<p>The binary files created by luac are portable only among
architectures with the same word size and byte order.</p>

<p>luac produces a single output file containing the
bytecodes for all source files given. By default, the output
file is named luac.out, but you can change this with the -o
option.</p>

<p>In the command line, you can mix text files containing
Lua source and binary files containing precompiled chunks.
This is useful to combine several precompiled chunks, even
from different (but compatible) plat- forms, into a single
precompiled chunk.</p>

<p>You can use-to indicate the standard input as a source
file and -- to signal the end of options (that is, all
remaining arguments will be treated as files even if they
start with).</p>

<p>The internal format of the binary files produced by luac
is likely to change when a new version of Lua is released.
So, save the source files of all Lua programs that you
precompile.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Options must be separate.</p>

<p>-l produce a listing of the compiled bytecode for Luas
virtual machine. Listing bytecodes is useful to learn about
Luas vir- tual machine. If no files are given, then luac
loads luac.out and lists its contents.</p>

<p>-o file output to file, instead of the default luac.out.
(You can use -for standard output, but not on platforms that
open standard output in text mode.) The output file may be a
source file because all files are loaded before the output
file is written. Be careful not to overwrite precious
files.</p>

<p>-p load files but do not generate any output file. Used
mainly for syntax checking and for testing precompiled
chunks: corrupted files will probably generate errors when
loaded. Lua always performs a thorough integrity test on
precompiled chunks. Bytecode that passes this test is
completely safe, in the sense that it will not break the
interpreter. However, there is no guarantee that such code
does anything sensible. (None can be given, because the
halting problem is unsolvable.) If no files are given, then
luac loads luac.out and tests its contents. No messages are
displayed if the file passes the integrity test.</p>

<p>-s strip debug information before writing the output
file. This saves some space in very large chunks, but if
errors occur when running a stripped chunk, then the error
messages may not con- tain the full information they usually
do. For instance, line numbers and names of local variables
are lost.</p>

<p>-v show version information.</p>

<p>FILES luac.out default output file</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Error messages should be self
explanatory.</p>
