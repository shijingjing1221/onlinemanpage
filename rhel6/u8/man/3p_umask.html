<p>UMASK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UMASK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME umask - set and get the file mode creation mask</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>mode_t umask(mode_t cmask);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The umask() function shall set the process
file mode creation mask to cmask and return the previous
value of the mask. Only the file permis- sion bits of cmask
(see &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;) are used; the meaning of the other
bits is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The process file mode creation mask is used during
open(), creat(), mkdir(), and mkfifo() to turn off
permission bits in the mode argument supplied. Bit positions
that are set in cmask are cleared in the mode of the created
file.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The file permission bits in the value
returned by umask() shall be the previous value of the file
mode creation mask. The state of any other bits in that
value is unspecified, except that a subsequent call to
umask() with the returned value as cmask shall leave the
state of the mask the same as its state before the first
call, including any unspec- ified use of those bits.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Unsigned argument and return types for umask()
were proposed. The return type and the argument were both
changed to mode_t.</p>

<p>Historical implementations have made use of additional
bits in cmask for their implementation-defined purposes. The
addition of the text that the meaning of other bits of the
field is implementation-defined permits these
implementations to conform to this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
