<p>NAME setroubleshoot_fixit_selinux - Security Enhanced
Linux Policy for the setroubleshoot_fixit processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
setroubleshoot_fixit processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The setroubleshoot_fixit processes execute with the
setrou- bleshoot_fixit_t SELinux type. You can check if you
have these pro- cesses running by executing the ps command
with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep setroubleshoot_fixit_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The setroubleshoot_fixit_t SELinux type can
be entered via the setrou- bleshoot_fixit_exec_t file
type.</p>

<p>The default entrypoint paths for the
setroubleshoot_fixit_t domain are the following:</p>

<p>/usr/share/setroubleshoot/SetroubleshootFixit.py*</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux setroubleshoot_fixit policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their setroubleshoot_fixit processes
in as secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
setroubleshoot_fixit:</p>

<p>setroubleshoot_fixit_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a setroubleshoot_fixit_t can
be used to make the process type setroubleshoot_fixit_t
permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive
process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are
still generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. setrou- bleshoot_fixit policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run setroubleshoot_fixit with the
tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow all daemons the ability to
read/write terminals, you must turn on the
allow_daemons_use_tty boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_daemons_use_tty 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to use other domains
file descriptors, you must turn on the allow_domain_fd_use
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_domain_fd_use 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined applications to run with
kerberos, you must turn on the allow_kerberos boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_kerberos 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all
processes, you must turn on the allow_ptrace boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ptrace 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow system to run with NIS, you must
turn on the allow_ypbind boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ypbind 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load
modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to execute in
fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fips_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable reading of urandom for all
domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P global_ssp 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined applications to use nscd
shared memory, you must turn on the nscd_use_shm boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P nscd_use_shm 1</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type
setroubleshoot_fixit_t can manage files labeled with the
following file types. The paths listed are the default paths
for these file types. Note the processes UID still need to
have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/rhev /misc</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /tmp-inst /var/tmp-inst
/var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux setroubleshoot_fixit policy is very
flexible allowing users to setup their setroubleshoot_fixit
processes in as secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
setroubleshoot_fixit:</p>

<p>setroubleshoot_fixit_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the setroubleshoot_fixit_exec_t type,
if you want to transition an executable to the
setroubleshoot_fixit_t domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
