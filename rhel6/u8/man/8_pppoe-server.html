<p>NAME pppoe-server - user-space PPPoE server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pppoe-server [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pppoe-server is a user-space server for
PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) for Linux and
other UNIX systems. pppoe-server works in concert with the
pppoe client to respond to PPPoE discovery packets and set
up PPPoE sessions.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -F The -F option causes pppoe-server not to fork
and become a dae- mon. The default is to fork and become a
daemon.</p>

<p>-I interface The -I option specifies the Ethernet
interface to use. Under Linux, it is typically eth0 or eth1.
The interface should be &quot;up&quot; before you start
pppoe-server, but should not be configured to have an IP
address. You can supply multiple -I options if you want the
server to respond on more than one interface.</p>

<p>-T timeout This option is passed directly to pppoe; see
pppoe(8) for details. If you are using kernel-mode PPPoE,
this option has no effect.</p>

<p>-C ac_name Specifies which name to report as the access
concentrator name. If not supplied, the host name is
used.</p>

<p>-S name Offer a service named name. Multiple -S options
may be speci- fied; each one causes the named service to be
advertised in a Service-Name tag in the PADO frame. The
first -S option speci- fies the default service, and is used
if the PPPoE client requests a Service-Name of length
zero.</p>

<p>-m MSS This option is passed directly to pppoe; see
pppoe(8) for details. If you are using kernel-mode PPPoE,
this option has no effect.</p>

<p>-x n Limit the number of sessions per peer MAC address
to n. If a given MAC address attempts to create more than n
sessions, then its PADI and PADR packets are ignored. If you
set n to 0 (the default), then no limit is imposed on the
number of sessions per peer MAC address.</p>

<p>-s This option is passed directly to pppoe; see pppoe(8)
for details. In addition, it causes pppd to be invoked with
the sync option.</p>

<p>-L ip Sets the local IP address. This is passed to
spawned pppd pro- cesses. If not specified, the default is
10.0.0.1.</p>

<p>-R ip Sets the starting remote IP address. As sessions
are estab- lished, IP addresses are assigned starting from
ip. pppoe- server automatically keeps track of the pool of
addresses and passes a valid remote IP address to pppd. If
not specified, a starting address of 10.67.15.1 is used.</p>

<p>-N num Allows at most num concurrent PPPoE sessions. If
not specified, the default is 64.</p>

<p>-O fname This option causes pppoe-server to tell pppd to
use the option file fname instead of the default
/etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options.</p>

<p>-p fname Reads the specified file fname which is a text
file consisting of one IP address per line. These IP
addresses will be assigned to clients. The number of
sessions allowed will equal the num- ber of addresses found
in the file. The -p option overrides both -R and -N.</p>

<p>In addition to containing IP addresses, the pool file
can con- tain lines of the form:</p>

<p>a.b.c.d-e</p>

<p>which includes all IP addresses from a.b.c.d to a.b.c.e.
For example, the line:</p>

<p>1.2.3.4-7</p>

<p>is equivalent to:</p>

<p>1.2.3.4 1.2.3.5 1.2.3.6 1.2.3.7</p>

<p>-r Tells the PPPoE server to randomly permute session
numbers. Instead of handing out sessions in order, the
session numbers are assigned in an unpredictable order.</p>

<p>-u Tells the server to invoke pppd with the unit option.
Note that this option only works for pppd version 2.4.0 or
newer.</p>

<p>-o offset Instead of numbering PPPoE sessions starting
at 1, they will be numbered starting at offset+1. This
allows you to run multiple servers on a given machine; just
make sure that their session numbers do not overlap.</p>

<p>-f disc:sess The -f option sets the Ethernet frame types
for PPPoE discovery and session frames. The types are
specified as hexadecimal num- bers separated by a colon.
Standard PPPoE uses frame types 8863:8864. You should not
use this option unless you are abso- lutely sure the peer
you are dealing with uses non-standard frame types.</p>

<p>-k The -k option tells the server to use kernel-mode
PPPoE on Linux. This option is available only on Linux
kernels 2.4.0 and later, and only if the server was built
with kernel-mode sup- port.</p>

<p>-h The -h option prints a brief usage message and
exits.</p>

<p>OPERATION pppoe-server listens for incoming PPPoE
discovery packets. When a ses- sion is established, it
spawns a pppd process. The following options are passed to
pppd:</p>

<p>nodetach noaccomp nobsdcom nodeflate nopcomp novj
novjccomp default-asyncmap</p>

<p>In addition, the local and remote IP address are set
based on the -L and -R options. The pty option is supplied
along with a pppoe command to initiate the PPPoE session.
Finally, additional pppd options can be placed in the file
/etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options (which must exist, even if it
is just empty!)</p>

<p>Note that pppoe-server is meant mainly for testing PPPoE
clients. It is not a high-performance server meant for
production use.</p>
