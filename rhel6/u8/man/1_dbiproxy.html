<p>NAME dbiproxy - A proxy server for the DBD::Proxy
driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dbiproxy &lt;options&gt;
--localport=&lt;port&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool is just a front end for the
DBI::ProxyServer package. All it does is picking options
from the command line and calling DBI::ProxyServer::main().
See DBI::ProxyServer for details.</p>

<p>Available options include:</p>

<p>--chroot=dir (UNIX only) After doing a bind(), change
root directory to the given directory by doing a chroot().
This is useful for security, but it restricts the
environment a lot. For example, you need to load DBI drivers
in the config file or you have to create hard links to Unix
sockets, if your drivers are using them. For example, with
MySQL, a config file might contain the following lines:</p>

<p>my $rootdir = &rsquo;/var/dbiproxy&rsquo;; my
$unixsockdir = &rsquo;/tmp&rsquo;; my $unixsockfile =
&rsquo;mysql.sock&rsquo;; foreach $dir ($rootdir,
&quot;$rootdir$unixsockdir&quot;) { mkdir 0755, $dir; }
link(&quot;$unixsockdir/$unixsockfile&quot;,
&quot;$rootdir$unixsockdir/$unixsockfile&quot;); require
DBD::mysql;</p>

<p>{ &rsquo;chroot&rsquo; =&gt; $rootdir, ... }</p>

<p>If you dont know chroot(), think of an FTP server where
you can see a certain directory tree only after logging in.
See also the --group and --user options.</p>

<p>--configfile=file Config files are assumed to return a
single hash ref that overrides the arguments of the new
method. However, command line arguments in turn take
precedence over the config file. See the &quot;CONFIGURATION
FILE&quot; section in the DBI::ProxyServer documentation for
details on the config file.</p>

<p>--debug Turn debugging mode on. Mainly this asserts that
logging messages of level &quot;debug&quot; are created.</p>

<p>--facility=mode (UNIX only) Facility to use for
Sys::Syslog. The default is daemon.</p>

<p>--group=gid After doing a bind(), change the real and
effective GID to the given. This is useful, if you want your
server to bind to a privileged port (&lt;1024), but dont
want the server to execute as root. See also the --user
option.</p>

<p>GIDs can be passed as group names or numeric values.</p>

<p>--localaddr=ip By default a daemon is listening to any
IP number that a machine has. This attribute allows to
restrict the server to the given IP number.</p>

<p>--localport=port This attribute sets the port on which
the daemon is listening. It must be given somehow, as theres
no default.</p>

<p>--logfile=file Be default logging messages will be
written to the syslog (Unix) or to the event log (Windows
NT). On other operating systems you need to specify a log
file. The special value &quot;STDERR&quot; forces logging to
stderr. See Net::Daemon::Log for details.</p>

<p>--mode=modename The server can run in three different
modes, depending on the environment.</p>

<p>If you are running Perl 5.005 and did compile it for
threads, then the server will create a new thread for each
connection. The thread will execute the server s Run()
method and then terminate. This mode is the default, you can
force it with &quot;--mode=threads&quot;.</p>

<p>If threads are not available, but you have a working
fork(), then the server will behave similar by creating a
new process for each connection. This mode will be used
automatically in the absence of threads or if you use the
&quot;--mode=fork&quot; option.</p>

<p>Finally theres a single-connection mode: If the server
has accepted a connection, he will enter the Run() method.
No other connections are accepted until the Run() method
returns (if the client disconnects). This operation mode is
useful if you have neither threads nor fork(), for example
on the Macintosh. For debugging purposes you can force this
mode with &quot;--mode=single&quot;.</p>

<p>--pidfile=file (UNIX only) If this option is present, a
PID file will be created at the given location. Default is
to not create a pidfile.</p>

<p>--user=uid After doing a bind(), change the real and
effective UID to the given. This is useful, if you want your
server to bind to a privileged port (&lt;1024), but dont
want the server to execute as root. See also the --group and
the --chroot options.</p>

<p>UIDs can be passed as group names or numeric values.</p>

<p>--version Supresses startup of the server; instead the
version string will be printed and the program exits
immediately.</p>
