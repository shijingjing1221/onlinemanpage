<p>tkerror(n) Tk Built-In Commands tkerror(n)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME tkerror - Command invoked to process background
errors</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tkerror message
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Note: as of Tk 4.1 the tkerror command has
been renamed to bgerror because the event loop (which is
what usually invokes it) is now part of Tcl. For backward
compatibility the bgerror provided by the current Tk version
still tries to call tkerror if there is one (or an auto
loadable one), so old script defining that error handler
should still work, but you should anyhow modify your scripts
to use bgerror instead of tkerror because that support for
the old name might vanish in the near future. If that call
fails, bgerror posts a dialog showing the error and offering
to see the stack trace to the user. If you want your own
error management you should directly override bgerror
instead of tkerror. Documentation for bgerror is available
as part of Tcls docu- mentation.</p>
