<p>ZSHCOMPSYS(1) ZSHCOMPSYS(1)</p>

<p>NAME zshcompsys - zsh completion system</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This describes the shell code for the new
completion system, referred to as compsys. It is written in
shell functions based on the features described in
zshcompwid(1).</p>

<p>The features are contextual, sensitive to the point at
which completion is started. Many completions are already
provided. For this reason, a user can perform a great many
tasks without knowing any details beyond how to initialize
the system, which is described below in INITIALIZA-
TION.</p>

<p>The context that decides what completion is to be
performed may be &middot; an argument or option position:
these describe the position on the command line at which
completion is requested. For example first argument to
rmdir, the word being completed names a directory;</p>

<p>&middot; a special context, denoting an element in the
shells syntax. For example a word in command position or an
array sub- script.</p>

<p>A full context specification contains other elements, as
we shall describe.</p>

<p>Besides commands names and contexts, the system employs
two more con- cepts, styles and tags. These provide ways for
the user to configure the systems behaviour.</p>

<p>Tags play a dual role. They serve as a classification
system for the matches, typically indicating a class of
object that the user may need to distinguish. For example,
when completing arguments of the ls com- mand the user may
prefer to try files before directories, so both of these are
tags. They also appear as the rightmost element in a context
specification.</p>

<p>Styles modify various operations of the completion
system, such as out- put formatting, but also what kinds of
completers are used (and in what order), or which tags are
examined. Styles may accept arguments and are manipulated
using the zstyle command described in see zshmod-
ules(1).</p>

<p>In summary, tags describe what the completion objects
are, and style how they are to be completed. At various
points of execution, the com- pletion system checks what
styles and/or tags are defined for the cur- rent context,
and uses that to modify its behavior. The full descrip- tion
of context handling, which determines how tags and other
elements of the context influence the behaviour of styles,
is described below in COMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION.</p>

<p>When a completion is requested, a dispatcher function is
called; see the description of _main_complete in the list of
control functions below. This dispatcher decides which
function should be called to pro- duce the completions, and
calls it. The result is passed to one or more completers,
functions that implement individual completion strategies:
simple completion, error correction, completion with error
correction, menu selection, etc.</p>

<p>More generally, the shell functions contained in the
completion system are of two types: &middot; those beginning
comp are to be called directly; there are only a few of
these;</p>

<p>&middot; those beginning _ are called by the completion
code. The shell functions of this set, which implement
completion behaviour and may be bound to keystrokes, are
referred to as widgets . These proliferate as new
completions are required.</p>

<p>INITIALIZATION If the system was installed completely,
it should be enough to call the shell function compinit from
your initialization file; see the next section. However, the
function compinstall can be run by a user to configure
various aspects of the completion system.</p>

<p>Usually, compinstall will insert code into .zshrc,
although if that is not writable it will save it in another
file and tell you that files location. Note that it is up to
you to make sure that the lines added to .zshrc are actually
run; you may, for example, need to move them to an earlier
place in the file if .zshrc usually returns early. So long
as you keep them all together (including the comment lines
at the start and finish), you can rerun compinstall and it
will correctly locate and modify these lines. Note, however,
that any code you add to this sec- tion by hand is likely to
be lost if you rerun compinstall, although lines using the
command zstyle should be gracefully handled.</p>

<p>The new code will take effect next time you start the
shell, or run .zshrc by hand; there is also an option to
make them take effect imme- diately. However, if compinstall
has removed definitions, you will need to restart the shell
to see the changes.</p>

<p>To run compinstall you will need to make sure it is in a
directory men- tioned in your fpath parameter, which should
already be the case if zsh was properly configured as long
as your startup files do not remove the appropriate
directories from fpath. Then it must be autoloaded (autoload
-U compinstall is recommended). You can abort the instal-
lation any time you are being prompted for information, and
your .zshrc will not be altered at all; changes only take
place right at the end, where you are specifically asked for
confirmation.</p>

<p>Use of compinit This section describes the use of
compinit to initialize completion for the current session
when called directly; if you have run compinstall it will be
called automatically from your .zshrc.</p>

<p>To initialize the system, the function compinit should
be in a direc- tory mentioned in the fpath parameter, and
should be autoloaded (autoload -U compinit is recommended),
and then run simply as compinit. This will define a few
utility functions, arrange for all the necessary shell
functions to be autoloaded, and will then re-define all
widgets that do completion to use the new system. If you use
the menu-select widget, which is part of the zsh/complist
module, you should make sure that that module is loaded
before the call to compinit so that that widget is also
re-defined. If completion styles (see below) are set up to
perform expansion as well as completion by default, and the
TAB key is bound to expand-or-complete, compinit will rebind
it to complete-word; this is necessary to use the correct
form of expansion.</p>

<p>Should you need to use the original completion commands,
you can still bind keys to the old widgets by putting a . in
front of the widget name, e.g. .expand-or-complete.</p>

<p>To speed up the running of compinit, it can be made to
produce a dumped configuration that will be read in on
future invocations; this is the default, but can be turned
off by calling compinit with the option -D. The dumped file
is .zcompdump in the same directory as the startup files
(i.e. $ZDOTDIR or $HOME); alternatively, an explicit file
name can be given by compinit -d dumpfile . The next
invocation of compinit will read the dumped file instead of
performing a full ini- tialization.</p>

<p>If the number of completion files changes, compinit will
recognise this and produce a new dump file. However, if the
name of a function or the arguments in the first line of a
#compdef function (as described below) change, it is easiest
to delete the dump file by hand so that compinit will
re-create it the next time it is run. The check performed to
see if there are new functions can be omitted by giving the
option -C. In this case the dump file will only be created
if there isnt one already.</p>

<p>The dumping is actually done by another function,
compdump, but you will only need to run this yourself if you
change the configuration (e.g. using compdef) and then want
to dump the new one. The name of the old dumped file will be
remembered for this purpose.</p>

<p>If the parameter _compdir is set, compinit uses it as a
directory where completion functions can be found; this is
only necessary if they are not already in the function
search path.</p>

<p>For security reasons compinit also checks if the
completion system would use files not owned by root or by
the current user, or files in directories that are world- or
group-writable or that are not owned by root or by the
current user. If such files or directories are found,
compinit will ask if the completion system should really be
used. To avoid these tests and make all files found be used
without asking, use the option -u, and to make compinit
silently ignore all insecure files and directories use the
option -i. This security check is skipped entirely when the
-C option is given.</p>

<p>The security check can be retried at any time by running
the function compaudit. This is the same check used by
compinit, but when it is executed directly any changes to
fpath are made local to the function so they do not persist.
The directories to be checked may be passed as arguments; if
none are given, compaudit uses fpath and _compdir to find
completion system directories, adding missing ones to fpath
as neces- sary. To force a check of exactly the directories
currently named in fpath, set _compdir to an empty string
before calling compaudit or compinit.</p>

<p>The function bashcompinit provides compatibility with
bashs pro- grammable completion system. When run it will
define the functions, compgen and complete which correspond
to the bash builtins with the same names. It will then be
possible to use completion specifications and functions
written for bash.</p>

<p>Autoloaded files The convention for autoloaded functions
used in completion is that they start with an underscore; as
already mentioned, the fpath/FPATH parame- ter must contain
the directory in which they are stored. If zsh was properly
installed on your system, then fpath/FPATH automatically
con- tains the required directories for the standard
functions.</p>

<p>For incomplete installations, if compinit does not find
enough files beginning with an underscore (fewer than
twenty) in the search path, it will try to find more by
adding the directory _compdir to the search path. If that
directory has a subdirectory named Base, all subdirecto-
ries will be added to the path. Furthermore, if the
subdirectory Base has a subdirectory named Core, compinit
will add all subdirectories of the subdirectories is to the
path: this allows the functions to be in the same format as
in the zsh source distribution.</p>

<p>When compinit is run, it searches all such files
accessible via fpath/FPATH and reads the first line of each
of them. This line should contain one of the tags described
below. Files whose first line does not start with one of
these tags are not considered to be part of the completion
system and will not be treated specially.</p>

<p>The tags are:</p>

<p>#compdef names... [ -[pP] patterns... [ -N names... ] ]
The file will be made autoloadable and the function defined
in it will be called when completing names, each of which is
either the name of a command whose arguments are to be
completed or one of a number of special contexts in the form
-context- described below.</p>

<p>Each name may also be of the form cmd=service . When
complet- ing the command cmd, the function typically behaves
as if the command (or special context) service was being
completed instead. This provides a way of altering the
behaviour of func- tions that can perform many different
completions. It is imple- mented by setting the parameter
$service when calling the func- tion; the function may
choose to interpret this how it wishes, and simpler
functions will probably ignore it.</p>

<p>If the #compdef line contains one of the options -p or
-P, the words following are taken to be patterns. The
function will be called when completion is attempted for a
command or context that matches one of the patterns. The
options -p and -P are used to specify patterns to be tried
before or after other com- pletions respectively. Hence -P
may be used to specify default actions.</p>

<p>The option -N is used after a list following -p or -P;
it speci- fies that remaining words no longer define
patterns. It is pos- sible to toggle between the three
options as many times as nec- essary.</p>

<p>#compdef -k style key-sequences... This option creates a
widget behaving like the builtin widget style and binds it
to the given key-sequences, if any. The style must be one of
the builtin widgets that perform comple- tion, namely
complete-word, delete-char-or-list, expand-or-com- plete,
expand-or-complete-prefix, list-choices, menu-complete,
menu-expand-or-complete, or reverse-menu-complete. If the
zsh/complist module is loaded (see zshmodules(1)) the widget
menu-select is also available.</p>

<p>When one of the key-sequences is typed, the function in
the file will be invoked to generate the matches. Note that
a key will not be re-bound if it already was (that is, was
bound to some- thing other than undefined-key). The widget
created has the same name as the file and can be bound to
any other keys using bindkey as usual.</p>

<p>#compdef -K widget-name style key-sequences ... This is
similar to -k except that only one key-sequences argu- ment
may be given for each widget-name style pair. However, the
entire set of three arguments may be repeated with a
different set of arguments. Note in particular that the
widget-name must be distinct in each set. If it does not
begin with _ this will be added. The widget-name should not
clash with the name of any existing widget: names based on
the name of the function are most useful. For example,</p>

<p>#compdef -K _foo_complete complete-word &quot;^X^C&quot;
_foo_list list-choices &quot;^X^D&quot;</p>

<p>(all on one line) defines a widget _foo_complete for
completion, bound to ^X^C , and a widget _foo_list for
listing, bound to ^X^D.</p>

<p>#autoload [ options ] Functions with the #autoload tag
are marked for autoloading but are not otherwise treated
specially. Typically they are to be called from within one
of the completion functions. Any options supplied will be
passed to the autoload builtin; a typical use is +X to force
the function to be loaded immediately. Note that the -U and
-z flags are always added implicitly.</p>

<p>The # is part of the tag name and no white space is
allowed after it. The #compdef tags use the compdef function
described below; the main difference is that the name of the
function is supplied implicitly.</p>

<p>The special contexts for which completion functions can
be defined are:</p>

<p>-array-value- The right hand side of an array-assignment
( foo=(...))</p>

<p>-brace-parameter- The name of a parameter expansion
within braces ( ${...})</p>

<p>-assign-parameter- The name of a parameter in an
assignment, i.e. on the left hand side of an =</p>

<p>-command- A word in command position</p>

<p>-condition- A word inside a condition ([[...]])</p>

<p>-default- Any word for which no other completion is
defined</p>

<p>-equal- A word beginning with an equals sign</p>

<p>-first- This is tried before any other completion
function. The func- tion called may set the _compskip
parameter to one of various values: all: no further
completion is attempted; a string con- taining the substring
patterns: no pattern completion functions will be called; a
string containing default: the function for the -default-
context will not be called, but functions defined for
commands will</p>

<p>-math- Inside mathematical contexts, such as ((...))</p>

<p>-parameter- The name of a parameter expansion ($...)</p>

<p>-redirect- The word after a redirection operator.</p>

<p>-subscript- The contents of a parameter subscript.</p>

<p>-tilde- After an initial tilde (~), but before the first
slash in the word.</p>

<p>-value- On the right hand side of an assignment.</p>

<p>Default implementations are supplied for each of these
contexts. In most cases the context -context- is implemented
by a corresponding function _context, for example the
context -tilde- and the function _tilde).</p>

<p>The contexts -redirect- and -value- allow extra
context-specific infor- mation. (Internally, this is handled
by the functions for each context calling the function
_dispatch.) The extra information is added sepa- rated by
commas.</p>

<p>For the -redirect- context, the extra information is in
the form -redirect-,op,command , where op is the redirection
operator and com- mand is the name of the command on the
line. If there is no command on the line yet, the command
field will be empty.</p>

<p>For the -value- context, the form is
-value-,name,command, where name is the name of the
parameter. In the case of elements of an associa- tive
array, for example assoc=(key &lt;TAB&gt;, name is expanded
to name-key . In certain special contexts, such as
completing after make CFLAGS=, the command part gives the
name of the command, here make; otherwise it is empty.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to define fully specific completions
as the func- tions provided will try to generate completions
by progressively replacing the elements with -default-. For
example, when completing after foo=&lt;TAB&gt;, _value will
try the names -value-,foo, (note the empty command part),
-value-,foo,-default- and-value-,-default-,-default-, in
that order, until it finds a func- tion to handle the
context.</p>

<p>As an example:</p>

<p>compdef_files -g
&quot;*.log-redirect-,2&gt;,-default-</p>

<p>completes files matching *.log after 2&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;
for any command with no more specific handler defined.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<p>compdef _foo -value-,-default-,-default-</p>

<p>specifies that _foo provides completions for the values
of parameters for which no special function has been
defined. This is usually han- dled by the function _value
itself.</p>

<p>The same lookup rules are used when looking up styles
(as described below); for example</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:*:-redirect-,2&gt;,*:*
file-patterns*.log</p>

<p>is another way to make completion after 2&gt;
&lt;TAB&gt; complete files matching *.log.</p>

<p>Functions The following function is defined by compinit
and may be called directly.</p>

<p>compdef [ -an ] function names... [ -[pP] patterns... [
-N names... ] ] compdef -d names... compdef -k [ -an ]
function style key-sequences... compdef -K [ -an ] function
name style key-sequences ... The first form defines the
function to call for completion in the given contexts as
described for the #compdef tag above.</p>

<p>Alternatively, all the arguments may have the form
cmd=ser- vice. Here service should already have been defined
by cmd1=service lines in #compdef files, as described above.
The argument for cmd will be completed in the same way as
service.</p>

<p>The function argument may alternatively be a string
containing any shell code. The string will be executed using
the eval builtin command to generate completions. This
provides a way of avoiding having to define a new completion
function. For exam- ple, to complete files ending in .h as
arguments to the com- mand foo:</p>

<p>compdef_files -g &quot;*.h&quot;foo</p>

<p>The option -n prevents any completions already defined
for the command or context from being overwritten.</p>

<p>The option -d deletes any completion defined for the
command or contexts listed.</p>

<p>The names may also contain -p, -P and -N options as
described for the #compdef tag. The effect on the argument
list is iden- tical, switching between definitions of
patterns tried ini- tially, patterns tried finally, and
normal commands and con- texts.</p>

<p>The parameter $_compskip may be set by any function
defined for a pattern context. If it is set to a value
containing the sub- string patterns none of the
pattern-functions will be called; if it is set to a value
containing the substring all, no other function will be
called.</p>

<p>The form with -k defines a widget with the same name as
the function that will be called for each of the
key-sequences; this is like the #compdef -k tag. The
function should generate the completions needed and will
otherwise behave like the builtin widget whose name is given
as the style argument. The widgets usable for this are:
complete-word, delete-char-or-list, expand-or-complete,
expand-or-complete-prefix, list-choices, menu-complete,
menu-expand-or-complete, and reverse-menu-com- plete, as
well as menu-select if the zsh/complist module is loaded.
The option -n prevents the key being bound if it is already
to bound to something other than undefined-key.</p>

<p>The form with -K is similar and defines multiple widgets
based on the same function, each of which requires the set
of three arguments name, style and key-sequences, where the
latter two are as for -k and the first must be a unique
widget name begin- ning with an underscore.</p>

<p>Wherever applicable, the -a option makes the function
autoload- able, equivalent to autoload -U function.</p>

<p>The function compdef can be used to associate existing
completion func- tions with new commands. For example,</p>

<p>compdef _pids foo</p>

<p>uses the function _pids to complete process IDs for the
command foo.</p>

<p>Note also the _gnu_generic function described below,
which can be used to complete options for commands that
understand the --help option.</p>

<p>COMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION This section gives a
short overview of how the completion system works, and then
more detail on how users can configure how and when matches
are generated.</p>

<p>Overview When completion is attempted somewhere on the
command line the comple- tion system first works out the
context. This takes account of a num- ber of things
including the command word (such as grep or zsh) and options
to which the current word may be an argument (such as the -o
option to zsh which takes a shell option as an
argument).</p>

<p>This context information is condensed into a string
consisting of mul- tiple fields separated by colons,
referred to simply as the context in the remainder of the
documentation. This is used to look up styles,
context-sensitive options that can be used to configure the
completion system. The context used for lookup may vary
during the same call to the completion system.</p>

<p>The context string always consists of a fixed set of
fields, separated by colons and with a leading colon before
the first, in the form :com-
pletion:function:completer:command:argument:tag. These have
the fol- lowing meaning:</p>

<p>&middot; The literal string completion, saying that this
style is used by the completion system. This distinguishes
the context from those used by, for example, zle widgets and
ZFTP functions.</p>

<p>&middot; The function, if completion is called from a
named widget rather than through the normal completion
system. Typically this is blank, but it is set by special
widgets such as predict-on and the various functions in the
Widget directory of the distribu- tion to the name of that
function, often in an abbreviated form.</p>

<p>&middot; The completer currently active, the name of the
function without the leading underscore and with other
underscores converted to hyphens. A completer is in overall
control of how completion is to be performed; complete is
the simplest, but other com- pleters exist to perform
related tasks such as correction, or to modify the behaviour
of a later completer. See the section Control Functions
below for more information.</p>

<p>&middot; The command or a special -context-, just at it
appears following the #compdef tag or the compdef function.
Completion functions for commands that have sub-commands
usually modify this field to contain the name of the command
followed by a minus sign and the sub-command. For example,
the completion function for the cvs command sets this field
to cvs-add when completing arguments to the add
subcommand.</p>

<p>&middot; The argument; this indicates which command line
or option argu- ment we are completing. For command
arguments this generally takes the form argument-n, where n
is the number of the argu- ment, and for arguments to
options the form option-opt-n where n is the number of the
argument to option opt. However, this is only the case if
the command line is parsed with standard UNIX-style options
and arguments, so many completions do not set this.</p>

<p>&middot; The tag. As described previously, tags are used
to discriminate between the types of matches a completion
function can generate in a certain context. Any completion
function may use any tag name it likes, but a list of the
more common ones is given below.</p>

<p>The context is gradually put together as the functions
are executed, starting with the main entry point, which adds
:completion: and the function element if necessary. The
completer then adds the completer element. The contextual
completion adds the command and argument options. Finally,
the tag is added when the types of completion are known. For
example, the context name</p>

<p>:completion::complete:dvips:option-o-1:files</p>

<p>says that normal completion was attempted as the first
argument to the option -o of the command dvips:</p>

<p>dvips -o ...</p>

<p>and the completion function will generate filenames.</p>

<p>Usually completion will be tried for all possible tags
in an order given by the completion function. However, this
can be altered by using the tag-order style. Completion is
then restricted to the list of given tags in the given
order.</p>

<p>The _complete_help bindable command shows all the
contexts and tags available for completion at a particular
point. This provides an easy way of finding information for
tag-order and other styles. It is described in the section
Bindable Commands below.</p>

<p>Styles determine such things as how the matches are
generated, simi- larly to shell options but with much more
control. They can have any number of strings as their value.
They are defined with the zstyle builtin command (see
zshmodules(1)).</p>

<p>When looking up styles the completion system uses full
context names, including the tag. Looking up the value of a
style therefore consists of two things: the context, which
may be matched as a pattern, and the name of the style
itself, which must be given exactly.</p>

<p>For example, many completion functions can generate
matches in a simple and a verbose form and use the verbose
style to decide which form should be used. To make all such
functions use the verbose form, put</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*verbose yes</p>

<p>in a startup file (probably .zshrc). This gives the
verbose style the value yes in every context inside the
completion system, unless that context has a more specific
definition. It is best to avoid giving the context as * in
case the style has some meaning outside the comple- tion
system.</p>

<p>Many such general purpose styles can be configured
simply by using the compinstall function.</p>

<p>A more specific example of the use of the verbose style
is by the com- pletion for the kill builtin. If the style is
set, the builtin lists full job texts and process command
lines; otherwise it shows the bare job numbers and PIDs. To
turn the style off for this use only:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*:*:kill:*verbose no</p>

<p>For even more control, the style can use one of the tags
jobs or processes. To turn off verbose display only for
jobs:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*:*:kill:*:jobsverbose no</p>

<p>The -e option to zstyle even allows completion function
code to appear as the argument to a style; this requires
some understanding of the internals of completion functions
(see see zshcompwid(1))). For exam- ple,</p>

<p>zstyle -e:completion:*hostsreply=($myhosts)</p>

<p>This forces the value of the hosts style to be read from
the variable myhosts each time a host name is needed; this
is useful if the value of myhosts can change dynamically.
For another useful example, see the example in the
description of the file-list style below. This form can be
slow and should be avoided for commonly examined styles such
as menu and list-rows-first.</p>

<p>Note that the order in which styles are defined does not
matter; the style mechanism uses the most specific possible
match for a particular style to determine the set of values.
More precisely, strings are pre- ferred over patterns (for
example, :completion::complete:foo is more specific than
:completion::complete:* ), and longer patterns are pre-
ferred over shorter patterns.</p>

<p>Style names like those of tags are arbitrary and depend
on the comple- tion function. However, the following two
sections list some of the most common tags and styles.</p>

<p>Standard Tags Some of the following are only used when
looking up particular styles and do not refer to a type of
match.</p>

<p>accounts used to look up the users-hosts style</p>

<p>all-expansions used by the _expand completer when adding
the single string con- taining all possible expansions</p>

<p>all-files for the names of all files (as distinct from a
particular sub- set, see the globbed-files tag).</p>

<p>arguments for arguments to a command</p>

<p>arrays for names of array parameters</p>

<p>association-keys for keys of associative arrays; used
when completing inside a subscript to a parameter of this
type</p>

<p>bookmarks when completing bookmarks (e.g. for URLs and
the zftp function suite)</p>

<p>builtins for names of builtin commands</p>

<p>characters for single characters in arguments of
commands such as stty. Also used when completing character
classes after an opening bracket</p>

<p>colormapids for X colormap ids</p>

<p>colors for color names</p>

<p>commands for names of external commands. Also used by
complex commands such as cvs when completing names
subcommands.</p>

<p>contexts for contexts in arguments to the zstyle builtin
command</p>

<p>corrections used by the _approximate and _correct
completers for possible corrections</p>

<p>cursors for cursor names used by X programs</p>

<p>default used in some contexts to provide a way of
supplying a default when more specific tags are also valid.
Note that this tag is used when only the function field of
the context name is set</p>

<p>descriptions used when looking up the value of the
format style to generate descriptions for types of
matches</p>

<p>Standard Styles Note that the values of several of these
styles represent boolean val- ues. Any of the strings true,
on, yes, and 1 can be used for the value true and any of the
strings false, off, no, and 0 for the value false. The
behavior for any other value is undefined except where
explicitly mentioned. The default value may be either true
or false if the style is not set.</p>

<p>Some of these styles are tested first for every possible
tag corre- sponding to a type of match, and if no style was
found, for the default tag. The most notable styles of this
type are menu, list-colors and styles controlling completion
listing such as list-packed and last-prompt). When tested
for the default tag, only the function field of the context
will be set so that a style using the default tag will
normally be defined along the lines of:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*:defaultmenu ...</p>

<p>accept-exact This is tested for the default tag in
addition to the tags valid for the current context. If it is
set to true and any of the trial matches is the same as the
string on the command line, this match will immediately be
accepted (even if it would other- wise be considered
ambiguous).</p>

<p>When completing pathnames (where the tag used is paths)
this style accepts any number of patterns as the value in
addition to the boolean values. Pathnames matching one of
these patterns will be accepted immediately even if the
command line contains some more partially typed pathname
components and these match no file under the directory
accepted.</p>

<p>This style is also used by the _expand completer to
decide if words beginning with a tilde or parameter
expansion should be expanded. For example, if there are
parameters foo and foobar, the string $foo will only be
expanded if accept-exact is set to true; otherwise the
completion system will be allowed to complete $foo to
$foobar. If the style is set to continue, _expand will add
the expansion as a match and the completion system will also
be allowed to continue.</p>

<p>accept-exact-dirs This is used by filename completion.
Unlike accept-exact it is a boolean. By default, filename
completion examines all compo- nents of a path to see if
there are completions of that compo- nent, even if the
component matches an existing directory. For example, when
completion after /usr/bin/, the function examines possible
completions to /usr.</p>

<p>When this style is true, any prefix of a path that
matches an existing directory is accepted without any
attempt to complete it further. Hence, in the given example,
the path /usr/bin/ is accepted immediately and completion
tried in that directory.</p>

<p>If you wish to inhibit this behaviour entirely, set the
path-completion style (see below) to false.</p>

<p>add-space This style is used by the _expand completer.
If it is true (the default), a space will be inserted after
all words resulting from the expansion, or a slash in the
case of directory names. If the value is file, the completer
will only add a space to names of existing files. Either a
boolean true or the value file may be combined with subst,
in which case the completer will not add a space to words
generated from the expansion of a substitution of the form
$(...) or ${...}.</p>

<p>The _prefix completer uses this style as a simple
boolean value to decide if a space should be inserted before
the suffix.</p>

<p>ambiguous This applies when completing non-final
components of filename paths, in other words those with a
trailing slash. If it is set, the cursor is left after the
first ambiguous component, even if menu completion is in
use. The style is always tested with the paths tag.</p>

<p>assign-list When completing after an equals sign that is
being treated as an assignment, the completion system
normally completes only one filename. In some cases the
value may be a list of filenames separated by colons, as
with PATH and similar parameters. This style can be set to a
list of patterns matching the names of such parameters.</p>

<p>The default is to complete lists when the word on the
line already contains a colon.</p>

<p>auto-description If set, this styles value will be used
as the description for options that are not described by the
completion functions, but that have exactly one argument.
The sequence %d in the value will be replaced by the
description for this argument. Depend- ing on personal
preferences, it may be useful to set this style to something
like specify: %d. Note that this may not work for some
commands.</p>

<p>avoid-completer This is used by the _all_matches
completer to decide if the string consisting of all matches
should be added to the list currently being generated. Its
value is a list of names of com- pleters. If any of these is
the name of the completer that gen- erated the matches in
this completion, the string will not be added.</p>

<p>The default value for this style is _expand _old_list
_correct _approximate, i.e. it contains the completers for
which a string with all matches will almost never be
wanted.</p>

<p>cache-path This style defines the path where any cache
files containing dumped completion data are stored. It
defaults to $ZDOT- DIR/.zcompcache , or $HOME/.zcompcache if
$ZDOTDIR is not defined. The completion cache will not be
used unless the use-cache style is set.</p>

<p>cache-policy This style defines the function that will
be used to determine whether a cache needs rebuilding. See
the section on the _cache_invalid function below.</p>

<p>call-command This style is used in the function for
commands such as make and ant where calling the command
directly to generate matches suf- fers problems such as
being slow or, as in the case of make can potentially cause
actions in the makefile to be executed. If it is set to true
the command is called to generate matches. The default value
of this style is false.</p>

<p>command In many places, completion functions need to
call external com- mands to generate the list of
completions. This style can be used to override the command
that is called in some such cases. The elements of the value
are joined with spaces to form a com- mand line to execute.
The value can also start with a hyphen, in which case the
usual command will be added to the end; this is most useful
for putting builtin or command in front to make sure the
appropriate version of a command is called, for example to
avoid calling a shell function with the same name as an
external command.</p>

<p>As an example, the completion function for process IDs
uses this style with the processes tag to generate the IDs
to complete and the list of processes to display (if the
verbose style is true ). The list produced by the command
should look like the output of the ps command. The first
line is not displayed, but is searched for the string PID
(or pid) to find the position of the process IDs in the
following lines. If the line does not contain PID, the first
numbers in each of the other lines are taken as the process
IDs to complete.</p>

<p>Note that the completion function generally has to call
the specified command for each attempt to generate the
completion list. Hence care should be taken to specify only
commands that take a short time to run, and in particular to
avoid any that may never terminate.</p>

<p>command-path This is a list of directories to search for
commands to com- plete. The default for this style is the
value of the special parameter path.</p>

<p>commands This is used by the function completing
sub-commands for the system initialisation scripts (residing
in /etc/init.d or some- where not too far away from that).
Its values give the default commands to complete for those
commands for which the completion function isnt able to find
them out automatically. The default for this style are the
two strings start and stop.</p>

<p>complete This is used by the _expand_alias function when
invoked as a bindable command. If set to true and the word
on the command line is not the name of an alias, matching
alias names will be completed.</p>

<p>complete-options This is used by the completer for cd,
chdir and pushd. For these commands a - is used to introduce
a directory stack entry and completion of these is far more
common than completing options. Hence unless the value of
this style is true options will not be completed, even after
an initial -. If it is true, options will be completed after
an initial - unless there is a preceding -- on the command
line.</p>

<p>completer The strings given as the value of this style
provide the names of the completer functions to use. The
available completer func- tions are described in the section
Control Functions below.</p>

<p>Each string may be either the name of a completer
function or a string of the form function:name. In the first
case the com- pleter field of the context will contain the
name of the com- pleter without the leading underscore and
with all other under- scores replaced by hyphens. In the
second case the function is the name of the completer to
call, but the context will contain the user-defined name in
the completer field of the context. If the name starts with
a hyphen, the string for the context will be build from the
name of the completer function as in the first case with the
name appended to it. For example:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* completer _complete
_complete:-foo</p>

<p>Here, completion will call the _complete completer
twice, once using complete and once using complete-foo in
the completer field of the context. Normally, using the same
completer more than once only makes sense when used with the
functions:name form, because otherwise the context name will
be the same in all calls to the completer; possible
exceptions to this rule are the _ignored and _prefix
completers.</p>

<p>The default value for this style is _complete _ignored:
only completion will be done, first using the
ignored-patterns style and the $fignore array and then
without ignoring matches.</p>

<p>condition This style is used by the _list completer
function to decide if insertion of matches should be delayed
unconditionally. The default is true.</p>

<p>delimiters This style is used when adding a delimiter
for use with history modifiers or glob qualifiers that have
delimited arguments. It is an array of preferred delimiters
to add. Non-special charac- ters are preferred as the
completion system may otherwise become confused. The default
list is :, +, /, -, %. The list may be empty to force a
delimiter to be typed.</p>

<p>disabled If this is set to true , the _expand_alias
completer and bind- able command will try to expand disabled
aliases, too. The default is false.</p>

<p>domains A list of names of network domains for
completion. If this is not set, domain names will be taken
from the file /etc/resolv.conf.</p>

<p>environ The environ style is used when completing for
sudo. It is set to an array of VAR=value assignments to be
exported into the local environment before the completion
for the target command is invoked. zstyle :complete:sudo:
environ PATH=&quot;/sbin:/usr/sbin:$PATH&quot;
HOME=&quot;/root&quot;</p>

<p>expand This style is used when completing strings
consisting of multi- ple parts, such as path names.</p>

<p>If one of its values is the string prefix, the partially
typed word from the line will be expanded as far as possible
even if trailing parts cannot be completed.</p>

<p>If one of its values is the string suffix, matching
names for components after the first ambiguous one will also
be added. This means that the resulting string is the
longest unambiguous string possible. However, menu
completion can be used to cycle through all matches.</p>

<p>fake This style may be set for any completion context.
It specifies additional strings that will always be
completed in that con- text. The form of each string is
value:description ; the colon and description may be
omitted, but any literal colons in value must be quoted with
a backslash. Any description provided is shown alongside the
value in completion listings.</p>

<p>It is important to use a sufficiently restrictive
context when specifying fake strings. Note that the styles
fake-files and fake-parameters provide additional features
when completing files or parameters.</p>

<p>fake-always This works identically to the fake style
except that the ignored-patterns style is not applied to it.
This makes it pos- sible to override a set of matches
completely by setting the ignored patterns to *.</p>

<p>The following shows a way of supplementing any tag with
arbi- trary data, but having it behave for display purposes
like a separate tag. In this example we use the features of
the tag-order style to divide the named-directories tag into
two when performing completion with the standard completer
complete for arguments of cd. The tag
named-directories-normal behaves as normal, but the tag
named-directories-mine contains a fixed set of directories.
This has the effect of adding the match group extra
directories with the given completions.</p>

<p>zstyle :completion::complete:cd:*tag-order
named-directories:-mine:extradirectories
named-directories:-normal:nameddirectories * zstyle
:completion::complete:cd:*:named-directories-mine
fake-always mydir1 mydir2 zstyle
:completion::complete:cd:*:named-directories-mine
ignored-patterns*</p>

<p>fake-files This style is used when completing files and
looked up without a tag. Its values are of the form
dir:names... . This will add the names (strings separated by
spaces) as possible matches when completing in the directory
dir, even if no such files really exist. The dir may be a
pattern; pattern characters or colons in dir should be
quoted with a backslash to be treated liter- ally.</p>

<p>This can be useful on systems that support special file
systems whose top-level pathnames can not be listed or
generated with glob patterns. It can also be used for
directories for which one does not have read permission.</p>

<p>The pattern form can be used to add a certain magic
entry to all directories on a particular file system.</p>

<p>fake-parameters This is used by the completion function
for parameter names. Its values are names of parameters that
might not yet be set but should be completed nonetheless.
Each name may also be followed by a colon and a string
specifying the type of the parameter (like scalar, array or
integer). If the type is given, the name will only be
completed if parameters of that type are required in the
particular context. Names for which no type is specified
will always be completed.</p>

<p>file-list This style controls whether files completed
using the standard builtin mechanism are to be listed with a
long list similar to ls -l. Note that this feature uses the
shell module zsh/stat for file information; this loads the
builtin stat which will replace any external stat
executable. To avoid this the follow- ing code can be
included in an initialization file:</p>

<p>zmodload -i zsh/stat disable stat</p>

<p>The style may either be set to a true value (or all ),
or one of the values insert or list, indicating that files
are to be listed in long format in all circumstances, or
when attempt- ing to insert a file name, or when listing
file names without attempting to insert one.</p>

<p>More generally, the value may be an array of any of the
above values, optionally followed by =num. If num is present
it gives the maximum number of matches for which long
listing style will be used. For example,</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* file-list list=20 insert=10</p>

<p>specifies that long format will be used when listing up
to 20 files or inserting a file with up to 10 matches
(assuming a listing is to be shown at all, for example on an
ambiguous com- pletion), else short format will be used.</p>

<p>zstyle -e :completion:* file-list (( ${+NUMERIC} ))
&amp;&amp; reply=(true)</p>

<p>specifies that long format will be used any time a
numeric argu- ment is supplied, else short format.</p>

<p>file-patterns This is used by the standard function for
completing filenames, _files. If the style is unset up to
three tags are offered, globbed-files,directories and
all-files, depending on the types of files expected by the
caller of _files. The first two (globbed-files and
directories) are normally offered together to make it easier
to complete files in sub-directories.</p>

<p>The file-patterns style provides alternatives to the
default tags, which are not used. Its value consists of
elements of the form pattern:tag ; each string may contain
any number of such specifications separated by spaces.</p>

<p>The pattern is a pattern that is to be used to generate
file- names. Any occurrence of the sequence %p is replaced
by any pattern(s) passed by the function calling _files.
Colons in the pattern must be preceded by a backslash to
make them distin- guishable from the colon before the tag.
If more than one pat- tern is needed, the patterns can be
given inside braces, sepa- rated by commas.</p>

<p>The tags of all strings in the value will be offered by
_files and used when looking up other styles. Any tags in
the same word will be offered at the same time and before
later words. If no :tag is given the files tag will be
used.</p>

<p>The tag may also be followed by an optional second colon
and a description, which will be used for the %d in the
value of the format style (if that is set) instead of the
default description supplied by the completion function. If
the description given here contains itself a %d, that is
replaced with the descrip- tion supplied by the completion
function.</p>

<p>For example, to make the rm command first complete only
names of object files and then the names of all files if
there is no matching object file:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:*:rm:* file-patterns
*.o:object-file%p:all-files</p>

<p>To alter the default behaviour of file completion --
offer files matching a pattern and directories on the first
attempt, then all files -- to offer only matching files on
the first attempt, then directories, and finally all
files:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* file-patterns
%p:globbed-file*(-/):directorie*:all-files</p>

<p>This works even where there is no special pattern:
_files matches all files using the pattern * at the first
step and stops when it sees this pattern. Note also it will
never try a pattern more than once for a single completion
attempt.</p>

<p>During the execution of completion functions, the
EXTENDED_GLOB option is in effect, so the characters #, ~
and ^ have special meanings in the patterns.</p>

<p>file-sort The standard filename completion function uses
this style with- out a tag to determine in which order the
names should be listed; menu completion will cycle through
them in the same order. The possible values are: size to
sort by the size of the file; links to sort by the number of
links to the file; modification (or time or date) to sort by
the last modifi- cation time; access to sort by the last
access time; and inode (or change) to sort by the last inode
change time. If the style is set to any other value, or is
unset, files will be sorted alphabetically by name. If the
value contains the string reverse, sorting is done in the
opposite order. If the value contains the string follow ,
timestamps are associated with the targets of symbolic
links; the default is to use the timestamps of the links
themselves.</p>

<p>filter This is used by the LDAP plugin for e-mail
address completion to specify the attributes to match
against when filtering entries. So for example, if the style
is set to sn , matching is done against surnames. Standard
LDAP filtering is used so normal completion matching is
bypassed. If this style is not set, the LDAP plugin is
skipped. You may also need to set the command style to
specify how to connect to your LDAP server.</p>

<p>force-list This forces a list of completions to be shown
at any point where listing is done, even in cases where the
list would usually be suppressed. For example, normally the
list is only shown if there are at least two different
matches. By setting this style to always, the list will
always be shown, even if there is only a single match that
will immediately be accepted. The style may also be set to a
number. In this case the list will be shown if there are at
least that many matches, even if they would all insert the
same string.</p>

<p>This style is tested for the default tag as well as for
each tag valid for the current completion. Hence the listing
can be forced only for certain types of match.</p>

<p>format If this is set for the descriptions tag, its
value is used as a string to display above matches in
completion lists. The sequence %d in this string will be
replaced with a short description of what these matches are.
This string may also contain the following sequences to
specify output attributes, as described in the section
EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zsh- misc(1): %B , %S, %U,
%F, %K and their lower case coun- terparts, as well as
%{...%}. %F, %K and %{...%} take arguments in the same form
as prompt expansion. Note that the %G sequence is not
available; an argument to %{ should be used instead.</p>

<p>The style is tested with each tag valid for the current
comple- tion before it is tested for the descriptions tag.
Hence dif- ferent format strings can be defined for
different types of match.</p>

<p>Note also that some completer functions define
additional % -sequences. These are described for the
completer functions that make use of them.</p>

<p>Some completion functions display messages that may be
cus- tomised by setting this style for the messages tag.
Here, the %d is replaced with a message given by the
completion func- tion.</p>

<p>Finally, the format string is looked up with the
warnings tag, for use when no matches could be generated at
all. In this case the %d is replaced with the descriptions
for the matches that were expected separated by spaces. The
sequence %D is replaced with the same descriptions separated
by newlines.</p>

<p>It is possible to use printf-style field width
specifiers with %d and similar escape sequences. This is
handled by the zfor- mat builtin command from the zsh/zutil
module, see zshmod- ules(1).</p>

<p>glob This is used by the _expand completer. If it is set
to true (the default), globbing will be attempted on the
words resulting from a previous substitution (see the
substitute style) or else the original string from the
line.</p>

<p>global If this is set to true (the default), the
_expand_alias com- pleter and bindable command will try to
expand global aliases.</p>

<p>group-name The completion system can group different
types of matches, which appear in separate lists. This style
can be used to give the names of groups for particular tags.
For example, in com- mand position the completion system
generates names of builtin and external commands, names of
aliases, shell functions and parameters and reserved words
as possible completions. To have the external commands and
shell functions listed separately:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:*:-command-:*:commands group-name
commands zstyle :completion:*:*:-command-:*:functions
group-name functions</p>

<p>As a consequence, any match with the same tag will be
displayed in the same group.</p>

<p>If the name given is the empty string the name of the
tag for the matches will be used as the name of the group.
So, to have all different types of matches displayed
separately, one can just set:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*group-name</p>

<p>All matches for which no group name is defined will be
put in a group named -default-.</p>

<p>group-order This style is additional to the group-name
style to specify the order for display of the groups defined
by that style (compare tag-order, which determines which
completions appear at all). The groups named are shown in
the given order; any other groups are shown in the order
defined by the completion function.</p>

<p>For example, to have names of builtin commands, shell
functions and external commands appear in that order when
completing in command position:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*:*:-command-:*group-order builtins
functions commands</p>

<p>groups A list of names of UNIX groups. If this is not
set, group names are taken from the YP database or the file
/etc/group.</p>

<p>hidden If this is set to true, matches for the given
context will not be listed, although any description for the
matches set with the format style will be shown. If it is
set to all , not even the description will be displayed.</p>

<p>Note that the matches will still be completed; they are
just not shown in the list. To avoid having matches
considered as possi- ble completions at all, the tag-order
style can be modified as described below.</p>

<p>hosts A list of names of hosts that should be completed.
If this is not set, hostnames are taken from the file
/etc/hosts.</p>

<p>hosts-ports This style is used by commands that need or
accept hostnames and network ports. The strings in the value
should be of the form host:port. Valid ports are determined
by the presence of hostnames; multiple ports for the same
host may appear.</p>

<p>ignore-line This is tested for each tag valid for the
current completion. If it is set to true, none of the words
that are already on the line will be considered as possible
completions. If it is set to current, the word the cursor is
on will not be consid- ered as a possible completion. The
value current-shown is similar but only applies if the list
of completions is currently shown on the screen. Finally, if
the style is set to other, no word apart from the current
one will be considered as a pos- sible completion.</p>

<p>The values current and current-shown are a bit like the
opposite of the accept-exact style: only strings with
missing characters will be completed.</p>

<p>Note that you almost certainly don t want to set this to
true or other for a general context such as :completion:*.
This is because it would disallow completion of, for
example, options multiple times even if the command in
question accepts the option more than once.</p>

<p>ignore-parents The style is tested without a tag by the
function completing pathnames in order to determine whether
to ignore the names of directories already mentioned in the
current word, or the name of the current working directory.
The value must include one or both of the following
strings:</p>

<p>parent The name of any directory whose path is already
contained in the word on the line is ignored. For example,
when completing after foo/../, the directory foo will not be
considered a valid completion.</p>

<p>pwd The name of the current working directory will not
be completed; hence, for example, completion after ../ will
not use the name of the current directory.</p>

<p>In addition, the value may include one or both of:</p>

<p>.. Ignore the specified directories only when the word
on the line contains the substring ../.</p>

<p>directory Ignore the specified directories only when
names of directories are completed, not when completing
names of files.</p>

<p>Excluded values act in a similar fashion to values of
the ignored-patterns style, so they can be restored to
consideration by the _ignored completer.</p>

<p>extra-verbose If set, the completion listing is more
verbose at the cost of a probable decrease in completion
speed. Completion performance will suffer if this style is
set to true.</p>

<p>ignored-patterns A list of patterns; any trial
completion matching one of the patterns will be excluded
from consideration. The _ignored com- pleter can appear in
the list of completers to restore the ignored matches. This
is a more configurable version of the shell parameter
$fignore.</p>

<p>Note that the EXTENDED_GLOB option is set during the
execution of completion functions, so the characters #, ~
and ^ have special meanings in the patterns.</p>

<p>insert This style is used by the _all_matches completer
to decide whether to insert the list of all matches
unconditionally instead of adding the list as another
match.</p>

<p>insert-ids When completing process IDs, for example as
arguments to the kill and wait builtins the name of a
command may be converted to the appropriate process ID. A
problem arises when the process name typed is not unique. By
default (or if this style is set explicitly to menu) the
name will be converted immediately to a set of possible IDs,
and menu completion will be started to cycle through
them.</p>

<p>If the value of the style is single, the shell will wait
until the user has typed enough to make the command unique
before con- verting the name to an ID; attempts at
completion will be unsuc- cessful until that point. If the
value is any other string, menu completion will be started
when the string typed by the user is longer than the common
prefix to the corresponding IDs.</p>

<p>insert-tab If this is set to true, the completion system
will insert a TAB character (assuming that was used to start
completion) instead of performing completion when there is
no non-blank character to the left of the cursor. If it is
set to false, completion will be done even there.</p>

<p>The value may also contain the substrings pending or
pend- ing=val. In this case, the typed character will be
inserted instead of starting completion when there is
unprocessed input pending. If a val is given, completion
will not be done if there are at least that many characters
of unprocessed input. This is often useful when pasting
characters into a terminal. Note however, that it relies on
the $PENDING special parameter from the zsh/zle module being
set properly which is not guaran- teed on all platforms.</p>

<p>The default value of this style is true except for
completion within vared builtin command where it is
false.</p>

<p>insert-unambiguous This is used by the _match and
_approximate completers. These completers are often used
with menu completion since the word typed may bear little
resemblance to the final completion. How- ever, if this
style is true, the completer will start menu completion only
if it could find no unambiguous initial string at least as
long as the original string typed by the user.</p>

<p>In the case of the _approximate completer, the completer
field in the context will already have been set to one of
correct-num or approximate-num, where num is the number of
errors that were accepted.</p>

<p>In the case of the _match completer, the style may also
be set to the string pattern. Then the pattern on the line
is left unchanged if it does not match unambiguously.</p>

<p>keep-prefix This style is used by the _expand completer.
If it is true, the completer will try to keep a prefix
containing a tilde or parameter expansion. Hence, for
example, the string ~/f* would be expanded to ~/foo instead
of /home/user/foo. If the style is set to changed (the
default), the prefix will only be left unchanged if there
were other changes between the expanded words and the
original word from the command line. Any other value forces
the prefix to be expanded unconditionally.</p>

<p>The behaviour of expand when this style is true is to
cause _expand to give up when a single expansion with the
restored prefix is the same as the original; hence any
remaining completers may be called.</p>

<p>last-prompt This is a more flexible form of the
ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT option. If it is true, the completion
system will try to return the cur- sor to the previous
command line after displaying a completion list. It is
tested for all tags valid for the current comple- tion, then
the default tag. The cursor will be moved back to the
previous line if this style is true for all types of match.
Note that unlike the ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT option this is
independent of the numeric prefix argument.</p>

<p>known-hosts-files This style should contain a list of
files to search for host names and (if the use-ip style is
set) IP addresses in a format compatible with ssh
known_hosts files. If it is not set, the files
/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts and ~/.ssh/known_hosts are
used.</p>

<p>list This style is used by the _history_complete_word
bindable com- mand. If it is set to true it has no effect.
If it is set to false matches will not be listed. This
overrides the setting of the options controlling listing
behaviour, in particular AUTO_LIST. The context always
starts with :completion:his- tory-words.</p>

<p>list-colors If the zsh/complist module is loaded, this
style can be used to set color specifications. This
mechanism replaces the use of the ZLS_COLORS and ZLS_COLOURS
parameters described in the sec- tion The zsh/complist
Module in zshmodules(1), but the syntax is the same.</p>

<p>If this style is set for the default tag, the strings in
the value are taken as specifications that are to be used
every- where. If it is set for other tags, the
specifications are used only for matches of the type
described by the tag. For this to work best, the group-name
style must be set to an empty string.</p>

<p>In addition to setting styles for specific tags, it is
also pos- sible to use group names specified explicitly by
the group-name tag together with the (group) syntax allowed
by the ZLS_COLORS and ZLS_COLOURS parameters and simply
using the default tag.</p>

<p>It is possible to use any color specifications already
set up for the GNU version of the ls command:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:default list-colors
${(s.:.)LS_COLORS}</p>

<p>The default colors are the same as for the GNU ls
command and can be obtained by setting the style to an empty
string (i.e. ).</p>

<p>list-dirs-first This is used by file completion. If set,
directories to be com- pleted are listed separately from and
before completion for other files, regardless of tag
ordering. In addition, the tag other-files is used in place
of all-files for the remaining files, to indicate that no
directories are presented with that tag.</p>

<p>list-grouped If this style is true (the default), the
completion system will try to make certain completion
listings more compact by grouping matches. For example,
options for commands that have the same description (shown
when the verbose style is set to true ) will appear as a
single entry. However, menu selection can be used to cycle
through all the matches.</p>

<p>list-packed This is tested for each tag valid in the
current context as well as the default tag. If it is set to
true, the corresponding matches appear in listings as if the
LIST_PACKED option were set. If it is set to false, they are
listed normally.</p>

<p>list-prompt If this style is set for the default tag,
completion lists that don t fit on the screen can be
scrolled (see the description of the zsh/complist module in
zshmodules(1)). The value, if not the empty string, will be
displayed after every screenful and the shell will prompt
for a key press; if the style is set to the empty string, a
default prompt will be used.</p>

<p>The value may contain the escape sequences: %l or %L,
which will be replaced by the number of the last line
displayed and the total number of lines; %m or %M, the
number of the last match shown and the total number of
matches; and %p and %P, Top when at the beginning of the
list, Bottom when at the end and the position shown as a
percentage of the total length otherwise. In each case the
form with the uppercase letter will be replaced by a string
of fixed width, padded to the right with spaces, while the
lowercase form will be replaced by a variable width string.
As in other prompt strings, the escape sequences %S , %s,
%B, %b, %U, %u for entering and leaving the display modes
standout, bold and underline, and %F , %f , %K , %k for
changing the foreground background colour, are also
available, as is the form %{...%} for enclos- ing escape
sequences which display with zero (or, with a numeric
argument, some other) width.</p>

<p>After deleting this prompt the variable LISTPROMPT
should be unset for the the removal to take effect.</p>

<p>list-rows-first This style is tested in the same way as
the list-packed style and determines whether matches are to
be listed in a rows-first fashion as if the LIST_ROWS_FIRST
option were set.</p>

<p>list-suffixes This style is used by the function that
completes filenames. If it is true, and completion is
attempted on a string containing multiple partially typed
pathname components, all ambiguous com- ponents will be
shown. Otherwise, completion stops at the first ambiguous
component.</p>

<p>list-separator The value of this style is used in
completion listing to sepa- rate the string to complete from
a description when possible (e.g. when completing options).
It defaults to -- (two hyphens).</p>

<p>local This is for use with functions that complete URLs
for which the corresponding files are available directly
from the file system. Its value should consist of three
strings: a hostname, the path to the default web pages for
the server, and the directory name used by a user placing
web pages within their home area.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* local toast /var/http/public/toast
public_html</p>

<p>Completion after http://toast/stuff/ will look for files
in the directory /var/http/public/toast/stuff, while
completion after http://toast/~yousir/ will look for files
in the direc- tory ~yousir/public_html.</p>

<p>mail-directory If set, zsh will assume that mailbox
files can be found in the directory specified. It defaults
to ~/Mail.</p>

<p>match-original This is used by the _match completer. If
it is set to only, _match will try to generate matches
without inserting a * at the cursor position. If set to any
other non-empty value, it will first try to generate matches
without inserting the * and if that yields no matches, it
will try again with the * inserted. If it is unset or set to
the empty string, matching will only be performed with the *
inserted.</p>

<p>matcher This style is tested separately for each tag
valid in the cur- rent context. Its value is added to any
match specifications given by the matcher-list style. It
should be in the form described in the section Completion
Matching Control in zshcompwid(1).</p>

<p>matcher-list This style can be set to a list of match
specifications that are to be applied everywhere. Match
specifications are described in the section Completion
Matching Control in zshcompwid(1). The completion system
will try them one after another for each com- pleter
selected. For example, to try first simple completion and,
if that generates no matches, case-insensitive
completion:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* matcher-list
m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}</p>

<p>By default each specification replaces the previous one;
how- ever, if a specification is prefixed with +, it is
added to the existing list. Hence it is possible to create
increasingly gen- eral specifications without
repetition:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*matcher-lis+m{a-z}={A-Z}
+m{A-Z}={a-z}</p>

<p>It is possible to create match specifications valid for
particu- lar completers by using the third field of the
context. For example, to use the completers _complete and
_prefix but only allow case-insensitive completion with
_complete:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* completer _complete _prefix
zstyle:completion:*:complete:* matcher-list
m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}</p>

<p>User-defined names, as explained for the completer
style, are available. This makes it possible to try the same
completer more than once with different match specifications
each time. For example, to try normal completion without a
match specifica- tion, then normal completion with
case-insensitive matching, then correction, and finally
partial-word completion:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* completer _complete _correct
_complete:foo zstyle:completion:*:complete:* matcher-list
m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z} zstyle :completion:*:foo:* matcher-list
m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z} r:|[-_./]=* r:|=*</p>

<p>If the style is unset in any context no match
specification is applied. Note also that some completers
such as _correct and _approximate do not use the match
specifications at all, though these completers will only
ever be called once even if the matcher-list contains more
than one element.</p>

<p>Where multiple specifications are useful, note that the
entire completion is done for each element of matcher-list,
which can quickly reduce the shells performance. As a rough
rule of thumb, one to three strings will give acceptable
performance. On the other hand, putting multiple
space-separated values into the same string does not have an
appreciable impact on perfor- mance.</p>

<p>If there is no current matcher or it is empty, and the
option NO_CASE_GLOB is in effect, the matching for files is
performed case-insensitively in any case. However, any
matcher must explicitly specify case-insensitive matching if
that is required.</p>

<p>max-errors This is used by the _approximate and _correct
completer func- tions to determine the maximum number of
errors to allow. The completer will try to generate
completions by first allowing one error, then two errors,
and so on, until either a match or matches were found or the
maximum number of errors given by this style has been
reached.</p>

<p>If the value for this style contains the string numeric,
the completer function will take any numeric argument as the
maximum number of errors allowed. For example, with</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*:approximate:::max-errors 2
numeric</p>

<p>two errors are allowed if no numeric argument is given,
but with a numeric argument of six (as in ESC-6 TAB), up to
six errors are accepted. Hence with a value of 0 numeric, no
correcting completion will be attempted unless a numeric
argument is given.</p>

<p>If the value contains the string not-numeric, the
completer will not try to generate corrected completions
when given a numeric argument, so in this case the number
given should be greater than zero. For example, 2
not-numeric specifies that correcting completion with two
errors will usually be performed, but if a numeric argument
is given, correcting completion will not be performed.</p>

<p>The default value for this style is 2 numeric.</p>

<p>max-matches-width This style is used to determine the
trade off between the width of the display used for matches
and the width used for their descriptions when the verbose
style is in effect. The value gives the number of display
columns to reserve for the matches. The default is half the
width of the screen.</p>

<p>This has the most impact when several matches have the
same description and so will be grouped together. Increasing
the style will allow more matches to be grouped together;
decreasing it will allow more of the description to be
visible.</p>

<p>menu If this is true in the context of any of the tags
defined for the current completion menu completion will be
used. The value for a specific tag will take precedence over
that for the default tag.</p>

<p>If none of the values found in this way is true but at
least one is set to auto, the shell behaves as if the
AUTO_MENU option is set.</p>

<p>If one of the values is explicitly set to false, menu
completion will be explicitly turned off, overriding the
MENU_COMPLETE option and other settings.</p>

<p>In the form yes=num, where yes may be any of the true
values (yes, true, on and 1 ), menu completion will be
turned on if there are at least num matches. In the form
yes=long, menu completion will be turned on if the list does
not fit on the screen. This does not activate menu
completion if the widget normally only lists completions,
but menu completion can be activated in that case with the
value yes=long-list (Typi- cally, the value select=long-list
described later is more use- ful as it provides control over
scrolling.)</p>

<p>Similarly, with any of the false values (as in no=10),
menu completion will not be used if there are num or more
matches.</p>

<p>The value of this widget also controls menu selection,
as imple- mented by the zsh/complist module. The following
values may appear either alongside or instead of the values
above.</p>

<p>If the value contains the string select , menu selection
will be started unconditionally.</p>

<p>In the form select=num, menu selection will only be
started if there are at least num matches. If the values for
more than one tag provide a number, the smallest number is
taken.</p>

<p>Menu selection can be turned off explicitly by defining
a value containing the stringno-select.</p>

<p>It is also possible to start menu selection only if the
list of matches does not fit on the screen by using the
value select=long . To start menu selection even if the
current wid- get only performs listing, use the value
select=long-list.</p>

<p>To turn on menu completion or menu selection when a
there are a certain number of matches or the list of matches
does not fit on the screen, both of yes= and select= may be
given twice, once with a number and once with long or
long-list.</p>

<p>Finally, it is possible to activate two special modes of
menu selection. The word interactive in the value causes
interactive mode to be entered immediately when menu
selection is started; see the description of the
zsh/complist module in zshmodules(1) for a description of
interactive mode. Including the string search does the same
for incremental search mode. To select backward incremental
search, include the string search-backward.</p>

<p>muttrc If set, gives the location of the mutt
configuration file. It defaults to ~/.muttrc.</p>

<p>numbers This is used with the jobs tag. If it is true,
the shell will complete job numbers instead of the shortest
unambiguous prefix of the job command text. If the value is
a number, job numbers will only be used if that many words
from the job descriptions are required to resolve
ambiguities. For example, if the value is 1, strings will
only be used if all jobs differ in the first word on their
command lines.</p>

<p>old-list This is used by the _oldlist completer. If it
is set to always, then standard widgets which perform
listing will retain the current list of matches, however
they were generated; this can be turned off explicitly with
the value never, giving the behaviour without the _oldlist
completer. If the style is unset, or any other value, then
the existing list of completions is displayed if it is not
already; otherwise, the standard com- pletion list is
generated; this is the default behaviour of _oldlist.
However, if there is an old list and this style con- tains
the name of the completer function that generated the list,
then the old list will be used even if it was generated by a
widget which does not do listing.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you type ^Xc to use the
_correct_word wid- get, which generates a list of
corrections for the word under the cursor. Usually, typing
^D would generate a standard list of completions for the
word on the command line, and show that. With _oldlist, it
will instead show the list of corrections already
generated.</p>

<p>As another example consider the _match completer: with
the insert-unambiguous style set to true it inserts only a
common prefix string, if there is any. However, this may
remove parts of the original pattern, so that further
completion could pro- duce more matches than on the first
attempt. By using the _oldlist completer and setting this
style to _match, the list of matches generated on the first
attempt will be used again.</p>

<p>old-matches This is used by the _all_matches completer
to decide if an old list of matches should be used if one
exists. This is selected by one of the true values or by the
string only . If the value is only, _all_matches will only
use an old list and wont have any effect on the list of
matches currently being generated.</p>

<p>If this style is set it is generally unwise to call the
_all_matches completer unconditionally. One possible use is
for either this style or the completer style to be defined
with the -e option to zstyle to make the style
conditional.</p>

<p>old-menu This is used by the _oldlist completer. It
controls how menu completion behaves when a completion has
already been inserted and the user types a standard
completion key such as TAB. The default behaviour of
_oldlist is that menu completion always continues with the
existing list of completions. If this style is set to false
, however, a new completion is started if the old list was
generated by a different completion command; this is the
behaviour without the _oldlist completer.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you type ^Xc to generate a list of
correc- tions, and menu completion is started in one of the
usual ways. Usually, or with this style set to false, typing
TAB at this point would start trying to complete the line as
it now appears. With _oldlist, it instead continues to cycle
through the list of corrections.</p>

<p>original This is used by the _approximate and _correct
completers to decide if the original string should be added
as a possible com- pletion. Normally, this is done only if
there are at least two possible corrections, but if this
style is set to true, it is always added. Note that the
style will be examined with the completer field in the
context name set to correct-num or approximate-num, where
num is the number of errors that were accepted.</p>

<p>packageset This style is used when completing arguments
of the Debian dpkg program. It contains an override for the
default package set for a given context. For example,</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:complete:dpkg:option--status-1:*
packageset avail</p>

<p>causes available packages, rather than only installed
packages, to be completed for dpkg --status.</p>

<p>path The function that completes color names uses this
style with the colors tag. The value should be the pathname
of a file contain- ing color names in the format of an X11
rgb.txt file. If the style is not set but this file is found
in one of various stan- dard locations it will be used as
the default.</p>

<p>path-completion This is used by filename completion. By
default, filename com- pletion examines all components of a
path to see if there are completions of that component. For
example, /u/b/z can be com- pleted to /usr/bin/zsh.
Explicitly setting this style to false inhibits this
behaviour for path components up to the / before the cursor;
this overrides the setting of accept-exact-dirs.</p>

<p>Even with the style set to false, it is still possible
to com- plete multiple paths by setting the option
COMPLETE_IN_WORD and moving the cursor back to the first
component in the path to be completed. For example, /u/b/z
can be completed to /usr/bin/zsh if the cursor is after the
/u.</p>

<p>pine-directory If set, specifies the directory
containing PINE mailbox files. There is no default, since
recursively searching this directory is inconvenient for
anyone who doesnt use PINE.</p>

<p>ports A list of Internet service names (network ports)
to complete. If this is not set, service names are taken
from the file /etc/services.</p>

<p>prefix-hidden This is used for certain completions which
share a common pre- fix, for example command options
beginning with dashes. If it is true, the prefix will not be
shown in the list of matches.</p>

<p>The default value for this style is false.</p>

<p>prefix-needed This, too, is used for matches with a
common prefix. If it is set to true this common prefix must
be typed by the user to generate the matches. In the case of
command options, this means that the initial -, +, or --
must be typed explic- itly before option names will be
completed.</p>

<p>The default value for this style is true.</p>

<p>preserve-prefix This style is used when completing path
names. Its value should be a pattern matching an initial
prefix of the word to complete that should be left unchanged
under all circumstances. For example, on some Unices an
initial // (double slash) has a special meaning; setting
this style to the string // will pre- serve it. As another
example, setting this style to ?:/ under Cygwin would allow
completion after a:/... and so on.</p>

<p>range This is used by the _history completer and the
_history_com- plete_word bindable command to decide which
words should be completed.</p>

<p>If it is a singe number, only the last N words from the
history will be completed.</p>

<p>If it is a range of the form max:slice , the last slice
words will be completed; then if that yields no matches, the
slice words before those will be tried and so on. This
process stops either when at least one match was been found,
or max words have been tried.</p>

<p>The default is to complete all words from the history at
once.</p>

<p>regular This style is used by the _expand_alias
completer and bindable command. If set to true (the
default), regular aliases will be expanded but only in
command position. If it is set to false, regular aliases
will never be expanded. If it is set to always, regular
aliases will be expanded even if not in command
position.</p>

<p>rehash If this is set when completing external commands,
the internal list (hash) of commands will be updated for
each search by issu- ing the rehash command. There is a
speed penalty for this which is only likely to be noticeable
when directories in the path have slow file access.</p>

<p>remote-access If set to false, certain commands will be
prevented from making Internet connections to retrieve
remote information. This includes the completion for the CVS
command.</p>

<p>It is not always possible to know if connections are in
fact to a remote site, so some may be prevented
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>remove-all-dups The _history_complete_word bindable
command and the _history completer use this to decide if all
duplicate matches should be removed, rather than just
consecutive duplicates.</p>

<p>select-prompt If this is set for the default tag, its
value will be displayed during menu selection (see the menu
style above) when the com- pletion list does not fit on the
screen as a whole. The same escapes as for the list-prompt
style are understood, except that the numbers refer to the
match or line the mark is on. A default prompt is used when
the value is the empty string.</p>

<p>select-scroll This style is tested for the default tag
and determines how a completion list is scrolled during a
menu selection (see the menu style above) when the
completion list does not fit on the screen as a whole. If
the value is 0 (zero), the list is scrolled by
half-screenfuls; if it is a positive integer, the list is
scrolled by the given number of lines; if it is a nega- tive
number, the list is scrolled by a screenful minus the abso-
lute value of the given number of lines. The default is to
scroll by single lines.</p>

<p>separate-sections This style is used with the manuals
tag when completing names of manual pages. If it is true ,
entries for different sections are added separately using
tag names of the form manual.X, where X is the section
number. When the group-name style is also in effect, pages
from different sections will appear sepa- rately. This style
is also used similarly with the words style when completing
words for the dict command. It allows words from different
dictionary databases to be added separately. The default for
this style is false.</p>

<p>show-completer Tested whenever a new completer is tried.
If it is true, the completion system outputs a progress
message in the listing area showing what completer is being
tried. The message will be overwritten by any output when
completions are found and is removed after completion is
finished.</p>

<p>single-ignored This is used by the _ignored completer
when there is only one match. If its value is show, the
single match will be displayed but not inserted. If the
value is menu, then the single match and the original string
are both added as matches and menu completion is started,
making it easy to select either of them.</p>

<p>sort Many completion widgets call _description at some
point which decides whether the matches are added sorted or
unsorted (often indirectly via _wanted or _requested). This
style can be set explicitly to one of the usual true or
false values as an over- ride. If it is not set for the
context, the standard behaviour of the calling widget is
used.</p>

<p>The style is tested first against the full context
including the tag, and if that fails to produce a value
against the context without the tag.</p>

<p>If the calling widget explicitly requests unsorted
matches, this is usually honoured. However, the default
(unsorted) behaviour of completion for the command history
may be overridden by set- ting the style to true.</p>

<p>In the _expand completer, if it is set to true, the
expansions generated will always be sorted. If it is set to
menu, then the expansions are only sorted when they are
offered as single strings but not in the string containing
all possible expan- sions.</p>

<p>special-dirs Normally, the completion code will not
produce the directory names . and .. as possible
completions. If this style is set to true, it will add both
. and .. as possible comple- tions; if it is set to .., only
.. will be added.</p>

<p>The following example sets special-dirs to .. when the
current prefix is empty, is a single ., or consists only of
a path beginning with ../. Otherwise the value is false
.</p>

<p>zstyle -e :completion:* special-dirs [[ $PREFIX =
(../)#(|.|..) ]] &amp;&amp; reply=(..)</p>

<p>squeeze-slashes If set to true, sequences of slashes in
filename paths (for example in foo//bar) will be treated as
a single slash. This is the usual behaviour of UNIX paths.
However, by default the file completion function behaves as
if there were a * between the slashes.</p>

<p>stop If set to true , the _history_complete_word
bindable command will stop once when reaching the beginning
or end of the his- tory. Invoking _history_complete_word
will then wrap around to the opposite end of the history. If
this style is set to false (the default),
_history_complete_word will loop immedi- ately as in a menu
completion.</p>

<p>strip-comments If set to true, this style causes
non-essential comment text to be removed from completion
matches. Currently it is only used when completing e-mail
addresses where it removes any dis- play name from the
addresses, cutting them down to plain user@host form.</p>

<p>subst-globs-only This is used by the _expand completer.
If it is set to true, the expansion will only be used if it
resulted from globbing; hence, if expansions resulted from
the use of the substitute style described below, but these
were not further changed by globbing, the expansions will be
rejected.</p>

<p>The default for this style is false.</p>

<p>substitute This boolean style controls whether the
_expand completer will first try to expand all substitutions
in the string (such as $(...) and ${...}).</p>

<p>The default is true.</p>

<p>suffix This is used by the _expand completer if the word
starts with a tilde or contains a parameter expansion. If it
is set to true, the word will only be expanded if it doesn t
have a suffix, i.e. if it is something like ~foo or $foo
rather than ~foo/ or $foo/bar, unless that suffix itself
contains characters eligible for expansion. The default for
this style is true.</p>

<p>tag-order This provides a mechanism for sorting how the
tags available in a particular context will be used.</p>

<p>The values for the style are sets of space-separated
lists of tags. The tags in each value will be tried at the
same time; if no match is found, the next value is used.
(See the file-pat- terns style for an exception to this
behavior.)</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:complete:-command-:* tag-order
commands functions</p>

<p>specifies that completion in command position first
offers external commands and shell functions. Remaining tags
will be tried if no completions are found.</p>

<p>In addition to tag names, each string in the value may
take one of the following forms:</p>

<p>- If any value consists of only a hyphen, then only the
tags specified in the other values are generated. Nor- mally
all tags not explicitly selected are tried last if the
specified tags fail to generate any matches. This means that
a single value consisting only of a single hyphen turns off
completion.</p>

<p>! tags... A string starting with an exclamation mark
specifies names of tags that are not to be used. The effect
is the same as if all other possible tags for the context
had been listed.</p>

<p>tag:label ... Here, tag is one of the standard tags and
label is an arbitrary name. Matches are generated as normal
but the name label is used in contexts instead of tag. This
is not useful in words starting with !.</p>

<p>If the label starts with a hyphen, the tag is prepended
to the label to form the name used for lookup. This can be
used to make the completion system try a certain tag more
than once, supplying different style settings for each
attempt; see below for an example.</p>

<p>tag:label:description As before, but description will
replace the %d in the value of the format style instead of
the default descrip- tion supplied by the completion
function. Spaces in the description must be quoted with a
backslash. A %d appearing in description is replaced with
the description given by the completion function.</p>

<p>In any of the forms above the tag may be a pattern or
several patterns in the form {pat1,pat2...}. In this case
all match- ing tags will be used except for any given
explicitly in the same string.</p>

<p>One use of these features is to try one tag more than
once, set- ting other styles differently on each attempt,
but still to use all the other tags without having to repeat
them all. For exam- ple, to make completion of function
names in command position ignore all the completion
functions starting with an underscore the first time
completion is tried:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:*:-command-:*tag-order
functions:-non-comp *functions zstyle
:completion:*:functions-non-comp ignored-patterns_*</p>

<p>On the first attempt, all tags will be offered but the
functions tag will be replaced by functions-non-comp. The
ignored-pat- terns style is set for this tag to exclude
functions starting with an underscore. If there are no
matches, the second value of the tag-order style is used
which completes functions using the default tag, this time
presumably including all function names.</p>

<p>The matches for one tag can be split into different
groups. For example:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* tag-order options:-long:longoptions
options:-short:shortoptions
options:-single-letter:singleletteroptions</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:*:options-long ignored-patterns
[-+](|-|[^-]*) zstyle :completion:*:options-short
ignored-patterns --* [-+]? zstyle
:completion:*:options-single-letter ignored-patterns
???*</p>

<p>With the group-names style set, options beginning with
--, options beginning with a single - or + but containing
multi- ple characters, and single-letter options will be
displayed in separate groups with different
descriptions.</p>

<p>Another use of patterns is to try multiple match
specifications one after another. The matcher-list style
offers something sim- ilar, but it is tested very early in
the completion system and hence can t be set for single
commands nor for more specific contexts. Here is how to try
normal completion without any match specification and, if
that generates no matches, try again with case-insensitive
matching, restricting the effect to argu- ments of the
command foo:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*:*:foo:*tag-order*:-case
zstyle:completion:*-casematcherm:{a-z}={A-Z}</p>

<p>First, all the tags offered when completing after foo
are tried using the normal tag name. If that generates no
matches, the second value of tag-order is used, which tries
all tags again except that this time each has -case appended
to its name for lookup of styles. Hence this time the value
for the matcher style from the second call to zstyle in the
example is used to make completion case-insensitive.</p>

<p>It is possible to use the -e option of the zstyle
builtin com- mand to specify conditions for the use of
particular tags. For example:</p>

<p>zstyle -e*:-command-:*tag-order if [[ -n $PREFIX$SUFFIX
]]; then reply=( ) else reply=( - ) fi</p>

<p>Completion in command position will be attempted only if
the string typed so far is not empty. This is tested using
the PRE- FIX special parameter; see zshcompwid for a
description of parameters which are special inside
completion widgets. Setting reply to an empty array provides
the default behaviour of trying all tags at once; setting it
to an array containing only a hyphen disables the use of all
tags and hence of all comple- tions.</p>

<p>If no tag-order style has been defined for a context,
the strings (|*-)argument-* (|*-)option-* values and options
plus all tags offered by the completion function will be
used to provide a sensible default behavior that causes
arguments (whether normal command arguments or arguments of
options) to be completed before option names for most
commands.</p>

<p>urls This is used together with the the urls tag by
functions com- pleting URLs.</p>

<p>If the value consists of more than one string, or if the
only string does not name a file or directory, the strings
are used as the URLs to complete.</p>

<p>If the value contains only one string which is the name
of a normal file the URLs are taken from that file (where
the URLs may be separated by white space or newlines).</p>

<p>Finally, if the only string in the value names a
directory, the directory hierarchy rooted at this directory
gives the completions. The top level directory should be the
file access method, such as http, ftp, bookmark and so on.
In many cases the next level of directories will be a
filename. The directory hierarchy can descend as deep as
necessary.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*urls ~/.urls mkdir -p
~/.urls/ftp/ftp.zsh.org/pub/development</p>

<p>allows completion of all the components of the URL
ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development after suitable commands
such as netscape or lynx. Note, however, that access methods
and files are completed separately, so if the hosts style is
set hosts can be completed without reference to the urls
style.</p>

<p>See the description in the function _urls itself for
more infor- mation (e.g. more $^fpath/_urls(N)).</p>

<p>use-cache If this is set, the completion caching layer
is activated for any completions which use it (via the
_store_cache, _retrieve_cache, and _cache_invalid
functions). The directory containing the cache files can be
changed with the cache-path style.</p>

<p>use-compctl If this style is set to a string not equal
to false, 0, no, and off, the completion system may use any
completion specifications defined with the compctl builtin
command. If the style is unset, this is done only if the
zsh/compctl module is loaded. The string may also contain
the substring first to use comple- tions defined with
compctl -T, and the substring default to use the completion
defined with compctl -D.</p>

<p>Note that this is only intended to smooth the transition
from compctl to the new completion system and may disappear
in the future.</p>

<p>Note also that the definitions from compctl will only be
used if there is no specific completion function for the
command in question. For example, if there is a function
_foo to complete arguments to the command foo, compctl will
never be invoked for foo. However, the compctl version will
be tried if foo only uses default completion.</p>

<p>use-ip By default, the function _hosts that completes
host names strips IP addresses from entries read from host
databases such as NIS and ssh files. If this style is true,
the corresponding IP addresses can be completed as well.
This style is not use in any context where the hosts style
is set; note also it must be set before the cache of host
names is generated (typically the first completion
attempt).</p>

<p>use-perl Various parts of the function system use awk to
extract words from files or command output as it is
universally available. However, many versions of awk have
arbitrary limits on the size of input. If this style is set,
perl will be used instead. This is almost always preferable
if perl is available on your system.</p>

<p>Currently this is only used in completions for make, but
it may be extended depending on authorial frustration.</p>

<p>users This may be set to a list of usernames to be
completed. If it is not set all usernames will be completed.
Note that if it is set only that list of users will be
completed; this is because on some systems querying all
users can take a prohibitive amount of time.</p>

<p>users-hosts The values of this style should be of the
form user@host or user:host. It is used for commands that
need pairs of user- and hostnames. These commands will
complete usernames from this style (only), and will restrict
subsequent hostname completion to hosts paired with that
user in one of the values of the style.</p>

<p>It is possible to group values for sets of commands
which allow a remote login, such as rlogin and ssh, by using
the my-accounts tag. Similarly, values for sets of commands
which usually refer to the accounts of other people, such as
talk and finger, can be grouped by using the other-accounts
tag. More ambivalent com- mands may use the accounts
tag.</p>

<p>users-hosts-ports Like users-hosts but used for commands
like telnet and contain- ing strings of the form
user@host:port.</p>

<p>verbose If set, as it is by default, the completion
listing is more ver- bose. In particular many commands show
descriptions for options if this style is true.</p>

<p>word This is used by the _list completer, which prevents
the inser- tion of completions until a second completion
attempt when the line has not changed. The normal way of
finding out if the line has changed is to compare its entire
contents between the two occasions. If this style is true,
the comparison is instead performed only on the current
word. Hence if completion is per- formed on another word
with the same contents, completion will not be delayed.</p>

<p>CONTROL FUNCTIONS The initialization script compinit
redefines all the widgets which per- form completion to call
the supplied widget function _main_complete. This function
acts as a wrapper calling the so-called completer func-
tions that generate matches. If _main_complete is called
with argu- ments, these are taken as the names of completer
functions to be called in the order given. If no arguments
are given, the set of functions to try is taken from the
completer style. For example, to use normal com- pletion and
correction if that doesn t generate any matches:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*completer _complete _correct</p>

<p>after calling compinit. The default value for this style
is _complete _ignored, i.e. normally only ordinary
completion is tried, first with the effect of the
ignored-patterns style and then without it. The
_main_complete function uses the return status of the
completer func- tions to decide if other completers should
be called. If the return status is zero, no other completers
are tried and the _main_complete function returns.</p>

<p>If the first argument to _main_complete is a single
hyphen, the argu- ments will not be taken as names of
completers. Instead, the second argument gives a name to use
in the completer field of the context and the other
arguments give a command name and arguments to call to
gener- ate the matches.</p>

<p>The following completer functions are contained in the
distribution, although users may write their own. Note that
in contexts the leading underscore is stripped, for example
basic completion is performed in the context
:completion::complete:....</p>

<p>_all_matches This completer can be used to add a string
consisting of all other matches. As it influences later
completers it must appear as the first completer in the
list. The list of all matches is affected by the
avoid-completer and old-matches styles described above.</p>

<p>It may be useful to use the _generic function described
below to bind _all_matches to its own keystroke, for
example:</p>

<p>zle -C all-matches complete-word _generic
bindkey^Xaall-matches zstyle:completion:all-matches:*
old-matches only zstyle :completion:all-matches::::completer
_all_matches</p>

<p>Note that this does not generate completions by itself:
first use any of the standard ways of generating a list of
comple- tions, then use ^Xa to show all matches. It is
possible instead to add a standard completer to the list and
request that the list of all matches should be directly
inserted:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:all-matches:::: completer _all_matches
_complete zstyle:completion:all-matches:*insert true</p>

<p>In this case the old-matches style should not be
set.</p>

<p>_approximate This is similar to the basic _complete
completer but allows the completions to undergo corrections.
The maximum number of errors can be specified by the
max-errors style; see the description of approximate
matching in zshexpn(1) for how errors are counted. Normally
this completer will only be tried after the normal _complete
completer:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* completer _complete
_approximate</p>

<p>This will give correcting completion if and only if
normal com- pletion yields no possible completions. When
corrected comple- tions are found, the completer will
normally start menu comple- tion allowing you to cycle
through these strings.</p>

<p>This completer uses the tags corrections and original
when gen- erating the possible corrections and the original
string. The format style for the former may contain the
additional sequences %e and %o which will be replaced by the
number of errors accepted to generate the corrections and
the original string, respectively.</p>

<p>The completer progressively increases the number of
errors allowed up to the limit by the max-errors style,
hence if a com- pletion is found with one error, no
completions with two errors will be shown, and so on. It
modifies the completer name in the context to indicate the
number of errors being tried: on the first try the completer
field contains approximate-1, on the second try
approximate-2, and so on.</p>

<p>When _approximate is called from another function, the
number of errors to accept may be passed with the -a option.
The argument is in the same format as the max-errors style,
all in one string.</p>

<p>Note that this completer (and the _correct completer
mentioned below) can be quite expensive to call, especially
when a large number of errors are allowed. One way to avoid
this is to set up the completer style using the -e option to
zstyle so that some completers are only used when completion
is attempted a second time on the same string, e.g.:</p>

<p>zstyle -e:completion:*completer if [[ $_last_try !=
&quot;$HISTNO$BUFFER$CURSOR&quot; ]]; then
_last_try=&quot;$HISTNO$BUFFER$CURSOR&quot; reply=(_complete
_match _prefix) else reply=(_ignored _correct _approximate)
fi</p>

<p>This uses the HISTNO parameter and the BUFFER and CURSOR
special parameters that are available inside zle and
completion widgets to find out if the command line hasnt
changed since the last time completion was tried. Only then
are the _ignored, _correct and _approximate completers
called.</p>

<p>_complete This completer generates all possible
completions in a con- text-sensitive manner, i.e. using the
settings defined with the compdef function explained above
and the current settings of all special parameters. This
gives the normal completion behaviour.</p>

<p>To complete arguments of commands, _complete uses the
utility function _normal, which is in turn responsible for
finding the particular function; it is described below.
Various contexts of the form -context- are handled
specifically. These are all men- tioned above as possible
arguments to the #compdef tag.</p>

<p>Before trying to find a function for a specific context,
_com- plete checks if the parameter compcontext is set.
Setting compcontext allows the usual completion dispatching
to be overridden which is useful in places such as a
function that uses vared for input. If it is set to an
array, the elements are taken to be the possible matches
which will be completed using the tag values and the
description value. If it is set to an associative array, the
keys are used as the possible completions and the values (if
non-empty) are used as descriptions for the matches. If
compcontext is set to a string containing colons, it should
be of the form tag:descr:action. In this case the tag and
descr give the tag and description to use and the action
indicates what should be completed in one of the forms
accepted by the _arguments utility function described
below.</p>

<p>Finally, if compcontext is set to a string without
colons, the value is taken as the name of the context to use
and the func- tion defined for that context will be called.
For this purpose, there is a special context named
-command-line- that completes whole command lines (commands
and their arguments). This is not used by the completion
system itself but is nonetheless handled when explicitly
called.</p>

<p>_correct Generate corrections, but not completions, for
the current word; this is similar to _approximate but will
not allow any number of extra characters at the cursor as
that completer does. The effect is similar to
spell-checking. It is based on _approxi- mate, but the
completer field in the context name is correct.</p>

<p>For example, with:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:::::completer _complete _correct
_approximate zstyle:completion:*:correct::: max-errors 2
not-numeric zstyle:completion:*:approximate:::max-errors 3
numeric</p>

<p>correction will accept up to two errors. If a numeric
argument is given, correction will not be performed, but
correcting com- pletion will be, and will accept as many
errors as given by the numeric argument. Without a numeric
argument, first correction and then correcting completion
will be tried, with the first one accepting two errors and
the second one accepting three errors.</p>

<p>When _correct is called as a function, the number of
errors to accept may be given following the -a option. The
argument is in the same form a values to the accept style,
all in one string.</p>

<p>This completer function is intended to be used without
the _approximate completer or, as in the example, just
before it. Using it after the _approximate completer is
useless since _approximate will at least generate the
corrected strings gener- ated by the _correct completer --
and probably more.</p>

<p>_expand This completer function does not really perform
completion, but instead checks if the word on the command
line is eligible for expansion and, if it is, gives detailed
control over how this expansion is done. For this to happen,
the completion system needs to be invoked with
complete-word, not expand-or-complete (the default binding
for TAB), as otherwise the string will be expanded by the
shells internal mechanism before the completion system is
started. Note also this completer should be called before
the _complete completer function.</p>

<p>The tags used when generating expansions are
all-expansions for the string containing all possible
expansions, expansions when adding the possible expansions
as single matches and original when adding the original
string from the line. The order in which these strings are
generated, if at all, can be controlled by the group-order
and tag-order styles, as usual.</p>

<p>The format string for all-expansions and for expansions
may con- tain the sequence %o which will be replaced by the
original string from the line.</p>

<p>The kind of expansion to be tried is controlled by the
substi- tute, glob and subst-globs-only styles.</p>

<p>It is also possible to call _expand as a function, in
which case the different modes may be selected with options:
-s for substi- tute, -g for glob and -o for
subst-globs-only.</p>

<p>_expand_alias If the word the cursor is on is an alias,
it is expanded and no other completers are called. The types
of aliases which are to be expanded can be controlled with
the styles regular, global and disabled.</p>

<p>This function is also a bindable command, see the
section Bind- able Commands below.</p>

<p>_history Complete words from the shell s command
history. This com- pleter can be controlled by the
remove-all-dups, and sort styles as for the
_history_complete_word bindable command, see the sec- tion
Bindable Commands below and the section Completion Sys- tem
Configuration above.</p>

<p>_ignored The ignored-patterns style can be set to a list
of patterns which are compared against possible completions;
matching ones are removed. With this completer those matches
can be rein- stated, as if no ignored-patterns style were
set. The completer actually generates its own list of
matches; which completers are invoked is determined in the
same way as for the _prefix com- pleter. The single-ignored
style is also available as described above.</p>

<p>_list This completer allows the insertion of matches to
be delayed until completion is attempted a second time
without the word on the line being changed. On the first
attempt, only the list of matches will be shown. It is
affected by the styles condition and word, see the section
Completion System Configuration above.</p>

<p>_match This completer is intended to be used after the
_complete com- pleter. It behaves similarly but the string
on the command line may be a pattern to match against trial
completions. This gives the effect of the GLOB_COMPLETE
option.</p>

<p>Normally completion will be performed by taking the
pattern from the line, inserting a * at the cursor position
and comparing the resulting pattern with the possible
completions generated. This can be modified with the
match-original style described above.</p>

<p>The generated matches will be offered in a menu
completion unless the insert-unambiguous style is set to
true; see the description above for other options for this
style.</p>

<p>Note that matcher specifications defined globally or
used by the completion functions (the styles matcher-list
and matcher) will not be used.</p>

<p>_menu This completer was written as simple example
function to show how menu completion can be enabled in shell
code. However, it has the notable effect of disabling menu
selection which can be useful with _generic based widgets.
It should be used as the first completer in the list. Note
that this is independent of the setting of the MENU_COMPLETE
option and does not work with the other menu completion
widgets such as reverse-menu-complete, or
accept-and-menu-complete.</p>

<p>_oldlist This completer controls how the standard
completion widgets behave when there is an existing list of
completions which may have been generated by a special
completion (i.e. a sepa- rately-bound completion command).
It allows the ordinary com- pletion keys to continue to use
the list of completions thus generated, instead of producing
a new list of ordinary contex- tual completions. It should
appear in the list of completers before any of the widgets
which generate matches. It uses two styles: old-list and
old-menu, see the section Completion Sys- tem Configuration
above.</p>

<p>_prefix This completer can be used to try completion
with the suffix (everything after the cursor) ignored. In
other words, the suf- fix will not be considered to be part
of the word to complete. The effect is similar to the
expand-or-complete-prefix command.</p>

<p>The completer style is used to decide which other
completers are to be called to generate matches. If this
style is unset, the list of completers set for the current
context is used -- except, of course, the _prefix completer
itself. Furthermore, if this completer appears more than
once in the list of com- pleters only those completers not
already tried by the last invocation of _prefix will be
called.</p>

<p>For example, consider this global completer style:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* completer _complete _prefix
_correct _prefix:foo</p>

<p>Here, the _prefix completer tries normal completion but
ignoring the suffix. If that doesnt generate any matches,
and neither does the call to the _correct completer after
it, _prefix will be called a second time and, now only
trying correction with the suffix ignored. On the second
invocation the completer part of the context appears as
foo.</p>

<p>To use _prefix as the last resort and try only normal
completion when it is invoked:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*completer _complete ... _prefix
zstyle :completion::prefix:* completer _complete</p>

<p>The add-space style is also respected. If it is set to
true then _prefix will insert a space between the matches
generated (if any) and the suffix.</p>

<p>Note that this completer is only useful if the
COMPLETE_IN_WORD option is set; otherwise, the cursor will
be moved to the end of the current word before the
completion code is called and hence there will be no
suffix.</p>

<p>_user_expand This completer behaves similarly to the
_expand completer but instead performs expansions defined by
users. The styles add-space and sort styles specific to the
_expand completer are usable with _user_expand in addition
to other styles handled more generally by the completion
system. The tag all-expansions is also available.</p>

<p>The expansion depends on the array style user-expand
being defined for the current context; remember that the
context for completers is less specific than that for
contextual completion as the full context has not yet been
determined. Elements of the array may have one of the
following forms: $hash hash is the name of an associative
array. Note this is not a full parameter expression, merely
a $, suitably quoted to prevent immediate expansion,
followed by the name of an associative array. If the trial
expansion word matches a key in hash, the resulting
expansion is the corresponding value. _func _func is the
name of a shell function whose name must begin with _ but is
not otherwise special to the comple- tion system. The
function is called with the trial word as an argument. If
the word is to be expanded, the func- tion should set the
array reply to a list of expansions. The return status of
the function is irrelevant.</p>

<p>BINDABLE COMMANDS In addition to the context-dependent
completions provided, which are expected to work in an
intuitively obvious way, there are a few widgets
implementing special behaviour which can be bound separately
to keys. The following is a list of these and their default
bindings.</p>

<p>_bash_completions This function is used by two widgets,
_bash_complete-word and _bash_list-choices. It exists to
provide compatibility with completion bindings in bash. The
last character of the binding determines what is completed:
!, command names; $ , environ- ment variables; @, host
names; /, file names; ~ user names. In bash, the binding
preceded by e gives completion, and preceded by ^X lists
options. As some of these bindings clash with standard zsh
bindings, onlye~ and ^X~ are bound by default. To add the
rest, the following should be added to .zshrc after compinit
has been run:</p>

<p>for key in; do bindkey e$key&quot; _bash_complete-word
bindkey &quot;^X$key&quot; _bash_list-choices done</p>

<p>This includes the bindings for ~ in case they were
already bound to something else; the completion code does
not override user bindings.</p>

<p>_correct_filename (^XC) Correct the filename path at the
cursor position. Allows up to six errors in the name. Can
also be called with an argument to correct a filename path,
independently of zle; the correction is printed on standard
output.</p>

<p>_correct_word (^Xc) Performs correction of the current
argument using the usual con- textual completions as
possible choices. This stores the string correct-word in the
function field of the context name and then calls the
_correct completer.</p>

<p>_expand_alias (^Xa) This function can be used as a
completer and as a bindable com- mand. It expands the word
the cursor is on if it is an alias. The types of alias
expanded can be controlled with the styles regular, global
and disabled.</p>

<p>When used as a bindable command there is one additional
feature that can be selected by setting the complete style
to true. In this case, if the word is not the name of an
alias, _expand_alias tries to complete the word to a full
alias name without expanding it. It leaves the cursor
directly after the completed word so that invoking
_expand_alias once more will expand the now-complete alias
name.</p>

<p>_expand_word (^Xe) Performs expansion on the current
word: equivalent to the stan- dard expand-word command, but
using the _expand completer. Before calling it, the function
field of the context is set to expand-word.</p>

<p>_generic This function is not defined as a widget and
not bound by default. However, it can be used to define a
widget and will then store the name of the widget in the
function field of the context and call the completion
system. This allows custom com- pletion widgets with their
own set of style settings to be defined easily. For example,
to define a widget that performs normal completion and
starts menu selection:</p>

<p>zle -C foo complete-word _generic bindkey...foo
zstyle:completion:foo:*menu yes select=1</p>

<p>Note in particular that the completer style may be set
for the context in order to change the set of functions used
to generate possible matches. If _generic is called with
arguments, those are passed through to _main_complete as the
list of completers in place of those defined by the
completer style.</p>

<p>_history_complete_word (\/) Complete words from the
shell s command history. This uses the list,
remove-all-dups, sort, and stop styles.</p>

<p>_most_recent_file (^Xm) Complete the name of the most
recently modified file matching the pattern on the command
line (which may be blank). If given a numeric argument N,
complete the Nth most recently modified file. Note the
completion, if any, is always unique.</p>

<p>_next_tags (^Xn) This command alters the set of matches
used to that for the next tag, or set of tags, either as
given by the tag-order style or as set by default; these
matches would otherwise not be avail- able. Successive
invocations of the command cycle through all possible sets
of tags.</p>

<p>_read_comp (^X^R) Prompt the user for a string, and use
that to perform completion on the current word. There are
two possibilities for the string. First, it can be a set of
words beginning _, for example _files -/, in which case the
function with any argu- ments will be called to generate the
completions. Unambiguous parts of the function name will be
completed automatically (nor- mal completion is not
available at this point) until a space is typed.</p>

<p>Second, any other string will be passed as a set of
arguments to compadd and should hence be an expression
specifying what should be completed.</p>

<p>A very restricted set of editing commands is available
when reading the string: DEL and ^H delete the last
character; ^U deletes the line, and ^C and ^G abort the
function, while RET accepts the completion. Note the string
is used verbatim as a command line, so arguments must be
quoted in accordance with standard shell rules.</p>

<p>Once a string has been read, the next call to _read_comp
will use the existing string instead of reading a new one.
To force a new string to be read, call _read_comp with a
numeric argu- ment.</p>

<p>_complete_debug (^X?) This widget performs ordinary
completion, but captures in a tem- porary file a trace of
the shell commands executed by the com- pletion system. Each
completion attempt gets its own file. A command to view each
of these files is pushed onto the editor buffer stack.</p>

<p>_complete_help (^Xh) This widget displays information
about the context names, the tags, and the completion
functions used when completing at the current cursor
position. If given a numeric argument other than 1 (as in
ESC-2 ^Xh), then the styles used and the contexts for which
they are used will be shown, too.</p>

<p>Note that the information about styles may be
incomplete; it depends on the information available from the
completion func- tions called, which in turn is determined
by the users own styles and other settings.</p>

<p>_complete_help_generic Unlike other commands listed
here, this must be created as a normal ZLE widget rather
than a completion widget (i.e. with zle -N). It is used for
generating help with a widget bound to the _generic widget
that is described above.</p>

<p>If this widget is created using the name of the
function, as it is by default, then when executed it will
read a key sequence. This is expected to be bound to a call
to a completion function that uses the _generic widget. That
widget will be executed, and information provided in the
same format that the _com- plete_help widget displays for
contextual completion.</p>

<p>If the widgets name contains debug, for example if it is
cre- ated as zle -N _complete_debug_generic
_complete_help_generic, it will read and execute the
keystring for a generic widget as before, but then generate
debugging information as done by _com- plete_debug for
contextual completion.</p>

<p>If the widgets name contains noread, it will not read a
keystring but instead arrange that the next use of a generic
widget run in the same shell will have the effect as
described above.</p>

<p>The widget works by setting the shell parameter
ZSH_TRACE_GENERIC_WIDGET which is read by _generic.
Unsetting the parameter cancels any pending effect of the
noread form.</p>

<p>For example, after executing the following:</p>

<p>zle -N _complete_debug_generic _complete_help_generic
bindkey^x:_complete_debug_generic</p>

<p>typing C-x : followed by the key sequence for a generic
widget will cause trace output for that widget to be saved
to a file.</p>

<p>_complete_tag (^Xt) This widget completes symbol tags
created by the etags or ctags programmes (note there is no
connection with the completion sys- tem s tags) stored in a
file TAGS, in the format used by etags, or tags, in the
format created by ctags. It will look back up the path
hierarchy for the first occurrence of either file; if both
exist, the file TAGS is preferred. You can specify the full
path to a TAGS or tags file by setting the parameter $TAGS-
FILE or $tagsfile respectively. The corresponding completion
tags used are etags and vtags, after emacs and vi
respectively.</p>

<p>UTILITY FUNCTIONS Descriptions follow for utility
functions that may be useful when writ- ing completion
functions. If functions are installed in subdirecto- ries,
most of these reside in the Base subdirectory. Like the
example functions for commands in the distribution, the
utility functions gen- erating matches all follow the
convention of returning status zero if they generated
completions and non-zero if no matching completions could be
added.</p>

<p>Two more features are offered by the _main_complete
function. The arrays compprefuncs and comppostfuncs may
contain names of functions that are to be called immediately
before or after completion has been tried. A function will
only be called once unless it explicitly rein- serts itself
into the array.</p>

<p>_all_labels [ -x ] [ -12VJ ] tag name descr [ command
args ... ] This is a convenient interface to the _next_label
function below, implementing the loop shown in the
_next_label example. The command and its arguments are
called to generate the matches. The options stored in the
parameter name will automat- ically be inserted into the
args passed to the command. Nor- mally, they are put
directly after the command, but if one of the args is a
single hyphen, they are inserted directly before that. If
the hyphen is the last argument, it will be removed from the
argument list before the command is called. This allows
_all_labels to be used in almost all cases where the matches
can be generated by a single call to the compadd builtin
command or by a call to one of the utility functions.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>local expl ... if _requested foo; then ... _all_labels
foo expl ... compadd ... - $matches fi</p>

<p>Will complete the strings from the matches parameter,
using com- padd with additional options which will take
precedence over those generated by _all_labels.</p>

<p>_alternative [ -C name ] spec ... This function is
useful in simple cases where multiple tags are available.
Essentially it implements a loop like the one described for
the _tags function below.</p>

<p>The tags to use and the action to perform if a tag is
requested are described using the specs which are of the
form: tag:descr:action. The tags are offered using _tags and
if the tag is requested, the action is executed with the
given descrip- tion descr. The actions are those accepted by
the _arguments function (described below), excluding the
-&gt;state and =... forms.</p>

<p>For example, the action may be a simple function
call:</p>

<p>_alternative users:user:_users hosts:host:_hosts</p>

<p>offers usernames and hostnames as possible matches,
generated by the _users and _hosts functions
respectively.</p>

<p>Like _arguments, this function uses _all_labels to
execute the actions, which will loop over all sets of tags.
Special han- dling is only required if there is an
additional valid tag, for example inside a function called
from _alternative.</p>

<p>Like _tags this function supports the -C option to give
a dif- ferent name for the argument context field.</p>

<p>_arguments [ -nswWACRS ] [ -O name ] [ -M matchspec ] [
: ] spec ... This function can be used to give a complete
specification for completion for a command whose arguments
follow standard UNIX option and argument conventions. The
following forms specify individual sets of options and
arguments; to avoid ambiguity, these may be separated from
the options to _arguments itself by a single colon. Options
to _arguments itself must be in separate words, i.e. -s -w,
not -sw.</p>

<p>With the option -n, _arguments sets the parameter
NORMARG to the position of the first normal argument in the
$words array, i.e. the position after the end of the
options. If that argument has not been reached, NORMARG is
set to -1. The caller should declare integer NORMARG if the
-n option is passed; otherwise the parameter is not
used.</p>

<p>n:message:action n::message:action This describes the n
th normal argument. The message will be printed above the
matches generated and the action indicates what can be
completed in this position (see below). If there are two
colons before the message the argument is optional. If the
message contains only white space, nothing will be printed
above the matches unless the action adds an explanation
string itself.</p>

<p>:message:action ::message:action Similar, but describes
the next argument, whatever number that happens to be. If
all arguments are specified in this form in the correct
order the numbers are unneces- sary.</p>

<p>*:message:action *::message:action *:::message:action
This describes how arguments (usually non-option argu-
ments, those not beginning with - or +) are to be com-
pleted when neither of the first two forms was provided. Any
number of arguments can be completed in this fashion.</p>

<p>With two colons before the message, the words special
array and the CURRENT special parameter are modified to
refer only to the normal arguments when the action is
executed or evaluated. With three colons before the mes-
sage they are modified to refer only to the normal argu-
ments covered by this description.</p>

<p>optspec optspec:... This describes an option. The colon
indicates handling for one or more arguments to the option;
if it is not present, the option is assumed to take no
arguments.</p>

<p>By default, options are multi-character name, one -word
per option. With -s, options may be single characters, with
more than one option per word, although words start- ing
with two hyphens, such as --prefix, are still con- sidered
complete option names. This is suitable for standard GNU
options.</p>

<p>The combination of -s with -w allows single-letter
options to be combined in a single word even if one or more
of the options take arguments. For example, if -a takes an
argument, with no -s -ab is considered as a single
(unhandled) option; with -s -ab is an option with the
argument b; with both -s and -w, -ab may be the option -a
and the option -b with arguments still to come.</p>

<p>The option -W takes this a stage further: it is possible
to complete single-letter options even after an argument
that occurs in the same word. However, it depends on the
action performed whether options will really be completed at
this point. For more control, use a utility function like
_guard as part of the action.</p>

<p>The following forms are available for the initial opt-
spec, whether or not the option has arguments.</p>

<p>*optspec Here optspec is one of the remaining forms
below. This indicates the following optspec may be repeated.
Otherwise if the corresponding option is already present on
the command line to the left of the cursor it will not be
offered again.</p>

<p>-optname +optname In the simplest form the optspec is
just the option name beginning with a minus or a plus sign,
such as -foo . The first argument for the option (if any)
must follow as a separate word directly after the
option.</p>

<p>Either of -+optname and +-optname can be used to specify
that -optname and +optname are both valid.</p>

<p>In all the remaining forms, the leading - may be
replaced by or paired with + in this way.</p>

<p>-optname- The first argument of the option must come
directly after the option name in the same word. For
example, -foo-:... specifies that the com- pleted option and
argument will look like -fooarg.</p>

<p>-optname+ The first argument may appear immediately
after optname in the same word, or may appear as a sep-
arate word after the option. For example, -foo+:...
specifies that the completed option and argument will look
like either -fooarg or -foo arg.</p>

<p>-optname= The argument may appear as the next word, or
in same word as the option name provided that it is
separated from it by an equals sign, for example -foo=arg or
-foo arg.</p>

<p>-optname=- The argument to the option must appear after
an equals sign in the same word, and may not be given in the
next argument.</p>

<p>optspec[explanation] An explanation string may be
appended to any of the preceding forms of optspec by
enclosing it in brackets, as in -q[query operation].</p>

<p>The verbose style is used to decide whether the
explanation strings are displayed with the option in a
completion listing.</p>

<p>If no bracketed explanation string is given but the
auto-description style is set and only one argument is
described for this optspec, the value of the style is
displayed, with any appearance of the sequence %d in it
replaced by the message of the first optarg that follows the
optspec; see below.</p>

<p>It is possible for options with a literal + or = to
appear, but that character must be quoted, for example
+.</p>

<p>Each optarg following an optspec must take one of the
following forms:</p>

<p>:message:action ::message:action An argument to the
option; message and action are treated as for ordinary
arguments. In the first form, the argu- ment is mandatory,
and in the second form it is optional.</p>

<p>This group may be repeated for options which take multi-
ple arguments. In other words, :message1:action1:mes-
sage2:action2 specifies that the option takes two argu-
ments.</p>

<p>:*pattern:message:action :*pattern::message:action
:*pattern:::message:action This describes multiple
arguments. Only the last optarg for an option taking
multiple arguments may be given in this form. If the pattern
is empty (i.e., :*:), all the remaining words on the line
are to be completed as described by the action; otherwise,
all the words up to and including a word matching the
pattern are to be com- pleted using the action.</p>

<p>Multiple colons are treated as for the *:... forms for
ordinary arguments: when the message is preceded by two
colons, the words special array and the CURRENT special
parameter are modified during the execution or evaluation of
the action to refer only to the words after the option. When
preceded by three colons, they are modified to refer only to
the words covered by this description.</p>

<p>Any literal colon in an optname, message, or action must
be preceded by a backslash:.</p>

<p>Each of the forms above may be preceded by a list in
parentheses of option names and argument numbers. If the
given option is on the com- mand line, the options and
arguments indicated in parentheses will not be offered. For
example, (-two -three 1)-one:... completes the option -one;
if this appears on the command line, the options -two and
-three and the first ordinary argument will not be completed
after it. (-foo):... specifies an ordinary argument
completion; -foo will not be completed if that argument is
already present.</p>

<p>Other items may appear in the list of excluded options
to indicate var- ious other items that should not be applied
when the current specifica- tion is matched: a single star
(*) for the rest arguments (i.e. a spec- ification of the
form *:...); a colon (:) for all normal (non-option-)
arguments; and a hyphen (-) for all options. For exam- ple,
if (*) appears before an option and the option appears on
the command line, the list of remaining arguments (those
shown in the above table beginning with *:) will not be
completed.</p>

<p>To aid in reuse of specifications, it is possible to
precede any of the forms above with !; then the form will no
longer be completed, although if the option or argument
appears on the command line they will be skipped as normal.
The main use for this is when the arguments are given by an
array, and _arguments is called repeatedly for more specific
contexts: on the first call _arguments $global_options is
used, and on subsequent calls _arguments !$^global_options
.</p>

<p>In each of the forms above the action determines how
completions should be generated. Except for the -&gt;string
form below, the action will be executed by calling the
_all_labels function to process all tag labels. No special
handling of tags is needed unless a function call introduces
a new one.</p>

<p>The forms for action are as follows.</p>

<p>(single unquoted space) This is useful where an argument
is required but it is not pos- sible or desirable to
generate matches for it. The message will be displayed but
no completions listed. Note that even in this case the colon
at the end of the message is needed; it may only be omitted
when neither a message nor an action is given.</p>

<p>(item1 item2 ...) One of a list of possible matches, for
example:</p>

<p>:foo:(foo bar baz)</p>

<p>((item:desc1 ...)) Similar to the above, but with
descriptions for each possible match. Note the backslash
before the colon. For example,</p>

<p>:foo:((:bar :baz))</p>

<p>The matches will be listed together with their
descriptions if the description style is set with the values
tag in the context.</p>

<p>-&gt;string In this form, _arguments processes the
arguments and options and then returns control to the
calling function with parameters set to indicate the state
of processing; the calling function then makes its own
arrangements for generating completions. For example,
functions that implement a state machine can use this type
of action.</p>

<p>Where _arguments encounters a -&gt;string , it will
strip all leading and trailing whitespace from string and
set the array state to the set of all stringss for which an
action is to be performed.</p>

<p>By default and in common with all other well behaved
completion functions, _arguments returns status zero if it
was able to add matches and non-zero otherwise. However, if
the -R option is given, _arguments will instead return a
status of 300 to indi- cate that $state is to be
handled.</p>

<p>In addition to $state, _arguments also sets the global
parame- ters context, line and opt_args as described below,
and does not reset any changes made to the special
parameters such as PREFIX and words. This gives the calling
function the choice of resetting these parameters or
propagating changes in them.</p>

<p>A function calling _arguments with at least one action
contain- ing a -&gt;string must therefore declare
appropriate local param- eters:</p>

<p>local context state line typeset -A opt_args</p>

<p>to prevent _arguments from altering the global
environment.</p>

<p>{eval-string} A string in braces is evaluated as shell
code to generate matches. If the eval-string itself does not
begin with an open- ing parenthesis or brace it is split
into separate words before execution.</p>

<p>= action If the action starts with = (an equals sign
followed by a space), _arguments will insert the contents of
the argument field of the current context as the new first
element in the words special array and increment the value
of the CURRENT spe- cial parameter. This has the effect of
inserting a dummy word onto the completion command line
while not changing the point at which completion is taking
place.</p>

<p>This is most useful with one of the specifiers that
restrict the words on the command line on which the action
is to operate (the two- and three-colon forms above). One
particular use is when an action itself causes _arguments on
a restricted range; it is necessary to use this trick to
insert an appropriate command name into the range for the
second call to _arguments to be able to parse the line.</p>

<p>word... word... This covers all forms other than those
above. If the action starts with a space, the remaining list
of words will be invoked unchanged.</p>

<p>Otherwise it will be invoked with some extra strings
placed after the first word; these are to be passed down as
options to the compadd builtin. They ensure that the state
specified by _arguments, in particular the descriptions of
options and argu- ments, is correctly passed to the
completion command. These additional arguments are taken
from the array parameter expl; this will be set up before
executing the action and hence may be referred to inside it,
typically in an expansion of the form $expl[@] which
preserves empty elements of the array.</p>

<p>During the performance of the action the array line will
be set to the command name and normal arguments from the
command line, i.e. the words from the command line excluding
all options and their arguments. Options are stored in the
associative array opt_args with option names as keys and
their arguments as the values. For options that have more
than one argument these are given as one string, separated
by colons. All colons in the original arguments are preceded
with back- slashes.</p>

<p>The parameter context is set when returning to the
calling function to perform an action of the form
-&gt;string. It is set to an array of elements corresponding
to the elements of $state. Each element is a suitable name
for the argument field of the context: either a string of
the form option-opt-n for the nth argument of the option
-opt, or a string of the form argument-n for the nth
argument. For rest arguments, that is those in the list at
the end not handled by posi- tion, n is the string rest .
For example, when completing the argu- ment of the -o
option, the name is option-o-1, while for the second normal
(non-option-) argument it is argument-2.</p>

<p>Furthermore, during the evaluation of the action the
context name in the curcontext parameter is altered to
append the same string that is stored in the context
parameter.</p>

<p>It is possible to specify multiple sets of options and
arguments with the sets separated by single hyphens. The
specifications before the first hyphen (if any) are shared
by all the remaining sets. The first word in every other set
provides a name for the set which may appear in exclusion
lists in specifications, either alone or before one of the
possible values described above. In the second case a -
should appear between this name and the remainder.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>_arguments -a - set1 -c - set2 -d :arg:(x2 y2)</p>

<p>This defines two sets. When the command line contains
the option -c, the -d option and the argument will not be
considered possible com- pletions. When it contains -d or an
argument, the option -c will not be considered. However,
after -a both sets will still be consid- ered valid.</p>

<p>If the name given for one of the mutually exclusive sets
is of the form (name) then only one value from each set will
ever be completed; more formally, all specifications are
mutually exclusive to all other speci- fications in the same
set. This is useful for defining multiple sets of options
which are mutually exclusive and in which the options are
aliases for each other. For example:</p>

<p>_arguments -a -b - (compress) {-c,--compress} [compress]
-(uncompress) {-d,--decompress[decompress]</p>

<p>As the completion code has to parse the command line
separately for each set this form of argument is slow and
should only be used when necessary. A useful alternative is
often an option specification with rest-arguments (as in
-foo:*:...); here the option -foo swallows up all remaining
arguments as described by the optarg definitions.</p>

<p>The options -S and -A are available to simplify the
specifications for commands with standard option parsing.
With -S, no option will be com- pleted after a -- appearing
on its own on the line; this argument will otherwise be
ignored; hence in the line</p>

<p>foobar -a -- -b</p>

<p>the -a is considered an option but the -b is considered
an argu- ment, while the -- is considered to be neither.</p>

<p>With -A, no options will be completed after the first
non-option argu- ment on the line. The -A must be followed
by a pattern matching all strings which are not to be taken
as arguments. For example, to make _arguments stop
completing options after the first normal argument, but
ignoring all strings starting with a hyphen even if they are
not described by one of the optspecs, the form is -A
&quot;-*&quot;.</p>

<p>The option -O name specifies the name of an array whose
elements will be passed as arguments to functions called to
execute actions. For example, this can be used to pass the
same set of options for the com- padd builtin to all
actions.</p>

<p>The option -M spec sets a match specification to use to
completion option names and values. It must appear before
the first argument specification. The default is r:|[_-]=*
r:|=*: this allows partial word completion after _ and -,
for example -f-b can be completed to -foo-bar.</p>

<p>The option -C tells _arguments to modify the curcontext
parameter for an action of the form -&gt;state. This is the
standard parameter used to keep track of the current
context. Here it (and not the context array) should be made
local to the calling function to avoid passing back the
modified value and should be initialised to the current
value at the start of the function:</p>

<p>local curcontext=&quot;$curcontext&quot;</p>

<p>This is useful where it is not possible for multiple
states to be valid together.</p>

<p>The option -- allows _arguments to work out the names of
long options that support the --help option which is
standard in many GNU com- mands. The command word is called
with the argument --help and the output examined for option
names. Clearly, it can be dangerous to pass this to commands
which may not support this option as the behaviour of the
command is unspecified.</p>

<p>In addition to options, _arguments -- will try to deduce
the types of arguments available for options when the form
--opt=val is valid. It is also possible to provide hints by
examining the help text of the command and adding specifiers
of the form pattern:message:action; note that normal
_arguments specifiers are not used. The pattern is matched
against the help text for an option, and if it matches the
mes- sage and action are used as for other argument
specifiers. For exam- ple:</p>

<p>_arguments -- *:toggle:(yes no) *=FILE*:file:_files
*=DIR*:directory:_files -/ *=PATH*:directory:_files -/</p>

<p>Here, yes and no will be completed as the argument of
options whose description ends in a star; file names will be
completed for options that contain the substring =FILE in
the description; and directories will be completed for
options whose description contains =DIR or =PATH. The last
three are in fact the default and so need not be given
explicitly, although it is possible to override the use of
these patterns. A typical help text which uses this feature
is:</p>

<p>-C, --directory=DIR change to directory DIR</p>

<p>so that the above specifications will cause directories
to be completed after --directory, though not after -C.</p>

<p>Note also that _arguments tries to find out
automatically if the argu- ment for an option is optional.
This can be specified explicitly by doubling the colon
before the message.</p>

<p>If the pattern ends in (-), this will be removed from
the pattern and the action will be used only directly after
the =, not in the next word. This is the behaviour of a
normal specification defined with the form =-.</p>

<p>The _arguments -- can be followed by the option -i
patterns to give patterns for options which are not to be
completed. The patterns can be given as the name of an array
parameter or as a literal list in parentheses. For
example,</p>

<p>_arguments -- -i
&quot;(--(en|dis)able-FEATURE*)&quot;</p>

<p>will cause completion to ignore the options
--enable-FEATURE and --disable-FEATURE (this example is
useful with GNU configure).</p>

<p>The _arguments -- form can also be followed by the
option -s pair to describe option aliases. Each pair
consists of a pattern and a replacement. For example, some
configure-scripts describe options only as --enable-foo ,
but also accept --disable-foo. To allow comple- tion of the
second form:</p>

<p>_arguments -- -s &quot;(#--enable- --disable-)&quot;</p>

<p>Here is a more general example of the use of
_arguments:</p>

<p>_arguments-l+:left border: -format:paper size:(letter
A4) *-copy:output file:_files::resolution:(300 600)
:postscript file:_files -g *(p|ep) *:page number:</p>

<p>This describes three options: -l, -format, and -copy.
The first takes one argument described as left border for
which no completion will be offered because of the empty
action. Its argument may come directly after the -l or it
may be given as the next word on the line.</p>

<p>The -format option takes one argument in the next word,
described as paper size for which only the strings letter
and A4 will be com- pleted.</p>

<p>The -copy option may appear more than once on the
command line and takes two arguments. The first is mandatory
and will be completed as a filename. The second is optional
(because of the second colon before the description
resolution) and will be completed from the strings 300 and
600.</p>

<p>The last two descriptions say what should be completed
as arguments. The first describes the first argument as a
postscript file and makes files ending in ps or eps be
completed. The last description gives all other arguments
the description page numbers but does not offer
completions.</p>

<p>_cache_invalid cache_identifier This function returns
status zero if the completions cache cor- responding to the
given cache identifier needs rebuilding. It determines this
by looking up the cache-policy style for the current
context. This should provide a function name which is run
with the full path to the relevant cache file as the only
argument.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>_example_caching_policy () { # rebuild if cache is more
than a week old local -a oldp oldp=( &quot;$1&quot;(Nmw+1) )
(( $#oldp )) }</p>

<p>_call_function return name [ args ... ] If a function
name exists, it is called with the arguments args. The
return argument gives the name of a parameter in which the
return status from the function name should be stored; if
return is empty or a single hyphen it is ignored.</p>

<p>The return status of _call_function itself is zero if
the func- tion name exists and was called and non-zero
otherwise.</p>

<p>_call_program tag string ... This function provides a
mechanism for the user to override the use of an external
command. It looks up the command style with the supplied
tag. If the style is set, its value is used as the command
to execute. The strings from the call to _call_program, or
from the style if set, are concatenated with spaces between
them and the resulting string is evaluated. The return
status is the return status of the command called.</p>

<p>_combination [ -s pattern ] tag style spec ... field
opts ... This function is used to complete combinations of
values, for example pairs of hostnames and usernames. The
style argument gives the style which defines the pairs; it
is looked up in a context with the tag specified.</p>

<p>The style name consists of field names separated by
hyphens, for example users-hosts-ports. For each field for a
value is already known, a spec of the form field=pattern is
given. For example, if the command line so far specifies a
user pws, the argument users=pws should appear.</p>

<p>The next argument with no equals sign is taken as the
name of the field for which completions should be generated
(presumably not one of the fields for which the value is
known).</p>

<p>The matches generated will be taken from the value of
the style. These should contain the possible values for the
combinations in the appropriate order (users, hosts, ports
in the example above). The different fields the values for
the different fields are separated by colons. This can be
altered with the option -s to _combination which specifies a
pattern. Typically this is a character class, as for example
-s &quot;[:@]&quot; in the case of the users-hosts style.
Each field=pattern specifi- cation restricts the completions
which apply to elements of the style with appropriately
matching fields.</p>

<p>If no style with the given name is defined for the given
tag, or if none of the strings in styles value match, but a
function name of the required field preceded by an
underscore is defined, that function will be called to
generate the matches. For exam- ple, if there is no
users-hosts-ports or no matching hostname when a host is
required, the function _hosts will automati- cally be
called.</p>

<p>If the same name is used for more than one field, in
both the field=pattern and the argument that gives the name
of the field to be completed, the number of the field
(starting with one) may be given after the fieldname,
separated from it by a colon.</p>

<p>All arguments after the required field name are passed
to compadd when generating matches from the style value, or
to the functions for the fields if they are called.</p>

<p>_describe [ -oO | -t tag ] descr name1 [ name2 ] opts
... -- ... This function associates completions with
descriptions. Multi- ple groups separated by -- can be
supplied, potentially with different completion options
opts.</p>

<p>The descr is taken as a string to display above the
matches if the format style for the descriptions tag is set.
This is fol- lowed by one or two names of arrays followed by
options to pass to compadd. The first array contains the
possible completions with their descriptions in the form
completion:description. Any literal colons in completion
must be quoted with a back- slash. If a second array is
given, it should have the same num- ber of elements as the
first; in this case the corresponding elements are added as
possible completions instead of the com- pletion strings
from the first array. The completion list will retain the
descriptions from the first array. Finally, a set of
completion options can appear.</p>

<p>If the option -o appears before the first argument, the
matches added will be treated as names of command options
(N.B. not shell options), typically following a -, -- or +
on the command line. In this case _describe uses the
prefix-hid- den, prefix-needed and verbose styles to find
out if the strings should be added as completions and if the
descriptions should be shown. Without the -o option, only
the verbose style is used to decide how descriptions are
shown. If -O is used instead of -o, command options are
completed as above but _describe will not handle the
prefix-needed style.</p>

<p>With the -t option a tag can be specified. The default
is val- ues or, if the -o option is given, options.</p>

<p>If selected by the list-grouped style, strings with the
same description will appear together in the list.</p>

<p>_describe uses the _all_labels function to generate the
matches, so it does not need to appear inside a loop over
tag labels.</p>

<p>_description [ -x ] [ -12VJ ] tag name descr [ spec ...
] This function is not to be confused with the previous one;
it is used as a helper function for creating options to
compadd. It is buried inside many of the higher level
completion functions and so often does not need to be called
directly.</p>

<p>The styles listed below are tested in the current
context using the given tag. The resulting options for
compadd are put into the array named name (this is
traditionally expl, but this convention is not enforced).
The description for the corre- sponding set of matches is
passed to the function in descr.</p>

<p>The styles tested are: format, hidden, matcher,
ignored-patterns and group-name. The format style is first
tested for the given tag and then for the descriptions tag
if no value was found, while the remainder are only tested
for the tag given as the first argument. The function also
calls _setup which tests some more styles.</p>

<p>The string returned by the format style (if any) will be
modi- fied so that the sequence %d is replaced by the descr
given as the third argument without any leading or trailing
white space. If, after removing the white space, the descr
is the empty string, the format style will not be used and
the options put into the name array will not contain an
explanation string to be displayed above the matches.</p>

<p>If _description is called with more than three
arguments, the additional specs should be of the form
char:str . These supply escape sequence replacements for the
format style: every appear- ance of %char will be replaced
by string.</p>

<p>If the -x option is given, the description will be
passed to compadd using the -x option instead of the default
-X. This means that the description will be displayed even
if there are no corresponding matches.</p>

<p>The options placed in the array name take account of the
group-name style, so matches are placed in a separate group
where necessary. The group normally has its elements sorted
(by passing the option -J to compadd), but if an option
starting with -V, -J, -1, or -2 is passed to _description,
that option will be included in the array. Hence it is
possible for the completion group to be unsorted by giving
the option -V, -1V, or -2V.</p>

<p>In most cases, the function will be used like this:</p>

<p>local expl _description files expl file compadd
&quot;$expl[@]&quot; - &quot;$files[@]&quot;</p>

<p>Note the use of the parameter expl, the hyphen, and the
list of matches. Almost all calls to compadd within the
completion sys- tem use a similar format; this ensures that
user-specified styles are correctly passed down to the
builtins which implement the internals of completion.</p>

<p>_dispatch context string ... This sets the current
context to context and looks for comple- tion functions to
handle this context by hunting through the list of command
names or special contexts (as described above for compdef)
given as string .... The first completion function to be
defined for one of the contexts in the list is used to
generate matches. Typically, the last string is -default- to
cause the function for default completion to be used as a
fall- back.</p>

<p>The function sets the parameter $service to the string
being tried, and sets the context/command field (the fourth)
of the $curcontext parameter to the context given as the
first argu- ment.</p>

<p>_files The function _files calls _path_files with all
the arguments it was passed except for -g and -/. The use of
these two options depends on the setting of the
file-patterns style.</p>

<p>This function accepts the full set of options allowed by
_path_files, described below.</p>

<p>_gnu_generic This function is a simple wrapper around
the _arguments function described above. It can be used to
determine automatically the long options understood by
commands that produce a list when passed the option --help.
It is intended to be used as a top-level completion function
in its own right. For example, to enable option completion
for the commands foo and bar, use</p>

<p>compdef _gnu_generic foo bar</p>

<p>after the call to compinit.</p>

<p>The completion system as supplied is conservative in its
use of this function, since it is important to be sure the
command understands the option --help.</p>

<p>_guard [ options ] pattern descr This function is
intended to be used in the action for the spec- ifications
passed to _arguments and similar functions. It returns
immediately with a non-zero return status if the string to
be completed does not match the pattern. If the pattern
matches, the descr is displayed; the function then returns
sta- tus zero if the word to complete is not empty, non-zero
other- wise.</p>

<p>The pattern may be preceded by any of the options
understood by compadd that are passed down from
_description, namely -M, -J, -V, -1, -2, -n, -F and -X. All
of these options will be ignored. This fits in conveniently
with the argument-passing conventions of actions for
_arguments.</p>

<p>As an example, consider a command taking the options -n
and -none, where -n must be followed by a numeric value in
the same word. By using:</p>

<p>_arguments -n-: :_guard &quot;[0-9]#&quot; &quot;numeric
value-none</p>

<p>_arguments can be made to both display the message
numeric value and complete options after -n&lt;TAB&gt;. If
the -n is already followed by one or more digits (the
pattern passed to _guard) only the message will be
displayed; if the -n is fol- lowed by another character,
only options are completed.</p>

<p>_message [ -r12 ] [ -VJ group ] descr _message -e [ tag
] descr The descr is used in the same way as the third
argument to the _description function, except that the
resulting string will always be shown whether or not matches
were generated. This is useful for displaying a help message
in places where no comple- tions can be generated.</p>

<p>The format style is examined with the messages tag to
find a message; the usual tag, descriptions, is used only if
the style is not set with the former.</p>

<p>If the -r option is given, no style is used; the descr
is taken literally as the string to display. This is most
useful when the descr comes from a pre-processed argument
list which already contains an expanded description.</p>

<p>The -12VJ options and the group are passed to compadd
and hence determine the group the message string is added
to.</p>

<p>The second form gives a description for completions with
the tag tag to be shown even if there are no matches for
that tag. The tag can be omitted and if so the tag is taken
from the parameter $curtag; this is maintained by the
completion system and so is usually correct.</p>

<p>_multi_parts sep array The argument sep is a separator
character. The array may be either the name of an array
parameter or a literal array in the form (foo bar), a
parenthesised list of words separated by whitespace. The
possible completions are the strings from the array.
However, each chunk delimited by sep will be completed
separately. For example, the _tar function uses _multi_parts
/ patharray to complete partial file paths from the given
array of complete file paths.</p>

<p>The -i option causes _multi_parts to insert a unique
match even if that requires multiple separators to be
inserted. This is not usually the expected behaviour with
filenames, but certain other types of completion, for
example those with a fixed set of possibilities, may be more
suited to this form.</p>

<p>Like other utility functions, this function accepts the
-V, -J, -1, -2, -n, -f, -X, -M, -P, -S, -r, -R, and -q
options and passes them to the compadd builtin.</p>

<p>_next_label [ -x ] [ -12VJ ] tag name descr [ options
... ] This function is used to implement the loop over
different tag labels for a particular tag as described above
for the tag-order style. On each call it checks to see if
there are any more tag labels; if there is it returns status
zero, otherwise non-zero. As this function requires a
current tag to be set, it must always follow a call to _tags
or _requested.</p>

<p>The -x12VJ options and the first three arguments are
passed to the _description function. Where appropriate the
tag will be replaced by a tag label in this call. Any
description given in the tag-order style is preferred to the
descr passed to _next_label.</p>

<p>The options given after the descr are set in the
parameter given by name, and hence are to be passed to
compadd or whatever func- tion is called to add the
matches.</p>

<p>Here is a typical use of this function for the tag foo.
The call to _requested determines if tag foo is required at
all; the loop over _next_label handles any labels defined
for the tag in the tag-order style.</p>

<p>local expl ret=1 ... if _requested foo; then ... while
_next_label foo expl..; do compadd &quot;$expl[@]&quot; ...
&amp;&amp; ret=0 done ... fi return ret</p>

<p>_normal This is the standard function called to handle
completion out- side any special -context-. It is called
both to complete the command word and also the arguments for
a command. In the sec- ond case, _normal looks for a special
completion for that com- mand, and if there is none it uses
the completion for the -default- context.</p>

<p>A second use is to reexamine the command line specified
by the $words array and the $CURRENT parameter after those
have been modified. For example, the function _precommand,
which com- pletes after pre-command specifiers such as
nohup, removes the first word from the words array,
decrements the CURRENT parame- ter, then calls _normal
again. The effect is that nohup cmd ... is treated in the
same way as cmd ....</p>

<p>If the command name matches one of the patterns given by
one of the options -p or -P to compdef, the corresponding
completion function is called and then the parameter
_compskip is checked. If it is set completion is terminated
at that point even if no matches have been found. This is
the same effect as in the -first- context.</p>

<p>_options This can be used to complete the names of shell
options. It provides a matcher specification that ignores a
leading no, ignores underscores and allows upper-case
letters to match their lower-case counterparts (for example,
glob, noglob, NO_GLOB are all completed). Any arguments are
propagated to the compadd builtin.</p>

<p>_options_set and _options_unset These functions complete
only set or unset options, with the same matching
specification used in the _options function.</p>

<p>Note that you need to uncomment a few lines in the
_main_com- plete function for these functions to work
properly. The lines in question are used to store the option
settings in effect before the completion widget locally sets
the options it needs. Hence these functions are not
generally used by the completion system.</p>

<p>_parameters This is used to complete the names of shell
parameters.</p>

<p>The option -g pattern limits the completion to
parameters whose type matches the pattern. The type of a
parameter is that shown by print ${(t)param}, hence
judicious use of * in pat- tern is probably necessary.</p>

<p>All other arguments are passed to the compadd
builtin.</p>

<p>_path_files This function is used throughout the
completion system to com- plete filenames. It allows
completion of partial paths. For example, the string
/u/i/s/sig may be completed to
/usr/include/sys/signal.h.</p>

<p>The options accepted by both _path_files and _files
are:</p>

<p>-f Complete all filenames. This is the default.</p>

<p>-/ Specifies that only directories should be
completed.</p>

<p>-g pattern Specifies that only files matching the
pattern should be completed.</p>

<p>-W paths Specifies path prefixes that are to be
prepended to the string from the command line to generate
the filenames but that should not be inserted as completions
nor shown in completion listings. Here, paths may be the
name of an array parameter, a literal list of paths enclosed
in parentheses or an absolute pathname.</p>

<p>-F ignored-files This behaves as for the corresponding
option to the com- padd builtin. It gives direct control
over which file- names should be ignored. If the option is
not present, the ignored-patterns style is used.</p>

<p>Both _path_files and _files also accept the following
options which are passed to compadd: -J, -V, -1, -2, -n, -X
, -M, -P, -S, -q, -r, and -R.</p>

<p>Finally, the _path_files function uses the styles
expand, ambiguous, special-dirs, list-suffixes and file-sort
described above.</p>

<p>_pick_variant [ -c command ] [ -r name ] label=pattern
... label [ args ... ] This function is used to resolve
situations where a single com- mand name requires more than
one type of handling, either because it has more than one
variant or because there is a name clash between two
different commands.</p>

<p>The command to run is taken from the first element of
the array words unless this is overridden by the option -c.
This command is run and its output is compared with a series
of patterns. Arguments to be passed to the command can be
specified at the end after all the other arguments. The
patterns to try in order are given by the arguments
label=pattern; if the output of com- mand args ... contains
pattern, then label is selected as the label for the command
variant. If none of the patterns match, the final command
label is selected and status 1 is returned.</p>

<p>If the -r name is given, the label picked is stored in
the parameter named name.</p>

<p>The results are also cached in the _cmd_variant
associative array indexed by the name of the command
run.</p>

<p>_regex_arguments name spec ... This function generates a
completion function name which matches the specifications
spec ..., a set of regular expressions as described below.
After running _regex_arguments, the function name should be
called as a normal completion function. The pat- tern to be
matched is given by the contents of the words array up to
the current cursor position joined together with null
characters; no quotation is applied.</p>

<p>The arguments are grouped as sets of alternatives
separated by |, which are tried one after the other until
one matches. Each alternative consists of a one or more
specifications which are tried left to right, with each
pattern matched being stripped in turn from the command line
being tested, until all of the group succeeds or until one
fails; in the latter case, the next alternative is tried.
This structure can be repeated to arbitrary depth by using
parentheses; matching proceeds from inside to outside.</p>

<p>A special procedure is applied if no test succeeds but
the remaining command line string contains no null character
(imply- ing the remaining word is the one for which
completions are to be generated). The completion target is
restricted to the remaining word and any actions for the
corresponding patterns are executed. In this case, nothing
is stripped from the com- mand line string. The order of
evaluation of the actions can be determined by the tag-order
style; the various formats supported by _alternative can be
used in action. The descr is used for setting up the array
parameter expl.</p>

<p>Specification arguments take one of following forms, in
which metacharacters such as ( , ), # and | should be
quoted.</p>

<p>/pattern/ [%lookahead%] [-guard] [:tag:descr:action]
This is a single primitive component. The function tests
whether the combined pattern (#b)((#B)pattern)looka- head*
matches the command line string. If so, guard is evaluated
and its return status is examined to deter- mine if the test
has succeeded. The pattern string [] is guaranteed never to
match. The lookahead is not stripped from the command line
before the next pattern is examined.</p>

<p>The argument starting with : is used in the same manner
as an argument to _alternative.</p>

<p>A component is used as follows: pattern is tested to see
if the component already exists on the command line. If it
does, any following specifications are examined to find
something to complete. If a component is reached but no such
pattern exists yet on the command line, the string
containing the action is used to generate matches to insert
at that point.</p>

<p>/pattern/+ [%lookahead%] [-guard] [:tag:descr:action]
This is similar to /pattern/ ... but the left part of the
command line string (i.e. the part already matched by
previous patterns) is also considered part of the comple-
tion target.</p>

<p>/pattern/- [%lookahead%] [-guard] [:tag:descr:action]
This is similar to /pattern/ ... but the actions of the
current and previously matched patterns are ignored even if
the following pattern matches the empty string.</p>

<p>( spec ) Parentheses may be used to groups specs; note
each paren- thesis is a single argument to
_regex_arguments.</p>

<p>spec # This allows any number of repetitions of
spec.</p>

<p>spec spec The two specs are to be matched one after the
other as described above.</p>

<p>spec | spec Either of the two specs can be matched.</p>

<p>The function _regex_words can be used as a helper
function to generate matches for a set of alternative words
possibly with their own arguments as a command line
argument.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>_regex_arguments _tst /$ [0]0 / /[0]/ compadd aaa</p>

<p>This generates a function _tst that completes aaa as its
only argument. The tag and description for the action have
been omitted for brevity (this works but is not recommended
in normal use). The first component matches the command
word, which is arbitrary; the second matches any argument.
As the argument is also arbitrary, any following component
would not depend on aaa being present.</p>

<p>_regex_arguments _tst /$ [0]0 / /aa/ compadd aaa</p>

<p>This is a more typical use; it is similar, but any
following patterns would only match if aaa was present as
the first argu- ment.</p>

<p>_regex_arguments _tst /$ [0]0 / ( /aa/ compadd aaa /bb/
compadd bb) In this example, an indefinite number of command
arguments may be completed. Odd arguments are completed as
aaa and even argu- ments as bbb. Completion fails unless the
set of aaa and bbb arguments before the current one is
matched correctly.</p>

<p>_regex_arguments _tst /$ [0]0 / ( /aa/ compadd aa| /bb/
compadd bb) This is similar, but either aaa or bbb may be
completed for any argument. In this case _regex_words could
be used to generate a suitable expression for the
arguments.</p>

<p>_regex_words tag description spec ... This function can
be used to generate arguments for the _regex_arguments
command which may be inserted at any point where a set of
rules is expected. The tag and description give a standard
tag and description pertaining to the current con- text.
Each spec contains two or three arguments separated by a
colon: note that there is no leading colon in this case.</p>

<p>Each spec gives one of a set of words that may be
completed at this point, together with arguments. It is thus
roughly equiva- lent to the _arguments function when used in
normal (non-regex) completion.</p>

<p>The part of the spec before the first colon is the word
to be completed. This may contain a *; the entire word,
before and after the * is completed, but only the text
before the * is required for the context to be matched, so
that further argu- ments may be completed after the
abbreviated form.</p>

<p>The second part of spec is a description for the word
being com- pleted.</p>

<p>The optional third part of the spec describes how words
follow- ing the one being completed are themselves to be
completed. It will be evaluated in order to avoid problems
with quoting. This means that typically it contains a
reference to an array con- taining previously generated
regex arguments.</p>

<p>The option -t term specifies a terminator for the word
instead of the usual space. This is handled as an
auto-removable suffix in the manner of the option -s sep to
_values.</p>

<p>The result of the processing by _regex_words is placed
in the array reply, which should be made local to the
calling function. If the set of words and arguments may be
matched repeatedly, a # should be appended to the generated
array at that point.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>local -a reply _regex_words mydb-commands mydb commands
add:add an entry to mydb:$mydb_add_cmds show:show entries in
mydb _regex_arguments _mydb &quot;$reply[@]&quot; _mydb
&quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p>This shows a completion function for a command mydb
which takes two command arguments, add and show. show takes
no arguments, while the arguments for add have already been
prepared in an array mydb_add_cmds, quite possibly by a
previous call to _regex_words.</p>

<p>_requested [ -x ] [ -12VJ ] tag [ name descr [ command
args ... ] ] This function is called to decide whether a tag
already regis- tered by a call to _tags (see below) has been
requested by the user and hence completion should be
performed for it. It returns status zero if the tag is
requested and non-zero other- wise. The function is
typically used as part of a loop over different tags as
follows:</p>

<p>_tags foo bar baz while _tags; do if _requested foo;
then ... # perform completion for foo fi ... # test the tags
bar and baz in the same way ... # exit loop if matches were
generated done</p>

<p>Note that the test for whether matches were generated is
not performed until the end of the _tags loop. This is so
that the user can set the tag-order style to specify a set
of tags to be completed at the same time.</p>

<p>If name and descr are given, _requested calls the
_description function with these arguments together with the
options passed to _requested.</p>

<p>If command is given, the _all_labels function will be
called immediately with the same arguments. In simple cases
this makes it possible to perform the test for the tag and
the matching in one go. For example:</p>

<p>local expl ret=1 _tags foo bar baz while _tags; do
_requested foo expl description compadd foobar foobaz
&amp;&amp; ret=0 ... (( ret )) || break done</p>

<p>If the command is not compadd, it must nevertheless be
prepared to handle the same options.</p>

<p>_retrieve_cache cache_identifier This function retrieves
completion information from the file given by
cache_identifier, stored in a directory specified by the
cache-path style which defaults to ~/.zcompcache. The return
status is zero if retrieval was successful. It will only
attempt retrieval if the use-cache style is set, so you can
call this function without worrying about whether the user
wanted to use the caching layer.</p>

<p>See _store_cache below for more details.</p>

<p>_sep_parts This function is passed alternating arrays
and separators as arguments. The arrays specify completions
for parts of strings to be separated by the separators. The
arrays may be the names of array parameters or a quoted list
of words in parentheses. For example, with the array
hosts=(ftp news) the call _sep_parts(foo bar) @ hosts will
complete the string f to foo and the string b@n to
bar@news.</p>

<p>This function accepts the compadd options -V, -J, -1,
-2, -n, -X, -M, -P, -S, -r, -R, and -q and passes them on to
the compadd builtin used to add the matches.</p>

<p>_setup tag [ group ] This function sets up the special
parameters used by the comple- tion system appropriately for
the tag given as the first argument. It uses the styles
list-colors, list-packed, list-rows-first, last-prompt,
accept-exact, menu and force-list.</p>

<p>The optional group supplies the name of the group in
which the matches will be placed. If it is not given, the
tag is used as the group name.</p>

<p>This function is called automatically from _description
and hence is not normally called explicitly.</p>

<p>_store_cache cache_identifier params ... This function,
together with _retrieve_cache and _cache_invalid, implements
a caching layer which can be used in any completion
function. Data obtained by costly operations are stored in
parameters; this function then dumps the values of those
parame- ters to a file. The data can then be retrieved
quickly from that file via _retrieve_cache, even in
different instances of the shell.</p>

<p>The cache_identifier specifies the file which the data
should be dumped to. The file is stored in a directory
specified by the cache-path style which defaults to
~/.zcompcache. The remaining params arguments are the
parameters to dump to the file.</p>

<p>The return status is zero if storage was successful. The
func- tion will only attempt storage if the use-cache style
is set, so you can call this function without worrying about
whether the user wanted to use the caching layer.</p>

<p>The completion function may avoid calling
_retrieve_cache when it already has the completion data
available as parameters. However, in that case it should
call _cache_invalid to check whether the data in the
parameters and in the cache are still valid.</p>

<p>See the _perl_modules completion function for a simple
example of the usage of the caching layer.</p>

<p>_tags [ [ -C name ] tags ... ] If called with arguments,
these are taken to be the names of tags valid for
completions in the current context. These tags are stored
internally and sorted by using the tag-order style.</p>

<p>Next, _tags is called repeatedly without arguments from
the same completion function. This successively selects the
first, sec- ond, etc. set of tags requested by the user. The
return status is zero if at least one of the tags is
requested and non-zero otherwise. To test if a particular
tag is to be tried, the _requested function should be called
(see above).</p>

<p>If -C name is given, name is temporarily stored in the
argu- ment field (the fifth) of the context in the
curcontext parame- ter during the call to _tags; the field
is restored on exit. This allows _tags to use a more
specific context without having to change and reset the
curcontext parameter (which has the same effect).</p>

<p>_values [ -O name ] [ -s sep ] [ -S sep ] [ -wC ] desc
spec ... This is used to complete arbitrary keywords
(values) and their arguments, or lists of such
combinations.</p>

<p>If the first argument is the option -O name, it will be
used in the same way as by the _arguments function. In other
words, the elements of the name array will be passed to
compadd when executing an action.</p>

<p>If the first argument (or the first argument after -O
name) is -s, the next argument is used as the character that
separates multiple values. This character is automatically
added after each value in an auto-removable fashion (see
below); all values completed by _values -s appear in the
same word on the command line, unlike completion using
_arguments. If this option is not present, only a single
value will be completed per word.</p>

<p>Normally, _values will only use the current word to
determine which values are already present on the command
line and hence are not to be completed again. If the -w
option is given, other arguments are examined as well.</p>

<p>The first non-option argument is used as a string to
print as a description before listing the values.</p>

<p>All other arguments describe the possible values and
their argu- ments in the same format used for the
description of options by the _arguments function (see
above). The only differences are that no minus or plus sign
is required at the beginning, values can have only one
argument, and the forms of action beginning with an equal
sign are not supported.</p>

<p>The character separating a value from its argument can
be set using the option -S (like -s, followed by the
character to use as the separator in the next argument). By
default the equals sign will be used as the separator
between values and arguments.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>_values -s , description *foo[bar]
(two)*one[number]:first count: two[another number]::second
count:(1 2 3)</p>

<p>This describes three possible values: foo , one , and
two. The first is described as bar, takes no argument and
may appear more than once. The second is described as
number, may appear more than once, and takes one mandatory
argument described as first count; no action is specified,
so it will not be completed. The (two) at the beginning says
that if the value one is on the line, the value two will no
longer be considered a possible completion. Finally, the
last value (two) is described as another number and takes an
optional argument described as second count for which the
completions (to appear after an =) are 1, 2, and 3 . The
_values function will complete lists of these values
separated by com- mas.</p>

<p>Like _arguments, this function temporarily adds another
context name component to the arguments element (the fifth)
of the cur- rent context while executing the action. Here
this name is just the name of the value for which the
argument is completed.</p>

<p>The style verbose is used to decide if the descriptions
for the values (but not those for the arguments) should be
printed.</p>

<p>The associative array val_args is used to report values
and their arguments; this works similarly to the opt_args
associa- tive array used by _arguments. Hence the function
calling _val- ues should declare the local parameters state,
line, context and val_args:</p>

<p>local context state line typeset -A val_args</p>

<p>when using an action of the form -&gt;string . With this
function the context parameter will be set to the name of
the value whose argument is to be completed.</p>

<p>Note also that _values normally adds the character used
as the separator between values as an auto-removable suffix
(similar to a / after a directory). However, this is not
possible for a -&gt;string action as the matches for the
argument are generated by the calling function. To get the
usual behaviour, the the calling function can add the
separator x as a suffix by passing the options -qS x either
directly or indirectly to compadd.</p>

<p>The option -C is treated in the same way as it is by
_arguments. In that case the parameter curcontext should be
made local instead of context (as described above).</p>

<p>_wanted [ -x ] [ -C name ] [ -12VJ ] tag name descr
command args ... In many contexts, completion can only
generate one particular set of matches, usually
corresponding to a single tag. However, it is still
necessary to decide whether the user requires matches of
this type. This function is useful in such a case.</p>

<p>The arguments to _wanted are the same as those to
_requested, i.e. arguments to be passed to _description.
However, in this case the command is not optional; all the
processing of tags, including the loop over both tags and
tag labels and the genera- tion of matches, is carried out
automatically by _wanted.</p>

<p>Hence to offer only one tag and immediately add the
correspond- ing matches with the given description:</p>

<p>local expl _wanted tag expl description compadd
matches...</p>

<p>Note that, as for _requested, the command must be able
to accept options to be passed down to compadd.</p>

<p>Like _tags this function supports the -C option to give
a dif- ferent name for the argument context field. The -x
option has the same meaning as for _description.</p>

<p>COMPLETION DIRECTORIES In the source distribution, the
files are contained in various subdi- rectories of the
Completion directory. They may have been installed in the
same structure, or into one single function directory. The
follow- ing is a description of the files found in the
original directory structure. If you wish to alter an
installed file, you will need to copy it to some directory
which appears earlier in your fpath than the standard
directory where it appears.</p>

<p>Base The core functions and special completion widgets
automatically bound to keys. You will certainly need most of
these, though will probably not need to alter them. Many of
these are docu- mented above.</p>

<p>Zsh Functions for completing arguments of shell builtin
commands and utility functions for this. Some of these are
also used by functions from the Unix directory.</p>

<p>Unix Functions for completing arguments of external
commands and suites of commands. They may need modifying for
your system, although in many cases some attempt is made to
decide which ver- sion of a command is present. For example,
completion for the mount command tries to determine the
system it is running on, while completion for many other
utilities try to decide whether the GNU version of the
command is in use, and hence whether the --help option is
supported.</p>

<p>X, AIX, BSD, ... Completion and utility function for
commands available only on some systems. These are not
arranged hierarchically, so, for example, both the Linux and
Debian directories, as well as the X directory, may be
useful on your system.</p>
