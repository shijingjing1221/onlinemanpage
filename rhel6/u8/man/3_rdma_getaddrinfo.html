<p>RDMA_GETADDRINFO(3) Librdmacm Programmer s Manual
RDMA_GETADDRINFO(3)</p>

<p>NAME rdma_getaddrinfo - Provides transport independent
address translation.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;rdma/rdma_cma.h&gt;</p>

<p>int rdma_getaddrinfo (char *node, char *service, struct
rdma_addrinfo *hints, struct rdma_addrinfo **res);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS node Optional, name, dotted-decimal IPv4, or
IPv6 hex address to resolve.</p>

<p>service Service name or port number of address.</p>

<p>hints Reference to an rdma_addrinfo structure containing
hints about the type of service the caller supports.</p>

<p>res A pointer to a linked list of rdma_addrinfo
structures con- taining response information.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Resolves the destination node and service
address and returns informa- tion needed to establish
communication. Provides the RDMA functional equivalent to
getaddrinfo.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error. If an
error occurs, errno will be set to indicate the failure
reason.</p>

<p>NOTES Either node, service, or hints must be provided.
If hints are pro- vided, the operation will be controlled by
hints.ai_flags. If RAI_PAS- SIVE is specified, the call will
resolve address information for use on the passive side of a
connection. If node is provided, rdma_getad- drinfo will
attempt to resolve the RDMA address, route, and connection
data to the given node. The hints parameter, if provided,
may be used to control the resulting output as indicated
below. If node is not given, rdma_getaddrinfo will attempt
to resolve the RDMA addressing information based on the
hints.ai_src_addr, hints.ai_dst_addr, or hints.ai_route.</p>

<p>rdma_addrinfo ai_flags Hint flags that control the
operation. Supported flags are:</p>

<p>RAI_PASSIVE Indicates that the results will be used on
the passive/lis- tening side of a connection.</p>

<p>RAI_NUMERICHOST If specified, then the node parameter,
if provided, must be a numerical network address. This flag
suppresses any lengthy address resolution.</p>

<p>RAI_NOROUTE If set, this flag suppresses any lengthy
route resolution.</p>

<p>RAI_FAMILY If set, the ai_family setting should be used
as an input hint for interpretting the node parameter.</p>

<p>ai_family Address family for the source and destination
address. Supported families are: AF_INET, AF_INET6, and
AF_IB.</p>

<p>ai_qp_type Indicates the type of RDMA QP used for
communication. Sup- ported types are: IBV_UD (unreliable
datagram) and IBV_RC (reliable connected).</p>

<p>ai_port_space RDMA port space in use. Supported values
are: RDMA_PS_UDP, RDMA_PS_TCP, and RDMA_PS_IB.</p>

<p>ai_src_len The length of the source address referenced
by ai_src_addr. This will be 0 if an appropriate source
address could not be discovered for a given destination.</p>

<p>ai_dst_len The length of the destination address
referenced by ai_dst_addr. This will be 0 if the RAI_PASSIVE
flag was specified as part of the hints.</p>

<p>ai_src_addr If provided, the address for the local RDMA
device.</p>

<p>ai_dst_addr If provided, the address for the destination
RDMA device.</p>

<p>ai_src_canonname The canonical for the source.</p>

<p>ai_dst_canonname The canonical for the destination.</p>

<p>ai_route_len Size of the routing information buffer
referenced by ai_route. This will be 0 if the underlying
transport does not require routing data, or none could be
resolved.</p>

<p>ai_route Routing information for RDMA transports that
require rout- ing data as part of connection establishment.
The format of the routing data depends on the underlying
transport. If Infiniband transports are used, ai_route will
reference an array of struct ibv_path_data on output, if
routing data is available. Routing paths may be restricted
by setting desired routing data fields on input to
rdma_getaddrinfo. For Infiniband, hints.ai_route may
reference an array of struct ibv_path_record or struct
ibv_path_data on input.</p>

<p>ai_connect_len Size of connection information referenced
by ai_connect. This will be 0 if the underlying transport
does not require additional connection information.</p>

<p>ai_connect Data exchanged as part of the connection
establishment pro- cess. If provided, ai_connect data must
be transferred as private data, with any user supplied
private data following it.</p>

<p>ai_next Pointer to the next rdma_addrinfo structure in
the list. Will be NULL if no more structures exist.</p>
