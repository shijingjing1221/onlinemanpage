<p>LD.SO(8) Linux Programmer s Manual LD.SO(8)</p>

<p>NAME ld.so, ld-linux.so* - dynamic linker/loader</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS The dynamic linker can be run either indirectly
by running some dynami- cally linked program or library (in
which case no command-line options to the dynamic linker can
be passed and, in the ELF case, the dynamic linker which is
stored in the .interp section of the program is exe- cuted)
or directly by running:</p>

<p>/lib/ld-linux.so.* [OPTIONS] [PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The programs ld.so and ld-linux.so* find and
load the shared libraries needed by a program, prepare the
program to run, and then run it.</p>

<p>Linux binaries require dynamic linking (linking at run
time) unless the -static option was given to ld(1) during
compilation.</p>

<p>The program ld.so handles a.out binaries, a format used
long ago; ld- linux.so* handles ELF (/lib/ld-linux.so.1 for
libc5, /lib/ld-linux.so.2 for glibc2), which everybody has
been using for years now. Otherwise both have the same
behavior, and use the same support files and pro- grams
ldd(1), ldconfig(8) and /etc/ld.so.conf.</p>

<p>The shared libraries needed by the program are searched
for in the fol- lowing order:</p>

<p>o (ELF only) Using the directories specified in the
DT_RPATH dynamic section attribute of the binary if present
and DT_RUNPATH attribute does not exist. Use of DT_RPATH is
deprecated.</p>

<p>o Using the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Except
if the exe- cutable is a set-user-ID/set-group-ID binary, in
which case it is ignored.</p>

<p>o (ELF only) Using the directories specified in the
DT_RUNPATH dynamic section attribute of the binary if
present.</p>

<p>o From the cache file /etc/ld.so.cache which contains a
compiled list of candidate libraries previously found in the
augmented library path. If, however, the binary was linked
with the -z nodeflib linker option, libraries in the default
library paths are skipped.</p>

<p>o In the default path /lib, and then /usr/lib. If the
binary was linked with the -z nodeflib linker option, this
step is skipped.</p>

<p>$ORIGIN and rpath ld.so understands the string $ORIGIN
(or equivalently ${ORIGIN}) in an rpath specification
(DT_RPATH or DT_RUNPATH) to mean the directory con- taining
the application executable. Thus, an application located in
somedir/app could be compiled with gcc
-Wl,-rpath,&rsquo;$ORIGIN/../lib&rsquo; so that it finds an
associated shared library in somedir/lib no matter where
somedir is located in the directory hierarchy. This
facilitates the creation of &quot;turn-key&quot;
applications that do not need to be installed into special
directories, but can instead be unpacked into any directory
and still find their own shared libraries.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --list List all dependencies and how they are
resolved.</p>

<p>--verify Verify that program is dynamically linked and
this dynamic linker can handle it.</p>

<p>--library-path PATH Override LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable setting (see below).</p>

<p>--inhibit-rpath LIST Ignore RPATH and RUNPATH
information in object names in LIST. This option is ignored
if ld.so is set-user-ID or set-group-ID.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT There are four important environment
variables.</p>

<p>LD_BIND_NOW (libc5; glibc since 2.1.1) If set to a
non-empty string, causes the dynamic linker to resolve all
symbols at program startup instead of deferring function
call resolution to the point when they are first referenced.
This is useful when using a debug- ger.</p>

<p>LD_LIBRARY_PATH A colon-separated list of directories in
which to search for ELF libraries at execution-time. Similar
to the PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>LD_PRELOAD A list of additional, user-specified, ELF
shared libraries to be loaded before all others. The items
of the list can be sepa- rated by spaces or colons. This can
be used to selectively override functions in other shared
libraries. The libraries are searched for using the rules
given under DESCRIPTION. For set- user-ID/set-group-ID ELF
binaries, preload pathnames containing slashes are ignored,
and libraries in the standard search direc- tories are
loaded only if the set-user-ID permission bit is enabled on
the library file.</p>

<p>LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS (ELF only) If set to a non-empty
string, causes the program to list its dynamic library
dependencies, as if run by ldd(1), instead of running
normally.</p>

<p>Then there are lots of more or less obscure variables,
many obsolete or only for internal use.</p>

<p>LD_AOUT_LIBRARY_PATH (libc5) Version of LD_LIBRARY_PATH
for a.out binaries only. Old versions of ld-linux.so.1 also
supported LD_ELF_LIBRARY_PATH.</p>

<p>LD_AOUT_PRELOAD (libc5) Version of LD_PRELOAD for a.out
binaries only. Old ver- sions of ld-linux.so.1 also
supported LD_ELF_PRELOAD.</p>

<p>LD_AUDIT (glibc since 2.4) A colon-separated list of
user-specified, ELF shared objects to be loaded before all
others in a separate linker namespace (i.e., one that does
not intrude upon the nor- mal symbol bindings that would
occur in the process). These libraries can be used to audit
the operation of the dynamic linker. LD_AUDIT is ignored for
set-user-ID/set-group-ID bina- ries.</p>

<p>The dynamic linker will notify the audit libraries at
so-called auditing checkpoints for example, loading a new
library, resolv- ing a symbol, or calling a symbol from
another shared objectby calling an appropriate function
within the audit library. For details, see rtld-audit(7).
The auditing interface is largely compatible with that
provided on Solaris, as described in its Linker and
Libraries Guide, in the chapter Runtime Linker Audit- ing
Interface.</p>

<p>LD_BIND_NOT (glibc since 2.1.95) Do not update the GOT
(global offset table) and PLT (procedure linkage table)
after resolving a symbol.</p>

<p>LD_DEBUG (glibc since 2.1) Output verbose debugging
information about the dynamic linker. If set to all prints
all debugging information it has, if set to help prints a
help message about which cate- gories can be specified in
this environment variable. Since glibc 2.3.4, LD_DEBUG is
ignored for set-user-ID/set-group-ID binaries.</p>

<p>LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT (glibc since 2.1) File where LD_DEBUG
output should be fed into, default is standard output.
LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT is ignored for set- user-ID/set-group-ID
binaries.</p>

<p>LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK (glibc since 2.1.91) Allow weak symbols
to be overridden (reverting to old glibc behavior). For
security reasons, since glibc 2.3.4, LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK is
ignored for set-user-ID/set- group-ID binaries.</p>

<p>LD_HWCAP_MASK (glibc since 2.1) Mask for hardware
capabilities.</p>

<p>LD_KEEPDIR (a.out only)(libc5) Don t ignore the
directory in the names of a.out libraries to be loaded. Use
of this option is strongly discouraged.</p>

<p>LD_NOWARN (a.out only)(libc5) Suppress warnings about
a.out libraries with incompatible minor version numbers.</p>

<p>LD_ORIGIN_PATH (glibc since 2.1) Path where the binary
is found (for non-set- user-ID programs). For security
reasons, since glibc 2.4, LD_ORIGIN_PATH is ignored for
set-user-ID/set-group-ID binaries.</p>

<p>LD_POINTER_GUARD (glibc since 2.4) Set to 0 to disable
pointer guarding. Any other value enables pointer guarding,
which is also the default. Pointer guarding is a security
mechanism whereby some pointers to code stored in writable
program memory (return addresses saved by setjmp(3) or
function pointers used by various glibc internals) are
mangled semi-randomly to make it more difficult for an
attacker to hijack the pointers for use in the event of a
buffer overrun or stack-smashing attack.</p>

<p>LD_PROFILE (glibc since 2.1) Shared object to be
profiled, specified either as a pathname or a soname.
Profiling output is written to the file whose name is:
&quot;$LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT/$LD_PROFILE.profile&quot;.</p>

<p>LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT (glibc since 2.1) Directory where
LD_PROFILE output should be written. If this variable is not
defined, or is defined as an empty string, then the default
is /var/tmp. LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT is ignored for set-user-ID
and set-group-ID programs, which always use
/var/profile.</p>

<p>LD_SHOW_AUXV (glibc since 2.1) Show auxiliary array
passed up from the ker- nel. For security reasons, since
glibc 2.3.5, LD_SHOW_AUXV is ignored for
set-user-ID/set-group-ID binaries.</p>

<p>LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS By default (i.e., if this variable is
not defined) executables and prelinked shared objects will
honor base addresses of their dependent libraries and
(non-prelinked) position-independent executables (PIEs) and
other shared objects will not honor them. If
LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS is defined wit the value, both executables
and PIEs will honor the base addresses. If LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS
is defined with the value 0, neither executables nor PIEs
will honor the base addresses. This variable is ignored by
set-user- ID and set-group-ID programs.</p>

<p>LD_VERBOSE (glibc since 2.1) If set to a non-empty
string, output symbol versioning information about the
program if querying information about the program (i.e.,
either LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS has been set, or --list or
--verify options have been given to the dynamic linker).</p>

<p>LD_WARN (ELF only)(glibc since 2.1.3) If set to a
non-empty string, warn about unresolved symbols.</p>

<p>LDD_ARGV0 (libc5) argv[0] to be used by ldd(1) when none
is present.</p>

<p>FILES /lib/ld.so a.out dynamic linker/loader
/lib/ld-linux.so.{1,2} ELF dynamic linker/loader
/etc/ld.so.cache File containing a compiled list of
directories in which to search for libraries and an ordered
list of candidate libraries. /etc/ld.so.preload File
containing a whitespace separated list of ELF shared
libraries to be loaded before the program. lib*.so* shared
libraries</p>

<p>NOTES The ld.so functionality is available for
executables compiled using libc version 4.4.3 or greater.
ELF functionality is available since Linux 1.1.52 and
libc5.</p>
