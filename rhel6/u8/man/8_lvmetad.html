<p>NAME lvmetad LVM metadata cache daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lvmetad [-l level[,level...]] [-p pidfile_path]
[-s socket_path] [-t timeout_value] [-f] [-h] [-V] [-?]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The lvmetad daemon caches LVM metadata, so
that LVM commands can read metadata without scanning
disks.</p>

<p>Metadata caching can be an advantage because scanning
disks is time consuming and may interfere with the normal
work of the system and disks.</p>

<p>lvmetad does not read metadata from disks itself. The
pvscan --cache command scans disks, reads the LVM metadata
and sends it to lvmetad.</p>

<p>New LVM disks that appear on the system must be scanned
by pvscan before lvmetad knows about them. If lvmetad does
not know about a disk, then LVM commands using lvmetad will
also not know about it. When disks are added or removed from
the system, lvmetad must be updated.</p>

<p>lvmetad is usually combined with event-based system
services that auto- matically run pvscan --cache on new
disks. This way, the lvmetad cache is automatically updated
with metadata from new disks when they appear. LVM udev
rules and systemd services implement this automation. Auto-
matic scanning is usually combined with automatic
activation. For more information, see pvscan(8).</p>

<p>If lvmetad is started or restarted after disks have been
added to the system, or if the global_filter has changed,
the cache must be updated by running pvscan --cache.</p>

<p>When lvmetad is not used, LVM commands revert to
scanning disks for LVM metadata.</p>

<p>Use of lvmetad is enabled/disabled by: lvm.conf(5)
global/use_lvmetad</p>

<p>For more information on this setting, see: lvmconfig
--withcomments global/use_lvmetad</p>

<p>To ignore disks from LVM at the system level, e.g.
lvmetad, pvscan use: lvm.conf(5) devices/global_filter</p>

<p>For more information on this setting, see lvmconfig
--withcomments devices/global_filter</p>

<p>OPTIONS To run the daemon in a test environment both the
pidfile_path and the socket_path should be changed from the
defaults.</p>

<p>-f Dont fork, but run in the foreground.</p>

<p>-h, -? Show help information.</p>

<p>-l levels Specify the levels of log messages to generate
as a comma sepa- rated list. Messages are logged by syslog.
Additionally, when -f is given they are also sent to
standard error. Possible lev- els are: all, fatal, error,
warn, info, wire, debug.</p>

<p>-p pidfile_path Path to the pidfile. This overrides both
the built-in default (/var/run/lvmetad.pid) and the
environment variable LVM_LVMETAD_PIDFILE. This file is used
to prevent more than one instance of the daemon running
simultaneously.</p>

<p>-s socket_path Path to the socket file. This overrides
both the built-in default (/var/run/lvm/lvmetad.socket) and
the environment vari- able LVM_LVMETAD_SOCKET. To
communicate successfully with lvmetad, all LVM2 processes
should use the same socket path.</p>

<p>-t timeout_value The daemon may shutdown after being
idle for the given time (in seconds). When the option is
omitted or the value given is zero the daemon never
shutdowns on idle.</p>

<p>-V Display the version of lvmetad daemon.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES LVM_LVMETAD_PIDFILE Path for the
pid file.</p>

<p>LVM_LVMETAD_SOCKET Path for the socket file.</p>
