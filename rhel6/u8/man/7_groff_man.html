<p>NAME groff_man - groff man macros to support generation
of man pages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groff -man [ options... ] [ files... ] groff -m
man [ options... ] [ files... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The man macros used to generate man pages
with groff were written by James Clark. This document
provides a brief summary of the use of each macro in that
package.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The man macros understand the following command
line options (which define various registers).</p>

<p>-rLL=line-length Set line length. If this option is not
given, the line length defaults to 78n in nroff mode and
6.5i in troff mode.</p>

<p>-rLT=title-length Set title length. If this option is
not given, the title length defaults to 78n in nroff mode
and 6.5i in troff mode.</p>

<p>-rcR=1 This option (the default if in nroff mode) will
create a single, very long page instead of multiple pages.
Say -rcR=0 to disable it.</p>

<p>-rC1 If more than one manual page is given on the
command line, num- ber the pages continuously, rather than
starting each at 1.</p>

<p>-rD1 Double-sided printing. Footers for even and odd
pages are for- matted differently.</p>

<p>-rPnnn Enumeration of pages will start with nnn rather
than with 1.</p>

<p>-rSxx Base document font size is xx points (xx can be
10, 11, or 12) rather than 10 points.</p>

<p>-rXnnn After page nnn, number pages as nnna, nnnb, nnnc,
etc. For example, the option -rX2 will produce the following
page num- bers: 1, 2, 2a, 2b, 2c, etc.</p>

<p>USAGE This section describes the available macros for
manual pages. For fur- ther customization, put additional
macros and requests into the file man.local which will be
loaded immediately after the man package.</p>

<p>.TH title section [extra1] [extra2] [extra3] Sets the
title of the man page to title and the section to sec- tion,
which must take on a value between 1 and 8. The value
section may also have a string appended, e.g. .pm , to
indicate a specific subsection of the man pages. Both title
and section are positioned at the left and right in the
header line (with section in parentheses immediately
appended to title. extra1 will be positioned in the middle
of the footer line. extra2 will be positioned at the left in
the footer line (resp. at the left on even pages and at the
right on odd pages if double-sided printing is active).
extra3 is centered in the header line.</p>

<p>For HTML output, headers and footers are completely
supressed.</p>

<p>Additionally, this macro starts a new page; the new line
number is 1 again (except if the -rC1 option is given on the
command line) -- this feature is intended only for
formatting multiple man pages; a single man page should
contain exactly one TH macro at the beginning of the
file.</p>

<p>.SH [text for a heading] Sets up an unnumbered section
heading sticking out to the left. Prints out all the text
following SH up to the end of the line (resp. the text in
the next input line if there is no argument to SH) in bold
face, one size larger than the base document size.
Additionally, the left margin for the following text is
reset to its default value.</p>

<p>.SS [text for a heading] Sets up an secondary,
unnumbered section heading. Prints out all the text
following SS up to the end of the line (resp. the text in
the next input line if there is no argument to SS) in bold
face, at the same size as the base document size. Addi-
tionally, the left margin for the following text is reset to
its default value.</p>

<p>.TP [nnn] Sets up an indented paragraph with label. The
indentation is set to nnn if that argument is supplied (the
default unit is n if omitted), otherwise it is set to the
default indentation value. The first input line of text
following this macro is interpreted as a string to be
printed flush-left, as it is appropriate for a label. It is
not interpreted as part of a paragraph, so there is no
attempt to fill the first line with text from the following
input lines. Nevertheless, if the label is not as wide as
the indentation, then the paragraph starts at the same line
(but indented), continuing on the following lines. If the
label is wider than the indentation, then the descriptive
part of the paragraph begins on the line following the
label, entirely indented. Note that neither font shape nor
font size of the label is set to a default value; on the
other hand, the rest of the text will have default font
settings. The TP macro is the macro used for the
explanations you are just reading.</p>

<p>.LP .PP .P These macros are mutual aliases. Any of them
causes a line break at the current position, followed by a
vertical space downwards by the amount specified by the PD
macro. The font size and shape are reset to the default
value (10pt resp. Roman). Finally, the current left margin
is restored.</p>

<p>.IP [designator] [nnn] Sets up an indented paragraph,
using designator as a tag to mark its beginning. The
indentation is set to nnn if that argument is supplied
(default unit is n ), otherwise the default inden- tation
value is used. Font size and face of the paragraph (but not
the designator) are reset to its default values. To start an
indented paragraph with a particular indentation but without
a designator, use &quot;&quot; (two doublequotes) as the
second argu- ment.</p>

<p>For example, the following paragraphs were all set up
with bul- lets as the designator, using .IP &bull; 4:</p>

<p>&middot; IP is one of the three macros used in the man
package to format lists.</p>

<p>&middot; HP is another. This macro produces a paragraph
with a left hanging indentation.</p>

<p>&middot; TP is another. This macro produces an
unindented label fol- lowed by an indented paragraph.</p>

<p>.HP [nnn] Sets up a paragraph with hanging left
indentation. The indenta- tion is set to nnn if that
argument is supplied (default unit is n ), otherwise the
default indentation value is used. Font size and face are
reset to its default values. The following paragraph
illustrates the effect of this macro with hanging
indentation set to 4:</p>

<p>This is a paragraph following an invocation of the HP
macro. As you can see, it produces a paragraph where all
lines but the first are indented.</p>

<p>.RS [nnn] This macro moves the left margin to the right
by the value nnn if specified (default unit is n); otherwise
the default inden- tation value is used. Calls to the RS
macro can be nested.</p>

<p>.RE [nnn] This macro moves the left margin back to level
nnn; if no argu- ment is given, it moves one level back. The
first level (i.e., no call to RS yet) has number 1, and each
call to RS increases the level by 1.</p>

<p>To summarize, the following macros cause a line break
with the inser- tion of vertical space (which amount can be
changed with the PD macro): SH, SS, TP, LP (PP, P), IP, and
HP. The macros RS and RE also cause a break but no insertion
of vertical space. Finally, the macros SH, SS, LP (PP, P),
and RS reset the indentation to its default value.</p>

<p>MACROS TO SET FONTS The standard font is Roman; the
default text size is 10 point.</p>

<p>.SM [text] Causes the text on the same line or the text
on the next input line to appear in a font that is one point
size smaller than the default font.</p>

<p>.SB [text] Causes the text on the same line or the text
on the next input line to appear in boldface font, one point
size smaller than the default font.</p>

<p>.BI text Causes text on the same line to appear
alternately in bold face and italic. The text must be on the
same line as the macro call. Thus</p>

<p>.BI this &quot;word and&quot; that</p>

<p>would cause this and that to appear in bold face, while
word and appears in italics.</p>

<p>.IB text Causes text to appear alternately in italic and
bold face. The text must be on the same line as the macro
call.</p>

<p>.RI text Causes text on the same line to appear
alternately in roman and italic. The text must be on the
same line as the macro call.</p>

<p>.IR text Causes text on the same line to appear
alternately in italic and roman. The text must be on the
same line as the macro call.</p>

<p>.BR text Causes text on the same line to appear
alternately in bold face and roman. The text must be on the
same line as the macro call.</p>

<p>.RB text Causes text on the same line to appear
alternately in roman and bold face. The text must be on the
same line as the macro call.</p>

<p>.B [text] Causes text to appear in bold face. If no text
is present on the line where the macro is called, then the
text of the next input line appears in bold face.</p>

<p>.I [text] Causes text to appear in italic. If no text is
present on the line where the macro is called, then the text
of the next input line appears in italic.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS The default indentation is 7.2n for all
output devices except for gro- html which ignores
indentation.</p>

<p>.DT Sets tabs every 0.5 inches. Since this macro is
always called during a TH request, it makes sense to call it
only if the tab positions have been changed.</p>

<p>.PD [nnn] Adjusts the empty space before a new paragraph
(resp. section). The optional argument gives the amount of
space (default units are v); without parameter, the value is
reset to its default value (1 line for tty devices, 0.4v
otherwise). This affects the macros SH, SS, TP, LP (resp. PP
and P), IP, and HP.</p>

<p>The following strings are defined:</p>

<p>*S Switch back to the default font size.</p>

<p>*R The registered sign.</p>

<p>*(Tm The trademark sign.</p>

<p>*(lq *(rq Left and right quote. This is equal to &ldquo;
and &rdquo; , respectively.</p>

<p>If a preprocessor like tbl or eqn is needed, it has
become usage to make the first line of the man page look
like this:</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Note the single space character after the double quote.
word consists of letters for the needed preprocessors: e for
eqn, r for refer, and t for tbl. Modern implementations of
the man program read this first line and automatically call
the right preprocessor(s).</p>

<p>FILES man.tmac an.tmac These are wrapper files to call
andoc.tmac.</p>

<p>andoc.tmac This file checks whether the man macros or
the mdoc package should be used.</p>

<p>an-old.tmac All man macros are contained in this
file.</p>

<p>man.local Local changes and customizations should be put
into this file.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO Since the man macros consist of groups of groff
requests, one can, in principle, supplement the
functionality of the man macros with individ- ual groff
requests where necessary. A complete list of these requests
is available on the WWW at</p>
