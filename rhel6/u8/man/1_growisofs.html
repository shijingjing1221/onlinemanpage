<p>NAME growisofs - combined mkisofs frontend/DVD recording
program.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS growisofs [-dry-run] [-dvd-compat] [-overburn]
[-speed=1] -[Z|M] /dev/dvd &lt;mkisofs-options&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION growisofs was originally designed as a
frontend to mkisofs to facili- tate appending of data to
ISO9660 volumes residing on random-access media such as
DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, plain files, hard disk partitions. In the
course of development general purpose DVD recording support
was implemented, and as of now growisofs supports not only
random-access media, but even mastering of multisession DVD
media such as DVD+R and DVD-R/-RW, as well as Blu-ray Disc.
In addition growisofs supports first-/single-session
recording of arbitrary pre-mastered image (for- matted as
UDF, ISO9660 or any other file system, if formatted at all)
to all supported DVD media types.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -Z /dev/dvd Burn an initial session to the
selected device. A special form of this option is recognized
to support burning of pre-mastered images. See EXAMPLES
section for further details.</p>

<p>-M /dev/dvd Merge a new session to an existing one.</p>

<p>-version Print version information and invoke mkisofs,
also with -version option.</p>

<p>-dvd-compat Provide maximum media compatibility with
DVD-ROM/-Video. In write-once DVD+R or DVD-R context this
results in unappendable recording (closed disk). In DVD+RW
context it instructs the log- ical unit to explicitly burn
[otherwise optional] lead-out.</p>

<p>-dry-run At dry-run growisofs performs all the steps
till, but not including the first write operation. Most
notably check for &quot;overburn&quot; condition is
performed, which implies that mkisofs is invoked and
terminated prematurely.</p>

<p>-overburn Normally single layer DVD media can
accommodate up to approxi- mately 4.700.000.000 bytes (in
marketing speech 4.7GB). In other words a DVD can contain
about 4.377 GiB or 4482 MiB. Same kind of arithmetics
applies to Blu-ray Disc capacity of 25.000.000.000 bytes.
Anyway, growisofs wont start without this option, if
&quot;overburn&quot; condition appears to be
unavoidable.</p>

<p>-speed=N An option to control recording velocity. Most
commonly youll use -speed=1 with &quot;no-name&quot; media,
if default speed setting messes up the media. Keep in mind
that N essentially denotes speed closest to N*1385KBps in
DVD or N*4496KBps in Blu-ray Disc case among those offered
by unit for currently mounted media. The list can be found
in dvd+rw-mediainfo output. Note that Blu-ray Disc
recordings are commonly performed at ~1/2 of advertised
speed, because of defect management being in effect.</p>

<p>&lt;mkisofs-options&gt; More options can be found in the
manpage for mkisofs.</p>

<p>There are several undocumented options commonly denoted
with -use-the-force-luke prefix. Some of them serve
debugging purposes. Some require certain knowledge about
recording process or even OS kernel internals and as being
such can induce confusing behaviour. Some are to be used in
very specific situations better recognized by front-ends or
automated scripts. Rationale behind leaving these options
undocumented is that those few users who would actually need
to use them directly can as well consult the source code or
obtain specific instructions elsewhere.</p>

<p>DIFFERENCES WITH RUNNING MKISOFS DIRECTLY When using
growisofs you may not use the -o option for an output file.
growisofs dumps the image directly to the media;</p>

<p>You dont have to specify the -C option to create a
higher level ses- sion on a multisession disk, growisofs
will construct one for you;</p>

<p>Otherwise everything that applies to [multisession]
mastering with mkisofs applies to growisofs as well.
growisofs needs at least mkisofs version 1.14, version 2.0
is required for multisession write-once recordings.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Actual device names vary from one operating
system to another. We use /dev/dvd as a collective name or
as symbolic link to the actual device if you wish. Under
Linux it will most likely be an ide-scsi device such as
&quot;/dev/scd0.&quot; Under NetBSD/OpenBSD it has to be a
character SCSI CD-ROM device such as &quot;/dev/rcd0c.&quot;
Under Solaris it also has to be a character SCSI/ATAPI
CD-ROM device, e.g. &quot;/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s2&quot; or
&quot;/vol/dev/aliases/cdrom0.&quot; And likewise in HP-UX,
IRIX and Mac OS X...</p>

<p>To master and burn an ISO9660 volume with Joliet and
Rock-Ridge exten- sions on a DVD or Blu-ray Disc:</p>

<p>growisofs -Z /dev/dvd -R -J /some/files</p>

<p>To append more data to same media:</p>

<p>growisofs -M /dev/dvd -R -J /more/files</p>

<p>Make sure to use the same options for both initial
burning and when appending data.</p>

<p>To finalize the multisession DVD maintaining maximum
compatibility:</p>

<p>growisofs -M /dev/dvd=/dev/zero</p>

<p>To use growisofs to write a pre-mastered ISO-image to a
DVD:</p>

<p>growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/dvd=image.iso</p>

<p>where image.iso represents an arbitrary object in the
filesystem, such as file, named pipe or device entry.
Nothing is growing here and com- mand name is not intuitive
in this context.</p>

<p>NOTES If executed under sudo(8) growisofs refuses to
start. This is done for the following reason. Naturally
growisofs has to access the data set to be recorded to
optical media, either indirectly by letting mkisofs gen-
erate ISO9660 layout on-the-fly or directly if a
pre-mastered image is to be recorded. Being executed under
sudo(8), growisofs effectively grants sudoers read access to
any file in the file system. The situa- tion is intensified
by the fact that growisofs parses MKISOFS environ- ment
variable in order to determine alternative path to mkisofs
exe- cutable image. This means that being executed under
sudo(8), growisofs effectively grants sudoers right to
execute program of their choice with elevated privileges. If
you for any reason still find the above acceptable and are
willing to take the consequences, then consider run- ning
following wrapper script under sudo(8) in place for real
growisofs binary.</p>

<p>#!/bin/ksh unset SUDO_COMMAND export
MKISOFS=/path/to/trusted/mkisofs exec growisofs
&quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p>But note that the recommended alternative to the above
&quot;workaround&quot; is actually to install growisofs
set-root-uid, in which case it will drop privileges prior
accessing data or executing mkisofs in order to pre- clude
unauthorized access to the data.</p>

<p>If the media already carries isofs and growisofs is
invoked with -Z option non-interactively, e.g. through cron,
it shall fail with &quot;FATAL: /dev/dvd already carries
isofs!&quot; Note that only ISO9660 is recognized, you can
perfectly zap e.g. an UDF filesystem non-interactively.
Recom- mendation is to prepare media for unattended usage by
re-formatting or nullifying first 64KB in advance.</p>

<p>&quot;Overburn&quot; protection in pre-mastered image
context works only with plain files and ISO9660 formatted
volumes. E.g. [given that /dev/root is an ext2 formatted
file system larger than 4.7GB] /dev/dvd=/dev/root is bound
to produce corrupted recording.</p>

<p>Note that DVD+RW re-formatting procedure does not
substitute for blank- ing. If you want to nullify the media,
e.g. for privacy reasons, do it explicitly with growisofs -Z
/dev/dvd=/dev/zero.</p>

<p>Playback of re-writable DVD media, both DVD+RW and
DVD-RW, might be limited in legacy DVD-ROM/-Video units. In
most cases this is due to lower reflectivity of such
media.</p>

<p>Even though growisofs supports it, playback of
multisession write-once DVD might be limited to the first
session for two reasons:</p>

<p>&middot; not all DVD-ROM players are capable of
multi-border DVD-R play- back, even less are aware of DVD+R
multisessioning, burner unit therefore might be the only one
in your vicinity capable of accessing files written at
different occasions;</p>

<p>&middot; OS might fail to mount multisession DVD for
various reasons;</p>

<p>The above is not applicable to DVD+RW, DVD-RW Restricted
Overwrite, DVD-RAM or Blu-ray Disc, as volumes are grown
within a single session.</p>

<p>When growisofs &quot;runs into&quot; blank Blu-ray Disc
media, BD-RE or BD-R, it gets pre-formatted with minimal
spare area size of 256MB.</p>
