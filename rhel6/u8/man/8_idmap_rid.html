<p>NAME idmap_rid - Samba&rsquo;s idmap_rid Backend for
Winbind</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The idmap_rid backend provides a way to use
an algorithmic mapping scheme to map UIDs/GIDs and SIDs. No
database is required in this case as the mapping is
deterministic.</p>

<p>Note that the idmap_rid module has changed considerably
since Samba versions 3.0. and 3.2. Currently, there should
to be an explicit idmap configuration for each domain that
should use the idmap_rid backend, using disjoint ranges. One
usually needs to define a writeable default idmap range,
using a backent like tdb or ldap that can create unix ids,
in order to be able to map the BUILTIN sids and other
domains, and also in order to be able to create group
mappings. See the example below.</p>

<p>Note that the old syntax idmap backend =
rid:&quot;DOM1=range DOM2=range2 ...&quot; is not supported
any more since Samba version 3.0.25.</p>

<p>IDMAP OPTIONS range = low - high Defines the available
matching uid and gid range for which the backend is
authoritative. Note that the range acts as a filter. If
algorithmically determined UID or GID fall outside the
range, they are ignored and the corresponding map is
discarded. It is intended as a way to avoid accidental
UID/GID overlaps between local and remotely defined IDs.</p>

<p>base_rid = INTEGER Defines the base integer used to
build SIDs out of a UID or a GID, and to rebase the UID or
GID to be obtained from a SID. This means SIDs with a RID
less than the base rid are filtered. The default is not to
restrict the allowed rids at all, i.e. a base_rid value of
0. A good value for the base_rid can be 1000, since user
RIDs by default start at 1000 (512 hexadecimal).</p>

<p>Use of this parameter is deprecated.</p>

<p>THE MAPPING FORMULAS The Unix ID for a RID is calculated
this way:</p>

<p>ID = RID - BASE_RID + LOW_RANGE_ID.</p>

<p>Correspondingly, the formula for calculating the RID for
a given Unix ID is this:</p>

<p>RID = ID + BASE_RID - LOW_RANGE_ID.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This example shows how to configure two domains
with idmap_rid, the principal domain and a trusted domain,
leaving the default id mapping scheme at tdb. The example
also demonstrates the use of the base_rid parameter for the
trusted domain.</p>

<p>[global] security = domain workgroup = MAIN</p>

<p>idmap config * : backend = tdb idmap config * : range =
1000000-1999999</p>

<p>idmap config MAIN : backend = rid idmap config MAIN :
range = 10000 - 49999</p>

<p>idmap config TRUSTED : backend = rid idmap config
TRUSTED : range = 50000 - 99999 idmap config TRUSTED :
base_rid = 1000</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
