<p>SEM_DESTROY(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SEM_DESTROY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sem_destroy - destroy an unnamed semaphore
(REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;semaphore.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sem_destroy(sem_t *sem);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sem_destroy() function shall destroy the
unnamed semaphore indi- cated by sem. Only a semaphore that
was created using sem_init() may be destroyed using
sem_destroy(); the effect of calling sem_destroy() with a
named semaphore is undefined. The effect of subsequent use
of the semaphore sem is undefined until sem is reinitialized
by another call to sem_init().</p>

<p>It is safe to destroy an initialized semaphore upon
which no threads are currently blocked. The effect of
destroying a semaphore upon which other threads are
currently blocked is undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, a value of zero
shall be returned. Other- wise, a value of -1 shall be
returned and errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sem_destroy() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The sem argument is not a valid semaphore.</p>

<p>The sem_destroy() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EBUSY There are currently processes blocked on the
semaphore.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The sem_destroy() function is part of
the Semaphores option and need not be available on all
implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
