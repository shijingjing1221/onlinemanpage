<p>PERL583DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL583DELTA(1)</p>

<p>NAME perl583delta - what is new for perl v5.8.3</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes differences between
the 5.8.2 release and the 5.8.3 release.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as
5.6.1, first read the perl58delta, which describes
differences between 5.6.0 and 5.8.0, and the perl581delta
and perl582delta, which describe differences between 5.8.0,
5.8.1 and 5.8.2</p>

<p>Incompatible Changes There are no changes incompatible
with 5.8.2.</p>

<p>Core Enhancements A &quot;SCALAR&quot; method is now
available for tied hashes. This is called when a tied hash
is used in scalar context, such as</p>

<p>if (%tied_hash) { ... }</p>

<p>The old behaviour was that %tied_hash would return
whatever would have been returned for that hash before the
hash was tied (so usually 0). The new behaviour in the
absence of a SCALAR method is to return TRUE if in the
middle of an &quot;each&quot; iteration, and otherwise call
FIRSTKEY to check if the hash is empty (making sure that a
subsequent &quot;each&quot; will also begin by calling
FIRSTKEY). Please see &quot;SCALAR&quot; in perltie for the
full details and caveats.</p>

<p>Modules and Pragmata CGI Cwd Digest Digest::MD5 Encode
File::Spec FindBin A function &quot;again&quot; is provided
to resolve problems where modules in different directories
wish to use FindBin.</p>

<p>List::Util You can now weaken references to read only
values.</p>

<p>Math::BigInt PodParser Pod::Perldoc POSIX
Unicode::Collate Unicode::Normalize Test::Harness
threads::shared &quot;cond_wait&quot; has a new two argument
form. &quot;cond_timedwait&quot; has been added.</p>

<p>Utility Changes &quot;find2perl&quot; now assumes
&quot;-print&quot; as a default action. Previously, it
needed to be specified explicitly.</p>

<p>A new utility, &quot;prove&quot;, makes it easy to run
an individual regression test at the command line.
&quot;prove&quot; is part of Test::Harness, which users of
earlier Perl versions can install from CPAN.</p>

<p>New Documentation The documentation has been revised in
places to produce more standard manpages.</p>

<p>The documentation for the special code blocks (BEGIN,
CHECK, INIT, END) has been improved.</p>

<p>Installation and Configuration Improvements Perl now
builds on OpenVMS I64</p>

<p>Selected Bug Fixes Using substr() on a UTF8 string could
cause subsequent accesses on that string to return garbage.
This was due to incorrect UTF8 offsets being cached, and is
now fixed.</p>

<p>join() could return garbage when the same join()
statement was used to process 8 bit data having earlier
processed UTF8 data, due to the flags on that statements
temporary workspace not being reset correctly. This is now
fixed.</p>

<p>&quot;$a .. $b&quot; will now work as expected when
either $a or $b is &quot;undef&quot;</p>

<p>Using Unicode keys with tied hashes should now work
correctly.</p>

<p>Reading $^E now preserves $!. Previously, the C code
implementing $^E did not preserve &quot;errno&quot;, so
reading $^E could cause &quot;errno&quot; and therefore $!
to change unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Reentrant functions will (once more) work with C++.
5.8.2 introduced a bugfix which accidentally broke the
compilation of Perl extensions written in C++</p>

<p>New or Changed Diagnostics The fatal error &quot;DESTROY
created new reference to dead object&quot; is now documented
in perldiag.</p>

<p>Changed Internals The hash code has been refactored to
reduce source duplication. The external interface is
unchanged, and aside from the bug fixes described above,
there should be no change in behaviour.</p>

<p>&quot;hv_clear_placeholders&quot; is now part of the
perl API</p>

<p>Some C macros have been tidied. In particular macros
which create temporary local variables now name these
variables more defensively, which should avoid bugs where
names clash.</p>

<p>&lt;signal.h&gt; is now always included.</p>

<p>Configuration and Building &quot;Configure&quot; now
invokes callbacks regardless of the value of the variable
they are called for. Previously callbacks were only invoked
in the &quot;case $variable $define)&quot; branch. This
change should only affect platform maintainers writing
configuration hints files.</p>

<p>Platform Specific Problems The regression test
ext/threads/shared/t/wait.t fails on early RedHat 9 and
HP-UX 10.20 due to bugs in their threading implementations.
RedHat users should see
https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2003-136.html and
consider upgrading their glibc.</p>

<p>Known Problems Detached threads arent supported on
Windows yet, as they may lead to memory access violation
problems.</p>

<p>There is a known race condition opening scripts in
&quot;suidperl&quot;. &quot;suidperl&quot; is neither built
nor installed by default, and has been deprecated since perl
5.8.0. You are advised to replace use of suidperl with tools
such as sudo ( http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ )</p>

<p>We have a backlog of unresolved bugs. Dealing with bugs
and bug reports is unglamorous work; not something ideally
suited to volunteer labour, but that is all that we
have.</p>

<p>The perl5 development team are implementing changes to
help address this problem, which should go live in early
2004.</p>

<p>Future Directions Code freeze for the next maintenance
release (5.8.4) is on March 31st 2004, with release expected
by mid April. Similarly 5.8.5s freeze will be at the end of
June, with release by mid July.</p>

<p>Obituary Iain Spoon Truskett, Perl hacker, author of
perlreref and contributor to CPAN, died suddenly on 29th
December 2003, aged 24. He will be missed.</p>

<p>Reporting Bugs If you find what you think is a bug, you
might check the articles recently posted to the
comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://bugs.perl.org. There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org, the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run
the perlbug program included with your release. Be sure to
trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your
bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the
Perl porting team. You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs
at http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
