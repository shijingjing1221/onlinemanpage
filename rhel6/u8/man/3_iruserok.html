<p>RCMD(3) Linux Programmer s Manual RCMD(3)</p>

<p>NAME rcmd, rresvport, iruserok, ruserok - routines for
returning a stream to a remote command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;netdb.h&gt; /* Or &lt;unistd.h&gt;
on some systems */</p>

<p>int rcmd(char **ahost, int inport, const char *locuser,
const char *remuser, const char *cmd, int *fd2p);</p>

<p>int rresvport(int *port);</p>

<p>int iruserok(uint32_t raddr, int superuser, const char
*ruser, const char *luser);</p>

<p>int ruserok(const char *rhost, int superuser, const char
*ruser, const char *luser);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>rcmd(), rresvport(), ruserok(): _BSD_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rcmd() function is used by the superuser
to execute a command on a remote machine using an
authentication scheme based on privileged port numbers. The
rresvport() function returns a descriptor to a socket with
an address in the privileged port space. The iruserok() and
ruserok() functions are used by servers to authenticate
clients requesting service with rcmd(). All four functions
are present in the same file and are used by the rshd(8)
server (among others).</p>

<p>The rcmd() function looks up the host *ahost using
gethostbyname(3), returning -1 if the host does not exist.
Otherwise *ahost is set to the standard name of the host and
a connection is established to a server residing at the
well-known Internet port inport.</p>

<p>If the connection succeeds, a socket in the Internet
domain of type SOCK_STREAM is returned to the caller, and
given to the remote command as stdin and stdout. If fd2p is
non-zero, then an auxiliary channel to a control process
will be set up, and a descriptor for it will be placed in
*fd2p. The control process will return diagnostic output
from the command (unit 2) on this channel, and will also
accept bytes on this channel as being Unix signal numbers,
to be forwarded to the process group of the command. If fd2p
is 0, then the stderr (unit 2 of the remote command) will be
made the same as the stdout and no provi- sion is made for
sending arbitrary signals to the remote process, although
you may be able to get its attention by using out-of-band
data.</p>

<p>The protocol is described in detail in rshd(8).</p>

<p>The rresvport() function is used to obtain a socket with
a privileged address bound to it. This socket is suitable
for use by rcmd() and several other functions. Privileged
Internet ports are those in the range 0 to 1023. Only the
superuser is allowed to bind an address of this sort to a
socket.</p>

<p>The iruserok() and ruserok() functions take a remote
hosts IP address or name, respectively, two usernames and a
flag indicating whether the local users name is that of the
superuser. Then, if the user is not the superuser, it checks
the /etc/hosts.equiv file. If that lookup is not done, or is
unsuccessful, the .rhosts in the local users home directory
is checked to see if the request for service is allowed.</p>

<p>If this file does not exist, is not a regular file, is
owned by anyone other than the user or the superuser, is
writable by anyone other than the owner, or is hardlinked
anywhere, the check automatically fails. Zero is returned if
the machine name is listed in the hosts.equiv file, or the
host and remote username are found in the .rhosts file;
other- wise iruserok() and ruserok() return -1. If the local
domain (as obtained from gethostname(2)) is the same as the
remote domain, only the machine name need be specified.</p>

<p>If the IP address of the remote host is known,
iruserok() should be used in preference to ruserok(), as it
does not require trusting the DNS server for the remote
hosts domain.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The rcmd() function returns a valid socket
descriptor on success. It returns -1 on error and prints a
diagnostic message on the standard error.</p>

<p>The rresvport() function returns a valid, bound socket
descriptor on success. It returns -1 on error with the
global value errno set according to the reason for failure.
The error code EAGAIN is over- loaded to mean &quot;All
network ports in use.&quot;</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO Not in POSIX.1-2001. Present on the BSDs,
Solaris, and many other sys- tems. These functions appeared
in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>BUGS iruserok() is not declared in glibc headers.</p>
