<p>CONNECT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CONNECT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME connect - connect a socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int connect(int socket, const struct sockaddr *address,
socklen_t address_len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The connect() function shall attempt to make
a connection on a socket. The function takes the following
arguments:</p>

<p>socket Specifies the file descriptor associated with the
socket.</p>

<p>address Points to a sockaddr structure containing the
peer address. The length and format of the address depend on
the address family of the socket.</p>

<p>address_len Specifies the length of the sockaddr
structure pointed to by the address argument.</p>

<p>If the socket has not already been bound to a local
address, connect() shall bind it to an address which, unless
the sockets address family is AF_UNIX, is an unused local
address.</p>

<p>If the initiating socket is not connection-mode, then
connect() shall set the sockets peer address, and no
connection is made. For SOCK_DGRAM sockets, the peer address
identifies where all datagrams are sent on subsequent send()
functions, and limits the remote sender for subsequent
recv() functions. If address is a null address for the pro-
tocol, the sockets peer address shall be reset.</p>

<p>If the initiating socket is connection-mode, then
connect() shall attempt to establish a connection to the
address specified by the address argument. If the connection
cannot be established immediately and O_NONBLOCK is not set
for the file descriptor for the socket, con- nect() shall
block for up to an unspecified timeout interval until the
connection is established. If the timeout interval expires
before the connection is established, connect() shall fail
and the connection attempt shall be aborted. If connect() is
interrupted by a signal that is caught while blocked waiting
to establish a connection, connect() shall fail and set
errno to [EINTR], but the connection request shall not be
aborted, and the connection shall be established
asynchronously.</p>

<p>If the connection cannot be established immediately and
O_NONBLOCK is set for the file descriptor for the socket,
connect() shall fail and set errno to [EINPROGRESS], but the
connection request shall not be aborted, and the connection
shall be established asynchronously. Subse- quent calls to
connect() for the same socket, before the connection is
established, shall fail and set errno to [EALREADY].</p>

<p>When the connection has been established asynchronously,
select() and poll() shall indicate that the file descriptor
for the socket is ready for writing.</p>

<p>The socket in use may require the process to have
appropriate privi- leges to use the connect() function.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, connect() shall
return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The connect() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EADDRNOTAVAIL The specified address is not available
from the local machine.</p>

<p>EAFNOSUPPORT The specified address is not a valid
address for the address family of the specified socket.</p>

<p>EALREADY A connection request is already in progress for
the specified socket.</p>

<p>EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ECONNREFUSED The target address was not listening for
connections or refused the connection request.</p>

<p>EINPROGRESS O_NONBLOCK is set for the file descriptor
for the socket and the connection cannot be immediately
established; the connection shall be established
asynchronously.</p>

<p>EINTR The attempt to establish a connection was
interrupted by deliv- ery of a signal that was caught; the
connection shall be estab- lished asynchronously.</p>

<p>EISCONN The specified socket is connection-mode and is
already con- nected.</p>

<p>ENETUNREACH No route to the network is present.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a
socket.</p>

<p>EPROTOTYPE The specified address has a different type
than the socket bound to the specified peer address.</p>

<p>ETIMEDOUT The attempt to connect timed out before a
connection was made.</p>

<p>If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then
connect() shall fail if:</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing
to the file system.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the pathname in address.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG A component of a pathname exceeded
{NAME_MAX} characters, or an entire pathname exceeded
{PATH_MAX} characters.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of the pathname does not name an
existing file or the pathname is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix of the pathname
in address is not a directory.</p>

<p>The connect() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied for a component of
the path prefix; or write access to the named socket is
denied.</p>

<p>EADDRINUSE Attempt to establish a connection that uses
addresses that are already in use.</p>

<p>ECONNRESET Remote host reset the connection request.</p>

<p>EHOSTUNREACH The destination host cannot be reached
(probably because the host is down or a remote router cannot
reach it).</p>

<p>EINVAL The address_len argument is not a valid length
for the address family; or invalid address family in the
sockaddr structure.</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the pathname in
address.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG Pathname resolution of a symbolic link
produced an intermediate result whose length exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENETDOWN The local network interface used to reach the
destination is down.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS No buffer space is available.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The socket is listening and cannot be
connected.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If connect() fails, the state of the
socket is unspecified. Conforming applications should close
the file descriptor and create a new socket before
attempting to reconnect.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
