<p>NAME ethers - Ethernet address to IP number database</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION /etc/ethers contains 48 bit Ethernet
addresses and their corresponding IP numbers, one line for
each IP number:</p>

<p>Ethernet-address IP-number</p>

<p>The two items are separated by any number of SPACE
and/or TAB char acters. A # at the beginning of a line
starts a comment which extends to the end of the line. The
Ethernet-address is written as x:x:x:x:x:x, where x is a
hexadecimal number between 0 and ff which represents one
byte of the address, which is in network byte order
(big-endian). The IP-number may be a hostname which can be
resolved by DNS or a dot separated number.</p>
