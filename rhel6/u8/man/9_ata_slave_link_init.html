<p>ATA_SLAVE_LINK_INIT(9) libata Library
ATA_SLAVE_LINK_INIT(9)</p>

<p>NAME ata_slave_link_init - initialize slave link</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int ata_slave_link_init(struct ata_port *
ap);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS ap port to initialize slave link for</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Create and initialize slave link for ap.
This enables slave link handling on the port.</p>

<p>In libata, a port contains links and a link contains
devices. There is single host link but if a PMP is attached
to it, there can be multiple fan-out links. On SATA,
there&acute;s usually a single device connected to a link
but PATA and SATA controllers emulating TF based interface
can have two - master and slave.</p>

<p>However, there are a few controllers which don&acute;t
fit into this abstraction too well - SATA controllers which
emulate TF interface with both master and slave devices but
also have separate SCR register sets for each device. These
controllers need separate links for physical link handling
(e.g. onlineness, link speed) but should be treated like a
traditional M/S controller for everything else (e.g. command
issue, softreset).</p>

<p>slave_link is libata&acute;s way of handling this class
of controllers without impacting core layer too much. For
anything other than physical link handling, the default host
link is used for both master and slave. For physical link
handling, separate ap-&gt;slave_link is used. All dirty
details are implemented inside libata core layer. From
LLD&acute;s POV, the only difference is that prereset,
hardreset and postreset are called once more for the slave
link, so the reset sequence looks like the following.</p>

<p>prereset(M) -&gt; prereset(S) -&gt; hardreset(M) -&gt;
hardreset(S) -&gt; softreset(M) -&gt; postreset(M) -&gt;
postreset(S)</p>

<p>Note that softreset is called only for the master.
Softreset resets both M/S by definition, so SRST on master
should handle both (the standard method will work just
fine).</p>

<p>LOCKING Should be called before host is registered.</p>

<p>RETURNS 0 on success, -errno on failure.</p>
