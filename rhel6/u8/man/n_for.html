<p>NAME for - For loop</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS for start test next body
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For is a looping command, similar in
structure to the C for statement. The start, next, and body
arguments must be Tcl command strings, and test is an
expression string. The for command first invokes the Tcl
interpreter to execute start. Then it repeatedly evaluates
test as an expression; if the result is non-zero it invokes
the Tcl interpreter on body, then invokes the Tcl
interpreter on next, then repeats the loop. The command
terminates when test evaluates to 0. If a continue command
is invoked within body then any remaining commands in the
current exe- cution of body are skipped; processing
continues by invoking the Tcl interpreter on next, then
evaluating test, and so on. If a break com- mand is invoked
within body or next, then the for command will return
immediately. The operation of break and continue are similar
to the corresponding statements in C. For returns an empty
string.</p>

<p>Note: test should almost always be enclosed in braces.
If not, vari- able substitutions will be made before the for
command starts execut- ing, which means that variable
changes made by the loop body will not be considered in the
expression. This is likely to result in an infi- nite loop.
If test is enclosed in braces, variable substitutions are
delayed until the expression is evaluated (before each loop
iteration), so changes in the variables will be visible. See
below for an example:</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Print a line for each of the integers from 0 to
10: for {set x 0} {$x&lt;10} {incr x} { puts &quot;x is
$x&quot; }</p>

<p>Either loop infinitely or not at all because the
expression being eval- uated is actually the constant, or
even generate an error! The actual behaviour will depend on
whether the variable x exists before the for command is run
and whether its value is a value that is less than or
greater than/equal to ten, and this is because the
expression will be substituted before the for command is
executed. for {set x 0} $x&lt;10 {incr x} { puts &quot;x is
$x&quot; }</p>

<p>Print out the powers of two from 1 to 1024: for {set x
1} {$x&lt;=1024} {set x [expr {$x * 2}]} { puts &quot;x is
$x&quot; }</p>
