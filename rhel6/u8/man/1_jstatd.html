<p>jstatd(1) Monitoring Tools jstatd(1)</p>

<p>NAME jstatd - Monitors Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and
enables remote monitoring tools to attach to JVMs. This
command is experimental and unsupported.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jstatd [ options ]</p>

<p>options The command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The jstatd command is an RMI server
application that monitors for the creation and termination
of instrumented Java HotSpot VMs and provides an interface
to enable remote monitoring tools to attach to JVMs that are
running on the local host.</p>

<p>The jstatd server requires an RMI registry on the local
host. The jstatd server attempts to attach to the RMI
registry on the default port, or on the port you specify
with the -pport option. If an RMI registry is not found,
then one is created within the jstatd application that is
bound to the port that is indicated by the -pport option or
to the default RMI registry port when the -pport option is
omitted. You can stop the creation of an internal RMI
registry by specifying the -nr option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -nr Does not attempt to create an internal RMI
registry within the jstatd process when an existing RMI
registry is not found.</p>

<p>-p port The port number where the RMI registry is
expected to be found, or when not found, created if the -nr
option is not specified.</p>

<p>-n rminame Name to which the remote RMI object is bound
in the RMI registry. The default name is JStatRemoteHost. If
multiple jstatd servers are started on the same host, then
the name of the exported RMI object for each server can be
made unique by specifying this option. However, doing so
requires that the unique server name be included in the
monitoring clients hostid and vmid strings.</p>

<p>-Joption Passes option to the JVM, where option is one
of the options described on the reference page for the Java
application launcher. For example, -J-Xms48m sets the
startup memory to 48 MB. See java(1).</p>

<p>SECURITY The jstatd server can only monitor JVMs for
which it has the appropriate native access permissions.
Therefore, the jstatd process must be running with the same
user credentials as the target JVMs. Some user credentials,
such as the root user in UNIX-based systems, have permission
to access the instrumentation exported by any JVM on the
system. A jstatd process running with such credentials can
monitor any JVM on the system, but introduces additional
security concerns.</p>

<p>The jstatd server does not provide any authentication of
remote clients. Therefore, running a jstatd server process
exposes the instrumentation export by all JVMs for which the
jstatd process has access permissions to any user on the
network. This exposure might be undesirable in your
environment, and therefore, local security policies should
be considered before you start the jstatd process,
particularly in production environments or on networks that
are not secure.</p>

<p>The jstatd server installs an instance of
RMISecurityPolicy when no other security manager is
installed, and therefore, requires a security policy file to
be specified. The policy file must conform to Default Policy
Implementation and Policy File Syntax at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/PolicyFiles.html</p>

<p>The following policy file allows the jstatd server to
run without any security exceptions. This policy is less
liberal than granting all permissions to all code bases, but
is more liberal than a policy that grants the minimal
permissions to run the jstatd server.</p>

<p>grant codebase
&quot;file:${java.home}/../lib/tools.jar&quot; { permission
java.security.AllPermission; };</p>

<p>To use this policy setting, copy the text into a file
called jstatd.all.policy and run the jstatd server as
follows:</p>

<p>jstatd -J-Djava.security.policy=jstatd.all.policy</p>

<p>For sites with more restrictive security practices, it
is possible to use a custom policy file to limit access to
specific trusted hosts or networks, though such techniques
are subject to IP address spoofing attacks. If your security
concerns cannot be addressed with a customized policy file,
then the safest action is to not run the jstatd server and
use the jstat and jps tools locally.</p>

<p>REMOTE INTERFACE The interface exported by the jstatd
process is proprietary and guaranteed to change. Users and
developers are discouraged from writing to this
interface.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following are examples of the jstatd
command. The jstatd scripts automatically start the server
in the background</p>

<p>INTERNAL RMI REGISTRY This example shows hos to start a
jstatd session with an internal RMI registry. This example
assumes that no other server is bound to the default RMI
registry port (port 1099).</p>

<p>jstatd -J-Djava.security.policy=all.policy</p>

<p>EXTERNAL RMI REGISTRY This example starts a jstatd
session with a external RMI registry.</p>

<p>rmiregistry&amp; jstatd
-J-Djava.security.policy=all.policy</p>

<p>This example starts a jstatd session with an external
RMI registry server on port 2020.</p>

<p>jrmiregistry 2020&amp; jstatd
-J-Djava.security.policy=all.policy -p 2020</p>

<p>This example starts a jstatd session with an external
RMI registry on port 2020 that is bound to
AlternateJstatdServerName.</p>

<p>rmiregistry 2020&amp; jstatd
-J-Djava.security.policy=all.policy -p 2020 -n
AlternateJstatdServerName</p>

<p>STOP THE CREATION OF AN IN-PROCESS RMI REGISTRY This
example starts a jstatd session that does not create an RMI
registry when one is not found. This example assumes an RMI
registry is already running. If an RMI registry is not
running, then an error message is displayed.</p>

<p>jstatd -J-Djava.security.policy=all.policy -nr</p>

<p>ENABLE RMI LOGGING This example starts a jstatd session
with RMI logging capabilities enabled. This technique is
useful as a troubleshooting aid or for monitoring server
activities.</p>

<p>jstatd -J-Djava.security.policy=all.policy
-J-Djava.rmi.server.logCalls=true</p>
