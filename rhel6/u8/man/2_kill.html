<p>KILL(2) Linux Programmer s Manual KILL(2)</p>

<p>NAME kill - send signal to a process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int kill(pid_t pid, int sig);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>kill(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE ||
_POSIX_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The kill() system call can be used to send
any signal to any process group or process.</p>

<p>If pid is positive, then signal sig is sent to the
process with the ID specified by pid.</p>

<p>If pid equals 0, then sig is sent to every process in
the process group of the calling process.</p>

<p>If pid equals -1, then sig is sent to every process for
which the call- ing process has permission to send signals,
except for process 1 (init), but see below.</p>

<p>If pid is less than -1, then sig is sent to every
process in the pro- cess group whose ID is -pid.</p>

<p>If sig is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking
is still per- formed; this can be used to check for the
existence of a process ID or process group ID.</p>

<p>For a process to have permission to send a signal it
must either be privileged (under Linux: have the CAP_KILL
capability), or the real or effective user ID of the sending
process must equal the real or saved set-user-ID of the
target process. In the case of SIGCONT it suffices when the
sending and receiving processes belong to the same
session.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success (at least one signal was sent),
zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL An invalid signal was specified.</p>

<p>EPERM The process does not have permission to send the
signal to any of the target processes.</p>

<p>ESRCH The pid or process group does not exist. Note that
an existing process might be a zombie, a process which
already committed termination, but has not yet been
wait(2)ed for.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES The only signals that can be sent to process ID 1,
the init process, are those for which init has explicitly
installed signal handlers. This is done to assure the system
is not brought down accidentally.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 requires that kill(-1,sig) send sig to all
processes that the calling process may send signals to,
except possibly for some implementation-defined system
processes. Linux allows a process to signal itself, but on
Linux the call kill(-1,sig) does not signal the calling
process.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 requires that if a process sends a signal
to itself, and the sending thread does not have the signal
blocked, and no other thread has it unblocked or is waiting
for it in sigwait(3), at least one unblocked signal must be
delivered to the sending thread before the kill().</p>

<p>Linux Notes Across different kernel versions, Linux has
enforced different rules for the permissions required for an
unprivileged process to send a sig- nal to another process.
In kernels 1.0 to 1.2.2, a signal could be sent if the
effective user ID of the sender matched that of the
receiver, or the real user ID of the sender matched that of
the receiver. From kernel 1.2.3 until 1.3.77, a signal could
be sent if the effective user ID of the sender matched
either the real or effec- tive user ID of the receiver. The
current rules, which conform to POSIX.1-2001, were adopted
in kernel 1.3.78.</p>

<p>BUGS In 2.6 kernels up to and including 2.6.7, there was
a bug that meant that when sending signals to a process
group, kill() failed with the error EPERM if the caller did
have permission to send the signal to any (rather than all)
of the members of the process group. Notwithstanding this
error return, the signal was still delivered to all of the
pro- cesses for which the caller had permission to
signal.</p>
