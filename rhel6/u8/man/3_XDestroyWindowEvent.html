XDestroyWindowEvent(3)</p>

<p>NAME XDestroyWindowEvent - DestroyNotify event
structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structure for DestroyNotify events
contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* DestroyNotify */ unsigned
long serial; /* # of last request processed by server */
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ Display *display; /* Display the event was read
from */ Window event; Window window; }
XDestroyWindowEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive this event, the structure members are
set as follows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>The event member is set either to the destroyed window
or to its par- ent, depending on whether StructureNotify or
SubstructureNotify was selected. The window member is set to
the window that is destroyed.</p>
