<p>sane-leo(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy sane-leo(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-leo - SANE backend for LEO Technologies
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-leo library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) back- end that provides access to
some LEO SCSI flatbed scanners. This back- end should be
considered beta-quality software! LEO scanners were also
sold under the Across Technologies brand.</p>

<p>The scanners that should work with this backend are:</p>

<p>Vendor Model status ---------------------- -----------
Across FS-1130 tested Leo S3 tested</p>

<p>The options the backend supports can either be selected
through command line options to programs like scanimage or
through GUI elements in xscanimage or xsane.</p>

<p>If you have any strange behavior, please report to the
backend main- tainer or to the SANE mailing list.</p>

<p>Valid command line options and their syntax can be
listed by using scanimage --help -d leo</p>

<p>Scan Mode</p>

<p>--mode selects the basic mode of operation of the
scanner valid choices are Black &amp; White , Grayscale and
Color The Black &amp; White mode is black and white only (1
bit). Grayscale will produce 256 lev- els of gray (8 bits).
Color will produce a 24 bits color image.</p>

<p>--resolution selects the resolution for a scan. The
scanner can do all reso- lutions between 1 and 300, in
increments of 1.</p>

<p>Geometry options</p>

<p>-l -t -x -y control the scan area: -l sets the top left
x coordinate, -t the top left y coordinate, -x selects the
width and -y the height of the scan area. All parameters are
specified in millimeters by default.</p>

<p>Enhancement options</p>

<p>--custom-gamma (grayscale and color mode only) allows
the user to specify a gamma table (see the next 3
parameters).</p>

<p>--red-gamma-table (color mode only) can be used to
download a user defined gamma table for the red channel. The
table must be 256 bytes long.</p>

<p>--green-gamma-table (color mode only) can be used to
download a user defined gamma table for the green channel.
The table must be 256 bytes long.</p>

<p>--blue-gamma-table (color mode only) can be used to
download a user defined gamma table for the blue channel.
The table must be 256 bytes long.</p>

<p>--halftone (Black &amp; White only) select the halftone
mask to use. Possible values are Diamond , 8x8 Coarse
Fatting , 8x8 Fine Fatting , 8x8 Bayer and 8x8 Vertical
Line</p>

<p>--preview requests a preview scan. The resolution used
for that scan is 28 dpi and the scan area is the maximum
allowed. The scan mode is user selected. The default is
&quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
/etc/sane.d/leo.conf supports only one informa- tion: the
device name to use (eg /dev/scanner).</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-leo.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-leo.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_LEO If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of
128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The windows TWAIN driver has many more
options than this SANE backend. However they are only
software adjustments. This backend only imple- ments what
the scanner can support.</p>

<p>BUGS None known.</p>

xsane(1), sane(7)</p>
