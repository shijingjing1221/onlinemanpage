<p>xcb_query_pointer(3) XCB Requests
xcb_query_pointer(3)</p>

<p>NAME xcb_query_pointer - get pointer coordinates</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</p>

<p>Request function xcb_query_pointer_cookie_t
xcb_query_pointer(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_window_t
window);</p>

<p>Reply datastructure typedef struct
xcb_query_pointer_reply_t { uint8_t response_type; uint8_t
same_screen; uint16_t sequence; uint32_t length;
xcb_window_t root; xcb_window_t child; int16_t root_x;
int16_t root_y; int16_t win_x; int16_t win_y; uint16_t mask;
uint8_t pad0[2]; } xcb_query_pointer_reply_t;</p>

<p>Reply function xcb_query_pointer_reply_t
*xcb_query_pointer_reply(xcb_connection_t *conn,
xcb_query_pointer_cookie_t cookie, xcb_generic_error_t
**e);</p>

<p>REQUEST ARGUMENTS conn The XCB connection to X11.</p>

<p>window A window to check if the pointer is on the same
screen as window (see the same_screen field in the
reply).</p>

<p>REPLY FIELDS response_type The type of this reply, in
this case XCB_QUERY_POINTER. This field is also present in
the xcb_generic_reply_t and can be used to tell replies
apart from each other.</p>

<p>sequence The sequence number of the last request
processed by the X11 server.</p>

<p>length The length of the reply, in words (a word is 4
bytes).</p>

<p>same_screen If same_screen is False, then the pointer is
not on the same screen as the argument window, child is
None, and win_x and win_y are zero. If same_screen is True,
then win_x and win_y are the pointer coordinates relative to
the argument windows origin, and child is the child
containing the pointer, if any.</p>

<p>root The root window the pointer is logically on.</p>

<p>child The child window containing the pointer, if any,
if same_screen is true. If same_screen is false, XCB_NONE is
re- turned.</p>

<p>root_x The pointer X position, relative to root.</p>

<p>root_y The pointer Y position, relative to root.</p>

<p>win_x The pointer X coordinate, relative to child, if
same_screen is true. Zero otherwise.</p>

<p>win_y The pointer Y coordinate, relative to child, if
same_screen is true. Zero otherwise.</p>

<p>mask The current logical state of the modifier keys and
the but- tons. Note that the logical state of a device (as
seen by means of the protocol) may lag the physical state if
device event processing is frozen.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Gets the root window the pointer is
logically on and the pointer coor- dinates relative to the
root windows origin.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns an xcb_query_pointer_cookie_t.
Errors have to be handled when calling the reply function
xcb_query_pointer_reply.</p>

<p>If you want to handle errors in the event loop instead,
use xcb_query_pointer_unchecked. See xcb-requests(3) for
details.</p>

<p>ERRORS xcb_window_error_t The specified window does not
exist.</p>
