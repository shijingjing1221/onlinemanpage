<p>NAME pamx - display Netpbm image in X Window System
window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamx</p>

<p>[-fullscreen] [-install] [-private] [-fit] [-pixmap]
[-verbose] [-dis- play=x-display] [-title=text]
[-foreground=color] [-background=color] [-border=color]
[-geometry=x-geometry-string] [-visual=name] netpbm_file</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate
an option. You may use either white space or an equals sign
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamx displays a Netpbm image in an X Window System
window. It is like a very simple version of the classic X
image viewer xloadimage.</p>

<p>If you dont specify the input file netpbm_file, the
input is from Standard Input. The input image can be any
Netpbm image format. If the input is a multi-image stream,
pamx ignores all but the first image.</p>

<p>pamx is not the best choice for general purpose viewing
of images, because it is a traditional simple Netpbm
building block. It is a good thing to build into other
programs and can be useful for debugging more complex
systems, but you can get much more powerful viewers that can
display Netpbm images. For example, xloadimage, xli, xzgv,
and any web browser.</p>

<p>The initial window is at most 90% of the size of the
display unless the window manager does not correctly handle
window size requests or if youve used the -fullscreen
option. You may move the image around in the window by
dragging with the first mouse button. The cursor will
indicate which directions you may drag, if any. You may exit
the win- dow by typing q or control-C when the keyboard
focus is on the win- dow.</p>

<p>ppmsvgalib is a similar program that displays an image
on a Linux sys- tem without the need for the X Window
System.</p>

<p>X RESOURCE CLASS pamx uses the resource class name
Xloadimage for window managers which need this resource set.
This is, of course, the same resource class that the
conventional viewer program xloadimage uses.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -border=color This sets the background portion
of the window which is not cov- ered by any images to be
color.</p>

<p>-display=display_name This names the X display in which
to put the window. E.g. 0:0.</p>

<p>-fit Force image to use the default visual and colormap.
This is useful if you do not want technicolor effects when
the colormap focus is inside the image window, but it may
reduce the quality of the displayed image.</p>

<p>-fullscreen Use the entire screen to display the
image.</p>

<p>-geometry=WxH[{+,-}X{+,-}Y This sets the size and
position of the window in which pamx dis- plays the
image.</p>

<p>By default, the window size exactly matches the image
size, except that if you dont specify -fullscreen, the
maximum is 90% of the screen dimensions.</p>

<p>-install Forcibly install the images colormap when the
window is focused. This violates ICCCM standards and only
exists to allow operation with naive window managers. Use
this option only if your window manager does not install
colormaps properly.</p>

<p>-pixmap Force the use of a pixmap as backing-store. This
is provided for servers where backing-store is broken (such
as some versions of the AIXWindows server). It may improve
scrolling performance on servers which provide
backing-store.</p>

<p>-private Force pamx to use of a private colormap. By
default, pamx allo- cates colors shared unless there are not
enough colors avail- able.</p>

<p>-verbose Causes pamx to print various information about
what its doing to Standard Error.</p>

<p>-visual=visual_name Force the use of a specific visual
type to display an image. By default, pamx tries to pick the
best available image for a par- ticular image type. The
available visual types are: Direct- Color, TrueColor,
PseudoColor, StaticColor, GrayScale, and Stat- icGray. You
may use the shortest unique prefix of these names, and case
is not significant.</p>

<p>-background=color Use color as the background color
instead of the default (usu- ally white but this depends on
the image type) if you are trans- ferring a monochrome image
to a color display.</p>

<p>-foreground=color Use color as the foreground color
instead of black if you are transferring a monochrome image
to a color display. You can also use this to invert the
foreground and background colors of a monochrome image.</p>

<p>-title=text Set the title bar title of the window.
Default is the file name of the input file, or stdin if the
image is from Standard Input.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamx was new in Netpbm 10.34 (May 2006).</p>

<p>pamx is essentially based on the classic X displayer
program xloadimage by Jim Frost, 1989. Bryan Henderson
stripped it down and adapted it to Netpbm in March 2006.</p>

<p>The following features of xloadimage are left out of
pamx, to be more compatible with Netpbms philosophy of
simple building blocks. Note that there are other programs
in Netpbm that do all of these things:</p>

<p>&middot; slide show</p>

<p>&middot; zoom in/out</p>

<p>&middot; ability to accept formats other than Netpbm</p>

<p>&middot; ability to display on the root window</p>

<p>&middot; image transformations (brightening, clipping,
rotating, etc)</p>

<p>&middot; decompressing and other decoding of input</p>

<p>pamx also differs from xloadimage in that it uses
Libnetpbm.</p>

<p>There is virtually no code from xloadimage actually in
pamx, because Bryan rewrote it all to make it easier to
understand.</p>
