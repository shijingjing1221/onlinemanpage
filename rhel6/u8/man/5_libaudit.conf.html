LIBAUDIT.CONF:(5)</p>

<p>NAME libaudit.conf - libaudit configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file /etc/libaudit.conf contains
configuration information for user space applications that
link to libaudit. The applications are respon- sible for
querrying the settings in this file and obeying the admins
preferences. This file contains one configuration keyword
per line, an equal sign, and then followed by appropriate
configuration information. The keywords recognized are:
failure_action. These keywords are described below.</p>

<p>failure_action This keyword specifies what action the
admin wishes a user space application to take when there is
a failure to send an audit event to the kernel. The possible
values are: IGNORE - meaning do nothing, LOG - write to
syslog the inability to send an audit event, and TERMINATE -
the user space application should exit.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO get_auditfail_action(3).</p>
