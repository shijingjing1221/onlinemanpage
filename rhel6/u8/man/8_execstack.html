<p>NAME execstack - tool to set, clear, or query executable
stack flag of ELF binaries and shared libraries</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS execstack [OPTION...] [FILES]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION execstack is a program which sets, clears,
or queries executable stack flag of ELF binaries and shared
libraries. Linux has in the past allowed execution of
instructions on the stack and there are lots of binaries and
shared libraries assuming this behaviour. Furthermore, GCC
trampoline code for e.g. nested functions requires
executable stack on many architectures. To avoid breaking
binaries and shared libraries which need executable stack,
ELF binaries and shared libraries now can be marked as
requiring executable stack or not requiring it. This marking
is done through the p_flags field in the PT_GNU_STACK
program header entry. If the marking is missing, kernel or
dynamic linker need to assume it might need executable
stack. The marking is done automat- ically by recent GCC
versions (objects using trampolines on the stack are marked
as requiring executable stack, all other newly built objects
are marked as not requiring it) and linker collects these
markings into marking of the whole binary or shared library.
The user can override this at assembly time (through
--execstack or --noexecstack assembler options), at link
time (through -z execstack or -z noexecstack linker options)
and using the execstack tool also on an already linker
binary or shared library. This tool is especially useful for
third party shared libraries where it is known that they don
t need executable stack or testing proves it.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s --set-execstack Mark binary or shared library
as requiring executable stack.</p>

<p>-c --clear-execstack Mark binary or shared library as
not requiring executable stack.</p>

<p>-q --query Query executable stack marking of binaries
and shared libraries. For each file it prints either - when
executable stack is not required, X when executable stack is
required or ? when it is unknown whether the object requires
or doesn t require exe- cutable stack (the marking is
missing).</p>

<p>-V Print execstack version and exit.</p>

<p>-? --help Print help message.</p>

<p>--usage Print a short usage message.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Command line arguments should be names of ELF
binaries and shared libraries which should be modified or
queried.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES # execstack -s ~/lib/libfoo.so.1 will mark
~/lib/libfoo.so.1 as requiring executable stack. # execstack
-c ~/bin/bar will mark ~/bin/bar as not requiring executable
stack. # execstack -q ~/lib/libfoo.so.1 ~/bin/bar will query
executable stack marking of the given files.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ld.so(8).</p>

<p>BUGS execstack doesn t support yet marking of
executables if they do not have PT_GNU_STACK program header
entry nor they have room for program segment header table
growth.</p>
