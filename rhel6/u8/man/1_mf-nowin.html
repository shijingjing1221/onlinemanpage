<p>NAME mf, mf-nowin, inimf, virmf - Metafont, a language
for font and logo design</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mf [options] [commands]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Metafont reads the program in the specified
files and outputs font rasters (in gf format) and font
metrics (in tfm format). The Metafont language is described
in The Metafontbook.</p>

<p>Like TeX, Metafont is normally used with a large body of
precompiled macros, and font generation in particular
requires the support of sev- eral macro files. This version
of Metafont looks at its command line to see what name it
was called under. Both inimf and virmf are sym- links to the
mf executable. When called as inimf (or when the -ini option
is given) it can be used to precompile macros into a .base
file. When called as virmf it will use the plain base. When
called under any other name, Metafont will use that name as
the name of the base to use. For example, when called as mf
the mf base is used, which is identical to the plain base.
Other bases than plain are rarely used.</p>

<p>The commands given on the command line to the Metafont
program are passed to it as the first input line. (But it is
often easier to type extended arguments as the first input
line, since UNIX shells tend to gobble up or misinterpret
Metafonts favorite symbols, like semicolons, unless you
quote them.) As described in The Metafontbook, that first
line should begin with a filename, a controlsequence, or a
&amp;basename.</p>

<p>The normal usage is to say</p>

<p>mf de=&lt;printengine&gt;; [mag=magstep(n);] input
font</p>

<p>to start processing font.mf. The single quotes are the
best way of keeping the Unix shell from misinterpreting the
semicolons and from removing the character, which is needed
here to keep Metafont from thinking that you want to produce
a font called mode. (Or you can just say mf and give the
other stuff on the next line, without quotes.) Other control
sequences, such as batchmode (for silent operation) can also
appear. The name font will be the jobname , and is used in
forming output file names. If Metafont doesnt get a file
name in the first line, the jobname is mfput. The default
extension, .mf, can be overridden by specifying an extension
explicitly.</p>

<p>A log of error messages goes into the file jobname.log.
The output files are jobname.tfm and
jobname.&lt;number&gt;gf, where &lt;number&gt; depends on
the resolution and magnification of the font. The mode in
this example is shown generically as &lt;printengine&gt;, a
symbolic term for which the name of an actual device or,
most commonly, the name localfont (see below) must be
substituted. If the mode is not specified or is not valid
for your site, Metafont will default to proof mode which
produces large character images for use in font design and
refinement. Proof mode can be recognized by the suffix
.2602gf after the jobname. Exam- ples of proof mode output
can be found in Computer Modern Typefaces (Volume E of
Computers and Typesetting). The system of magsteps is
identical to the system used by TeX, with values generally
in the range 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0. A listing of
gf numbers for 118-dpi, 240-dpi and 300-dpi fonts is shown
below.</p>

<p>MAGSTEP 118 dpi 240 dpi 300 dpi</p>

<p>mag=magstep(0) 118 240 300 mag=magstep(0.5) 129 263 329
mag=magstep(1) 142 288 360 mag=magstep(2) 170 346 432
mag=magstep(3) 204 415 518 mag=magstep(4) 245 498 622
mag=magstep(5) 294 597 746</p>

<p>Magnification can also be specified not as a magstep but
as an arbi- trary value, such as 1.315, to create special
character sizes.</p>

<p>Before font production can begin, it is necessary to set
up the appro- priate base files. The minimum set of
components for font production for a given print-engine is
the plain.mf macro file and the local mode_def file. The
macros in plain.mf can be studied in an appendix to the
Metafontbook; they were developed by Donald E. Knuth, and
this file should never be altered except when it is
officially upgraded. Each mode_def specification helps adapt
fonts to a particular print-engine. There is a regular
discussion of mode_defs in TUGboat, the journal of the TeX
Users Group. The local ones in use on this computer should
be in modes.mf.</p>

<p>The e response to Metafont s error-recovery mode invokes
the system default editor at the erroneous line of the
source file. There is an environment variable, MFEDIT, that
overrides the default editor. It should contain a string
with &quot;%s&quot; indicating where the filename goes and
&quot;%d&quot; indicating where the decimal linenumber (if
any) goes. For example, an MFEDIT string for the vi editor
can be set with the csh command setenv MFEDIT &quot;vi +%d
%s&quot;</p>

<p>A convenient file in the library is null.mf, containing
nothing. When mf cant find the file it thinks you want to
input, it keeps asking you for another file name; responding
null gets you out of the loop if you dont want to input
anything.</p>

<p>ONLINE GRAPHICS OUTPUT Metafont can use most modern
displays, so you can see its output with- out printing.
Chapter 23 of The Metafontbook describes what you can do.
This implementation of Metafont uses environment variables
to determine which display device you want to use. First it
looks for a variable MFTERM, and then for TERM. If it can t
find either, you get no online output. Otherwise, the value
of the variable determines the device to use: hp2627, sun
(for old SunView), tek, uniterm (for an Atari ST Tek 4014
emulator), xterm (for either X10 or X11). Some of these
devices may not be supported in all Metafont executables;
the choice is made at compilation time.</p>

<p>On some systems, there are two Metafont binaries, mf and
mf-nowin. On those systems the mf binary supports graphics,
while the mf-nowin binary does not. The mf-nowin binary is
used by scripts like mktexpk where graphics support is a
nuisance rather than something helpful.</p>

<p>OPTIONS This version of Metafont understands the
following command line options.</p>

<p>-base base Use base as the name of the base to be used,
instead of the name by which Metafont was called or a %&amp;
line.</p>

<p>-file-line-error Print error messages in the form
file:line:error which is simi- lar to the way many compilers
format them.</p>

<p>-no-file-line-error Disable printing error messages in
the file:line:error style.</p>

<p>-file-line-error-style This is the old name of the
-file-line-error option.</p>

<p>-halt-on-error Exit with an error code when an error is
encountered during pro- cessing.</p>

<p>-help Print help message and exit.</p>

<p>-ini Be inimf, for dumping bases; this is implicitly
true if the pro- gram is called as inimf.</p>

<p>-interaction mode Sets the interaction mode. The mode
can be one of batchmode, nonstopmode, scrollmode, and
errorstopmode. The meaning of these modes is the same as
that of the corresponding commands.</p>

<p>-jobname name Use name for the job name, instead of
deriving it from the name of the input file.</p>

<p>-kpathsea-debug bitmask Sets path searching debugging
flags according to the bitmask. See the Kpathsea manual for
details.</p>

<p>-maketex fmt Enable mktexfmt, where fmt must be mf.</p>

<p>-no-maketex fmt Disable mktexfmt, where fmt must be
mf.</p>

<p>-output-directory directory directory instead of the
current directory. Look up input files in directory first,
the along the normal search path.</p>

<p>-parse-first-line If the first line of the main input
file begins with %&amp; parse it to look for a dump name or
a -translate-file option.</p>

<p>-no-parse-first-line Disable parsing of the first line
of the main input file.</p>

<p>-progname name Pretend to be program name. This affects
both the format used and the search paths.</p>

<p>-recorder Enable the filename recorder. This leaves a
trace of the files opened for input and output in a file
with extension .fls.</p>

<p>-translate-file tcxname Use the tcxname translation
table.</p>

<p>-version Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT See the Kpathsearch library documentation
(the Path specifications node) for the details of how the
environment variables are use when searching. The kpsewhich
utility can be used to query the values of the
variables.</p>

<p>If the environment variable TEXMFOUTPUT is set, Metafont
attempts to put its output files in it, if they cannot be
put in the current direc- tory. Again, see tex(1).</p>

<p>MFINPUTS Search path for input and openin files.</p>

<p>MFEDIT Command template for switching to editor.</p>

<p>MFTERM Determines the online graphics display. If MFTERM
is not set, and DISPLAY is set, the Metafont window support
for X is used. (DISPLAY must be set to a valid X server
specification, as usual.) If neither MFTERM nor DISPLAY is
set, TERM is used to guess the window support to use.</p>

<p>FONT UTILITIES A number of utility programs are
available. The following is a partial list of available
utilities and their purpose. Consult your local Metafont
guru for details.</p>

<p>gftopk Takes a gf file and produces a more tightly
packed pk font file.</p>

<p>gftodvi Produces proof sheets for fonts.</p>

<p>gftype Displays the contents of a gf file in mnemonics
and/or images.</p>

<p>pktype Mnemonically displays the contents of a pk
file.</p>

<p>mft Formats a source file as shown in Computer Modern
Typefaces.</p>

<p>FILES mf.pool Encoded text of Metafonts messages.</p>

<p>*.base Predigested Metafont base files.</p>

<p>$TEXMFMAIN/metafont/base/plain.mf The standard base.</p>

<p>$TEXMFMAIN/metafont/misc/modes.mf The file of mode_defs
for your site s various printers</p>

<p>BUGS On January 4, 1986 the final bug in Metafont was
discovered and removed. If an error still lurks in the code,
Donald E. Knuth promises to pay a finders fee which doubles
every year to the first person who finds it. Happy
hunting.</p>

<p>COMMENTS Warning: Type design can be hazardous to your
other interests. Once you get hooked, you will develop
intense feelings about letterforms; the medium will intrude
on the messages that you read. And you will perpetually be
thinking of improvements to the fonts that you see
everywhere, especially those of your own design.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Metafont was designed by Donald E. Knuth, who
implemented it using his Web system for Pascal programs. It
was originally ported to Unix by Paul Richards at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This page was
mostly written by Pierre MacKay.</p>
