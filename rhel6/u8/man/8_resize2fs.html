<p>NAME resize2fs - ext2/ext3/ext4 file system resizer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS resize2fs [ -fFpPM ] [ -d debug-flags ] [ -S
RAID-stride ] device [ size ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The resize2fs program will resize ext2,
ext3, or ext4 file systems. It can be used to enlarge or
shrink an unmounted file system located on device. If the
filesystem is mounted, it can be used to expand the size of
the mounted filesystem, assuming the kernel supports on-line
resizing. (As of this writing, the Linux 2.6 kernel supports
on-line resize for filesystems mounted using ext3 and
ext4.).</p>

<p>The size parameter specifies the requested new size of
the filesystem. If no units are specified, the units of the
size parameter shall be the filesystem blocksize of the
filesystem. Optionally, the size parameter may be suffixed
by one of the following the units designators: s, K, M, or
G, for 512 byte sectors, kilobytes, megabytes, or giga-
bytes, respectively. The size of the filesystem may never be
larger than the size of the partition. If size parameter is
not specified, it will default to the size of the
partition.</p>

<p>The resize2fs program does not manipulate the size of
partitions. If you wish to enlarge a filesystem, you must
make sure you can expand the size of the underlying
partition first. This can be done using fdisk(8) by deleting
the partition and recreating it with a larger size or using
lvextend(8), if you re using the logical volume manager
lvm(8). When recreating the partition, make sure you create
it with the same starting disk cylinder as before!
Otherwise, the resize oper- ation will certainly not work,
and you may lose your entire filesystem. After running
fdisk(8), run resize2fs to resize the ext2 filesystem to use
all of the space in the newly enlarged partition.</p>

<p>If you wish to shrink an ext2 partition, first use
resize2fs to shrink the size of filesystem. Then you may use
fdisk(8) to shrink the size of the partition. When shrinking
the size of the partition, make sure you do not make it
smaller than the new size of the ext2 filesystem!</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d debug-flags Turns on various resize2fs
debugging features, if they have been compiled into the
binary. debug-flags should be computed by adding the numbers
of the desired features from the following list: 2 - Debug
block relocations 4 - Debug inode relocations 8 - Debug
moving the inode table</p>

<p>-f Forces resize2fs to proceed with the filesystem
resize opera- tion, overriding some safety checks which
resize2fs normally enforces.</p>

<p>-F Flush the filesystem device s buffer caches before
beginning. Only really useful for doing resize2fs time
trials.</p>

<p>-M Shrink the filesystem to the minimum size.</p>

<p>-p Prints out a percentage completion bars for each
resize2fs oper- ation, so that the user can keep track of
what the program is doing.</p>

<p>-P Print the minimum size of the filesystem and
exit.</p>

<p>-S RAID-stride The resize2fs program will heuristically
determine the RAID stride that was specified when the
filesystem was created. This option allows the user to
explicitly specify a RAID stride set- ting to be used by
resize2fs instead.</p>

<p>KNOWN BUGS The minimum size of the filesystem as
estimated by resize2fs may be incorrect, especially for
filesystems with 1k and 2k blocksizes.</p>
