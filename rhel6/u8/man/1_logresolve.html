<p>NAME logresolve - Resolve IP-addresses to hostnames in
Apache log files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS logresolve [ -s filename ] [ -c ] &lt;
access_log &gt; access_log.new</p>

<p>SUMMARY logresolve is a post-processing program to
resolve IP-addresses in Apache s access logfiles. To
minimize impact on your nameserver, logre- solve has its
very own internal hash-table cache. This means that each IP
number will only be looked up the first time it is found in
the log file.</p>

<p>Takes an Apache log file on standard input. The IP
addresses must be the first thing on each line and must be
separated from the remainder of the line by a space.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s filename Specifies a filename to record
statistics.</p>

<p>-c This causes logresolve to apply some DNS checks:
after finding the hostname from the IP address, it looks up
the IP addresses for the hostname and checks that one of
these matches the origi- nal address.</p>
