<p>NAME lpr - print files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lpr [ -E ] [ -H server[:port] ] [ -U username ]
[ -P destina- tion[/instance] ] [ -# num-copies [ -h ] [ -l
] [ -m ] [ -o option[=value] ] [ -p] [ -q ] [ -r ] [ -C/J/T
title ] [ file(s) ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lpr submits files for printing. Files named
on the command line are sent to the named printer (or the
default destination if no destination is specified). If no
files are listed on the command-line, lpr reads the print
file from the standard input.</p>

<p>THE DEFAULT DESTINATION CUPS provides many ways to set
the default destination. The &quot;LPDEST&quot; and
&quot;PRINTER&quot; environment variables are consulted
first. If neither are set, the current default set using the
lpoptions(1) command is used, followed by the default set
using the lpadmin(8) command.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are recognized by lpr:</p>

<p>-E Forces encryption when connecting to the server.</p>

<p>-H server[:port] Specifies an alternate server.</p>

<p>-C &quot;name&quot;</p>

<p>-J &quot;name&quot;</p>

<p>-T &quot;name&quot; Sets the job name.</p>

<p>-P destination[/instance] Prints files to the named
printer.</p>

<p>-U username Specifies an alternate username.</p>

<p>-# copies Sets the number of copies to print from 1 to
100.</p>

<p>-h Disables banner printing. This option is equivalent
to &quot;-o job- sheets=none&quot;.</p>

<p>-l Specifies that the print file is already formatted
for the desti- nation and should be sent without filtering.
This option is equiv- alent to &quot;-o raw&quot;.</p>

<p>-m Send an email on job completion.</p>

<p>-o option[=value] Sets a job option.</p>

<p>-p Specifies that the print file should be formatted
with a shaded header with the date, time, job name, and page
number. This option is equivalent to &quot;-o
prettyprint&quot; and is only useful when printing text
files.</p>

<p>-q Hold job for printing.</p>

<p>-r Specifies that the named print files should be
deleted after printing them.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY The &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;,
&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;n&quot;,
&quot;t&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, and &quot;w&quot; options are
not supported by CUPS and produce a warning message if
used.</p>
