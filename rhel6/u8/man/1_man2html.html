<p>NAME man2html - format a manual page in html</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS man2html [options] [file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION man2html converts a manual page as found in
file (or stdin, in case no file argument, or the argument
&quot;-&quot;, is given) from man-style nroff into html, and
prints the result on stdout. It does support tbl but does
not know about eqn. The exit status is 0. If something goes
wrong, an error page is printed on stdout.</p>

<p>This can be used as a stand-alone utility, but is mainly
intended as an auxiliary, to enable users to browse their
man pages using a html browser like lynx(1), xmosaic(1) or
netscape(1).</p>

<p>The main part of man2html is the troff-to-html engine
written by Richard Verhoeven (rcb5@win.tue.nl). It adds
hyperlinks for the fol- lowing constructs:</p>

<p>foo(3x)
&quot;http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3x+foo&quot;
method://string &quot;method://string&quot; www.host.name
&quot;http://www.host.name&quot; ftp.host.name
&quot;ftp://ftp.host.name&quot; name@host
&quot;mailto:name@host&quot; &lt;string.h&gt;
&quot;file:/usr/include/string.h&quot;</p>

<p>(The first of these can be tuned by options - see
below.) No lookup is done - the links generated need not
exist. Also an index with internal hyperlinks to the various
sections is generated, so that it is easier to find ones way
in large man pages like bash(1).</p>

<p>OPTIONS When reading from stdin, it is not always clear
how to do .so expan- sion. The -D option allows a script to
define the working directory.</p>

<p>-D pathname Strip the last two parts from the pathname,
and do a chdir(dir) before starting the conversion.</p>

<p>The -E option allows the easy generation of error
messages from a cgi script.</p>

<p>-E string Output an error page containing the given
error message.</p>

<p>The general form of a hyperlink generated for a man page
reference is</p>


<p>&lt;method:cgipath&gt;&lt;man2htmlpath&gt;&lt;separator&gt;&lt;manpage&gt;</p>

<p>with a default as shown above. The parts of this
hyperlink are set using the various options.</p>

<p>-h Set method:cgipath to http://localhost. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-H host[.domain][:port] Set method:cgipath to
http://host.domain:port.</p>

<p>-l Set method:cgipath to lynxcgi:/home/httpd.</p>

<p>-L dir Set method:cgipath to lynxcgi:dir.</p>

<p>-M man2htmlpath Set the man2htmlpath to use. The default
is /cgi- bin/man/man2html.</p>

<p>-p Set separator to /.</p>

<p>-q Set separator to ?. This is the default.</p>

<p>-r Use relative html paths, instead of cgi-bin
paths.</p>

<p>On a machine without running httpd, one can use lynx to
browse the man pages, using the lynxcgi method. When some
http daemon is running, lynx, or any other browser, can be
used to browse the man pages, using the http method. The
option -l (for lynxcgi) selects the former behaviour. With
it, the default cgipath is /home/httpd.</p>

<p>In general, a cgi script can be called by</p>


<p>&lt;path_to_script&gt;/&lt;more_path&gt;?&lt;query&gt;</p>

<p>and the environment variables PATH_INFO and QUERY_STRING
will be set to &lt;more_path&gt; and &lt;query&gt;,
respectively. Since lynxcgi does not handle the PATH_INFO
part, we generate hyperlinks with ? as a separator by
default. The option -p (for path ) selects / as a separator,
while the option -q (for query) selects ? as a
separator.</p>

<p>The option -H host will specify the host to use (instead
of localhost). A cgi script could use</p>

<p>man2html -H $SERVER_NAME</p>

<p>if the variable SERVER_NAME is set. This would allow
your machine to act as a server and export man pages.</p>

<p>BUGS There are many heuristics. The output will not
always be perfect. The lynxcgi method will not work if lynx
was compiled without selecting support for it. There may be
problems with security.</p>

<p>AUTHOR Richard Verhoeven was the original author of
man2html. Michael Hamil- ton and Andries Brouwer
subsequently improved on it. Federico Lucifredi
&lt;flucifredi@acm.org&gt; is the current maintainer.</p>
