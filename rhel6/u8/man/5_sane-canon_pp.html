<p>sane-canon_pp(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-canon_pp(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-canon_pp - SANE backend for Canon CanoScan
Parallel Port flatbed scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-canon_pp library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
the following Canon flatbed scanners:</p>

<p>CanoScan FB320P CanoScan FB620P CanoScan FB330P CanoScan
FB630P CanoScan N340P CanoScan N640P CanoScan N640P ex</p>

<p>No USB scanners are supported and there are no plans to
support them in the future. Other projects are working on
support for USB scanners. See the PROJECTS file for more
detail. The FB310P and FB610P are re- badged Avision
scanners which use a different command set, so are unlikely
to be supported by this backend in the future.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: this is alpha code. While we have made every
effort to make it as reliable as possible, it will not
always work as expected. Feed- back is still appreciated.
Please send any bug reports to the main- tainers as listed
on the web page (listed in SEE ALSO below).</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form presented by libieee1284. These names are highly
dependent on operating system and version.</p>

<p>On Linux 2.4 kernels this will be of the form parport0
or older (2.2 and before) kernels may produce names like
0x378 (the base address of your port) or simply 0 depending
on your module configuration. Check the contents of
/proc/parport if it exists. If you don t want to spec- ify a
default port (or dont know its name), the backend should be
able to detect which port your scanner is on.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the canon_pp.conf file is
a list of options for the driver to use. Empty lines and
lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.</p>

<p>The supported options are currently ieee1284, calibrate,
init_mode, and force_nibble</p>

<p>Option ieee1284 port-name defines which port to use. The
format of port-name is OS dependent, based on the names
presented by libieee1284. Please only have one of these
lines, or all but one will be ignored.</p>

<p>Option calibrate cal-file [port-name] defines which
calibration file to use on a per-port basis. If you only
have one parport, the port-name argument may be omitted -
but be careful as this will cause problems on multi-scanner
systems. You may have as many of these lines as you like, as
long as each has a unique port name. The tilde (~) charac-
ter is acceptable and will be expanded to the value of the
HOME envi- ronment.</p>

<p>Option init_mode &lt;AUTO|FB620P|FB630P&gt; [portname]
defines which initialisation (wake-up) mode to use on a
per-port basis. If you only have one parport, the portname
argument may be omitted - but be careful as this may cause
problems on multi-scanner systems. You may have as many of
these lines as you like, as long as each has a unique port
name. The valid initialisation modes are FB620P (which
strobes 10101010 and 01010101 on the data pins), FB630P
(which strobes 11001100 and 00110011 on the data pins) and
AUTO, which will try FB630P mode first then FB620P mode
second. The FB620P mode is also used by the FB320P. The
FB630P mode is used by the FB330P, N340P, and N640P.</p>

<p>Option force_nibble forces the driver to use nibble mode
even if ECP mode is reported to work by libieee1284. This
works-around the rare issue of ECP mode being reported to
work by the library, then not work- ing.</p>

<p>TIPS Hit the &quot;Calibrate&quot; button before
scanning. It vastly improves the quality of scans.</p>

<p>To enable automatic detection of your scanner, uncomment
the &quot;canon_pp&quot; line from /etc/sane.d/dll.conf</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/canon_pp.conf The backend
configuration file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR
below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-canon_pp.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-canon_pp.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_CANON_PP If the library was compiled with
debug support enabled, this environment variable controls
the debug level for this backend. Higher debug levels
increase the verbosity of the output.</p>

<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_CANON_PP=4</p>

<p>NOTES Features available in the Windows interface</p>

<p>Brightness and Contrast These are not implemented, and
probably never will be. These appear to be implemented
entirely in software. Use GIMP or a similar program if you
need these features.</p>

<p>Descreen Mode This appears on our first analysis to be
just oversampling with an anti-aliasing filter. Again, it
seems to be implemented entirely in software, so GIMP is
your best bet for now.</p>

<p>Gamma Tables This is under investigation, but for now
only a simple gamma profile (ie: the one returned during
calibration) will be loaded.</p>

<p>Communication Problems</p>

<p>ECP mode in libieee1284 doesn t always work properly,
even with new hardware. We believe that this is a ppdev
problem. If you change the configuration file to include
force_nibble , the problem will go away, but you will only
be able to scan in nibble mode.</p>

<p>Sometimes the scanner can be left in a state where our
code cannot revive it. If the backend reports no scanner
present, try unplugging the power and plugging it back in.
Also try unplugging printers from the pass-through port.</p>

<p>The scanner will not respond correctly to our commands
when you first plug in the power. You may find if you try a
scan very soon after plugging in the power that the backend
will incorrectly report that you have no scanner present. To
avoid this, give it about 10 seconds to reset itself before
attempting any scans.</p>

<p>Repeated Lines</p>

<p>Sometimes at high resolutions (ie. 600dpi) you will
notice lines which appear twice. These lines correspond to
points where the scanner head has stopped during the scan
(it stops every time the internal 64kb buffer is full).
Basically it s a mechanical problem inside the scan- ner,
that the tolerance of movement for a start/stop event is
greater than 1/600 inches. Ive never tried the windows
driver so Im not sure how (or if) it works around this
problem, but as we don t know how to rewind the scanner head
to do these bits again, theres currently no nice way to deal
with the problem.</p>

<p>Grey-scale Scans</p>

<p>Be aware that the scanner uses the green LEDs to read
grey-scale scans, meaning green coloured things will appear
lighter than normal, and red and blue coloured items will
appear darker than normal. For high-accu- racy grey-scale
scans of colour items, its best just to scan in colour and
convert to grey-scale in graphics software such as the
GIMP.</p>

<p>FB620P/FB320P Caveats</p>

<p>These models can not be reset in the same way as the
others. The win- dows driver doesnt know how to reset them
either - when left with an inconsistent scanner, it will
start scanning half way down the page!</p>

<p>Aborting is known to work correctly on the FB*30P
models, and is known to be broken on the FB*20P models. The
FB620P which I tested on simply returns garbage after a scan
has been aborted using the method we know. Aborting is able
to leave the scanner in a state where it can be shut down,
but not where another scan can be made.</p>

<p>AUTHOR This backend is primarily the work of Simon Krix
(Reverse Engineering), and Matthew Duggan (SANE
interface).</p>

<p>Many thanks to Kevin Easton for his comments and help,
and Kent A. Sig- norini for his help with the N340P.</p>
