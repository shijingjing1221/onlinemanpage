<p>DESCRIPTION cvs is a system for providing source control
to hierarchical collec- tions of source directories.
Commands and procedures for using cvs are described in
cvs(1).</p>

<p>cvs manages source repositories, the directories
containing master copies of the revision-controlled files,
by copying particular revi- sions of the files to (and
modifications back from) developers private working
directories. In terms of file structure, each individual
source repository is an immediate subdirectory of
$CVSROOT.</p>

<p>The files described here are supporting files; they do
not have to ex- ist for cvs to operate, but they allow you
to make cvs operation more flexible.</p>

<p>You can use the modules file to define symbolic names
for collections of source maintained with cvs. If there is
no modules file, develop- ers must specify complete path
names (absolute, or relative to $CVS- ROOT) for the files
they wish to manage with cvs commands.</p>

<p>You can use the commitinfo file to define programs to
execute whenev- er cvs commit is about to execute. These
programs are used for pre-commit checking to verify that the
modified, added, and removed files are really ready to be
committed. Some uses for this check might be to turn off a
portion (or all) of the source repository from a par-
ticular person or group. Or, perhaps, to verify that the
changed files conform to the sites standards for coding
practice.</p>

<p>You can use the cvswrappers file to record cvs wrapper
commands to be used when checking files into and out of the
repository. Wrappers al- low the file or directory to be
processed on the way in and out of CVS. The intended uses
are many, one possible use would be to reformat a C file
before the file is checked in, so all of the code in the
reposito- ry looks the same.</p>

<p>You can use the loginfo file to define programs to
execute after any commit, which writes a log entry for
changes in the repository. These logging programs might be
used to append the log message to a file. Or send the log
message through electronic mail to a group of developers.
Or, perhaps, post the log message to a particular
newsgroup.</p>

<p>You can use the taginfo file to define programs to
execute after any tagorrtag operation. These programs might
be used to append a message to a file listing the new tag
name and the programmer who created it, or send mail to a
group of developers, or, perhaps, post a message to a
particular newsgroup.</p>

<p>You can use the rcsinfo file to define forms for log
messages.</p>

<p>You can use the editinfo file to define a program to
execute for editing/validating cvs commit log entries. This
is most useful when used with a rcsinfo forms specification,
as it can verify that the proper fields of the form have
been filled in by the user committing the change.</p>

<p>You can use the cvsignore file to specify the default
list of files to ignore during update.</p>

<p>You can use the history file to record the cvs commands
that affect the repository. The creation of this file
enables history logging.</p>

<p>FILES modules The modules file records your definitions
of names for collec- tions of source code. cvs will use
these definitions if you use cvs to check in a file with the
right format to $CVSROOT/CVS- ROOT/modules,v.</p>

<p>The modules file may contain blank lines and comments
(lines beginning with #) as well as module definitions. Long
lines can be continued on the next line by specifying a
backslash () as the last character on the line.</p>

<p>A module definition is a single line of the modules
file, in either of two formats. In both cases, mname
represents the sym- bolic module name, and the remainder of
the line is its defini- tion.</p>

<p>mname -a aliases... This represents the simplest way of
defining a module mname. The -a flags the definition as a
simple alias: cvs will treat any use of mname (as a command
argument) as if the list of names aliases had been specified
instead. aliases may contain either other module names or
paths. When you use paths in aliases, cvs checkout creates
all intermediate directories in the work- ing directory,
just as if the path had been specified explicitly in the cvs
arguments.</p>

<p>mname [ options ] dir [ files... ] [ &amp;module...
]</p>

<p>In the simplest case, this form of module definition
reduces to mname dir . This defines all the files in
directory dir as module mname. dir is a relative path (from
$CVSROOT) to a di- rectory of source in one of the source
repositories. In this case, on checkout, a single directory
called mname is created as a working directory; no
intermediate directory levels are used by default, even if
dir was a path involving several directory levels.</p>

<p>By explicitly specifying files in the module definition
after dir, you can select particular files from directory
dir. The sample definition for modules is an example of a
module defined with a single file from a particular
directory. Here is another example:</p>

<p>m4test unsupported/gnu/m4 foreach.m4 forloop.m4</p>

<p>With this definition, executing cvs checkout m4test will
cre- ate a single working directory m4test containing the
two files listed, which both come from a common directory
several levels deep in the cvs source repository.</p>

<p>A module definition can refer to other modules by
including &amp;module in its definition. checkout creates a
subdirectory for each such module, in your working
directory. New in cvs 1.3; avoid this feature if sharing
module definitions with older versions of cvs.</p>

<p>Finally, you can use one or more of the following
options in module definitions:</p>

<p>-d name, to name the working directory something other
than the module name. New in cvs 1.3; avoid this feature if
sharing module definitions with older versions of cvs.</p>

<p>-i prog allows you to specify a program prog to run
whenever files in a module are committed. prog runs with a
single argu- ment, the full pathname of the affected
directory in a source repository. The commitinfo , loginfo ,
and editinfo files provide other ways to call a program on
commit.</p>

<p>-o prog allows you to specify a program prog to run
whenever files in a module are checked out. prog runs with a
single ar- gument, the module name.</p>

<p>-e prog allows you to specify a program prog to run
whenever files in a module are exported. prog runs with a
single argu- ment, the module name.</p>

<p>-t prog allows you to specify a program prog to run
whenever files in a module are tagged. prog runs with two
arguments: the module name and the symbolic tag specified to
rtag.</p>

<p>-u prog allows you to specify a program prog to run
whenever cvs update is executed from the top-level directory
of the checked-out module. prog runs with a single argument,
the full path to the source repository for this module.</p>

<p>commitinfo, loginfo, rcsinfo, editinfo These files all
specify programs to call at different points in the cvs
commit process. They have a common structure. Each line is a
pair of fields: a regular expression, separated by
whitespace from a filename or command-line template.
Whenever one of the regular expression matches a directory
name in the repository, the rest of the line is used. If the
line begins with a # character, the entire line is
considered a comment and is ignored. Whitespace between the
fields is also ignored.</p>

<p>For loginfo , the rest of the line is a command-line
template to execute. The templates can include not only a
program name, but whatever list of arguments you wish. If
you write %s somewhere on the argument list, cvs supplies,
at that point, the list of files affected by the commit. The
first entry in the list is the relative path within the
source repository where the change is being made. The
remaining arguments list the files that are being modified,
added, or removed by this commit invo- cation.</p>

<p>For taginfo , the rest of the line is a command-line
template to execute. The arguments passed to the command
are, in order, the tagname , operation (i.e. add for tag,
mov for tag -F, and del for tag -d ), repository , and any
remaining are pairs of filename revision . A non-zero exit
of the filter program will cause the tag to be aborted.</p>

<p>For commitinfo , the rest of the line is a command-line
tem- plate to execute. The template can include not only a
program name, but whatever list of arguments you wish. The
full path to the current source repository is appended to
the template, fol- lowed by the file names of any files
involved in the commit (added, removed, and modified
files).</p>

<p>For rcsinfo, the rest of the line is the full path to a
file that should be loaded into the log message
template.</p>

<p>For editinfo , the rest of the line is a command-line
template to execute. The template can include not only a
program name, but whatever list of arguments you wish. The
full path to the current log message template file is
appended to the template.</p>

<p>You can use one of two special strings instead of a
regular ex- pression: ALL specifies a command line template
that must al- ways be executed, and DEFAULT specifies a
command line tem- plate to use if no regular expression is a
match.</p>

<p>The commitinfo file contains commands to execute before
any other commit activity, to allow you to check any
conditions that must be satisfied before commit can proceed.
The rest of the commit will execute only if all selected
commands from this file exit with exit status 0.</p>

<p>The rcsinfo file allows you to specify log templates for
the commit logging session; you can use this to provide a
form to edit when filling out the commit log. The field
after the regu- lar expression, in this file, contains
filenames (of files con- taining the logging forms) rather
than command templates.</p>

<p>The editinfo file allows you to execute a script before
the commit starts, but after the log information is
recorded. These &quot;edit&quot; scripts can verify
information recorded in the log file. If the edit script
exits with a non-zero exit status, the commit is
aborted.</p>

<p>The loginfo file contains commands to execute at the end
of a commit. The text specified as a commit log message is
piped through the command; typical uses include sending
mail, filing an article in a newsgroup, or appending to a
central file.</p>

<p>cvsignore, .cvsignore The default list of files (or
sh(1) file name patterns) to ig- nore during cvs update. At
startup time, cvs loads the com- piled in default list of
file name patterns (see cvs(1)). Then the per-repository
list included in $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore is loaded, if it
exists. Then the per-user list is loaded from
$HOME/.cvsignore . Finally, as cvs traverses through your
di- rectories, it will load any per-directory .cvsignore
files whenever it finds one. These per-directory files are
only valid for exactly the directory that contains them, not
for any sub- directories.</p>

<p>history Create this file in $CVSROOT/CVSROOT to enable
history logging (see the description of cvs history).</p>
