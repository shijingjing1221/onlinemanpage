<p>NAME smp_rep_route_info - invoke REPORT ROUTE
INFORMATION SMP function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smp_rep_route_info [--help] [--hex]
[--index=IN] [--interface=PARAMS] [--multiple] [--num=NUM]
[--phy=ID] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--verbose] [--version]
SMP_DEVICE[,N]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends a SAS Management Protocol (SMP) REPORT
ROUTE INFORMATION function to a SMP target. The SMP target
is identified by the SMP_DEVICE and the SAS_ADDR. Depending
on the interface, the SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the
SMP_DEVICE. With one interface there is one SMP_DEVICE per
machine so the SMP_DEVICE,N syntax is needed to
differentiate between HBAs if there are multiple
present.</p>

<p>Each phy in a SAS expander that has an associated
routing attribute of &quot;table&quot; has a router table.
The number of rows (or entries) in each router table is
given by the &quot;expander route indexes&quot; field in the
response of the REPORT GENERAL function.</p>

<p>When the --multiple option is given, the REPORT ROUTE
INFORMATION func- tion is called multiple times. The index
value increments on each iter- ation, starting from
--index=IN (default 0). If --num=NUM is given and NUM is
greater than zero then that is the maximum number of
iterations performed. If --num=NUM is not given (or NUM is
zero) then iterations continue until there are 4 adjacent
disabled route entries (or some error is detected).</p>

<p>OPTIONS Mandatory arguments to long options are
mandatory for short options as well.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex output the response in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-i, --index=IN expander route index. IN is a value
between 0 and 65535. Default is 0. More precisely the
maximum index value is (expander_route_indexes - 1).</p>

<p>-I, --interface=PARAMS interface specific parameters. In
this case &quot;interface&quot; refers to the path through
the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.</p>

<p>-m, --multiple call the REPORT ROUTE INFORMATION
function multiple times, starting at --index=IN,
incrementing the index value on each iteration for a maximum
of --num=NUM iterations. For each enabled route table entry,
one line is output. If --num=NUM is not given (or NUM is
zero) then iterations continue until 4 adjacent disabled
entries are found (or some error occurs).</p>

<p>-n, --num=NUM used with --multiple option to specify the
maximum number of iterations.</p>

<p>-p, --phy=ID phy identifier. ID is a value between 0 and
127. Default is 0.</p>

<p>-r, --raw send the response to stdout in binary. All
error messages are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-s, --sa=SAS_ADDR specifies the SAS address of the SMP
target device. Typically this is an expander. This option
may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the targets SAS
address within it. The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS
addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in
hexadecimal either prefix it with 0x or put a trailing h on
it.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the verbosity of the output. Can
be used multiple times.</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The SMP REPORT ROUTE INFORMATION function
was introduced in SAS-1 . The &quot;Expander change
count&quot; field was added in SAS-2 .</p>
