<p>TELNETD(8) BSD System Manager s Manual TELNETD(8)</p>

<p>NAME telnetd - DARPA telnet protocol server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/sbin/in.telnetd [-hnNs] [-a authmode] [-D
debugmode] [-L loginprg] [-S tos] [-X authtype] [-edebug]
[-debug port]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The telnetd program is a server which
supports the DARPA telnet interac- tive communication
protocol. Telnetd is normally invoked by the internet server
(see inetd(8)) for requests to connect to the telnet port as
indi- cated by the /etc/services file (see services(5)). The
-debug option may be used to start up telnetd manually,
instead of through inetd(8). If started up this way, port
may be specified to run telnetd on an alternate TCP port
number.</p>

<p>The telnetd program accepts the following options:</p>

<p>-a authmode This option may be used for specifying what
mode should be used for authentication. Note that this
option is only use- ful if telnetd has been compiled with
support for authenti- cation, which is not available in the
current version. The following values of authmode are
understood:</p>

<p>debug Turns on authentication debugging code.</p>

<p>user Only allow connections when the remote user can
pro- vide valid authentication information to identify the
remote user, and is allowed access to the specified account
without providing a password.</p>

<p>valid Only allow connections when the remote user can
pro- vide valid authentication information to identify the
remote user. The login(1) command will provide any
additional user verification needed if the remote user is
not allowed automatic access to the specified account.</p>

<p>other Only allow connections that supply some
authentica- tion information. This option is currently not
sup- ported by any of the existing authentication mecha-
nisms, and is thus the same as specifying valid.</p>

<p>none This is the default state. Authentication informa-
tion is not required. If no or insufficient authen- tication
information is provided, then the login(1) program will
provide the necessary user verification.</p>

<p>off This disables the authentication code. All user ver-
ification will happen through the login(1) program.</p>

<p>-D debugmode This option may be used for debugging
purposes. This allows telnetd to print out debugging
information to the connec- tion, allowing the user to see
what telnetd is doing. There are several possible values for
debugmode:</p>

<p>options Prints information about the negotiation of
telnet options.</p>

<p>report Prints the options information, plus some addi-
tional information about what processing is going on.</p>

<p>netdata Displays the data stream received by
telnetd.</p>

<p>ptydata Displays data written to the pty.</p>

<p>exercise Has not been implemented yet.</p>

<p>-edebug If telnetd has been compiled with support for
encryption, then the -edebug option may be used to enable
encryption debugging code.</p>

<p>-h Disables the printing of host-specific information
before login has been completed.</p>

<p>-L loginprg This option may be used to specify a
different login pro- gram. By default, /bin/login is
used.</p>

<p>-n Disable TCP keep-alives. Normally telnetd enables the
TCP keep-alive mechanism to probe connections that have been
idle for some period of time to determine if the client is
still there, so that idle connections from machines that
have crashed or can no longer be reached may be cleaned
up.</p>

<p>-N Do not use DNS to canonicalize the local hostname;
gethostname(2) returns a fully qualified name.</p>

<p>-s This option is only enabled if telnetd is compiled
with sup- port for SecurID cards. It causes the -s option to
be passed on to login(1), and thus is only useful if
login(1) supports the -s flag to indicate that only SecurID
validated logins are allowed. This is usually useful for
controlling remote logins from outside of a firewall.</p>

<p>-S tos Sets the IP type-of-service (TOS) option for the
telnet con- nection to the value tos.</p>

<p>-X authtype This option is only valid if telnetd has
been built with support for the authentication option. It
disables the use of authtype authentication, and can be used
to temporarily disable a specific authentication type
without having to recompile telnetd.</p>

<p>If the file /etc/issue.net is present, telnetd will
display its contents before the login prompt of a telnet
session (see issue.net(5)).</p>

<p>Telnetd operates by allocating a pseudo-terminal device
(see pty(4)) for a client, then creating a login process
which has the slave side of the pseudo-terminal as stdin,
stdout, and stderr. Telnetd manipulates the master side of
the pseudo-terminal, implementing the telnet protocol and
passing characters between the remote client and the login
process.</p>

<p>When a telnet session is started up, telnetd sends
telnet options to the client side indicating a willingness
to do the following telnet options, which are described in
more detail below:</p>

<p>DO AUTHENTICATION WILL ENCRYPT DO TERMINAL TYPE DO
TSPEED DO XDISPLOC DO NEW-ENVIRON DO ENVIRON WILL SUPPRESS
GO AHEAD DO ECHO DO LINEMODE DO NAWS WILL STATUS DO LFLOW DO
TIMING-MARK</p>

<p>The pseudo-terminal allocated to the client is
configured to operate in cooked mode, and with XTABS CRMOD
enabled (see tty(4)).</p>

<p>Telnetd has support for enabling locally the following
telnet options:</p>

<p>WILL ECHO When the LINEMODE option is enabled, a WILL
ECHO or WONT ECHO will be sent to the client to indicate the
current state of terminal echoing. When terminal echo is not
desired, a WILL ECHO is sent to indicate that telnetd will
take care of echoing any data that needs to be echoed to the
terminal, and then nothing is echoed. When terminal echo is
desired, a WONT ECHO is sent to indicate that telnetd will
not be doing any terminal echoing, so the client should do
any terminal echoing that is needed.</p>

<p>WILL BINARY Indicates that the client is willing to send
a 8 bits of data, rather than the normal 7 bits of the
Network Virtual Terminal.</p>

<p>WILL SGA Indicates that it will not be sending IAC GA,
go ahead, commands.</p>

<p>WILL STATUS Indicates a willingness to send the client,
upon request, of the current status of all TELNET
options.</p>

<p>WILL TIMING-MARK Whenever a DO TIMING-MARK command is
received, it is always responded to with a WILL
TIMING-MARK</p>

<p>WILL LOGOUT When a DO LOGOUT is received, a WILL LOGOUT
is sent in response, and the TELNET session is shut
down.</p>

<p>WILL ENCRYPT Only sent if telnetd is compiled with
support for data encryption, and indicates a willingness to
decrypt the data stream.</p>

<p>Telnetd has support for enabling remotely the following
TELNET options:</p>

<p>DO BINARY Sent to indicate that telnetd is willing to
receive an 8 bit data stream.</p>

<p>DO LFLOW Requests that the client handle flow control
charac- ters remotely.</p>

<p>DO ECHO This is not really supported, but is sent to
identify a 4.2BSD telnet(1) client, which will improperly
respond with WILL ECHO. If a WILL ECHO is received, a DONT
ECHO will be sent in response.</p>

<p>DO TERMINAL-TYPE Indicates a desire to be able to
request the name of the type of terminal that is attached to
the client side of the connection.</p>

<p>DO SGA Indicates that it does not need to receive IAC
GA, the go ahead command.</p>

<p>DO NAWS Requests that the client inform the server when
the window (display) size changes.</p>

<p>DO TERMINAL-SPEED Indicates a desire to be able to
request information about the speed of the serial line to
which the client is attached.</p>

<p>DO XDISPLOC Indicates a desire to be able to request the
name of the X windows display that is associated with the
tel- net client.</p>

<p>DO NEW-ENVIRON Indicates a desire to be able to request
environment variable information, as described in RFC
1572.</p>

<p>DO ENVIRON Indicates a desire to be able to request
environment variable information, as described in RFC
1408.</p>

<p>DO LINEMODE Only sent if telnetd is compiled with
support for linemode, and requests that the client do line
by line processing.</p>

<p>DO TIMING-MARK Only sent if telnetd is compiled with
support for both linemode and kludge linemode, and the
client responded with WONT LINEMODE. If the client responds
with WILL TM, the it is assumed that the client supports
kludge linemode. Note that the [-k] option can be used to
disable this.</p>

<p>DO AUTHENTICATION Only sent if telnetd is compiled with
support for authentication, and indicates a willingness to
receive authentication information for automatic login.</p>

<p>DO ENCRYPT Only sent if telnetd is compiled with support
for data encryption, and indicates a willingness to decrypt
the data stream. issue.net(5)).</p>

<p>BUGS Some TELNET commands are only partially
implemented.</p>

<p>Because of bugs in the original 4.2 BSD telnet(1),
telnetd performs some dubious protocol exchanges to try to
discover if the remote client is, in fact, a 4.2 BSD
telnet(1).</p>

<p>Binary mode has no common interpretation except between
similar operating systems (Unix in this case).</p>

<p>The terminal type name received from the remote client
is converted to lower case.</p>

<p>Telnetd never sends TELNET IAC GA (go ahead)
commands.</p>

<p>The source code is not comprehensible.</p>
