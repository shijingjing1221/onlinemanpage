<p>TRACE-CMD-SPLIT(1) [FIXME: manual]
TRACE-CMD-SPLIT(1)</p>

<p>NAME trace-cmd-split - split a trace.dat file into
smaller files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS trace-cmd split [OPTIONS] [start-time
[end-time]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The trace-cmd(1) split is used to break up a
trace.dat into small files. The start-time specifies where
the new file will start at. Using trace-cmd-report(1) and
copying the time stamp given at a particular event, can be
used as input for either start-time or end-time. The split
will stop creating files when it reaches an event after
end-time. If only the end-time is needed, use 0.0 as the
start-time.</p>

<p>If start-time is left out, then the split will start at
the beginning of the file. If end-time is left out, then
split will continue to the end unless it meets one of the
requirements specified by the options.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -i file If this option is not specified, then
the split command will look for the file named trace.dat.
This options will allow the reading of another file other
than trace.dat.</p>

<p>-o file By default, the split command will use the input
file name as a basis of where to write the split files. The
output file will be the input file with an attached
&acute;.#&acute; to the end: trace.dat.1, trace.dat.2,
etc.</p>

<p>This option will change the name of the base file
used.</p>

<p>-o file will create file.1, file.2, etc.</p>

<p>-s seconds This specifies how many seconds should be
recorded before the new file should stop.</p>

<p>-m milliseconds This specifies how many milliseconds
should be recorded before the new file should stop.</p>

<p>-u microseconds This specifies how many microseconds
should be recorded before the new file should stop.</p>

<p>-e events This specifies how many events should be
recorded before the new file should stop.</p>

<p>-p pages This specifies the number of pages that should
be recorded before the new file should stop.</p>

<p>Note: only one of *-p*, *-e*, *-u*, *-m*, *-s* may be
specified at a time.</p>

<p>If *-p* is specified, then *-c* is automatically
set.</p>

<p>-r This option causes the break up to repeat until
end-time is reached (or end of the input if end-time is not
specified).</p>

<p>trace-cmd split -r -e 10000</p>

<p>This will break up trace.dat into several smaller files,
each with at most 10,000 events in it.</p>

<p>-c This option causes the above break up to be per
CPU.</p>

<p>trace-cmd split -c -p 10</p>

<p>This will create a file that has 10 pages per each CPU
from the input.</p>
