<p>DESCRIPTION The purpose of this program is to provide a
daemonized version of the spamassassin executable. The goal
is improving throughput performance for automated mail
checking.</p>

<p>This is intended to be used alongside &quot;spamc&quot;,
a fast, low-overhead C client program.</p>

<p>See the README file in the &quot;spamd&quot; directory
of the SpamAssassin distribution for more details.</p>

<p>Note: Although &quot;spamd&quot; will check per-user
config files for every message, any changes to the
system-wide config files will require either restarting
spamd or forcing it to reload itself via SIGHUP for the
changes to take effect.</p>

<p>Note: If &quot;spamd&quot; receives a SIGHUP, it
internally reloads itself, which means that it will change
its pid and might not restart at all if its environment
changed (ie. if it cant change back into its own directory).
If you plan to use SIGHUP, you should always start
&quot;spamd&quot; with the -r switch to know its current
pid.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Options of the long form can be shortened as
long as they remain unambiguous. (i.e. --dae can be used
instead of --daemonize) Also, boolean options (like
--user-config) can be negated by adding no
(--nouser-config), however, this is usually unnecessary.</p>

<p>-l, --allow-tell Allow learning and forgetting (to a
local Bayes database), reporting and revoking (to a remote
database) by spamd. The client issues a TELL command to tell
what type of message is being processed and whether local
(learn/forget) or remote (report/revoke) databases should be
updated.</p>

<p>Note that spamd always trusts the username passed in
(unless --auth-ident is used) so clients could maliciously
learn messages for other users. (This is not ususally a
concern with an SQL Bayes store as users will typically have
read-write access directly to the database, and can also use
&quot;sa-learn&quot; with the -u option to achieve the same
result.)</p>

<p>-c, --create-prefs Create user preferences files if they
dont exist (default: dont).</p>

<p>-C path, --configpath=path Use the specified path for
locating the distributed configuration files. Ignore the
default directories (usually
&quot;/usr/share/spamassassin&quot; or similar).</p>

<p>--siteconfigpath=path Use the specified path for
locating site-specific configuration files. Ignore the
default directories (usually
&quot;/etc/mail/spamassassin&quot; or similar).</p>

<p>--cfconfig line Add additional lines of configuration
directly from the command- line, parsed after the
configuration files are read. Multiple --cf arguments can be
used, and each will be considered a separate line of
configuration.</p>

<p>-d, --daemonize Detach from starting process and run in
background (daemonize).</p>

<p>-h, --help Print a brief help message, then exit without
further action.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print version information, then exit
without further action.</p>

<p>-i [ipaddress], --listen-ip[=ipaddress],
--ip-address[=ipaddress] Tells spamd to listen on the
specified IP address (defaults to 127.0.0.1). If you specify
no IP address after the switch, spamd will listen on all
interfaces. (This is equal to the address 0.0.0.0). You can
also use a valid hostname which will make spamd listen on
the first address that name resolves to.</p>

<p>-p port, --port=port Optionally specifies the port
number for the server to listen on (default: 783).</p>

<p>If the --ssl switch is used, and --ssl-port is not
supplied, then this port will be used to accept SSL
connections instead of unencrypted connections. If the --ssl
switch is used, and --ssl-port is set, then unencrypted
connections will be accepted on the --port at the same time
as encrypted connections are accepted at --ssl-port.</p>

<p>-q, --sql-config Turn on SQL lookups even when per-user
config files have been disabled with -x. this is useful for
spamd hosts which dont have user s home directories but do
want to load user preferences from an SQL database.</p>

<p>If your spamc client does not support sending the
&quot;User:&quot; header, like &quot;exiscan&quot;, then the
SQL username used will always be nobody.</p>

<p>This inhibits the setuid() behavior, so the
&quot;-u&quot; option is required. If you want the setuid()
behaviour, use &quot;-Q&quot; or
&quot;--setuid-with-sql&quot; instead.</p>

<p>--ldap-config Turn on LDAP lookups. This is completely
analog to &quot;--sql-config&quot;, only it is using an LDAP
server.</p>

<p>Like &quot;--sql-config&quot;, this disables the setuid
behavior, and requires &quot;-u&quot;. If you want it, use
&quot;--setuid-with-ldap&quot; instead.</p>

<p>-Q, --setuid-with-sql Turn on SQL lookups even when
per-user config files have been disabled with -x and also
setuid to the user. This is useful for spamd hosts which
want to load user preferences from an SQL database but also
wish to support the use of -H (Helper home directories.)</p>

<p>--setuid-with-ldap Turn on LDAP lookups even when
per-user config files have been disabled with -x and also
setuid to the user. This is again completely analog to
&quot;--setuid-with-sql&quot;, only it is using an LDAP
server.</p>

<p>--virtual-config-dir=pattern This option specifies where
per-user preferences can be found for virtual users, for the
-x switch. The pattern is used as a base pattern for the
directory name. Any of the following escapes can be
used:</p>

<p>%u -- replaced with the full name of the current user,
as sent by spamc. %l -- replaced with the local part of the
current username. In other words, if the username is an
email address, this is the part before the &quot;@&quot;
sign. %d -- replaced with the domain of the current
username. In other words, if the username is an email
address, this is the part after the &quot;@&quot; sign. %%
-- replaced with a single percent sign (%).</p>

<p>So for example, if
&quot;/vhome/users/%u/spamassassin&quot; is specified, and
spamc sends a virtual username of
&quot;jm@example.com&quot;, the directory
&quot;/vhome/users/jm@example.com/spamassassin&quot; will be
used.</p>

<p>The set of characters allowed in the virtual username
for this path are restricted to:</p>

<p>A-Z a-z 0-9 - + _ . , @ =</p>

<p>All others will be replaced by underscores
(&quot;_&quot;).</p>

<p>This path must be a writable directory. It will be
created if it does not already exist. If a file called
user_prefs exists in this directory (note: not in a
&quot;.spamassassin&quot; subdirectory!), it will be loaded
as the user s preferences. The Bayes databases for that user
will be stored in this directory.</p>

<p>Note that this requires that -x is used, and cannot be
combined with SQL- or LDAP-based configuration.</p>

<p>The pattern must expand to an absolute directory when
spamd is running daemonized (-d).</p>

<p>Currently, use of this without -u is not supported. This
inhibits setuid.</p>

<p>-r pidfile, --pidfile=pidfile Write the process ID of
the spamd parent to the file specified by pidfile. The file
will be unlinked when the parent exits. Note that when
running with the -u option, the file must be writable by
that user.</p>

<p>-v, --vpopmail Enable vpopmail config. If specified with
with -u set to the vpopmail user, this allows spamd to
lookup/create user_prefs in the vpopmail users own maildir.
This option is useful for vpopmail virtual users who do not
have an entry in the system /etc/passwd file.</p>

<p>Currently, use of this without -u is not supported. This
inhibits setuid.</p>

<p>-s facility, --syslog=facility Specify the syslog
facility to use (default: mail). If &quot;stderr&quot; is
specified, output will be written to stderr. (This is useful
if you re running &quot;spamd&quot; under the
&quot;daemontools&quot; package.) With a facility of
&quot;file&quot;, all output goes to spamd.log. facility is
interpreted as a file name to log to if it contains any
characters except a-z and 0-9. &quot;null&quot; disables
logging completely (used internally).</p>

<p>Examples: spamd -s mail # use syslog, facility mail
(default) spamd -s ./mail # log to file ./mail spamd -s
stderr 2&gt;/dev/null # log to stderr, throw messages away
spamd -s null # the same as above spamd -s file # log to
file ./spamd.log spamd -s /var/log/spamd.log # log to file
/var/log/spamd.log</p>

<p>If logging to a file is enabled and that log file is
rotated, the spamd server must be restarted with a SIGHUP.
(If the log file is just truncated, this is not needed but
still recommended.)</p>

<p>Note that logging to a file does not use locking, so you
cannot intermix logging from spamd and other processes into
the same file. If you want to mix logging like this, use
syslog instead.</p>

<p>If you use syslog logging, it is essential to send a
SIGHUP to the spamd daemon when you restart the syslogd
daemon. (This is due to a shortcoming in Perl s syslog
handling, where the disappearance of the connection to the
syslogd is considered a fatal error.)</p>

<p>--syslog-socket=type Specify how spamd should send
messages to syslogd. The type can be any of the socket types
or logging mechanisms as accepted by the subroutine
Sys::Syslog::setlogsock(). Depending on a version of
Sys::Syslog and on the underlying operating system, one of
the following values (or their subset) can be used:
&quot;native&quot;, &quot;eventlog&quot;, &quot;tcp&quot;,
&quot;udp&quot;, &quot;inet&quot;, &quot;unix&quot;,
&quot;stream&quot;, &quot;pipe&quot;, or
&quot;console&quot;. The value &quot;eventlog&quot; is
specific to Win32 events logger and requires a perl module
Win32::EventLog to be installed. For more information please
consult the Sys::Syslog documentation.</p>

<p>A historical setting --syslog-socket=none is mapped to
--syslog=stderr.</p>

<p>A default for Windows platforms is &quot;none&quot;,
otherwise the default is to try &quot;unix&quot; first,
falling back to &quot;inet&quot; if perl detects errors in
its &quot;unix&quot; support.</p>

<p>Some platforms, or versions of perl, are shipped with
old or dysfunctional versions of the Sys::Syslog module
which do not support some socket types, so you may need to
set this option explicitly. If you get error messages
regarding __PATH_LOG or similar spamd, try changing this
setting.</p>

<p>The socket types &quot;file&quot; is used internally and
should not be specified. Use the &quot;-s&quot; switch
instead.</p>

<p>-u username, --username=username Run as the named user.
If this option is not set, the default behaviour is to
setuid() to the user running &quot;spamc&quot;, if
&quot;spamd&quot; is running as root.</p>

<p>Note: &quot;--username=root&quot; is not a valid option.
If specified, &quot;spamd&quot; will exit with a fatal error
on startup.</p>

<p>-g groupname, --groupname=groupname Run as the named
group if --username is being used. If this option is not set
when --username is used then the primary group for the user
given to --username is used.</p>

<p>-x, --nouser-config, --user-config Turn off (on) reading
of per-user configuration files (user_prefs) from the users
home directory. The default behaviour is to read per-user
configuration from the users home directory
(--user-config).</p>

<p>This option does not disable or otherwise influence the
SQL, LDAP or Virtual Config Dir settings.</p>

<p>--auth-ident Verify the username provided by spamc using
ident. This is only useful if connections are only allowed
from trusted hosts (because an identd that lies is trivial
to create) and if spamc REALLY SHOULD be running as the user
it represents. Connections are terminated immediately if
authentication fails. In this case, spamc will pass the mail
through unchecked. Failure to connect to an ident server,
and response timeouts are considered authentication
failures. This requires that Net::Ident be installed.</p>

<p>--ident-timeout=timeout Wait at most timeout seconds for
a response to ident queries. Authentication that takes long
that timeout seconds will fail, and mail will not be
processed. Setting this to 0.0 or less results in no
timeout, which is STRONGLY discouraged. The default is 5
seconds.</p>

<p>-A host,..., --allowed-ips=host,... Specify a list of
authorized hosts or networks which can connect to this spamd
instance. Single IP addresses can be given, ranges of IP
addresses in address/masklength CIDR format, or ranges of IP
addresses by listing 3 or less octets with a trailing dot.
Hostnames are not supported, only IP addresses. This option
can be specified multiple times, or can take a list of
addresses separated by commas. Examples:</p>

<p>-A 10.11.12.13 -- only allow connections from
10.11.12.13.</p>

<p>-A 10.11.12.13,10.11.12.14 -- only allow connections
from 10.11.12.13 and 10.11.12.14.</p>

<p>-A 10.200.300.0/24 -- allow connections from any machine
in the range &quot;10.200.300.*&quot;.</p>

<p>-A 10. -- allow connections from any machine in the
range &quot;10.*.*.*&quot;.</p>

<p>By default, connections are only accepted from localhost
[127.0.0.1].</p>

<p>-D [area,...], --debug [area,...] Produce debugging
output. If no areas are listed, all debugging information is
printed. Diagnostic output can also be enabled for each area
individually; area is the area of the code to instrument.
For example, to produce diagnostic output on bayes, learn,
and dns, use:</p>

<p>spamassassin -D bayes,learn,dns</p>

<p>Higher priority informational messages that are suitable
for logging in normal circumstances are available with an
area of &quot;info&quot;.</p>

<p>For more information about which areas (also known as
channels) are available, please see the documentation
at:</p>


<p>C&lt;http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/DebugChannels&gt;</p>

<p>--ipv4only, --ipv4-only, --ipv4 Do not use IPv6 for DNS
tests. Use if the existing tests for IPv6 availability
produce incorrect results or crashes.</p>

<p>-L, --local Perform only local tests on all mail. In
other words, skip DNS and other network tests. Works the
same as the &quot;-L&quot; flag to spamassassin(1).</p>

<p>-P, --paranoid Die on user errors (for the user passed
from spamc) instead of falling back to user nobody and using
the default configuration.</p>

<p>-m number , --max-children=number This option specifies
the maximum number of children to spawn. Spamd will spawn
that number of children, then sleep in the background until
a child dies, wherein it will go and spawn a new child.</p>

<p>Incoming connections can still occur if all of the
children are busy, however those connections will be queued
waiting for a free child. The minimum value is 1, the
default value is 5.</p>

<p>Please note that there is a OS specific maximum of
connections that can be queued (Try &quot;perl -MSocket
-e&rsquo;print SOMAXCONN&rsquo;&quot; to find this
maximum).</p>

<p>Note that if you run too many servers for the amount of
free RAM available, you run the danger of hurting
performance by causing a high swap load as server processes
are swapped in and out continually.</p>

<p>--min-children=number The minimum number of children
that will be kept running. The minimum value is 1, the
default value is 1. If you have lots of free RAM, you may
want to increase this.</p>

<p>--min-spare=number The lower limit for the number of
spare children allowed to run. A spare, or idle, child is
one that is not handling a scan request. If there are too
few spare children available, a new server will be started
every second or so. The default value is 1.</p>

<p>--max-spare=number The upper limit for the number of
spare children allowed to run. If there are too many spare
children, one will be killed every second or so until the
number of idle children is in the desired range. The default
value is 2.</p>

<p>--max-conn-per-child=number This option specifies the
maximum number of connections each child should process
before dying and letting the master spamd process spawn a
new child. The minimum value is 1, the default value is
200.</p>

<p>--round-robin By default, &quot;spamd&quot; will attempt
to keep a small number of &quot;hot&quot; child processes as
busy as possible, and keep any others as idle as possible,
using something similar to the Apache httpd server scaling
algorithm. This is accomplished by the master process
coordinating the activities of the children. This switch
will disable this scaling algorithm, and the behaviour seen
in the 3.0.x versions will be used instead, where all
processes receive an equal load and no scaling takes
place.</p>

<p>--timeout-tcp=number This option specifies the number of
seconds to wait for headers from a client (spamc) before
closing the connection. The minimum value is 1, the default
value is 30, and a value of 0 will disable socket timeouts
completely.</p>

<p>--timeout-child=number This option specifies the number
of seconds to wait for a spamd child to process or check a
message. The minimum value is 1, the default value is 300,
and a value of 0 will disable child timeouts completely.</p>

<p>-H directory, --helper-home-dir=directory Specify that
external programs such as Razor, DCC, and Pyzor should have
a HOME environment variable set to a specific directory. The
default is to use the HOME environment variable setting from
the shell running spamd. By specifying no argument, spamd
will use the spamc callers home directory instead.</p>

<p>--ssl Accept only SSL connections on the associated
port. The IO::Socket::SSL perl module must be installed.</p>

<p>If the --ssl switch is used, and --ssl-port is not
supplied, then --port port will be used to accept SSL
connections instead of unencrypted connections. If the --ssl
switch is used, and --ssl-port is set, then unencrypted
connections will be accepted on the --port, at the same time
as encrypted connections are accepted at --ssl-port.</p>

<p>--ssl-port=port Optionally specifies the port number for
the server to listen on for SSL connections (default:
whatever --port uses). See --ssl for more details.</p>

<p>--ssl-version=sslversion Specify the SSL protocol
version to use, one of sslv2, sslv3, tlsv1, or sslv23. The
default, sslv23, is the most flexible, accepting a SSLv2 or
higher hello handshake, then negotiating use of SSLv3 or
TLSv1 protocol if the client can accept it. Specifying
--ssl-version implies --ssl.</p>

<p>--server-key keyfile Specify the SSL key file to use for
SSL connections.</p>

<p>--server-cert certfile Specify the SSL certificate file
to use for SSL connections.</p>

<p>--socketpath pathname Listen on UNIX domain path
pathname instead of a TCP socket.</p>

<p>Warning: the Perl support on BSD platforms for UNIX
domain sockets seems to have a bug regarding paths of over
100 bytes or so (SpamAssassin bug 4380). If you see a could
not find newly- created UNIX socket error message, and the
path appears truncated, this may be the cause. Try using a
shorter path to the socket.</p>

<p>By default, use of --socketpath will inhibit SSL
connections and unencrypted TCP connections. To enable them,
specify --port and/or --ssl-port explicitly.</p>

<p>--socketowner name Set UNIX domain socket to be owned by
the user named name. Note that this requires that spamd be
started as &quot;root&quot;, and if &quot;-u&quot; is used,
that user should have write permissions to unlink the file
later, for when the &quot;spamd&quot; server is killed.</p>

<p>--socketgroup name Set UNIX domain socket to be owned by
the group named name. See &quot;--socketowner&quot; for
notes on ownership and permissions.</p>

<p>--socketmode mode Set UNIX domain socket to use the
octal mode mode. Note that if &quot;-u&quot; is used, that
user should have write permissions to unlink the file later,
for when the &quot;spamd&quot; server is killed.</p>
