<p>appletviewer(1) Basic Tools appletviewer(1)</p>

<p>NAME appletviewer - Runs applets outside of a web
browser.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS appletviewer [options] url...</p>

<p>options The command-line options separated by spaces.
See Options.</p>

<p>url The location of the documents or resources to be
displayed. You can specify multiple URLs separated by
spaces.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The appletviewer command connects to the
documents or resources designated by urls and displays each
applet referenced by the documents in its own window. If the
documents referred to by urls do not reference any applets
with the OBJECT, EMBED, or APPLET tag, then the appletviewer
command does nothing. For details about the HTML tags that
the appletviewer command supports, see AppletViewer Tags at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/appletviewertags.html</p>

<p>The appletviewer command requires encoded URLs according
to the escaping mechanism defined in RFC2396. Only encoded
URLs are supported. However, file names must be unencoded,
as specified in RFC2396.</p>

<p>Note: The appletviewer command is intended for
development purposes only. For more information, see About
Sample/Test Applications and Code at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/samples/aboutCodeSamples.html</p>

<p>OPTIONS -debug Starts the Applet Viewer in the Java
debugger with the jdb command to debug the applets in the
document.</p>

<p>-encoding encoding-name Specifies the input HTML file
encoding name.</p>

<p>-Jjavaoption Passes the string javaoption as a single
argument to the Java interpreter, which runs the Applet
Viewer. The argument should not contain spaces. Multiple
argument words must all begin with the prefix -J. This is
useful for adjusting the compilers execution environment or
memory usage.</p>
