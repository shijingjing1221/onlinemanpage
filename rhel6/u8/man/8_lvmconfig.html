<p>DESCRIPTION lvmconfig produces formatted output from the
LVM configuration tree. The command was added in release
2.02.119 and has an identical longer form lvm
dumpconfig.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f, --file filename Send output to a file named
filename.</p>

<p>-l, --list List configuration settings with summarizing
comment. This is the same as using lvmconfig --type list
--withsummary.</p>

<p>--type
{current|default|diff|full|missing|new|profilable|profilable-
command|profilable-metadata} Select the type of
configuration to display. The configuration settings
displayed have either default values or currently-used
values assigned based on the type selected. If no type is
selected, --type current is used by default. Whenever a
configu- ration setting with a default value is commented
out, it means the setting does not have any concrete default
value defined. Output can be saved and used as a proper
lvm.conf(5) file.</p>

<p>current Display the current lvm.conf configuration
merged with any tag config if used. See also lvm.conf(5) for
more info about LVM configuration methods.</p>

<p>default Display all possible configuration settings with
default val- ues assigned.</p>

<p>diff Display all configuration settings for which the
values used differ from defaults. The value assigned for
each configura- tion setting is the value currently used.
This is actually minimal LVM configuration which can be used
without a change to current configured behaviour.</p>

<p>full Display full configuration tree - a combination of
current configuration tree (--type current) and tree of
settings for which default values are used (--type missing).
This is exactly the configuration tree that LVM2 uses during
command execution. Using this type also implies the use of
--merged- config option. If comments are displayed (see
--withcomments and --withsummary options), then for each
setting found in existing configuration and for which
defaults are not used, there s an extra comment line printed
to denote this.</p>

<p>list Display plain list of configuration settings.</p>

<p>missing Display all configuration settings with default
values assigned which are missing in the configuration
currently used and for which LVM automatically fallbacks to
using these default values.</p>

<p>new Display all new configuration settings introduced in
current LVM version or specific version as defined by
--atversion option.</p>

<p>profilable Display all profilable configuration settings
with default values assigned. See lvm.conf(5) for more info
about profile config method.</p>

<p>profilable-command Display all profilable configuration
settings with default values assigned that can be used in
command profile. This is a subset of settings displayed by
--type --profilable.</p>

<p>profilable-metadata Display all profilable configuration
settings with default values assigned that can be used in
metadata profile. This is a subset of settings displayed by
--type --profilable.</p>

<p>--atversion version Specify an LVM version in x.y.z
format where x is the major ver- sion, the y is the minor
version and z is the patchlevel (e.g. 2.2.106). When
configuration is displayed, the configuration settings
recognized at this LVM version will be considered only. This
can be used to display a configuration that a certain LVM
version understands and which does not contain any newer
set- tings for which LVM would issue a warning message when
checking the configuration.</p>

<p>--sinceversion version Specify an LVM version in x.y.z
format where x is the major ver- sion, the y is the minor
version and z is the patchlevel (e.g. 2.2.106). This option
is currently applicable only with --type new to display all
configuration settings introduced since given version.</p>

<p>--ignoreadvanced Exclude advanced configuration settings
from the output.</p>

<p>--ignoreunsupported Exclude unsupported configuration
settings from the output. These settings are either used for
debugging and development purposes only or their support is
not yet complete and they are not meant to be used in
production. The current and diff types include unsupported
settings in their output by default, all the other types
ignore unsupported settings.</p>

<p>--ignorelocal Ignore local section.</p>

<p>--config ConfigurationString Use ConfigurationString to
override existing configuration. This configuration is then
applied for the lvmconfig command itself. See also
lvm.conf(5) for more info about config cas- cade.</p>

<p>--commandprofile ProfileName Use ProfileName to override
existing configuration. This con- figuration is then applied
for the lvmconfig command itself. See also --mergedconfig
option and lvm.conf(5) for more info about config
cascade.</p>

<p>--profile ProfileName The same as using --commandprofile
but the configuration is not applied for the lvmconfig
command itself.</p>

<p>--metadataprofile ProfileName Use ProfileName to
override existing configuration. The config- uration defined
in metadata profile has no effect for the lvm- config
command itself. lvmconfig displays the configuration only.
See also --mergedconfig option and lvm.conf(5) for more info
about config cascade.</p>

<p>--mergedconfig When the lvmconfig command is run with
the --config option and/or --commandprofile (or using
LVM_COMMAND_PROFILE environ- ment variable), --profile,
--metadataprofile option, merge all the contents of the
config cascade before displaying it. With- out the
--mergeconfig option used, only the configuration at the
front of the cascade is displayed. See also lvm.conf(5) for
more info about config cascade.</p>

<p>--showdeprecated Include deprecated configuration
settings in the output. These settings are always deprecated
since certain version. If con- crete version is specified
with --atversion option, deprecated settings are
automatically included if specified version is lower that
the version in which the settings were deprecated. The
current and diff types include deprecated settings int their
output by default, all the other types ignore deprecated
set- tings.</p>

<p>--showunsupported Include unsupported configuration
settings in the output. These settings are either used for
debugging or development purposes only or their support is
not yet complete and they are not meant to be used in
production. The current and diff types include unsupported
settings in their output by default, all the other types
ignore unsupported settings.</p>

<p>--validate Validate current configuration used and exit
with appropriate return code. The validation is done only
for the configuration at the front of the config cascade. To
validate the whole merged configuration tree, use also the
--mergedconfig option. The validation is done even if
config/checks lvm.conf(5) option is disabled.</p>

<p>--withsummary Display a one line comment for each
configuration node.</p>

<p>--withcomments Display a full comment for each
configuration node. For depre- cated settings, also display
comments about deprecation in addi- tion.</p>

<p>--withspaces Where appropriate, add more spaces in
output for better read- ability.</p>

<p>--withversions Also display a comment containing the
version of introduction for each configuration node. If the
setting is deprecated, also display the version since which
it is deprecated.</p>
