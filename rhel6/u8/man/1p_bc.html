<p>BC(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual BC(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME bc - arbitrary-precision arithmetic language</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS bc [-l] [file ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The bc utility shall implement an arbitrary
precision calculator. It shall take input from any files
given, then read from the standard input. If the standard
input and standard output to bc are attached to a terminal,
the invocation of bc shall be considered to be interactive,
causing behavioral constraints described in the following
sections.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The bc utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-l (The letter ell.) Define the math functions and
initialize scale to 20, instead of the default zero; see the
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a text file containing bc program
statements. After all files have been read, bc shall read
the standard input.</p>

<p>STDIN See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES Input files shall be text files containing a
sequence of comments, statements, and function definitions
that shall be executed as they are read.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of bc:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The output of the bc utility shall be controlled
by the program read, and consist of zero or more lines
containing the value of all executed expressions without
assignments. The radix and precision of the output shall be
controlled by the values of the obase and scale variables;
see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION Grammar The grammar in this section
and the lexical conventions in the follow- ing section shall
together describe the syntax for bc programs. The general
conventions for this style of grammar are described in
Grammar Conventions . A valid program can be represented as
the non-terminal symbol program in the grammar. This formal
syntax shall take precedence over the text syntax
description.</p>

<p>Lexical Conventions in bc The lexical conventions for bc
programs, with respect to the preceding grammar, shall be as
follows:</p>

<p>1. Except as noted, bc shall recognize the longest
possible token or delimiter beginning at a given point.</p>

<p>2. A comment shall consist of any characters beginning
with the two adjacent characters &quot;/*&quot; and
terminated by the next occurrence of the two adjacent
characters &quot;*/&quot; . Comments shall have no effect
except to delimit lexical tokens.</p>

<p>3. The &lt;newline&gt; shall be recognized as the token
NEWLINE.</p>

<p>4. The token STRING shall represent a string constant;
it shall con- sist of any characters beginning with the
double-quote character ( ) and terminated by another
occurrence of the double-quote char- acter. The value of the
string is the sequence of all characters between, but not
including, the two double-quote characters. All characters
shall be taken literally from the input, and there is no way
to specify a string containing a double-quote character. The
length of the value of each string shall be limited to
{BC_STRING_MAX} bytes.</p>

<p>5. A &lt;blank&gt; shall have no effect except as an
ordinary character if it appears within a STRING token, or
to delimit a lexical token other than STRING.</p>

<p>6. The combination of a backslash character immediately
followed by a &lt;newline&gt; shall have no effect other
than to delimit lexical tokens with the following
exceptions:</p>

<p>* It shall be interpreted as the character sequence
&lt;newline&gt;&quot; in STRING tokens.</p>

<p>* It shall be ignored as part of a multi-line NUMBER
token.</p>

<p>7. The token NUMBER shall represent a numeric constant.
It shall be recognized by the following grammar:</p>

<p>NUMBER : integer |.integer | integer. | integer.integer
;</p>

<p>integer : digit | integer digit ;</p>

<p>digit : 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B |
C | D | E | F ;</p>

<p>8. The value of a NUMBER token shall be interpreted as a
numeral in the base specified by the value of the internal
register ibase (described below). Each of the digit
characters shall have the value from 0 to 15 in the order
listed here, and the period charac- ter shall represent the
radix point. The behavior is undefined if digits greater
than or equal to the value of ibase appear in the token.
However, note the exception for single-digit values being
assigned to ibase and obase themselves, in Operations in bc
.</p>

<p>9. The following keywords shall be recognized as
tokens:</p>

<p>auto ibase length return while break if obase scale
define for quit sqrt</p>

<p>10. Any of the following characters occurring anywhere
except within a keyword shall be recognized as the token
LETTER:</p>

<p>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z</p>

<p>11. The following single-character and two-character
sequences shall be recognized as the token ASSIGN_OP:</p>

<p>= += -= *= /= %= ^=</p>

<p>12. If an = character, as the beginning of a token, is
followed by a - character with no intervening delimiter, the
behavior is unde- fined.</p>

<p>13. The following single-characters shall be recognized
as the token MUL_OP:</p>

<p>* / %</p>

<p>14. The following single-character and two-character
sequences shall be recognized as the token REL_OP:</p>

<p>== &lt;= &gt;= != &lt; &gt;</p>

<p>15. The following two-character sequences shall be
recognized as the token INCR_DECR:</p>

<p>++ --</p>

<p>16. The following single characters shall be recognized
as tokens whose names are the character:</p>

<p>&lt;newline&gt; ( ) , + - ; [ ] ^ { }</p>

<p>17. The token EOF is returned when the end of input is
reached.</p>

<p>Operations in bc There are three kinds of identifiers:
ordinary identifiers, array iden- tifiers, and function
identifiers. All three types consist of single lowercase
letters. Array identifiers shall be followed by square
brack- ets ( &quot;[]&quot; ). An array subscript is
required except in an argument or auto list. Arrays are
singly dimensioned and can contain up to {BC_DIM_MAX}
elements. Indexing shall begin at zero so an array is
indexed from 0 to {BC_DIM_MAX}-1. Subscripts shall be
truncated to integers. The application shall ensure that
function identifiers are followed by parentheses, possibly
enclosing arguments. The three types of identifiers do not
conflict.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the rules for precedence
and associativ- ity of all operators. Operators on the same
line shall have the same precedence; rows are in order of
decreasing precedence.</p>

<p>Table: Operators in bc</p>

<p>Operator Associativity ++, -- N/A unary - N/A ^ Right to
left *, /, % Left to right +, binary - Left to right =, +=,
-=, *=, /=, %=, ^= Right to left ==, &lt;=, &gt;=, !=, &lt;,
&gt; None</p>

<p>Each expression or named expression has a scale, which
is the number of decimal digits that shall be maintained as
the fractional portion of the expression.</p>

<p>Named expressions are places where values are stored.
Named expressions shall be valid on the left side of an
assignment. The value of a named expression shall be the
value stored in the place named. Simple identi- fiers and
array elements are named expressions; they have an initial
value of zero and an initial scale of zero.</p>

<p>The internal registers scale, ibase, and obase are all
named expres- sions. The scale of an expression consisting
of the name of one of these registers shall be zero; values
assigned to any of these regis- ters are truncated to
integers. The scale register shall contain a global value
used in computing the scale of expressions (as described
below). The value of the register scale is limited to 0
&lt;= scale &lt;= {BC_SCALE_MAX} and shall have a default
value of zero. The ibase and obase registers are the input
and output number radix, respectively. The value of ibase
shall be limited to:</p>

<p>2 &lt;= ibase &lt;= 16</p>

<p>The value of obase shall be limited to:</p>

<p>2 &lt;= obase &lt;= {BC_BASE_MAX}</p>

<p>When either ibase or obase is assigned a single digit
value from the list in Lexical Conventions in bc, the value
shall be assumed in hex- adecimal. (For example, ibase=A
sets to base ten, regardless of the current ibase value.)
Otherwise, the behavior is undefined when digits greater
than or equal to the value of ibase appear in the input.
Both ibase and obase shall have initial values of 10.</p>

<p>Internal computations shall be conducted as if in
decimal, regardless of the input and output bases, to the
specified number of decimal dig- its. When an exact result
is not achieved (for example, scale=0; 3.2/1), the result
shall be truncated.</p>

<p>For all values of obase specified by this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, bc shall output numeric values by
performing each of the following steps in order:</p>

<p>1. If the value is less than zero, a hyphen (-)
character shall be output.</p>

<p>2. One of the following is output, depending on the
numerical value:</p>

<p>* If the absolute value of the numerical value is
greater than or equal to one, the integer portion of the
value shall be output as a series of digits appropriate to
obase (as described below), most significant digit first.
The most significant non-zero digit shall be output next,
followed by each successively less significant digit.</p>

<p>* If the absolute value of the numerical value is less
than one but greater than zero and the scale of the
numerical value is greater than zero, it is unspecified
whether the character 0 is output.</p>

<p>* If the numerical value is zero, the character 0 shall
be output.</p>

<p>3. If the scale of the value is greater than zero and
the numeric value is not zero, a period character shall be
output, followed by a series of digits appropriate to obase
(as described below) repre- senting the most significant
portion of the fractional part of the value. If s represents
the scale of the value being output, the number of digits
output shall be s if obase is 10, less than or equal to s if
obase is greater than 10, or greater than or equal to s if
obase is less than 10. For obase values other than 10, this
should be the number of digits needed to represent a
precision of 10**s.</p>

<p>For obase values from 2 to 16, valid digits are the
first obase of the single characters:</p>

<p>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F</p>

<p>which represent the values zero to 15, inclusive,
respectively.</p>

<p>For bases greater than 16, each digit shall be written
as a separate multi-digit decimal number. Each digit except
the most significant fractional digit shall be preceded by a
single &lt;space&gt;. For bases from 17 to 100, bc shall
write two-digit decimal numbers; for bases from 101 to 1000,
three-digit decimal strings, and so on. For example, the
deci- mal number 1024 in base 25 would be written as:</p>

<p>01 15 24</p>

<p>and in base 125, as:</p>

<p>008 024</p>

<p>Very large numbers shall be split across lines with 70
characters per line in the POSIX locale; other locales may
split at different charac- ter boundaries. Lines that are
continued shall end with a backslash ( ).</p>

<p>A function call shall consist of a function name
followed by parenthe- ses containing a comma-separated list
of expressions, which are the function arguments. A whole
array passed as an argument shall be speci- fied by the
array name followed by empty square brackets. All function
arguments shall be passed by value. As a result, changes
made to the formal parameters shall have no effect on the
actual arguments. If the function terminates by executing a
return statement, the value of the function shall be the
value of the expression in the parentheses of the return
statement or shall be zero if no expression is provided or
if there is no return statement.</p>

<p>The result of sqrt( expression) shall be the square root
of the expres- sion. The result shall be truncated in the
least significant decimal place. The scale of the result
shall be the scale of the expression or the value of scale,
whichever is larger.</p>

<p>The result of length( expression) shall be the total
number of signifi- cant decimal digits in the expression.
The scale of the result shall be zero.</p>

<p>The result of scale( expression) shall be the scale of
the expression. The scale of the result shall be zero.</p>

<p>A numeric constant shall be an expression. The scale
shall be the num- ber of digits that follow the radix point
in the input representing the constant, or zero if no radix
point appears.</p>

<p>The sequence ( expression ) shall be an expression with
the same value and scale as expression. The parentheses can
be used to alter the nor- mal precedence.</p>

<p>The semantics of the unary and binary operators are as
follows:</p>

<p>-expression</p>

<p>The result shall be the negative of the expression. The
scale of the result shall be the scale of expression.</p>

<p>The unary increment and decrement operators shall not
modify the scale of the named expression upon which they
operate. The scale of the result shall be the scale of that
named expression.</p>

<p>++named-expression</p>

<p>The named expression shall be incremented by one. The
result shall be the value of the named expression after
incrementing.</p>

<p>--named-expression</p>

<p>The named expression shall be decremented by one. The
result shall be the value of the named expression after
decrementing.</p>

<p>named-expression++</p>

<p>The named expression shall be incremented by one. The
result shall be the value of the named expression before
incrementing.</p>

<p>named-expression--</p>

<p>The named expression shall be decremented by one. The
result shall be the value of the named expression before
decrementing.</p>

<p>The exponentiation operator, circumflex (^), shall bind
right to left.</p>

<p>expression^expression</p>

<p>The result shall be the first expression raised to the
power of the second expression. If the second expression is
not an inte- ger, the behavior is undefined. If a is the
scale of the left expression and b is the absolute value of
the right expression, the scale of the result shall be:</p>

<p>if b &gt;= 0 min(a * b, max(scale, a)) if b &lt; 0
scale</p>

<p>The multiplicative operators (,, % ) shall bind left to
right.</p>

<p>expression*expression</p>

<p>The result shall be the product of the two expressions.
If a and b are the scales of the two expressions, then the
scale of the result shall be:</p>

<p>min(a+b,max(scale,a,b))</p>

<p>expression/expression</p>

<p>The result shall be the quotient of the two expressions.
The scale of the result shall be the value of scale.</p>

<p>expression%expression</p>

<p>For expressions a and b, a% b shall be evaluated
equivalent to the steps:</p>

<p>1. Compute a/ b to current scale.</p>

<p>2. Use the result to compute:</p>

<p>a - (a / b) * b</p>

<p>to scale:</p>

<p>max(scale + scale(b), scale(a))</p>

<p>The scale of the result shall be:</p>

<p>max(scale + scale(b), scale(a))</p>

<p>When scale is zero, the %operator is the mathematical
remainder operator.</p>

<p>The additive operators (,-) shall bind left to
right.</p>

<p>expression+expression</p>

<p>The result shall be the sum of the two expressions. The
scale of the result shall be the maximum of the scales of
the expres- sions.</p>

<p>expression-expression</p>

<p>The result shall be the difference of the two
expressions. The scale of the result shall be the maximum of
the scales of the expressions.</p>

<p>The assignment operators (, &quot;+=&quot;,
&quot;-=&quot;, &quot;*=&quot;, &quot;/=&quot;,
&quot;%=&quot;, &quot;^=&quot; ) shall bind right to
left.</p>

<p>named-expression=expression</p>

<p>This expression shall result in assigning the value of
the expression on the right to the named expression on the
left. The scale of both the named expression and the result
shall be the scale of expression.</p>

<p>The compound assignment forms:</p>

<p>named-expression &lt;operator&gt;= expression</p>

<p>shall be equivalent to:</p>

<p>named-expression=named-expression &lt;operator&gt;
expression</p>

<p>except that the named-expression shall be evaluated only
once.</p>

<p>Unlike all other operators, the relational operators (,,
&quot;&lt;=&quot;, &quot;&gt;=&quot;, &quot;==&quot;,
&quot;!=&quot; ) shall be only valid as the object of an if,
while, or inside a for statement.</p>

<p>expression1&lt;expression2</p>

<p>The relation shall be true if the value of expression1
is strictly less than the value of expression2.</p>

<p>expression1&gt;expression2</p>

<p>The relation shall be true if the value of expression1
is strictly greater than the value of expression2.</p>

<p>expression1&lt;=expression2</p>

<p>The relation shall be true if the value of expression1
is less than or equal to the value of expression2.</p>

<p>expression1&gt;=expression2</p>

<p>The relation shall be true if the value of expression1
is greater than or equal to the value of expression2.</p>

<p>expression1==expression2</p>

<p>The relation shall be true if the values of expression1
and expression2 are equal.</p>

<p>expression1!=expression2</p>

<p>The relation shall be true if the values of expression1
and expression2 are unequal.</p>

<p>There are only two storage classes in bc: global and
automatic (local). Only identifiers that are local to a
function need be declared with the auto command. The
arguments to a function shall be local to the func- tion.
All other identifiers are assumed to be global and available
to all functions. All identifiers, global and local, have
initial values of zero. Identifiers declared as auto shall
be allocated on entry to the function and released on
returning from the function. They therefore do not retain
values between function calls. Auto arrays shall be
specified by the array name followed by empty square
brackets. On entry to a function, the old values of the
names that appear as parameters and as automatic variables
shall be pushed onto a stack. Until the function returns,
reference to these names shall refer only to the new
values.</p>

<p>References to any of these names from other functions
that are called from this function also refer to the new
value until one of those func- tions uses the same name for
a local variable.</p>

<p>When a statement is an expression, unless the main
operator is an assignment, execution of the statement shall
write the value of the expression followed by a
&lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>When a statement is a string, execution of the statement
shall write the value of the string.</p>

<p>Statements separated by semicolons or &lt;newline&gt;s
shall be executed sequentially. In an interactive invocation
of bc, each time a &lt;newline&gt; is read that satisfies
the grammatical production:</p>

<p>input_item : semicolon_list NEWLINE</p>

<p>the sequential list of statements making up the
semicolon_list shall be executed immediately and any output
produced by that execution shall be written without any
delay due to buffering.</p>

<p>In an if statement ( if( relation) statement), the
statement shall be executed if the relation is true.</p>

<p>The while statement ( while( relation) statement)
implements a loop in which the relation is tested; each time
the relation is true, the statement shall be executed and
the relation retested. When the rela- tion is false,
execution shall resume after statement.</p>

<p>A for statement( for( expression; relation; expression)
statement) shall be the same as:</p>

<p>first-expressionwhile (relation) { statement
last-expression} The application shall ensure that all three
expressions are present.</p>

<p>The break statement shall cause termination of a for or
while state- ment.</p>

<p>The auto statement ( auto identifier [, identifier ]
...) shall cause the values of the identifiers to be pushed
down. The identifiers can be ordinary identifiers or array
identifiers. Array identifiers shall be specified by
following the array name by empty square brackets. The
application shall ensure that the auto statement is the
first statement in a function definition.</p>

<p>A define statement:</p>

<p>define LETTER ( opt_parameter_list ) {
opt_auto_define_list statement_list}</p>

<p>defines a function named LETTER. If a function named
LETTER was previ- ously defined, the define statement shall
replace the previous defini- tion. The expression:</p>

<p>LETTER ( opt_argument_list )</p>

<p>shall invoke the function named LETTER. The behavior is
undefined if the number of arguments in the invocation does
not match the number of parameters in the definition.
Functions shall be defined before they are invoked. A
function shall be considered to be defined within its own
body, so recursive calls are valid. The values of numeric
constants within a function shall be interpreted in the base
specified by the value of the ibase register when the
function is invoked.</p>

<p>The return statements ( return and return( expression))
shall cause termination of a function, popping of its auto
variables, and specifi- cation of the result of the
function. The first form shall be equiva- lent to return(0).
The value and scale of the result returned by the function
shall be the value and scale of the expression returned.</p>

<p>The quit statement ( quit) shall stop execution of a bc
program at the point where the statement occurs in the
input, even if it occurs in a function definition, or in an
if, for, or while statement.</p>

<p>The following functions shall be defined when the -l
option is speci- fied:</p>

<p>s( expression )</p>

<p>Sine of argument in radians.</p>

<p>c( expression )</p>

<p>Cosine of argument in radians.</p>

<p>a( expression )</p>

<p>Arctangent of argument.</p>

<p>l( expression )</p>

<p>Natural logarithm of argument.</p>

<p>e( expression )</p>

<p>Exponential function of argument.</p>

<p>j( expression, expression )</p>

<p>Bessel function of integer order.</p>

<p>The scale of the result returned by these functions
shall be the value of the scale register at the time the
function is invoked. The value of the scale register after
these functions have completed their execution shall be the
same value it had upon invocation. The behavior is unde-
fined if any of these functions is invoked with an argument
outside the domain of the mathematical function.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All input files were processed successfully.</p>

<p>unspecified An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS If any file operand is specified
and the named file cannot be accessed, bc shall write a
diagnostic message to standard error and terminate without
any further action.</p>

<p>In an interactive invocation of bc, the utility should
print an error message and recover following any error in
the input. In a non-interac- tive invocation of bc, invalid
input causes undefined behavior.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Automatic variables in bc do not work
in exactly the same way as in either C or PL/1.</p>

<p>For historical reasons, the exit status from bc cannot
be relied upon to indicate that an error has occurred.
Returning zero after an error is possible. Therefore, bc
should be used primarily by interactive users (who can react
to error messages) or by application programs that can
somehow validate the answers returned as not including error
mes- sages.</p>

<p>The bc utility always uses the period (.) character to
represent a radix point, regardless of any decimal-point
character specified as part of the current locale. In
languages like C or awk, the period character is used in
program source, so it can be portable and unam- biguous,
while the locale-specific character is used in input and
out- put. Because there is no distinction between source and
input in bc, this arrangement would not be possible. Using
the locale-specific char- acter in bcs input would introduce
ambiguities into the language; con- sider the following
example in a locale with a comma as the decimal- point
character:</p>

<p>define f(a,b) { ... } ...</p>

<p>f(1,2,3)</p>

<p>Because of such ambiguities, the period character is
used in input. Having input follow different conventions
from output would be confus- ing in either pipeline usage or
interactive usage, so the period is also used in output.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES In the shell, the following assigns an
approximation of the first ten digits ofpito the variable
x:</p>

<p>x=$(printf &quot;%n&quot;scale = 10; 104348/33215|
bc)</p>

<p>The following bc program prints the same approximation
of p, with a label, to standard output:</p>

<p>scale = 10 &quot;pi equals &quot; 104348 / 33215</p>

<p>The following defines a function to compute an
approximate value of the exponential function (note that
such a function is predefined if the -l option is
specified):</p>

<p>scale = 20 define e(x){ auto a, b, c, i, s a = 1 b = 1 s
= 1 for (i = 1; 1 == 1; i++){ a = a*x b = b*i c = a/b if (c
== 0) { return(s) } s = s+c } }</p>

<p>The following prints approximate values of the
exponential function of the first ten integers:</p>

<p>for (i = 1; i &lt;= 10; ++i) { e(i) }</p>

<p>RATIONALE The bc utility is implemented historically as
a front-end processor for dc; dc was not selected to be part
of this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 because bc was
thought to have a more intuitive programmatic interface.
Current implementations that implement bc using dc are
expected to be compliant.</p>

<p>The exit status for error conditions has been left
unspecified for sev- eral reasons:</p>

<p>* The bc utility is used in both interactive and
non-interactive situ- ations. Different exit codes may be
appropriate for the two uses.</p>

<p>* It is unclear when a non-zero exit should be given;
divide-by-zero, undefined functions, and syntax errors are
all possibilities.</p>

<p>* It is not clear what utility the exit status has.</p>

<p>* In the 4.3 BSD, System V, and Ninth Edition
implementations, bc works in conjunction with dc. The dc
utility is the parent, bc is the child. This was done to
cleanly terminate bc if dc aborted.</p>

<p>The decision to have bc exit upon encountering an
inaccessible input file is based on the belief that bc file1
file2 is used most often when at least file1 contains
data/function declarations/initializations. Having bc
continue with prerequisite files missing is probably not
use- ful. There is no implication in the CONSEQUENCES OF
ERRORS section that bc must check all its files for
accessibility before opening any of them.</p>

<p>There was considerable debate on the appropriateness of
the language accepted by bc. Several reviewers preferred to
see either a pure subset of the C language or some changes
to make the language more compatible with C. While the bc
language has some obvious similarities to C, it has never
claimed to be compatible with any version of C. An inter-
preter for a subset of C might be a very worthwhile utility,
and it could potentially make bc obsolete. However, no such
utility is known in historical practice, and it was not
within the scope of this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 to
define such a language and utility. If and when they are
defined, it may be appropriate to include them in a future
version of IEEE Std 1003.1. This left the following
alternatives:</p>

<p>1. Exclude any calculator language from this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>The consensus of the standard developers was that a
simple programmatic calculator language is very useful for
both applications and interac- tive users. The only
arguments for excluding any calculator were that it would
become obsolete if and when a C-compatible one emerged, or
that the absence would encourage the development of such a
C-compatible one. These arguments did not sufficiently
address the needs of current application writers.</p>

<p>2. Standardize the historical dc, possibly with minor
modifications.</p>

<p>The consensus of the standard developers was that dc is
a fundamentally less usable language and that that would be
far too severe a penalty for avoiding the issue of being
similar to but incompatible with C.</p>

<p>3. Standardize the historical bc, possibly with minor
modifications.</p>

<p>This was the approach taken. Most of the proponents of
changing the language would not have been satisfied until
most or all of the incom- patibilities with C were resolved.
Since most of the changes considered most desirable would
break historical applications and require signifi- cant
modification to historical implementations, almost no
modifica- tions were made. The one significant modification
that was made was the replacement of the historical bc
assignment operators &quot;=+&quot;, and so on, with the
more modern &quot;+=&quot;, and so on. The older versions
are considered to be fundamentally flawed because of the
lexical ambiguity in uses like a=-1.</p>

<p>In order to permit implementations to deal with
backwards-compatibility as they see fit, the behavior of
this one ambiguous construct was made undefined. (At least
three implementations have been known to support this change
already, so the degree of change involved should not be
great.)</p>

<p>The % operator is the mathematical remainder operator
when scale is zero. The behavior of this operator for other
values of scale is from historical implementations of bc,
and has been maintained for the sake of historical
applications despite its non-intuitive nature.</p>

<p>Historical implementations permit setting ibase and
obase to a broader range of values. This includes values
less than 2, which were not seen as sufficiently useful to
standardize. These implementations do not interpret input
properly for values of ibase that are greater than 16. This
is because numeric constants are recognized syntactically,
rather than lexically, as described in this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001. They are built from lexical tokens of
single hexadecimal digits and periods. Since &lt;blank&gt;s
between tokens are not visible at the syntactic level, it is
not possible to recognize the multi-digit &quot;digits&quot;
used in the higher bases properly. The ability to recognize
input in these bases was not considered useful enough to
require modifying these implementations. Note that the
recognition of numeric constants at the syntactic level is
not a problem with conformance to this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, as it does not impact the behavior of
conforming applications (and correct bc programs).
Historical implementations also accept input with all of the
digits0-9andA-Fregardless of the value of ibase; since
digits with value greater than or equal to ibase are not
really appropriate, the behavior when they appear is
undefined, except for the common case of:</p>

<p>ibase=8; /* Process in octal base. */ ... ibase=A /*
Restore decimal base. */</p>

<p>In some historical implementations, if the expression to
be written is an uninitialized array element, a leading
&lt;space&gt; and/or up to four leading 0 characters may be
output before the character zero. This behavior is
considered a bug; it is unlikely that any currently con-
forming application relies on:</p>

<p>echob[3]| bc</p>

<p>returning 00000 rather than 0.</p>

<p>Exact calculation of the number of fractional digits to
output for a given value in a base other than 10 can be
computationally expensive. Historical implementations use a
faster approximation, and this is per- mitted. Note that the
requirements apply only to values of obase that this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires implementations to support
(in particular, not to 1, 0, or negative bases, if an
implementation supports them as an extension).</p>

<p>Historical implementations of bc did not allow array
parameters to be passed as the last parameter to a function.
New implementations are encouraged to remove this
restriction even though it is not required by the
grammar.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
