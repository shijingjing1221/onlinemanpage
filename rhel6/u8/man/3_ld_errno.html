<p>LDAP_ERROR(3) LDAP_ERROR(3)</p>

<p>NAME ldap_perror, ld_errno, ldap_result2error,
ldap_errlist, ldap_err2string - LDAP protocol error handling
routines</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ldap.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *ldap_err2string( int err );</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ldap_err2string() routine provides short
description of the various codes returned by routines in
this library. The returned string is a pointer to a static
area that should not be modified.</p>

<p>These codes are either negative, indicating an API error
code; posi- tive, indicating an LDAP resultCode other than
&acute;success (0), or - zero, indicating both successful
use of the API and the LDAP resultCode &acute;success
(0).</p>

<p>The code associated with an LDAP session is accessible
using ldap_get_option(3) and ldap_set_option(3) with the
LDAP_OPT_RESULT_CODE option (previously called
LDAP_OPT_ERROR_NUMBER).</p>

<p>PROTOCOL RESULT CODES This section provides a partial
list of protocol codes recognized by the library. As LDAP is
extensible, additional values may be returned. A complete
listing of registered LDAP result codes can be obtained from
the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
&lt;http://www.iana.org&gt;.</p>

<p>LDAP_SUCCESS The request was successful.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPERATIONS_ERROR An operations error occurred.</p>

<p>LDAP_PROTOCOL_ERROR A protocol violation was
detected.</p>

<p>LDAP_TIMELIMIT_EXCEEDED An LDAP time limit was
exceeded.</p>

<p>LDAP_SIZELIMIT_EXCEEDED An LDAP size limit was
exceeded.</p>

<p>LDAP_COMPARE_FALSE A compare operation returned
false.</p>

<p>LDAP_COMPARE_TRUE A compare operation returned true.</p>

<p>LDAP_STRONG_AUTH_NOT_SUPPORTED The LDAP server does not
support strong authentica- tion.</p>

<p>LDAP_STRONG_AUTH_REQUIRED Strong authentication is
required for the opera- tion.</p>

<p>LDAP_PARTIAL_RESULTS Partial results only returned.</p>

<p>LDAP_NO_SUCH_ATTRIBUTE The attribute type specified does
not exist in the entry.</p>

<p>LDAP_UNDEFINED_TYPE The attribute type specified is
invalid.</p>

<p>LDAP_INAPPROPRIATE_MATCHING Filter type not supported
for the specified attribute.</p>

<p>LDAP_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION An attribute value specified
violates some con- straint (e.g., a postalAddress has too
many lines, or a line that is too long).</p>

<p>LDAP_TYPE_OR_VALUE_EXISTS An attribute type or attribute
value specified already exists in the entry.</p>

<p>LDAP_INVALID_SYNTAX An invalid attribute value was
specified.</p>

<p>LDAP_NO_SUCH_OBJECT The specified object does not exist
in The Direc- tory.</p>

<p>LDAP_ALIAS_PROBLEM An alias in The Directory points to a
nonexistent entry.</p>

<p>LDAP_INVALID_DN_SYNTAX A syntactically invalid DN was
specified.</p>

<p>LDAP_IS_LEAF The object specified is a leaf.</p>

<p>LDAP_ALIAS_DEREF_PROBLEM A problem was encountered when
dereferencing an alias.</p>

<p>LDAP_INAPPROPRIATE_AUTH Inappropriate authentication was
specified (e.g., LDAP_AUTH_SIMPLE was specified and the
entry does not have a userPassword attribute).</p>

<p>LDAP_INVALID_CREDENTIALS Invalid credentials were
presented (e.g., the wrong password).</p>

<p>LDAP_INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS The user has insufficient
access to perform the operation.</p>

<p>LDAP_BUSY The DSA is busy.</p>

<p>LDAP_UNAVAILABLE The DSA is unavailable.</p>

<p>LDAP_UNWILLING_TO_PERFORM The DSA is unwilling to
perform the operation.</p>

<p>LDAP_LOOP_DETECT A loop was detected.</p>

<p>LDAP_NAMING_VIOLATION A naming violation occurred.</p>

<p>LDAP_OBJECT_CLASS_VIOLATION An object class violation
occurred (e.g., a &quot;must&quot; attribute was missing
from the entry).</p>

<p>LDAP_NOT_ALLOWED_ON_NONLEAF The operation is not allowed
on a nonleaf object.</p>

<p>LDAP_NOT_ALLOWED_ON_RDN The operation is not allowed on
an RDN.</p>

<p>LDAP_ALREADY_EXISTS The entry already exists.</p>

<p>LDAP_NO_OBJECT_CLASS_MODS Object class modifications are
not allowed.</p>

<p>LDAP_OTHER An unknown error occurred.</p>

<p>API ERROR CODES This section provides a complete list of
API error codes recognized by the library. Note that
LDAP_SUCCESS indicates success of an API call in addition to
representing the return of the LDAP &acute;success result-
Code.</p>

<p>LDAP_SERVER_DOWN The LDAP library cant contact the LDAP
server.</p>

<p>LDAP_LOCAL_ERROR Some local error occurred. This is
usually a failed dynamic memory allocation.</p>

<p>LDAP_ENCODING_ERROR An error was encountered encoding
parameters to send to the LDAP server.</p>

<p>LDAP_DECODING_ERROR An error was encountered decoding a
result from the LDAP server.</p>

<p>LDAP_TIMEOUT A timelimit was exceeded while waiting for
a result.</p>

<p>LDAP_AUTH_UNKNOWN The authentication method specified to
ldap_bind() is not known.</p>

<p>LDAP_FILTER_ERROR An invalid filter was supplied to
ldap_search() (e.g., unbalanced parentheses).</p>

<p>LDAP_PARAM_ERROR An ldap routine was called with a bad
parameter.</p>

<p>LDAP_NO_MEMORY An memory allocation (e.g., malloc(3) or
other dynamic memory allocator) call failed in an ldap
library routine.</p>

<p>LDAP_USER_CANCELED Indicates the user cancelled the
operation.</p>

<p>LDAP_CONNECT_ERROR Indicates a connection problem.</p>

<p>LDAP_NOT_SUPPORTED Indicates the routine was called in a
manner not supported by the library.</p>

<p>LDAP_CONTROL_NOT_FOUND Indicates the control provided is
unknown to the client library.</p>

<p>LDAP_NO_RESULTS_RETURNED Indicates no results
returned.</p>

<p>LDAP_MORE_RESULTS_TO_RETURN Indicates more results could
be returned.</p>

<p>LDAP_CLIENT_LOOP Indicates the library has detected a
loop in its processing.</p>

<p>LDAP_REFERRAL_LIMIT_EXCEEDED Indicates the referral
limit has been exceeded.</p>

<p>DEPRECATED Deprecated interfaces generally remain in the
library. The macro LDAP_DEPRECATED can be defined to a
non-zero value (e.g., -DLDAP_DEPRE- CATED=1) when compiling
program designed to use deprecated interfaces. It is
recommended that developers writing new programs, or
updating old programs, avoid use of deprecated interfaces.
Over time, it is expected that documentation (and,
eventually, support) for deprecated interfaces to be
eliminated.</p>
