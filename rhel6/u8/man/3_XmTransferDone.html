call)</p>

<p>NAME XmTransferDone A toolkit function that completes a
data transfer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt;</p>

<p>void XmTransferDone( XtPointer transfer_id,
XmTransferStatus status);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmTransferDone completes an
already-initiated data transfer operation. An application
can call this routine from an XmNdestinationCallback
procedure or any function called as a result, including the
selection procedures called as a result of calls to
XmTransferValue.</p>

<p>The caller of XmTransferDone supplies an identifier for
the transfer operation and an indication of the completion
status. XmTransferDone causes any remaining transfers for
the operation to be discarded.</p>

<p>transfer_id Specifies a unique indentifier for the data
transfer opera- tion. The value must be the same as the
value of the trans- fer_id member of the
XmDestinationCallbackStruct passed to the
XmNdestinationCallback procedure.</p>

<p>status Specifies the completion status of the data
transfer. Fol- lowing are the possible values:</p>

<p>XmTRANSFER_DONE_SUCCEED The transfer was completed
successfully. This sta- tus has the following additional
effects:</p>

<p>&middot; For a move operation, the selection owner
receives a request to convert the selection to the DELETE
target.</p>

<p>&middot; If a TRANSACT operation is in progress, the
owner receives a request to commit the trans- action.</p>

<p>&middot; If a PERSIST or _MOTIF_SNAPSHOT operation is in
progress, the owner receives a notifica- tion that the
operation is finished.</p>

<p>&middot; The widget class destination procedure is not
called.</p>

<p>XmTRANSFER_DONE_FAIL The transfer was completed
unsuccessfully. This status has the following additional
effects:</p>

<p>&middot; For a move operation, the selection owner does
not receive a request to convert the selection to the DELETE
target.</p>

<p>&middot; For a drag and drop operation, the DropTrans-
fers XmNtransferStatus is set to XmTRANS- FER_FAILURE.</p>

<p>&middot; If a TRANSACT operation is in progress, the
owner receives a request to abort the transaction.</p>

<p>&middot; If a PERSIST or _MOTIF_SNAPSHOT operation is in
progress, the owner receives a notifica- tion that the
operation is finished.</p>

<p>&middot; The widget class destination procedure is not
called.</p>

<p>XmTRANSFER_DONE_CONTINUE This status has the same effect
as XmTRANS- FER_DONE_SUCCEED, except that if a PERSIST or
_MOTIF_SNAPSHOT operation is in progress, the owner does not
receive a notification that the operation is finished.</p>

<p>XmTRANSFER_DONE_DEFAULT The widget class destination
procedure is called. Further effects depend on the actions
of that pro- cedure.</p>

<p>RELATED XmTransferSendRequest(3),
XmTransferStartRequest(3), XmTransferStartRe- quest(3), and
XmTransferValue(3).</p>
