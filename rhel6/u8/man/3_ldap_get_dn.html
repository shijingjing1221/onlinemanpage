<p>DESCRIPTION These routines allow LDAP entry names
(Distinguished Names, or DNs) to be obtained, parsed,
converted to a user-friendly form, and tested. A DN has the
form described in RFC 4414 &quot;Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP): String Representation of
Distinguished Names&quot;.</p>

<p>The ldap_get_dn() routine takes an entry as returned by
ldap_first_entry(3) or ldap_next_entry(3) and returns a copy
of the entry s DN. Space for the DN will be obtained
dynamically and should be freed by the caller using
ldap_memfree(3).</p>

<p>ldap_str2dn() parses a string representation of a
distinguished name contained in str into its components,
which are stored in dn as ldap_ava structures, arranged in
LDAPAVA, LDAPRDN, and LDAPDN terms. Space for dn will be
obtained dynamically and should be freed by the caller using
ldap_dnfree(3). The LDAPDN is defined as:</p>

<p>typedef struct ldap_ava { struct berval la_attr; struct
berval la_value; unsigned la_flags; } LDAPAVA;</p>

<p>typedef LDAPAVA** LDAPRDN; typedef LDAPRDN* LDAPDN;</p>

<p>The attribute types and the attribute values are not
normalized. The la_flags can be either LDAP_AVA_STRING or
LDAP_AVA_BINARY, the latter meaning that the value is
BER/DER encoded and thus must be represented as, quoting
from RFC 4514, &quot; ... an octothorpe character ( # ASCII
35) followed by the hexadecimal representation of each of
the bytes of the BER encoding of the X.500
AttributeValue.&quot; The flags parameter to ldap_str2dn()
can be</p>

<p>LDAP_DN_FORMAT_LDAPV3 LDAP_DN_FORMAT_LDAPV2
LDAP_DN_FORMAT_DCE</p>

<p>which defines what DN syntax is expected (according to
RFC 4514, RFC 1779 and DCE, respectively). The format can be
ORed to the flags</p>

<p>LDAP_DN_P_NO_SPACES LDAP_DN_P_NO_SPACE_AFTER_RDN ...
LDAP_DN_PEDANTIC</p>

<p>The latter is a shortcut for all the previous
limitations.</p>

<p>LDAP_DN_P_NO_SPACES does not allow extra spaces in the
dn; the default is to silently eliminate spaces around AVA
separators (=), RDN compo- nent separators (+ for
LDAPv3/LDAPv2 or , for DCE) and RDN separa- tors (,
LDAPv3/LDAPv2 or / for DCE).</p>

<p>LDAP_DN_P_NO_SPACE_AFTER_RDN does not allow a single
space after RDN separators.</p>

<p>ldap_dn2str() performs the inverse operation, yielding
in str a string representation of dn. It allows the same
values for flags as ldap_str2dn(), plus</p>

<p>LDAP_DN_FORMAT_UFN LDAP_DN_FORMAT_AD_CANONICAL</p>

<p>for user-friendly naming (RFC 1781) and AD
canonical.</p>

<p>The following routines are viewed as deprecated in favor
of ldap_str2dn() and ldap_dn2str(). They are provided to
support legacy applications.</p>

<p>The ldap_explode_dn() routine takes a DN as returned by
ldap_get_dn() and breaks it up into its component parts.
Each part is known as a Relative Distinguished Name, or RDN.
ldap_explode_dn() returns a NULL- terminated array, each
component of which contains an RDN from the DN. The notypes
parameter is used to request that only the RDN values be
returned, not their types. For example, the DN &quot;cn=Bob,
c=US&quot; would return as either { &quot;cn=Bob&quot;,
&quot;c=US&quot;, NULL } or { &quot;Bob&quot;,
&quot;US&quot;, NULL }, depending on whether notypes was 0
or 1, respectively. Assertion val- ues in RDN strings may
included escaped characters. The result can be freed by
calling ldap_value_free(3).</p>

<p>Similarly, the ldap_explode_rdn() routine takes an RDN
as returned by ldap_explode_dn(dn,0) and breaks it up into
its &quot;type=value&quot; component parts (or just
&quot;value&quot;, if the notypes parameter is set). Note
the value is not unescaped. The result can be freed by
calling ldap_value_free(3).</p>

<p>ldap_dn2ufn() is used to turn a DN as returned by
ldap_get_dn(3) into a more user-friendly form, stripping off
all type names. See &quot;Using the Directory to Achieve
User Friendly Naming&quot; (RFC 1781) for more details on
the UFN format. Due to the ambiguous nature of the format,
it is generally only used for display purposes. The space
for the UFN returned is obtained dynamically and the user is
responsible for free- ing it via a call to
ldap_memfree(3).</p>

<p>ldap_dn2dcedn() is used to turn a DN as returned by
ldap_get_dn(3) into a DCE-style DN, e.g. a string with
most-significant to least signifi- cant rdns separated by
slashes (/); rdn components are separated by commas (,).
Only printable chars (e.g. LDAPv2 printable string) are
allowed, at least in this implementation. ldap_dcedn2dn()
performs the opposite operation. ldap_dn2ad_canonical()
turns a DN into a AD canon- ical name, which is basically a
DCE dn with attribute types omitted. The trailing domain, if
present, is turned in a DNS-like domain. The space for the
returned value is obtained dynamically and the user is
responsible for freeing it via a call to
ldap_memfree(3).</p>

<p>ERRORS If an error occurs in ldap_get_dn(), NULL is
returned and the ld_errno field in the ld parameter is set
to indicate the error. See ldap_error(3) for a description
of possible error codes. ldap_explode_dn(),
ldap_explode_rdn(), ldap_dn2ufn(), ldap_dn2dcedn(),
ldap_dcedn2dn(), and ldap_dn2ad_canonical() will return NULL
with errno(3) set appropriately in case of trouble.</p>

<p>NOTES These routines dynamically allocate memory that
the caller must free.</p>
