<p>NAME cupstestppd - test conformance of ppd files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cupstestppd [ -R rootdir ] [ -W category ] [ -q
] [-r] [ -v[v] ] file- name.ppd[.gz] [ ...
filenameN.ppd[.gz] ] cupstestppd [ -R rootdir ] [ -W
category ] [ -q ] [-r] [ -v[v] ] -</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cupstestppd tests the conformance of PPD
files to the Adobe PostScript Printer Description file
format specification version 4.3. It can also be used to
list the supported options and available fonts in a PPD
file. The results of testing and any other output are sent
to the stan- dard output.</p>

<p>The first form of cupstestppd tests one or more PPD
files on the com- mand-line. The second form tests the PPD
file provided on the standard input.</p>

<p>OPTIONS cupstestppd supports the following options:</p>

<p>-R rootdir Specifies an alternate root directory for the
filter, pre-filter, and other support file checks.</p>

<p>-W constraints Report all UIConstraint errors as
warnings.</p>

<p>-W defaults Except for size-related options, report all
default option errors as warnings.</p>

<p>-W filters Report all filter errors as warnings.</p>

<p>-W profiles Report all profile errors as warnings.</p>

<p>-W sizes Report all media size errors as warnings.</p>

<p>-W translations Report all translation errors as
warnings.</p>

<p>-W all Report all of the previous errors as
warnings.</p>

<p>-W none Report all of the previous errors as errors.</p>

<p>-q Specifies that no information should be
displayed.</p>

<p>-r Relaxes the PPD conformance requirements so that
common whites- pace, control character, and formatting
problems are not treated as hard errors.</p>

<p>-v Specifies that detailed conformance testing results
should be dis- played rather than the concise
PASS/FAIL/ERROR status.</p>

<p>-vv Specifies that all information in the PPD file
should be displayed in addition to the detailed conformance
testing results.</p>

<p>The -q, -v, and -vv options are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS cupstestppd returns zero on success and
non-zero on error. The error codes are as follows:</p>

<p>1 Bad command-line arguments or missing PPD
filename.</p>

<p>2 Unable to open or read PPD file.</p>

<p>3 The PPD file contains format errors that cannot be
skipped.</p>

<p>4 The PPD file does not conform to the Adobe PPD
specification.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following command will test all PPD files
under the current direc- tory and print the names of each
file that does not conform:</p>

<p>find . -name ppd -exec cupstestppd -q {} ; -print</p>

<p>The next command tests all PPD files under the current
directory and print detailed conformance testing results for
the files that do not conform:</p>

<p>find . -name ppd -exec cupstestppd -q {} ; -exec
cupstestppd -v {} ;</p>
