<p>NAME xinput - utility to configure and test X input
devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xinput [OPTIONS] [DEVICE]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xinput is a utility to list available input
devices, query information about a device and change input
device settings.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --version Test if the X Input extension is
available and return the ver- sion number of the program and
the version supported by the server. This option does not
require a device name.</p>

<p>--list [--short || --long || --name-only || --id-only]
[device] If no argument is given list all the input devices.
If an argu- ment is given, show all the features of device.
If --long is provided, the output includes detailed
information about the capabilities of each devices.
Otherwise, or if --short is pro- vided, only the device
names and some minimal information is listed. If --name-only
is provided, the output is limited to the device names. One
device name is listed per line. Note that the order the
devices are listed is undefined. If --id-only is provided,
the output is limited to the device IDs. One device ID is
listed per line. Note that the order the devices are listed
is undefined.</p>

<p>--get-feedbacks device Display the feedbacks of
device.</p>

<p>--set-pointer device Switch device in core pointer. This
option does nothing on X servers 1.5 and later.</p>

<p>--set-mode device ABSOLUTE|RELATIVE Change the mode of
device.</p>

<p>--set-ptr-feedback device threshold num denom Change the
pointer acceleration (or feedback) parameters of device. The
xset(1) man page has more details. For X.Org Server 1.7 and
above, there are additional device properties pertaining to
pointer acceleration. These do not replace, but complement
the pointer feedback setting.</p>

<p>--set-integer-feedback device index value Change the
value of an integer feedback of device.</p>

<p>--set-button-map device map_button_1 [map_button_2
[...]] Change the button mapping of device. The buttons are
specified in physical order (starting with button 1) and are
mapped to the logical button provided. 0 disables a button.
The default button mapping for a device is 1 2 3 4 5 6
etc.</p>

<p>--query-state device Query the device state.</p>

<p>--list-props device [device [...]] Lists properties that
can be set for the given device(s).</p>

<p>--set-int-prop device property format value Sets an
integer property for the device. Appropriate values for
format are 8, 16, or 32, depending on the property. Depre-
cated, use --set-prop instead.</p>

<p>--set-float-prop device property value Sets a float
property for the device. Deprecated, use --set- prop
instead.</p>

<p>--set-prop [--type=atom|float|int] [--format=8|16|32]
device property value [...] Set the property to the given
value(s). If not specified, the format and type of the
property are left as-is. The arguments are interpreted
according to the property type.</p>

<p>--watch-props device Prints to standard out when
property changes occur.</p>

<p>--delete-prop device property Delete the property from
the device.</p>

<p>--test [-proximity] device Register all extended events
from device and enter an endless loop displaying events
received. If the -proximity is given, ProximityIn and
ProximityOut are registered.</p>

<p>--test-xi2 [--root] [device] Register for a number of
XI2 events and display them. If a device is given, only
events on this device are displayed. If --root is given,
events are selected on the root window only. Otherwise, a
new client window is created (similar to xev).</p>

<p>--create-master prefix [sendCore] [enable] Create a new
pair of master devices on an XI2-enabled server with the
given prefix. The server will create one master pointer
named &quot;prefix pointer&quot; and one master keyboard
named &quot;prefix keyboard&quot;. If sendCore is 1, this
pair of master devices is set to send core events (default).
If enable is 1, this master device pair will be enabled
immediately (default).</p>

<p>--remove-master master [Floating|AttachToMaster]
[returnPointer] [returnKeyboard] Remove master and its
paired master device. Attached slave devices are set
floating if Floating is specified or the argu- ment is
omitted. If the second argument is AttachToMaster,
returnPointer specifies the master pointer to attach all
slave pointers to and returnKeyboard specifies the master
keyboard to attach all slave keyboards to.</p>

<p>--reattach slave master Reattach slave to master.</p>

<p>--float slave Remove slave from its current master
device.</p>

<p>--set-cp window master Set the ClientPointer for the
client owning window to master. master must specify a master
pointer.</p>

<p>--map-to-output device crtc Restricts the movements of
the absolute device to the RandR crtc. The output name must
match a currently connected output (see xrandr(1)). If the
NVIDIA binary driver is detected or RandR 1.2 or later is
not available, a Xinerama output may be specified as
&quot;HEAD-N&quot;, with N being the Xinerama screen number.
This option has no effect on relative devices.</p>

<p>--enable device Enable the device. This call is
equivalent to xinput --set-prop device &quot;Device
Enabled&quot; 1</p>

<p>--disable device Disable the device. This call is
equivalent to xinput --set- prop device &quot;Device
Enabled&quot; 0</p>

<p>device can be the device name as a string or the XID of
the device.</p>

<p>slave can be the device name as a string or the XID of a
slave device.</p>

<p>master can be the device name as a string or the XID of
a master device.</p>

<p>property can be the property as a string or the Atom
value.</p>
