<p>NAME ed, red - text editor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ed [-GVhs] [-p string] [file]</p>

<p>red [-GVhs] [-p string] [file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ed is a line-oriented text editor. It is
used to create, display, mod- ify and otherwise manipulate
text files. red is a restricted ed: it can only edit files
in the current directory and cannot execute shell
commands.</p>

<p>If invoked with a file argument, then a copy of file is
read into the editors buffer. Changes are made to this copy
and not directly to file itself. Upon quitting ed, any
changes not explicitly saved with a w_command are lost.</p>

<p>Editing is done in two distinct modes: command and
input. When first invoked, ed is in command mode. In this
mode commands are read from the standard input and executed
to manipulate the contents of the edi- tor buffer. A typical
command might look like:</p>

<p>,s/old/new/g</p>

<p>which replaces all occurrences of the string old with
new.</p>

<p>When an input command, such as a_ (append), i_ (insert)
or c_ (change), is given, ed enters input mode. This is the
primary means of adding text to a file. In this mode, no
commands are available; instead, the standard input is
written directly to the editor buffer. Lines consist of text
up to and including a newline character. Input mode is
terminated by entering a single period (.) on a line.</p>

<p>All ed commands operate on whole lines or ranges of
lines; e.g., the d_command deletes lines; the m_command
moves lines, and so on. It is possible to modify only a
portion of a line by means of replacement, as in the example
above. However even here, the s_command is applied to whole
lines at a time.</p>

<p>In general, ed commands consist of zero or more line
addresses, fol- lowed by a single character command and
possibly additional parameters; i.e., commands have the
structure:</p>

<p>[address [,address]]command[parameters]</p>

<p>The address(es) indicate the line or range of lines to
be affected by the command. If fewer addresses are given
than the command accepts, then default addresses are
supplied.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -G Forces backwards compatibility. Affects the
commands G, V, f, l, m, t, and !!.</p>

<p>-s Suppresses diagnostics. This should be used if eds
standard input is from a script.</p>

<p>-p string Specifies a command prompt. This may be
toggled on and off with the P_command.</p>

<p>file Specifies the name of a file to read. If file is
prefixed with a bang (!), then it is interpreted as a shell
command. In this case, what is read is the standard output
of file executed via sh(1). To read a file whose name begins
with a bang, prefix the name with a backslash (. The default
filename is set to file only if it is not prefixed with a
bang.</p>

<p>LINE ADDRESSING An address represents the number of a
line in the buffer. ed maintains a current address which is
typically supplied to commands as the default address when
none is specified. When a file is first read, the current
address is set to the last line of the file. In general, the
current address is set to the last line affected by a
command.</p>

<p>A line address is constructed from one of the bases in
the list below, optionally followed by a numeric offset. The
offset may include any combination of digits, operators
(i.e. + and -) and whitespace. Addresses are read from left
to right, and their values are computed relative to the
current address.</p>

<p>One exception to the rule that addresses represent line
numbers is the address 0 (zero). This means &quot;before the
first line,&quot; and is legal wherever it makes sense.</p>

<p>An address range is two addresses separated either by a
comma or semi- colon. The value of the first address in a
range cannot exceed the value of the the second. If only one
address is given in a range, then the second address is set
to the given address. If an n-tuple of addresses is given
where n &gt; 2, then the corresponding range is deter- mined
by the last two addresses in the n-tuple. If only one
address is expected, then the last address is used.</p>

<p>Each address in a comma-delimited range is interpreted
relative to the current address. In a semicolon-delimited
range, the first address is used to set the current address,
and the second address is interpreted relative to the
first.</p>

<p>The following address symbols are recognized.</p>

<p>. The current line (address) in the buffer.</p>

<p>$ The last line in the buffer.</p>

<p>n The nth, line in the buffer where n is a number in the
range [0,$].</p>

<p>- The previous line. This is equivalent to -1 and may be
repeated with cumulative effect.</p>

<p>^n The nth previous line, where n is a non-negative
number.</p>

<p>+ The next line. This is equivalent to +1 and may be
repeated with cumulative effect.</p>

<p>whitespace n</p>

<p>+n The nth next line, where n is a non-negative number.
Whites- pace followed by a number n is interpreted as
+n.</p>

<p>, The first through last lines in the buffer. This is
equivalent to the address range 1,$.</p>

<p>; The current through last lines in the buffer. This is
equiva- lent to the address range .,$.</p>

<p>/re/ The next line containing the regular expression re.
The search wraps to the beginning of the buffer and
continues down to the current line, if necessary. // repeats
the last search.</p>

<p>?re? The previous line containing the regular expression
re. The search wraps to the end of the buffer and continues
up to the current line, if necessary. ?? repeats the last
search.</p>

<p>lc The line previously marked by a k_ (mark) command,
where lc is a lower case letter.</p>

<p>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS Regular expressions are patterns
used in selecting text. For example, the ed command</p>

<p>g/string/</p>

<p>prints all lines containing string. Regular expressions
are also used by the _s_ command for selecting old text to
be replaced with new.</p>

<p>In addition to a specifying string literals, regular
expressions can represent classes of strings. Strings thus
represented are said to be matched by the corresponding
regular expression. If it is possible for a regular
expression to match several strings in a line, then the
left- most longest match is the one selected.</p>

<p>The following symbols are used in constructing regular
expressions:</p>

<p>c Any character c not listed below, including {, }, (,
), &lt; and &gt;, matches itself.</p>

<p>c A backslash-escaped character c other than {, }, (, ),
&lt;, &gt;, b, B, w, W, +, and ? matches itself.</p>

<p>. Matches any single character.</p>

<p>[char-class] Matches any single character in char-class.
To include a ] in char-class, it must be the first
character. A range of characters may be specified by
separating the end characters of the range with a -, e.g.,
a-z specifies the lower case characters. The following
literal expressions can also be used in char-class to
specify sets of characters:</p>

<p>[:alnum:] [:cntrl:] [:lower:] [:space:] [:alpha:]
[:digit:] [:print:] [:upper:] [:blank:] [:graph:] [:punct:]
[:xdigit:]</p>

<p>If - appears as the first or last character of
char-class, then it matches itself. All other characters in
char-class match themselves.</p>

<p>Patterns in char-class of the form:</p>

<p>[.col-elm.] or, [=col-elm=]</p>

<p>where col-elm is a collating element are interpreted
according to locale(5) (not currently supported). See
regex(3) for an explanation of these constructs.</p>

<p>[^char-class] Matches any single character, other than
newline, not in char- class. char-class is defined as
above.</p>

<p>^ If ^ is the first character of a regular expression,
then it anchors the regular expression to the beginning of a
line. Otherwise, it matches itself.</p>

<p>$ If $ is the last character of a regular expression, it
anchors the regular expression to the end of a line. Other-
wise, it matches itself.</p>

<p>re Defines a (possibly null) subexpression re.
Subexpressions may be nested. A subsequent backreference of
the form n, where n is a number in the range [1,9], expands
to the text matched by the nth subexpression. For example,
the regular expression &#729;c1 matches the string abcabc,
but not abcadc . Subexpressions are ordered relative to
their left delimiter.</p>

<p>* Matches the single character regular expression or
subexpres- sion immediately preceding it zero or more times.
If * is the first character of a regular expression or
subexpression, then it matches itself. The * operator
sometimes yields unexpected results. For example, the
regular expression b* matches the beginning of the string
abbb , as opposed to the substring bbb, since a null match
is the only left-most match.</p>

<p>n,m n, n Matches the single character regular expression
or subexpres- sion immediately preceding it at least n and
at most m times. If m is omitted, then it matches at least n
times. If the comma is also omitted, then it matches exactly
n times. If any of these forms occurs first in a regular
expression or subexpression, then it is interpreted
literally (i.e., the reg- ular expression 2 matches the
string {2}, and so on).</p>

<p>&lt; &gt; Anchors the single character regular
expression or subexpres- sion immediately following it to
the beginning (&lt;) or ending (&gt;) of a word, i.e., in
ASCII, a maximal string of alphanu- meric characters,
including the underscore (_).</p>

<p>The following extended operators are preceded by a
backslash ( to distinguish them from traditional ed
syntax.</p>

<p>Unconditionally matches the beginning () or ending () of
a line.</p>

<p>subexpression immediately preceding it. For example, the
regu- lar expression a[bd] ac . If or subexpression, then it
matches a literal ?.</p>

<p>+ Matches the single character regular expression or
subexpres- sion immediately preceding it one or more times.
So the regu- lar expression a+ is shorthand for aa* . If +
occurs at the beginning of a regular expression or
subexpression, then it matches a literal +.</p>

<p>Matches the beginning or ending (null string) of a word.
Thus e l the regular expression l o&lt;hello&gt;. However,
whereas &lt;&gt; is not.</p>

<p>0 Matches (a null string) inside a word.</p>

<p>0 Matches any character in a word.</p>

<p>W Matches any character not in a word.</p>

<p>COMMANDS All ed commands are single characters, though
some require additional parameters. If a commands parameters
extend over several lines, then each line except for the
last must be terminated with a backslash (.</p>

<p>In general, at most one command is allowed per line.
However, most commands accept a print suffix, which is any
of p_(print), l_(list) , or n_(enumerate), to print the last
line affected by the command.</p>

<p>An interrupt (typically ^C) has the effect of aborting
the current com- mand and returning the editor to command
mode.</p>

<p>ed recognizes the following commands. The commands are
shown together with the default address or address range
supplied if none is specified (in parenthesis).</p>

<p>(.)a Appends text to the buffer after the addressed
line, which may be the address 0 (zero). Text is entered in
input mode. The current address is set to last line
entered.</p>

<p>(.,.)c Changes lines in the buffer. The addressed lines
are deleted from the buffer, and text is appended in their
place. Text is entered in input mode. The current address is
set to last line entered.</p>

<p>(.,.)d Deletes the addressed lines from the buffer. If
there is a line after the deleted range, then the current
address is set to this line. Otherwise the current address
is set to the line before the deleted range.</p>

<p>e file Edits file, and sets the default filename. If
file is not specified, then the default filename is used.
Any lines in the buffer are deleted before the new file is
read. The cur- rent address is set to the last line
read.</p>

<p>e !command Edits the standard output of _!command_, (see
!command below). The default filename is unchanged. Any
lines in the buffer are deleted before the output of command
is read. The current address is set to the last line
read.</p>

<p>E file Edits file unconditionally. This is similar to
the e command, except that unwritten changes are discarded
without warning. The current address is set to the last line
read.</p>

<p>f file Sets the default filename to file. If file is not
specified, then the default unescaped filename is
printed.</p>

<p>(1,$)g/re/command-list Applies command-list to each of
the addressed lines matching a regular expression re. The
current address is set to the line currently matched before
command-list is executed. At the end of the _g_command, the
current address is set to the last line affected by
command-list.</p>

<p>Each command in command-list must be on a separate line,
and every line except for the last must be terminated by a
back- slash (. Any commands are allowed, except for g, _ G,
v, and _V_. A newline alone in command-list is equivalent to
a p_command.</p>

<p>(1,$)G/re/ Interactively edits the addressed lines
matching a regular expression re. For each matching line,
the line is printed, the current address is set, and the
user is prompted to enter a command-list. At the end of the
G_command, the current address is set to the last line
affected by (the last) command- list.</p>

<p>The format of command-list is the same as that of the
g_com- mand. A newline alone acts as a null command list. A
single &amp; repeats the last non-null command list.</p>

<p>H Toggles the printing of error explanations. By
default, expla- nations are not printed. It is recommended
that ed scripts begin with this command to aid in
debugging.</p>

<p>h Prints an explanation of the last error.</p>

<p>(.)i Inserts text in the buffer before the current line.
Text is entered in input mode. The current address is set to
the last line entered.</p>

<p>(.,.+1)j Joins the addressed lines. The addressed lines
are deleted from the buffer and replaced by a single line
containing their joined text. The current address is set to
the resultant line.</p>

<p>(.)klc Marks a line with a lower case letter lc. The
line can then be addressed as _lc (i.e., a single quote
followed by lc ) in subsequent commands. The mark is not
cleared until the line is deleted or otherwise modified.</p>

<p>(.,.)l Prints the addressed lines unambiguously. If
invoked from a terminal, ed pauses at the end of each page
until a newline is entered. The current address is set to
the last line printed.</p>

<p>(.,.)m(.) Moves lines in the buffer. The addressed lines
are moved to after the right-hand destination address, which
may be the address 0 (zero). The current address is set to
the last line moved.</p>

<p>(.,.)n Prints the addressed lines along with their line
numbers. The current address is set to the last line
printed.</p>

<p>(.,.)p Prints the addressed lines. If invoked from a
terminal, ed pauses at the end of each page until a newline
is entered. The current address is set to the last line
printed.</p>

<p>P Toggles the command prompt on and off. Unless a prompt
was specified by with command-line option -p string, the
command prompt is by default turned off.</p>

<p>q Quits ed.</p>

<p>Q Quits ed unconditionally. This is similar to the q
command, except that unwritten changes are discarded without
warning.</p>

<p>($)r file Reads file to after the addressed line. If
file is not speci- fied, then the default filename is used.
If there was no default filename prior to the command, then
the default file- name is set to file. Otherwise, the
default filename is unchanged. The current address is set to
the last line read.</p>

<p>($)r !command Reads to after the addressed line the
standard output of !com- mand, (see the !command below). The
default filename is unchanged. The current address is set to
the last line read.</p>

<p>(.,.)s/re/replacement/ (.,.)s/re/replacement/g
(.,.)s/re/replacement/n Replaces text in the addressed lines
matching a regular expres- sion re with replacement. By
default, only the first match in each line is replaced. If
the _g_ (global) suffix is given, then every match to be
replaced. The n_suffix, where n is a positive number, causes
only the nth match to be replaced. It is an error if no
substitutions are performed on any of the addressed lines.
The current address is set the last line affected.</p>

<p>re and replacement may be delimited by any character
other than space and newline (see the s_command below). If
one or two of the last delimiters is omitted, then the last
line affected is printed as though the print suffix _p_ were
specified.</p>

<p>An unescaped &amp; in replacement is replaced by the
currently matched text. The character sequence m, where m is
a number in the range [1,9], is replaced by the mth
backreference expression of the matched text. If replacement
consists of a single % , then replacement from the last
substitution is used. Newlines may be embedded in
replacement if they are escaped with a backslash (.</p>

<p>(.,.)s Repeats the last substitution. This form of the
s_command accepts a count suffix n, or any combination of
the charac- ters r, g, and p. If a count suffix n_is given,
then only the nth match is replaced. The _r_ suffix causes
the reg- ular expression of the last search to be used
instead of the that of the last substitution. The _g_ suffix
toggles the global suffix of the last substitution. The p_
suffix toggles the print suffix of the last substitution.
The current address is set to the last line affected.</p>

<p>(.,.)t(.) Copies (i.e., transfers) the addressed lines
to after the right-hand destination address, which may be
the address 0 (zero). The current address is set to the last
line copied.</p>

<p>u Undoes the last command and restores the current
address to what it was before the command. The global
commands g, G, v, and V. are treated as a single command by
undo. u_is its own inverse.</p>

<p>(1,$)v/re/command-list Applies command-list to each of
the addressed lines not match- ing a regular expression re.
This is similar to the g_com- mand.</p>

<p>(1,$)V/re/ Interactively edits the addressed lines not
matching a regular expression re. This is similar to the G_
command.</p>

<p>(1,$)w file Writes the addressed lines to file. Any
previous contents of file is lost without warning. If there
is no default filename, then the default filename is set to
file, otherwise it is unchanged. If no filename is
specified, then the default file- name is used. The current
address is unchanged.</p>

<p>(1,$)wq file Writes the addressed lines to file, and
then executes a q_ command.</p>

<p>(1,$)w !command Writes the addressed lines to the
standard input of !command, (see the !command below). The
default filename and current address are unchanged.</p>

<p>(1,$)W file Appends the addressed lines to the end of
file. This is simi- lar to the w_command, expect that the
previous contents of file is not clobbered. The current
address is unchanged.</p>

<p>(.)x Copies (puts) the contents of the cut buffer to
after the addressed line. The current address is set to the
last line copied.</p>

<p>(.,.)y Copies (yanks) the addressed lines to the cut
buffer. The cut buffer is overwritten by subsequent y, s, j,
_d_, or c_ commands. The current address is unchanged.</p>

<p>(.+1)zn Scrolls n lines at a time starting at addressed
line. If n is not specified, then the current window size is
used. The cur- rent address is set to the last line
printed.</p>

<p>!command Executes command via sh(1). If the first
character of command is !, then it is replaced by text of
the previous _ !command. ed does not process command for
backslash ( escapes. How- ever, an unescaped _%_ is replaced
by the default filename. When the shell returns from
execution, a ! is printed to the standard output. The
current line is unchanged.</p>

<p>(.,.)# Begins a comment; the rest of the line, up to a
newline, is ignored. If a line address followed by a
semicolon is given, then the current address is set to that
address. Otherwise, the current address is unchanged.</p>

<p>($)= Prints the line number of the addressed line.</p>

<p>(.+1)newline Prints the addressed line, and sets the
current address to that line.</p>

<p>FILES ed.hup The file to which ed attempts to write the
buffer if the ter- minal hangs up.</p>

Pascal , Addison- Wesley, 1981.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS ed processes file arguments for backslash
escapes, i.e., in a file- name, any characters preceded by a
backslash ( are interpreted liter- ally.</p>

<p>If a text (non-binary) file is not terminated by a
newline character, then ed appends one on reading/writing
it. In the case of a binary file, ed does not append a
newline on reading/writing.</p>

<p>per line overhead: 4 ints</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS When an error occurs, if eds input is from a
regular file or here doc- ument, then it exits, otherwise it
prints a ? and returns to command mode. An explanation of
the last error can be printed with the h_ (help)
command.</p>

<p>Attempting to quit ed or edit another file before
writing a modified buffer results in an error. If the
command is entered a second time, it succeeds, but any
changes to the buffer are lost.</p>

<p>ed exits with 0 if no errors occurred; otherwise
&gt;0.</p>
