<p>MBSTOWCS(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MBSTOWCS(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mbstowcs - convert a character string to a
wide-character string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t mbstowcs(wchar_t *restrict pwcs, const char
*restrict s, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mbstowcs() function shall convert a
sequence of characters that begins in the initial shift
state from the array pointed to by s into a sequence of
corresponding wide-character codes and shall store not more
than n wide-character codes into the array pointed to by
pwcs. No char- acters that follow a null byte (which is
converted into a wide-charac- ter code with value 0) shall
be examined or converted. Each character shall be converted
as if by a call to mbtowc(), except that the shift state of
mbtowc() is not affected.</p>

<p>No more than n elements shall be modified in the array
pointed to by pwcs. If copying takes place between objects
that overlap, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>The behavior of this function shall be affected by the
LC_CTYPE cate- gory of the current locale. If pwcs is a null
pointer, mbstowcs() shall return the length required to
convert the entire array regardless of the value of n, but
no values are stored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If an invalid character is encountered,
mbstowcs() shall return (size_t)-1 and may set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>Otherwise, mbstowcs() shall return the number of the
array elements modified (or required if pwcs is null), not
including a terminating 0 code, if any. The array shall not
be zero-terminated if the value returned is n.</p>

<p>ERRORS The mbstowcs() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EILSEQ Invalid byte sequence is detected.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>
