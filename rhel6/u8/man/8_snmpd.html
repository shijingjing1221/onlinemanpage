<p>NAME snmpd - daemon to respond to SNMP request
packets.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS snmpd [OPTIONS] [LISTENING ADDRESSES]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION snmpd is an SNMP agent which binds to a port
and awaits requests from SNMP management software. Upon
receiving a request, it processes the request(s), collects
the requested information and/or performs the requested
operation(s) and returns the information to the sender.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Log the source addresses of incoming
requests.</p>

<p>-A Append to the log file rather than truncating it.</p>

<p>-c FILE Read FILE as a configuration file (or a
comma-separated list of configuration files). Note that the
loaded file will only understand snmpd.conf tokens, unless
the configuration type is specified in the file as described
in the snmp_config man page under SWITCHING CONFIGURATION
TYPES IN MID-FILE.</p>

<p>-C Do not read any configuration files except the ones
optionally specified by the -c option. Note that this
behaviour also cov- ers the persistent configuration files.
This may result in dynamically-assigned values being reset
following an agent restart, unless the relevant persistent
config files are explicitly loaded using the -c option.</p>

<p>-d Dump (in hexadecimal) the sent and received SNMP
packets.</p>

<p>-D[TOKEN[,...]] Turn on debugging output for the given
TOKEN(s). Without any tokens specified, it defaults to
printing all the tokens (which is equivalent to the keyword
&quot;ALL&quot;). You might want to try ALL for extremely
verbose output. Note: You can not put a space between the -D
flag and the listed TOKENs.</p>

<p>-f Do not fork() from the calling shell.</p>

<p>-g GID Change to the numerical group ID GID after
opening listening sockets.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display a brief usage message and then
exit.</p>

<p>-H Display a list of configuration file directives
understood by the agent and then exit.</p>

<p>-I [-]INITLIST Specifies which modules should (or should
not) be initialized when the agent starts up. If the
comma-separated INITLIST is preceded with a -, it is the
list of modules that should not be started. Otherwise this
is the list of the only modules that should be started.</p>

<p>To get a list of compiled modules, run the agent with
the argu- ments -Dmib_init -H (assuming debugging support
has been com- piled in).</p>

<p>-L[efos] Specify where logging output should be directed
(standard error or output, to a file or via syslog). See
LOGGING OPTIONS in snmpcmd(5) for details.</p>

<p>-m MIBLIST Specifies a colon separated list of MIB
modules to load for this application. This overrides the
environment variable MIBS. See snmpcmd(1) for details.</p>

<p>-M DIRLIST Specifies a colon separated list of
directories to search for MIBs. This overrides the
environment variable MIBDIRS. See snmpcmd(1) for
details.</p>

<p>-n NAME Set an alternative application name (which will
affect the con- figuration files loaded). By default this
will be snmpd, regardless of the name of the actual
binary.</p>

<p>-p FILE Save the process ID of the daemon in FILE.</p>

<p>-q Print simpler output for easier automated
parsing.</p>

<p>-r Do not require root access to run the daemon.
Specifically, do not exit if files only accessible to root
(such as /dev/kmem etc.) cannot be opened.</p>

<p>-u UID Change to the user ID UID (which can be given in
numerical or textual form) after opening listening
sockets.</p>

<p>-U Instructs the agent to not remove its pid file (see
the -p option) on shutdown. Overrides the leave_pidfile
token in the snmpd.conf file, see snmpd.conf(5).</p>

<p>-v, --version Print version information for the agent
and then exit.</p>

<p>-V Symbolically dump SNMP transactions.</p>

<p>-x ADDRESS Listens for AgentX connections on the
specified address rather than the default
&quot;/var/agentx/master&quot;. The address can either be a
Unix domain socket path, or the address of a network
interface. The format is the same as the format of listening
addresses described below.</p>

<p>-X Run as an AgentX subagent rather than as an SNMP
master agent.</p>

<p>--name=&quot;value&quot; Allows to specify any token
(&quot;name&quot;) supported in the snmpd.conf file and sets
its value to &quot;value&quot;. Overrides the corresponding
token in the snmpd.conf file. See snmpd.conf(5) for the full
list of tokens.</p>

<p>LISTENING ADDRESSES By default, snmpd listens for
incoming SNMP requests on UDP port 161 on all IPv4
interfaces. However, it is possible to modify this behaviour
by specifying one or more listening addresses as arguments
to snmpd. A listening address takes the form:</p>


<p>[&lt;transport-specifier&gt;:]&lt;transport-address&gt;</p>

<p>At its simplest, a listening address may consist only of
a port number, in which case snmpd listens on that UDP port
on all IPv4 interfaces. Otherwise, the
&lt;transport-address&gt; part of the specification is
parsed according to the following table:</p>

<p>&lt;transport-specifier&gt; &lt;transport-address&gt;
format</p>

<p>udp (default) hostname[:port] or IPv4-address[:port]</p>

<p>tcp hostname[:port] or IPv4-address[:port]</p>

<p>unix pathname</p>

<p>ipx [network]:node[/port]</p>

<p>aal5pvc or pvc [interface.][VPI.]VCI</p>

<p>udp6 or udpv6 or udpipv6 hostname[:port] or
IPv6-address[:port]</p>

<p>tcp6 or tcpv6 or tcpipv6 hostname[:port] or
IPv6-address[:port]</p>

<p>ssh hostname:port</p>

<p>dtlsudp hostname:port</p>

<p>Note that &lt;transport-specifier&gt; strings are
case-insensitive so that, for example, &quot;tcp&quot; and
&quot;TCP&quot; are equivalent. Here are some examples,
along with their interpretation:</p>

<p>127.0.0.1:161 listen on UDP port 161, but only on the
loop- back interface. This prevents snmpd being queried
remotely. The port specification &quot;:161&quot; is not
strictly necessary since that is the default SNMP port.</p>

<p>TCP:1161 listen on TCP port 1161 on all IPv4
interfaces.</p>

<p>ipx:/40000 listen on IPX port 40000 on all IPX
interfaces.</p>

<p>unix:/tmp/local-agent listen on the Unix domain socket
/tmp/local- agent.</p>

<p>/tmp/local-agent is identical to the previous
specification, since the Unix domain is assumed if the first
character of the &lt;transport-address&gt; is /.</p>

<p>PVC:161 listen on the AAL5 permanent virtual circuit
with VPI=0 and VCI=161 (decimal) on the first ATM adapter in
the machine.</p>

<p>udp6:10161 listen on port 10161 on all IPv6
interfaces.</p>

<p>ssh:127.0.0.1:22 Allows connections from the snmp
subsystem on the ssh server on port 22. The details of using
SNMP over SSH are defined below.</p>

<p>dtlsudp:127.0.0.1:9161 Listen for connections over DTLS
on UDP port 9161. The snmp.conf file must have the
defX509ServerPub, defX509ServerPriv, and defX509ClientCerts
configuration tokens defined.</p>

<p>Note that not all the transport domains listed above
will always be available; for instance, hosts with no IPv6
support will not be able to use udp6 transport addresses,
and attempts to do so will result in the error &quot;Error
opening specified endpoint&quot;. Likewise, since AAL5 PVC
support is only currently available on Linux, it will fail
with the same error on other platforms.</p>

<p>Transport Specific Notes ssh The SSH transport, on the
server side, is actually just a unix named pipe that can be
connected to via a ssh subsystem config- ured in the main
ssh server. The pipe location (configurable with the
sshtosnmpsocket token in snmp.conf) is /var/net-
snmp/sshtosnmp. Packets should be submitted to it via the
ssh- tosnmp application, which also sends the user ID as
well when starting the connection. The TSM security model
should be used when packets should process it.</p>

<p>The sshtosnmp command knows how to connect to this pipe
and talk to it. It should be configured in the OpenSSH sshd
con- figuration file (which is normally /etc/ssh/sshd_config
using the following configuration line:</p>

<p>Subsystem snmp /usr/local/bin/sshtosnmp</p>

<p>The sshtosnmp command will need read/write access to the
/var/net-snmp/sshtosnmp pipe. Although it should be fairly
safe to grant access to the average user since it still
requires modifications to the ACM settings before the user
can perform operations, paranoid administrators may want to
make the /var/net-snmp directory accessible only by users in
a par- ticular group. Use the sshtosnmpsocketperms snmp.conf
config- ure option to set the permissions, owner and group
of the cre- ated socket.</p>

<p>Access control can be granted to the user
&quot;foo&quot; using the fol- lowing style of simple
snmpd.conf settings:</p>

<p>rouser -s tsm foo authpriv</p>

<p>Note that &quot;authpriv&quot; is acceptable assuming as
SSH protects everything that way (assuming you have a
non-insane setup). snmpd has no notion of how SSH has
actually protected a packet and thus the snmp agent assumes
all packets passed through the SSH transport have been
protected at the authpriv level.</p>

<p>dtlsudp The DTLS protocol, which is based off of TLS,
requires both client and server certificates to establish
the connection and authenticate both sides. In order to do
this, the client will need to configure the snmp.conf file
with the defX509ServerCerts, defX509ClientPriv, and
defX509ClientPub configuration tokens. The server will need
to configure the snmp.conf file with the defX509ServerPub,
defX509ServerPriv, and defX509ClientCerts configuration
tokens defined.</p>

<p>Access control setup is similar to the ssh transport as
the TSM security model should be used to protect the
packet.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILES snmpd checks for the existence of
and parses the following files:</p>

<p>/etc/snmp/snmp.conf Common configuration for the agent
and applications. See snmp.conf(5) for details.</p>

<p>/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf</p>

<p>/etc/snmp/snmpd.local.conf Agent-specific configuration.
See snmpd.conf(5) for details. These files are optional and
may be used to configure access con- trol, trap generation,
subagent protocols and much else besides.</p>

<p>In addition to these two configuration files in
/etc/snmp, the agent will read any files with the names
snmpd.conf and snmpd.local.conf in a colon separated path
specified in the SNMP- CONFPATH environment variable.</p>

<p>/usr/share/snmp/mibs/ The agent will also load all files
in this directory as MIBs. It will not, however, load any
file that begins with a . or descend into
subdirectories.</p>
