<p>GIT-STATUS(1) Git Manual GIT-STATUS(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-status - Show the working tree status</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git status [&lt;options&gt;...] [--]
[&lt;pathspec&gt;...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Displays paths that have differences between
the index file and the current HEAD commit, paths that have
differences between the working tree and the index file, and
paths in the working tree that are not tracked by git (and
are not ignored by gitignore(5)). The first are what you
would commit by running git commit; the second and third are
what you could commit by running git add before running git
commit.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s, --short Give the output in the
short-format.</p>

<p>--porcelain Give the output in a stable, easy-to-parse
format for scripts. Currently this is identical to --short
output, but is guaranteed not to change in the future,
making it safe for scripts.</p>

<p>-u[&lt;mode&gt;], --untracked-files[=&lt;mode&gt;] Show
untracked files (Default: all).</p>

<p>The mode parameter is optional, and is used to specify
the handling of untracked files. The possible options
are:</p>

<p>&middot; no - Show no untracked files</p>

<p>&middot; normal - Shows untracked files and
directories</p>

<p>&middot; all - Also shows individual files in untracked
directories. See git-config(1) for configuration variable
used to change the default for when the option is not
specified.</p>

<p>-z Terminate entries with NUL, instead of LF. This
implies the --porcelain output format if no other format is
given.</p>

<p>OUTPUT The output from this command is designed to be
used as a commit template comment, and all the output lines
are prefixed with #. The default, long format, is designed
to be human readable, verbose and descriptive. They are
subject to change in any time.</p>

<p>The paths mentioned in the output, unlike many other git
commands, are made relative to the current directory if you
are working in a subdirectory (this is on purpose, to help
cutting and pasting). See the status.relativePaths config
option below.</p>

<p>In short-format, the status of each path is shown as</p>

<p>XY PATH1 -&gt; PATH2</p>

<p>where PATH1 is the path in the HEAD, and PATH2 part is
shown only when PATH1 corresponds to a different path in the
index/worktree (i.e. the file is renamed). The XY is a
two-letter status code.</p>

<p>The fields (including the ) are separated from each
other by a single space. If a filename contains whitespace
or other nonprintable characters, that field will be quoted
in the manner of a C string literal: surrounded by ASCII
double quote (34) characters, and with interior special
characters backslash-escaped.</p>

<p>For paths with merge conflicts, X and Y show the
modification states of each side of the merge. For paths
that do not have merge conflicts, X shows the status of the
index, and Y shows the status of the work tree. For
untracked paths, XY are ??. Other status codes can be
interpreted as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; &acute; &acute; = unmodified</p>

<p>&middot; M = modified</p>

<p>&middot; A = added</p>

<p>&middot; D = deleted</p>

<p>&middot; R = renamed</p>

<p>&middot; C = copied</p>

<p>&middot; U = updated but unmerged</p>

<p>Ignored files are not listed.</p>

<p>X Y Meaning
------------------------------------------------- [MD] not
updated M [ MD] updated in index A [ MD] added to index D [
M] deleted from index R [ MD] renamed in index C [ MD]
copied in index [MARC] index and work tree matches [ MARC] M
work tree changed since index [ MARC] D deleted in work tree
------------------------------------------------- D D
unmerged, both deleted A U unmerged, added by us U D
unmerged, deleted by them U A unmerged, added by them D U
unmerged, deleted by us A A unmerged, both added U U
unmerged, both modified
------------------------------------------------- ? ?
untracked
-------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>There is an alternate -z format recommended for machine
parsing. In that format, the status field is the same, but
some other things change. First, the _is omitted from rename
entries and the field order is reversed (e.g from _to
becomes to from). Second, a NUL (ASCII 0) follows each
filename, replacing space as a field separator and the
terminating newline (but a space still separates the status
field from the first filename). Third, filenames containing
special characters are not specially formatted; no quoting
or backslash-escaping is performed.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The command honors color.status (or
status.color they mean the same thing and the latter is kept
for backward compatibility) and color.status.&lt;slot&gt;
configuration variables to colorize its output.</p>

<p>If the config variable status.relativePaths is set to
false, then all paths shown are relative to the repository
root, not to the current directory.</p>

<p>If status.submodulesummary is set to a non zero number
or true (identical to -1 or an unlimited number), the
submodule summary will be enabled for the long format and a
summary of commits for modified submodules will be shown
(see --summary-limit option of git- submodule(1)).</p>
