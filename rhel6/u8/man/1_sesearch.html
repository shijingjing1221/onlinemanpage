<p>NAME sesearch - SELinux policy query tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sesearch [OPTIONS] RULE_TYPE [RULE_TYPE ...]
[EXPRESSION] [POLICY ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sesearch allows the user to search the rules
in a SELinux policy.</p>

<p>POLICY sesearch supports loading a SELinux policy in one
of four formats.</p>

<p>source A single text file containing policy source for
versions 12 through 21. This file is usually named
policy.conf.</p>

<p>binary A single file containing a monolithic kernel
binary policy for versions 15 through 21. This file is
usually named by version - for example, policy.20.</p>

<p>modular A list of policy packages each containing a
loadable policy mod- ule. The first module listed must be a
base module.</p>

<p>policy list A single text file containing all the
information needed to load a policy, usually exported by
SETools graphical utilities.</p>

<p>If no policy file is provided, sesearch will search for
the system default policy: checking first for a source
policy, next for a binary policy matching the running
kernels preferred version, and finally for the highest
version that can be found. In the latter case, the policy
will be downgraded to match the running system. If no policy
can be found, sesearch will print an error message and
exit.</p>

<p>RULE TYPE OPTIONS sesearch is capable of searching
multiple types of rules. At least one of the following must
be provided to specify the desired type(s) of rules to
search.</p>

<p>-A, --allow Search for allow rules.</p>

<p>--neverallow Search for neverallow rules.</p>

<p>--auditallow Search for auditallow rules.</p>

<p>--dontaudit Search for dontaudit rules.</p>

<p>-T, --type Search for type_transition, type_member, and
type_change rules.</p>

<p>--role_allow Search for role allow rules.</p>

<p>--role_trans Search for role_transition rules.</p>

<p>--range_trans Search for range_transition rules.</p>

<p>--all Search all rule types.</p>

<p>EXPRESSIONS The user may specify an expression
containing values for a given field(s) in a rule. Only those
fields applicable to a given rule type will be used; all
other fields will be ignored. (For example, type_transition
rules will ignore the permissions field.) If no expression
is specified or if none of the specified fields apply to a
given rule type, all rules of that type are considered to
match the expression.</p>

<p>-s NAME, --source=NAME Find rules with type/attribute
NAME as their source.</p>

<p>-t NAME, --target=NAME Find rules with type/attribute
NAME as their target.</p>

<p>--role_source=NAME Find rules with role NAME as their
source.</p>

<p>--role_target=NAME Find rules with role NAME as their
target.</p>

<p>-c NAME, --class=NAME Find rules with class NAME as
their object class.</p>

<p>-p P1[,P2,...] --perm=P1[,P2...] Find rules with at
least one of the specified permissions. Mul- tiple
permissions may be specified as a comma separated list; it
is recommended that this list be quoted for shells that
inter- pret comma as a special character.</p>

<p>-b NAME, --bool=NAME Find conditional rules with NAME in
their conditional expres- sion. This option will include
rules in both the true and false lists of the
conditional.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following additional options exist to modify
how the search is per- formed and the amount of information
printed for each result.</p>

<p>-d, --direct Normally rules are matched using the type
given or any of that type s attributes (or an attributes
types). This &quot;indirect&quot; matching also considers
types used in complemented sets, the special set
&quot;*&quot;, and the special target &quot;self&quot;. When
the direct flag is given, matching is done literally. The
rule must explicitly contain the given type (or attribute)
for it to be returned.</p>

<p>-R, --regex Use regular expressions to match symbol
names. By default only exact string matches will be
considered.</p>

<p>-n, --linenum Print the line number for each rule. This
option is ignored if using the --semantic option or if line
numbers are not available for the given policy.</p>

<p>-S, --semantic Search rules semantically instead of
syntactically. This option is implied for policies for which
syntactic rules are not avail- able.</p>

<p>-C, --show_cond Print the conditional expression and
state for all conditional rules found. This option has no
effect on unconditional rules.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print help information and exit.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print version information and exit.</p>
