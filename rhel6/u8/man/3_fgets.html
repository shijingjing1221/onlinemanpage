<p>GETS(3) Linux Programmer s Manual GETS(3)</p>

<p>NAME fgetc, fgets, getc, getchar, gets, ungetc - input
of characters and strings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fgetc(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>char *fgets(char *s, int size, FILE *stream);</p>

<p>int getc(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>int getchar(void);</p>

<p>char *gets(char *s);</p>

<p>int ungetc(int c, FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fgetc() reads the next character from stream
and returns it as an unsigned char cast to an int, or EOF on
end of file or error.</p>

<p>getc() is equivalent to fgetc() except that it may be
implemented as a macro which evaluates stream more than
once.</p>

<p>getchar() is equivalent to getc(stdin).</p>

<p>gets() reads a line from stdin into the buffer pointed
to by s until either a terminating newline or EOF, which it
replaces with 0&rsquo;. No check for buffer overrun is
performed (see BUGS below).</p>

<p>fgets() reads in at most one less than size characters
from stream and stores them into the buffer pointed to by s.
Reading stops after an EOF or a newline. If a newline is
read, it is stored into the buffer. A 0&rsquo; is stored
after the last character in the buffer.</p>

<p>ungetc() pushes c back to stream, cast to unsigned char,
where it is available for subsequent read operations.
Pushed-back characters will be returned in reverse order;
only one pushback is guaranteed.</p>

<p>Calls to the functions described here can be mixed with
each other and with calls to other input functions from the
stdio library for the same input stream.</p>

<p>For non-locking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE fgetc(), getc() and getchar() return the
character read as an unsigned char cast to an int or EOF on
end of file or error.</p>

<p>gets() and fgets() return s on success, and NULL on
error or when end of file occurs while no characters have
been read.</p>

<p>ungetc() returns c on success, or EOF on error.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001. LSB deprecates
gets(). POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of
gets().</p>

<p>BUGS Never use gets(). Because it is impossible to tell
without knowing the data in advance how many characters
gets() will read, and because gets() will continue to store
characters past the end of the buffer, it is extremely
dangerous to use. It has been used to break computer
security. Use fgets() instead.</p>

<p>It is not advisable to mix calls to input functions from
the stdio library with low-level calls to read(2) for the
file descriptor associ- ated with the input stream; the
results will be undefined and very probably not what you
want.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO read(2), write(2), ferror(3), fgetwc(3),
fgetws(3), fopen(3), fread(3), fseek(3), getline(3),
getwchar(3), puts(3), scanf(3), ungetwc(3),
