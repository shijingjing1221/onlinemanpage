<p>MORE(1) BSD General Commands Manual MORE(1)</p>

<p>NAME more - file perusal filter for crt viewing</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS more [-dlfpcsu] [-num] [+/pattern] [+linenum]
[file ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION More is a filter for paging through text one
screenful at a time. This version is especially primitive.
Users should realize that less(1) pro- vides more(1)
emulation and extensive enhancements.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Command line options are described below.
Options are also taken from the environment variable MORE
(make sure to precede them with a dash (-)) but command line
options will override them.</p>

<p>-num This option specifies an integer which is the
screen size (in lines).</p>

<p>-d more will prompt the user with the message
&quot;[Press space to con- tinue, q to quit.]&quot; and will
display &quot;[Press h for instruc- tions.]&quot; instead of
ringing the bell when an illegal key is pressed.</p>

<p>-l more usually treats ^L (form feed) as a special
character, and will pause after any line that contains a
form feed. The -l option will prevent this behavior.</p>

<p>-f Causes more to count logical, rather than screen
lines (i.e., long lines are not folded).</p>

<p>-p Do not scroll. Instead, clear the whole screen and
then display the text.</p>

<p>-c Do not scroll. Instead, paint each screen from the
top, clearing the remainder of each line as it is
displayed.</p>

<p>-s Squeeze multiple blank lines into one.</p>

<p>-u Suppress underlining.</p>

<p>+/ The +/ option specifies a string that will be
searched for before each file is displayed.</p>

<p>+num Start at line number num.</p>

<p>COMMANDS Interactive commands for more are based on
vi(1). Some commands may be preceded by a decimal number,
called k in the descriptions below. In the following
descriptions, ^X means control-X.</p>

<p>h or ? Help: display a summary of these commands. If you
forget all the other commands, remember this one.</p>

<p>SPACE Display next k lines of text. Defaults to current
screen size.</p>

<p>z Display next k lines of text. Defaults to current
screen size. Argument becomes new default.</p>

<p>RETURN Display next k lines of text. Defaults to 1.
Argument becomes new default.</p>

<p>d or ^D Scroll k lines. Default is current scroll size,
initially 11. Argument becomes new default.</p>

<p>q or Q or INTERRUPT Exit.</p>

<p>s Skip forward k lines of text. Defaults to 1.</p>

<p>f Skip forward k screenfuls of text. Defaults to 1.</p>

<p>b or ^B Skip backwards k screenfuls of text. Defaults to
1. Only works with files, not pipes.</p>

<p>Go to place where previous search started.</p>

<p>= Display current line number.</p>

<p>/pattern Search for kth occurrence of regular
expression. Defaults to 1.</p>

<p>n Search for kth occurrence of last r.e. Defaults to
1.</p>

<p>!&lt;cmd&gt; or :!&lt;cmd&gt; Execute &lt;cmd&gt; in a
subshell</p>

<p>v Start up an editor at current line. The editor is
taken from the environment variable VISUAL if defined, or
EDITOR if VISUAL is not defined, or defaults to
&quot;vi&quot; if neither VISUAL nor EDITOR is defined.</p>

<p>^L Redraw screen</p>

<p>:n Go to kth next file. Defaults to 1.</p>

<p>:p Go to kth previous file. Defaults to 1.</p>

<p>:f Display current file name and line number</p>

<p>. Repeat previous command</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT More utilizes the following environment
variables, if they exist:</p>

<p>MORE This variable may be set with favored options to
more.</p>

<p>SHELL Current shell in use (normally set by the shell at
login time).</p>

<p>TERM Specifies terminal type, used by more to get the
terminal characteristics necessary to manipulate the
screen.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO vi(1), less(1)</p>

<p>HISTORY The more command appeared in 3.0BSD. This man
page documents more ver- sion 5.19 (Berkeley 6/29/88), which
is currently in use in the Linux com- munity. Documentation
was produced using several other versions of the man page,
and extensive inspection of the source code.</p>
