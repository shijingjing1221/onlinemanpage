<p>NAME MrmFetchWidget Fetches and creates an indexed (UIL
named) application widget and its children</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Mrm/MrmPublic.h&gt; Cardinal
MrmFetchWidget( MrmHierarchy hierarchy_id, String index,
Widget parent_widget, Widget *widget, MrmType *class);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The MrmFetchWidget function fetches and
creates an indexed application widget and its children. The
indexed application widget is any widget that is named in
UIL. In fetch operations, the fetched widgets sub- tree is
also fetched and created. This widget must not appear as the
child of a widget within its own subtree. MrmFetchWidget
does not exe- cute XtManageChild for the newly created
widget.</p>

<p>All widgets fetched by a call to MrmFetchWidget are not
managed at the time of their creation callbacks.</p>

<p>hierarchy_id Specifies the ID of the UID hierarchy that
contains the interface definition. The value of hierarchy_id
was returned in a previous call to
MrmOpenHierarchyPerDisplay.</p>

<p>index Specifies the UIL name of the widget to fetch.</p>

<p>parent_widget Specifies the parent widget ID.</p>

<p>widget Returns the widget ID of the created widget.</p>

<p>class This argument must be set to an actual pointer; it
cannot be a NULL pointer. MrmFetchWidget sets this argument
to an implementation dependent value.</p>

<p>An application can fetch any named widget in the UID
hierarchy using MrmFetchWidget. MrmFetchWidget can be called
at any time to fetch a widget that was not fetched at
application startup. MrmFetchWidget can be used to defer
fetching pop-up widgets until they are first refer- enced
(presumably in a callback), and then used to fetch them
once.</p>

<p>MrmFetchWidget can also create multiple instances of a
widget (and its subtree). In this case, the UID definition
functions as a template; a widget definition can be fetched
any number of times. An application can use this template to
make multiple instances of a widget, for exam- ple, in a
dialog box box or menu.</p>

<p>The index (UIL name) that identifies the widget must be
known to the application.</p>

<p>RETURN This function returns one of the following status
return constants:</p>

<p>MrmSUCCESS The function executed successfully.</p>

<p>MrmBAD_HIERARCHY The hierarchy ID was invalid.</p>

<p>MrmNOT_FOUND The widget was not found in UID
hierarchy.</p>

<p>MrmFAILURE The function failed.</p>
