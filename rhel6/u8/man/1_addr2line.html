<p>ADDR2LINE(1) GNU Development Tools ADDR2LINE(1)</p>

<p>NAME addr2line - convert addresses into file names and
line numbers.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS addr2line [-b bfdname|--target=bfdname]
[-C|--demangle[=style]] [-e filename|--exe=filename]
[-f|--functions] [-s|--basename] [-i|--inlines]
[-j|--section=name] [-H|--help] [-V|--version] [addr addr
...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION addr2line translates addresses into file
names and line numbers. Given an address in an executable or
an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the
debugging information to figure out which file name and line
number are associated with it.</p>

<p>The executable or relocatable object to use is specified
with the -e option. The default is the file a.out. The
section in the relocatable object to use is specified with
the -j option.</p>

<p>addr2line has two modes of operation.</p>

<p>In the first, hexadecimal addresses are specified on the
command line, and addr2line displays the file name and line
number for each address.</p>

<p>In the second, addr2line reads hexadecimal addresses
from standard input, and prints the file name and line
number for each address on standard output. In this mode,
addr2line may be used in a pipe to convert dynamically
chosen addresses.</p>

<p>The format of the output is FILENAME:LINENO. The file
name and line number for each address is printed on a
separate line. If the -f option is used, then each
FILENAME:LINENO line is preceded by a FUNCTIONNAME line
which is the name of the function containing the
address.</p>

<p>If the file name or function name can not be determined,
addr2line will print two question marks in their place. If
the line number can not be determined, addr2line will print
0.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The long and short forms of options, shown here
as alternatives, are equivalent.</p>

<p>-b bfdname --target=bfdname Specify that the object-code
format for the object files is bfdname.</p>

<p>-C --demangle[=style] Decode (demangle) low-level symbol
names into user-level names. Besides removing any initial
underscore prepended by the system, this makes C++ function
names readable. Different compilers have different mangling
styles. The optional demangling style argument can be used
to choose an appropriate demangling style for your
compiler.</p>

<p>-e filename --exe=filename Specify the name of the
executable for which addresses should be translated. The
default file is a.out.</p>

<p>-f --functions Display function names as well as file
and line number information.</p>

<p>-s --basenames Display only the base of each file
name.</p>

<p>-i --inlines If the address belongs to a function that
was inlined, the source information for all enclosing scopes
back to the first non-inlined function will also be printed.
For example, if &quot;main&quot; inlines &quot;callee1&quot;
which inlines &quot;callee2&quot;, and address is from
&quot;callee2&quot;, the source information for
&quot;callee1&quot; and &quot;main&quot; will also be
printed.</p>

<p>-j --section Read offsets relative to the specified
section instead of absolute addresses.</p>

<p>@file Read command-line options from file. The options
read are inserted in place of the original @file option. If
file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will
be treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p>Options in file are separated by whitespace. A
whitespace character may be included in an option by
surrounding the entire option in either single or double
quotes. Any character (including a backslash) may be
included by prefixing the character to be included with a
backslash. The file may itself contain additional @file
options; any such options will be processed recursively.</p>
