<p>NAME rpmdev-rmdevelrpms - manual page for
rpmdev-rmdevelrpms version 1.12</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rpmdev-rmdevelrpms [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rpmdev-rmdevelrpms is a script for finding
and optionally removing &quot;development&quot; packages,
for example for cleanup purposes before start- ing to build
a new package.</p>

<p>By default, the following packages are treated as
development ones and are thus candidates for removal: any
package whose name matches ( c a s e , i
&quot;-devel,-debuginfo,-sdko-staticn r s e n s i - tively)
except gcc requirements; any package whose name starts with
&quot;perl-(Devel|ExtUtils|Test)-&quot;; any package whose
name starts with &quot;com- pat-gcc&quot;; packages in the
internal list of known development oriented packages (see
def_devpkgs in the source code); packages determined to be
development ones based on some basic heuristic checks on the
pack- ages contents.</p>

<p>The default set of packages above is not intended to not
reduce a sys- tem into a minimal clean build root, but to
keep it usable for general purposes while getting rid of a
reasonably large set of development packages. The package
set operated on can be configured to meet vari- ous
scenarios.</p>

<p>To include additional packages in the list of ones
treated as develop- ment packages, use the
&quot;devpkgs&quot; option in the configuration file. To
exclude packages from the list use &quot;nondevpkgs&quot; in
it. Exclusion over- rides inclusion.</p>

<p>The system wide configuration file is
/etc/rpmdevtools/rmdevel- rpms.conf, and per user settings
(which override system ones) can be specified in
~/.config/rpmdevtools/rmdevelrpms.conf or ~/.rmdevelrpmsrc
(deprecated). These files are written in Python.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, --help show this help message and exit</p>

<p>-l, --list-only Output condensed list of packages, do
not remove.</p>

<p>--qf=QF, --queryformat=QF Query format to use for
output.</p>

<p>-y, --yes Root only: remove without prompting; ignored
with -l.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print program version and exit.</p>
