<p>NAME pilot-xfer - Backup, sync, and restore databases
from a Palm handheld device.</p>

<p>SECTION pilot-link: Userland conduits</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pilot-xfer [-p &lt;port&gt;] [-e &lt;file&gt;]
[-b] [-u] [-s] &lt;directory&gt;</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>pilot-xfer [-p &lt;port&gt;] [-r &lt;directory&gt;] [-l]
[-L] [-P] [-f &lt;dbname&gt;] [-d &lt;dbname&gt;] [-i
&lt;dbname&gt;] [-m &lt;file&gt;] ...</p>

<p>Use exactly one of -brsudfimlI; mix in -aexDPv, --rom
and with-os.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is the swiss-army-knife of the entire
pilot-link suite.</p>

<p>pilot-xfer allows the user to install databases
contained in the stan- dard .prc (Palm Resource Database),
.pdb (Palm Record Database), and .pqa (Palm Query
Application) formats onto a Palm, retrieve databases from
the Palm, list the databases contained in a Palm, backup or
restore all of the databases at once as well as many other
powerful operations performed on a Palm handheld device.</p>

<p>OPTIONS pilot-xfer options Archive files which have been
removed from the Palm to &lt;dir&gt; instead of just
deleting (unlinking) them.</p>

<p>-a, --archive &lt;dir&gt;</p>

<p>Back up the Palm into the specified directory (which
will be created if it does not already exist).</p>

<p>-b, --backup &lt;dir&gt;</p>

<p>Show information on available cards</p>

<p>-C, --cardinfo</p>

<p>Permanently delete the specified database(s) by name
(without extension). Obviously, be very careful with this
one.</p>

<p>--delete &lt;dbname&gt;</p>

<p>Modify -l, -i or -f to use VFS dir instead of internal
storage (see examples section for usage)</p>

<p>-D, --vfsdir=dir</p>

<p>Reads a list of databases from &lt;file&gt; and prevents
--backup, --sync, or --update from operating on the listed
database(s). A maximum of 100 databases can be excluded.
Databases should be specified by name with- out the
extension, as displayed with --list, in any order.</p>

<p>-e, --exclude= &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>Fetch each specified database out of the Palm into the
current direc- tory.</p>

<p>Obsolete. Replaced by --rom in v0.12.</p>

<p>-F, --Flash</p>

<p>Install each specified file into the Palm. Wildcards are
valid with this syntax and multiple files may be listed at
once.</p>

<p>-i, --install &lt;file&gt; [...]</p>

<p>Note: the behavior of list has changed in version 0.12
and later</p>

<p>List all the databases in the Palm, including
OS-specific native databases.</p>

<p>-l, --list</p>

<p>Unsupported in 0.12 - see -l</p>

<p>-L, --Listall</p>

<p>Adds the records in each specified file into the
corresponding Palm database.</p>

<p>-m, --merge &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; [...]</p>

<p>Obsolete. Replaced by --with-os in v0.12 and later</p>

<p>-O, --Osflash</p>

<p>Purge any deleted data that havent been cleaned up by a
full synchro- nization (this is a safe operation, and will
prevent your Palm from accumulating unused data if you
delete records but arent syncing with a PIM.) The only
information you can lose is archived but un-synchro- nized
records.</p>

<p>-P, --Purge</p>

<p>Installs all files contained in the named directory to
the Palm. (Use this to restore your Palm after a hard reset
has cleared and wiped its memory, using your backup
directory as a baseline).</p>

<p>-r, --restore &lt;dir&gt;</p>

<p>Modifies -b, -u, and s , to back up non-OS dbs from the
internal Flash ROM</p>

<p>--rom</p>

<p>Backs up the Palm into the specified directory (which
will be created if it does not already exist). Any Palm
databases which have not been modified or created since the
versions stored in the specified direc- tory will not be
backed up.</p>

<p>NOTE: Any Palm databases which have been deleted will
have their cor- responding backup file removed.</p>

<p>-s, --sync &lt;dir&gt;</p>

<p>Not supported in v0.12. No replacement.</p>

<p>-S, --novsf</p>

<p>Modifies -b, -u, and s , to back up OS databases from
internal Flash ROM.</p>

<p>--with-os</p>

<p>Backs up the Palm into the specified directory (which
will be created if it does not already exist). Any Palm
databases which have not been modified or created since the
versions stored in the specified direc- tory will not be
backed up.</p>

<p>-u, --update</p>

<p>This will back up the UnsavedPreferences.prc file from
the Palm. Nor- mally this file is not backed up by normal
means (Palm recommends that you do not restore this file
upon restoration of your device using --restore.</p>

<p>This also modifies the behavior of --backup, --sync, and
--update.</p>

<p>-I, --Illegal</p>

<p>Execute a shell command for intermediate processing. All
commands will be done, from left to right on the
command-line, before the connection to the Palm device is
made.</p>

<p>-x, --exec=command</p>

<p>Conduit Options Use device file &lt;port&gt; to
communicate with the Palm handheld. If this is not
specified, pilot-xfer will look for the $PILOTPORT
environment variable. If neither are found, pilot-xfer will
print the usage information.</p>

<p>-p, --port &lt;port&gt;</p>

<p>Display version of pilot-xfer and exit without
connecting.</p>

<p>-v, --version</p>

<p>Help Options Display the help synopsis for pilot-xfer
and exit without connecting.</p>

<p>-h, --help</p>

<p>Display a brief usage message and exit without
connecting.</p>

<p>--usage</p>

<p>USAGE The program will attempt to connect to a target
Palm handheld device and specified port and perform the
requested options specified by the user on the
commandline.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To perform a full backup of your Palm
handheld:</p>

<p># using long options</p>

<p>pilot-xfer --port /dev/pilot --backup
$HOME/pilot/Backup</p>

<p># or over IrDA, using short options</p>

<p>pilot-xfer -p /dev/ircomm0 -b $HOME/pilot/Backup</p>

<p>To restore that backup to a non-standard serial port
(for example, to a xcopilot or POSE session, assuming you
have xcopilot or POSE configured properly for this
operation, see the appropriate man pages for details on
configuring your emulator):</p>

<p>pilot-xfer -p /dev/ttyqe --restore
$HOME/pilot/Backup</p>

<p>To fetch a file that is on your Palm handheld, such as
the Palm Address Book database, you could do the following.
This will connect to /dev/pilot and retrieve the records
found in AddressDB and place them in a local file called
AddressDB.pdb (Palm Record Database).</p>

<p>pilot-xfer -p /dev/pilot --fetch AddressDB</p>

<p>This will connect to your Palm device and install the
application Foo (in Foo.prc) to your external storage card
(typically an SD or MMC card) in the directory
/Palm/Launcher on that card, using VFS.</p>

<p>pilot-xfer -p /dev/pilot -i Foo.prc -D
/Palm/Launcher</p>

<p>BUGS Known Bugs --backup will currently truncate/corrupt
pdb/prc files if the communi- cation to the device is
interrupted during sync (such as removing the Palm from the
cradle, or a temporary network hiccup during a NetSync).
Ideally, this should restore the original file, or delete
the corrupted version and restore the original version back
into place, but presently.. it does not.</p>

<p>Reporting Bugs We have an online bug tracker. Using this
