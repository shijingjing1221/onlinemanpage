<p>NAME ppmtopjxl - convert a PPM image to an HP PaintJet
XL PCL file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtopjxl [-nopack] [-gamma n] [-presentation]
[-dark] [-diffuse] [-cluster] [-dither] [-xshift s] [-yshift
s] [-xshift s] [-yshift s] [{-xsize|-width|-xscale} s]
[{-ysize|-height|-yscale} s] [ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtopjxl reads a PPM image as input and produces a PCL
file suitable for printing on an HP PaintJet XL printer as
output.</p>

<p>The generated file is not suitable for printing on a
normal PrintJet printer. The -nopack option generates a file
which does not use the normal TIFF 4.0 compression method.
This file might be printable on a normal PaintJet printer
(not an XL).</p>

<p>The -gamma option sets the gamma correction for the
image. The useful range for the PaintJet XL is approximately
0.6 to 1.5.</p>

<p>You an alter the rendering algorithm used for images
with the -dither, -cluster, and -diffuse options. These
options select ordered dither- ing, clustered ordered
dithering, or error diffusion respectively. You can use the
-dark option to enhance images with a dark background when
they are reduced in size. The -presentation option turns on
presenta- tion mode, in which two passes are made over the
paper to increase ink density. You should use this only for
images where quality is criti- cal.</p>

<p>You can resize the image by setting the -xsize and
-ysize options. The parameter to either of these options is
interpreted as the number of dots to set the width or height
to, but you may append an optional dimension of pt (points),
dp (decipoints), in (inches), or cm (centimetres). If you
specify only one dimension, ppmtopjxl will scale the other
one appropriately.</p>

<p>The options -width and -height are synonyms of -xsize
and -ysize.</p>

<p>You can alternatively use the -xscale and -yscale
options to scale the image by a simple factor.</p>

<p>You can shift the image on the page with the -xshift and
-yshift options. These move the image the specified
dimensions right and down.</p>
