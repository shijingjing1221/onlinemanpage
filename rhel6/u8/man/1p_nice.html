<p>NICE(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual NICE(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME nice - invoke a utility with an altered nice
value</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nice [-n increment] utility [argument...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The nice utility shall invoke a utility,
requesting that it be run with a different nice value (see
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
3.239, Nice Value). With no options and only if the user has
appropriate privileges, the executed utility shall be run
with a nice value that is some implementation-defined
quantity less than or equal to the nice value of the current
process. If the user lacks appropriate privileges to affect
the nice value in the requested manner, the nice utility
shall not affect the nice value; in this case, a warning
message may be written to standard error, but this shall not
prevent the invocation of utility or affect the exit
status.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The nice utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option is supported:</p>

<p>-n increment A positive or negative decimal integer
which shall have the same effect on the execution of the
utility as if the utility had called the nice() function
with the numeric value of the incre- ment
option-argument.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>utility The name of a utility that is to be invoked. If
the utility operand names any of the special built-in
utilities in Special Built-In Utilities, the results are
undefined.</p>

<p>argument Any string to be supplied as an argument when
invoking the util- ity named by the utility operand.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of nice:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>PATH Determine the search path used to locate the
utility to be invoked. See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Variables.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS If utility is invoked, the exit status of
nice shall be the exit status of utility; otherwise, the
nice utility shall exit with one of the fol- lowing
values:</p>

<p>1-125 An error occurred in the nice utility.</p>

<p>126 The utility specified by utility was found but could
not be invoked.</p>

<p>127 The utility specified by utility could not be
found.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The only guaranteed portable uses of
this utility are:</p>

<p>nice utility</p>

<p>Run utility with the default lower nice value.</p>

<p>nice -n &lt;positive integer&gt; utility</p>

<p>Run utility with a lower nice value.</p>

<p>On some implementations they have no discernible effect
on the invoked utility and on some others they are exactly
equivalent.</p>

<p>Historical systems have frequently supported the
&lt;positive integer&gt; up to 20. Since there is no error
penalty associated with guessing a num- ber that is too
high, users without access to the system conformance
document (to see what limits are actually in place) could
use the his- torical 1 to 20 range or attempt to use very
large numbers if the job should be truly low priority.</p>

<p>The nice value of a process can be displayed using the
command:</p>

<p>ps -o nice</p>

<p>The command, env, nice, nohup, time, and xargs utilities
have been specified to use exit code 127 if an error occurs
so that applications can distinguish &quot;failure to find a
utility&quot; from &quot;invoked utility exited with an
error indication&quot;. The value 127 was chosen because it
is not commonly used for other meanings; most utilities use
small val- ues for &quot;normal error conditions&quot; and
the values above 128 can be con- fused with termination due
to receipt of a signal. The value 126 was chosen in a
similar manner to indicate that the utility could be found,
but not invoked. Some scripts produce meaningful error
messages differ- entiating the 126 and 127 cases. The
distinction between exit codes 126 and 127 is based on
KornShell practice that uses 127 when all attempts to exec
the utility fail with [ENOENT], and uses 126 when any
attempt to exec the utility fails for any other reason.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Due to the text about the limits of the nice
value being implementa- tion-defined, nice is not actually
required to change the nice value of the executed command;
the limits could be zero differences from the system
default, although the implementor is required to document
this fact in the conformance document.</p>

<p>The 4.3 BSD version of nice does not check whether
increment is a valid decimal integer. The command nice -x
utility, for example, would be treated the same as the
command nice --1 utility. If the user does not have
appropriate privileges, this results in a &quot;permission
denied&quot; error. This is considered a bug.</p>

<p>When a user without appropriate privileges gives a
negative increment, System V treats it like the command nice
-0 utility, while 4.3 BSD writes a &quot;permission
denied&quot; message and does not run the utility. Nei- ther
was considered clearly superior, so the behavior was left
unspeci- fied.</p>

<p>The C shell has a built-in version of nice that has a
different inter- face from the one described in this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>The term &quot;utility&quot; is used, rather than
&quot;command&quot;, to highlight the fact that shell
compound commands, pipelines, and so on, cannot be used.
Special built-ins also cannot be used. However,
&quot;utility&quot; includes user application programs and
shell scripts, not just utili- ties defined in this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>Historical implementations of nice provide a nice value
range of 40 or 41 discrete steps, with the default nice
value being the midpoint of that range. By default, they
lower the nice value of the executed util- ity by 10.</p>

<p>Some historical documentation states that the increment
value must be within a fixed range. This is misleading; the
valid increment values on any invocation are determined by
the current process nice value, which is not always the
default.</p>

<p>The definition of nice value is not intended to suggest
that all pro- cesses in a system have priorities that are
comparable. Scheduling policy extensions such as the
realtime priorities in the System Inter- faces volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 make the notion of a single under-
lying priority for all scheduling policies problematic. Some
implemen- tations may implement the nice-related features to
affect all processes on the system, others to affect just
the general time-sharing activi- ties implied by this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, and others may have no effect at
all. Because of the use of
&quot;implementation-defined&quot; in nice and renice, a
wide range of implementation strategies are pos- sible.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
