<p>ENDIAN(3) Linux Programmer s Manual ENDIAN(3)</p>

<p>NAME htobe16, htole16, be16toh, le16toh, htobe32,
htole32, be32toh, le32toh, htobe64, htole64, be64toh,
le64toh - convert values between host and big-/little-endian
byte order</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _BSD_SOURCE #include
&lt;endian.h&gt;</p>

<p>uint16_t htobe16(uint16_t host_16bits); uint16_t
htole16(uint16_t host_16bits); uint16_t be16toh(uint16_t
big_endian_16bits); uint16_t le16toh(uint16_t
little_endian_16bits);</p>

<p>uint32_t htobe32(uint32_t host_32bits); uint32_t
htole32(uint32_t host_32bits); uint32_t be32toh(uint32_t
big_endian_32bits); uint32_t le32toh(uint32_t
little_endian_32bits);</p>

<p>uint64_t htobe64(uint64_t host_64bits); uint64_t
htole64(uint64_t host_64bits); uint64_t be64toh(uint64_t
big_endian_64bits); uint64_t le64toh(uint64_t
little_endian_64bits);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions convert the byte encoding of
integer values from the byte order that the current CPU (the
&quot;host&quot;) uses, to and from little- endian and
big-endian byte order.</p>

<p>The number, nn, in the name of each function indicates
the size of integer handled by the function, either 16, 32,
or 64 bits.</p>

<p>The functions with names of the form &quot;htobenn&quot;
convert from host byte order to big-endian order.</p>

<p>The functions with names of the form &quot;htolenn&quot;
convert from host byte order to little-endian order.</p>

<p>The functions with names of the form &quot;benntoh&quot;
convert from big-endian order to host byte order.</p>

<p>The functions with names of the form &quot;lenntoh&quot;
convert from little- endian order to host byte order.</p>

<p>VERSIONS These function were added to glibc in version
2.9.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These functions are non-standard. Similar
functions are present on the BSDs, where the required header
file is &lt;sys/endian.h&gt; instead of &lt;endian.h&gt;.
Unfortunately, NetBSD, FreeBSD, and glibc havent followed
the original OpenBSD naming convention for these functions,
whereby the nn component always appears at the end of the
function name (thus, for example, in NetBSD, FreeBSD, and
glibc, the equivalent of OpenBSDs &quot;betoh32&quot; is
&quot;be32toh&quot;).</p>

<p>NOTES These functions are similar to the older
byteorder(3) family of func- tions. For example, be32toh()
is identical to ntohl().</p>

<p>The advantage of the byteorder(3) functions is that they
are standard functions available on all Unix systems. On the
other hand, the fact that they were designed for use in the
context of TCP/IP means that they lack the 64-bit and
little-endian variants described in this page.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The program below display the results of
converting an integer from host byte order to both
little-endian and big-endian byte order. Since host byte
order is either little-endian or big-endian, only one of
these conversions will have an effect. When we run this
program on a little-endian system such as x86-32, we see the
following:</p>

<p>$ ./a.out x.u32 = 0x44332211 htole32(x.u32) = 0x44332211
htobe32(x.u32) = 0x11223344</p>

<p>Program source</p>

<p>#include &lt;endian.h&gt; #include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { union { uint32_t u32;
uint8_t arr[4]; } x;</p>

<p>x.arr[0] = 0x11; /* Lowest-address byte */ x.arr[1] =
0x22; x.arr[2] = 0x33; x.arr[3] = 0x44; /* Highest-address
byte */</p>

<p>printf(&quot;x.u32 = 0x%x0, x.u32);
printf(&quot;htole32(x.u32) = 0x%x0, htole32(x.u32));
printf(&quot;htobe32(x.u32) = 0x%x0, htobe32(x.u32));</p>

<p>exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>
