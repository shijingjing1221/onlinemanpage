<p>WMEMCHR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WMEMCHR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wmemchr - find a wide character in memory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wchar_t *wmemchr(const wchar_t *ws, wchar_t wc, size_t
n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wmemchr() function shall locate the
first occurrence of wc in the initial n wide characters of
the object pointed to by ws. This function shall not be
affected by locale and all wchar_t values shall be treated
identically. The null wide character and wchar_t values not
correspond- ing to valid characters shall not be treated
specially.</p>

<p>If n is zero, the application shall ensure that ws is a
valid pointer and the function behaves as if no valid
occurrence of wc is found.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wmemchr() function shall return a
pointer to the located wide char- acter, or a null pointer
if the wide character does not occur in the object.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
