<p>NAME genisoimagerc - startup configuration file for
genisoimage</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION genisoimage(1) searches for a configuration
file in several places; it uses the first one it is able to
open. First, if the GENISOIMAGERC environment variable is
set, its value is used as the filename; like- wise for the
MKISOFSRC environment variable. Next, genisoimage looks for
files named .genisoimagerc or .mkisofsrc, first in the
current working directory, then in the user s home
directory. Next, it looks for /etc/genisoimagerc. Finally,
it looks for a .genisoimagerc in the same directory as
genisoimage itself is stored.</p>

<p>The .genisoimagerc file contains lines of the form</p>

<p>TAG=value</p>

<p>where TAG is one of the settings defined below. The case
of the tag is not significant. All settings have
command-line equivalents; if the command-line parameter is
specified, it takes priority over the config- uration
file.</p>

<p>Blank lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION SETTINGS ABST The abstract information,
typically the name of a file on the disc containing an
abstract. There is space for 37 characters. Equivalent to
the -abstract command-line option.</p>

<p>APPI The application identifier should describe the
application that will be on the disc. There is space for 128
characters. Equiv- alent to the -A command-line option.</p>

<p>BIBL The bibliographic information, often the name of a
file on the disc containing a bibliography. There is space
for 37 charac- ters. Equivalent to the -biblio command-line
option.</p>

<p>COPY The copyright information, typically the name of a
file on the disc containing the copyright notice. There is
space for 37 characters. Equivalent to the -copyright
command-line option.</p>

exactly 4 charac- ters. Equivalent to the -hfs-type
command-line option. The default value is TEXT.</p>

usually with a mailing address and phone number. There is
space for 128 char- acters. Equivalent to the -p

<p>PUBL This should describe the publisher of the CD-ROM,
usually with a mailing address and phone number. There is
