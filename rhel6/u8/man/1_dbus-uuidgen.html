<p>NAME dbus-uuidgen - Utility to generate UUIDs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dbus-uuidgen [--version] [--ensure[=FILENAME]]
[--get[=FILENAME]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The dbus-uuidgen command generates or reads
a universally unique ID.</p>

<p>Note that the D-Bus UUID has no relationship to RFC 4122
and does not generate UUIDs compatible with that spec. Many
systems have a separate command for that (often called
&quot;uuidgen&quot;).</p>

<p>See http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/ for more
information about D-Bus.</p>

<p>The primary usage of dbus-uuidgen is to run in the
post-install script of a D-Bus package like this:
dbus-uuidgen --ensure</p>

<p>This will ensure that /var/lib/dbus/machine-id exists
and has the uuid in it. It wont overwrite an existing uuid,
since this id should remain fixed for a single machine until
the next reboot at least.</p>

<p>The important properties of the machine UUID are that 1)
it remains unchanged until the next reboot and 2) it is
different for any two run- ning instances of the OS kernel.
That is, if two processes see the same UUID, they should
also see the same shared memory, UNIX domain sockets, local
X displays, localhost.localdomain resolution, process IDs,
and so forth.</p>

<p>If you run dbus-uuidgen with no options it just prints a
new uuid made up out of thin air.</p>

<p>If you run it with --get, it prints the machine UUID by
default, or the UUID in the specified file if you specify a
file.</p>

<p>If you try to change an existing machine-id on a running
system, it will probably result in bad things happening.
Dont try to change this file. Also, don t make it the same
on two different systems; it needs to be different anytime
there are two different kernels running.</p>

<p>The UUID should be different on two different virtual
machines, because there are two different kernels.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>--get[=FILENAME] If a filename is not given, defaults to
localstate- dir/lib/dbus/machine-id (localstatedir is
usually /var). If this file exists and is valid, the uuid in
the file is printed on stdout. Otherwise, the command exits
with a nonzero status.</p>

<p>--ensure[=FILENAME] If a filename is not given, defaults
to localstate- dir/lib/dbus/machine-id (localstatedir is
usually /var). If this file exists then it will be
validated, and a failure code returned if it contains the
wrong thing. If the file does not exist, it will be created
with a new uuid in it. On success, prints no output.</p>

<p>--version Print the version of dbus-uuidgen</p>
