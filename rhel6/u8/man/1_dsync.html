<p>DSYNC(1) Dovecot DSYNC(1)</p>

<p>NAME dsync - Dovecot&rsquo;s mailbox synchronization
utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dsync [options] mirror location2 dsync
[options] backup location2</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dsync is Dovecot&rsquo;s mailbox
synchronization utility. It can be used for several
different use cases: Two-way synchronization of mailboxes in
different servers (via ssh(1)), creating backups of mails to
a remote server, and convert mailboxes from/to different
mailbox formats.</p>

<p>The syncing is done as perfectly as possible: an IMAP or
a POP3 client shouldn&rsquo;t be able to notice any
differences between the two mailboxes. Two-way syncing means
that it&rsquo;s safe to do any kind of modifications in both
sides, and dsync will merge the changes without losing any
changes done on either side. This is possible because dsync
can access Dove- cot&rsquo;s index logs that keep track of
changes. It&rsquo;s of course possible to have conflicts
during merging, these are resolved in a safe way. See the
dsync design document for more information.</p>

<p>dsync uses the same configuration files as the rest of
Dovecot (via doveconf binary). The entire configuration can
be changed by giving -c parameter to another configuration
file, or using -o parameter to over- ride specific settings.
When executing a remote dsync program it works the same way:
it uses its own local configuration.</p>

<p>dsync can be run completely standalone. It doesn&rsquo;t
require any Dovecot server processes to be running, except
when using -u parameter to do a userdb lookup from auth
process.</p>

<p>dsync can currently sync only one user at a time. If you
want to dsync all users, you&rsquo;ll need to get a list of
all users and execute dsync separately for each one.</p>

<p>Any errors are written to stderr.</p>

<p>OPTIONS dsync recognizes the following command line
options:</p>

<p>-c config-file read configuration from the given
config-file. By default /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf will be
used. -C alt_char Specifies an alternative mailbox name
character. If source and destina- tion mailbox formats are
different, it&rsquo;s possible that on one side there exists
a mailbox name that isn&rsquo;t valid for the other side.
These invalid mailbox names are fixed by replacing such
invalid characters with the given alt_char. The default is
&rsquo;_&rsquo;.</p>

<p>-D Activates debug messages and makes dsync more
verbose.</p>

<p>-f Makes dsync run in &quot;full sync&quot; mode rather
than &quot;fast sync&quot; mode. In fast sync mode dsync
might skip syncing a mailbox, if both locations had modified
it equally many times (i.e. high- est-modseqs were equal),
but with different changes.</p>

<p>-m mailbox Specifies the mailbox that should be
synchronized or from which mails should be converted. The
default is to synchronize all respectively convert from all
mailboxes.</p>

<p>-o setting=value Overrides the configuration setting
from /etc/dovecot/dove- cot.conf and from the userdb with
the given value. In order to override multiple settings to
-o option may be specified multi- ple times.</p>

<p>-R Reverse backup direction, so mails in location2 are
backed up to default mail location.</p>

<p>-u user Specifies that the userdb lookup for the given
user should be done and used to set up the environment (uid,
gid, home, etc.). By default the system user&rsquo;s current
environment will be used.</p>

<p>-v Makes dsync more verbose.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS location2 The first mail location is based on
configuration (mail_location or userdb settings). It&rsquo;s
also possible to override it by giv- ing -o
mail_location=mail_location setting. This parameter defines
the other mail location that is used.</p>

<p>If the location is on local filesystem, you can use a
regular mail_location, such as
maildir:/backup/user/Maildir</p>

<p>If the location is on a remote server, dsync can ssh to
it by giving host or user@host as the parameter. If user is
speci- fied, it&rsquo;s given as -u parameter to dsync, not
to ssh. The ssh username is always the default.</p>

<p>The final way to specify a location is to give a full
command line or a path to a script that executes the dsync.
For exam- ple:</p>

<p>ssh mailuser@host dsync -u user</p>

<p>COMMANDS dsync provides the following commands:</p>

<p>mirror Does a two-way synchronization between two mail
locations. Changes in both locations are synchronized to the
other one, without losing any changes made by either of
them. Any potential UID conflicts are resolved by giving
them new UIDs.</p>

<p>backup Backup mails from default mail location to
location2 (or vice versa, if -R parameter is given). No
changes are ever done to the source loca- tion. Any changes
done in destination are discarded.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS dsync will exit with one of the following
values:</p>

<p>0 Synchronization was done perfectly.</p>

<p>2 Synchronization was done without errors, but some
changes couldn&rsquo;t be done, so the mailboxes
aren&rsquo;t perfectly synchronized. Running dsync again
usually fixes this. Typically this occurs for message
modification sequences with newly created mailboxes. It can
also occur if one of the mailboxes change during the
syncing.</p>

<p>1, &gt;2 Synchronization failed.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE MIRRORING Mirror mailboxes to a remote server.
Any errors are written to stderr.</p>

<p>dsync -u username mirror username@example.com</p>

<p>If you need more complex parameters to ssh, you can use
e.g.:</p>

<p>dsync -u username mirror ssh -i id_dsa.dovecot
mailuser@example.com dsync -u username</p>

<p>CONVERTING Assuming that the mail_location setting in
/etc/dove- cot/conf.d/10-mail.conf is set to: mail_location
= mdbox:~/mdbox, a logged in system user may convert her/his
mails from its Maildir in her/his home directory to the
mdbox mailbox format. The user has to execute the
command:</p>

<p>dsync mirror maildir:~/Maildir</p>

<p>If you want to do this without any downtime, you can do
the conversion one user at a time. Initially:</p>

<p>&middot; Configuration uses mail_location =
maildir:~/Maildir</p>

<p>&middot; Set up the possibility of doing per-user mail
location using userdb extra fields.</p>

<p>Then for each user:</p>

<p>1. Run dsync mirror once to do the initial
conversion.</p>

<p>2. Run dsync mirror again, because the initial
conversion could have taken a while and new changes could
have occurred during it. This second time only applies
changes, so it should be fast.</p>

<p>3. Update mail extra field in userdb to mdbox:~/mdbox.
If you&rsquo;re using auth cache, you need to flush it.</p>

<p>4. Wait for a few seconds and then kill the user&rsquo;s
all existing imap and pop3 sessions (that are still using
maildir).</p>

<p>5. Run dsync mirror once more to apply final changes
that were possibly done. After this there should be no
changes to Maildir, because the user&rsquo;s mail location
has been changed and all existing processes using it have
been killed.</p>

<p>Once all users have been converted, you can set the
default mail_loca- tion to mdbox and remove the per-user
mail locations from userdb.</p>
