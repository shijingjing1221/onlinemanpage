<p>GIT-RECEIVE-PACK(1) Git Manual GIT-RECEIVE-PACK(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-receive-pack - Receive what is pushed into the
repository</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git-receive-pack &lt;directory&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Invoked by git send-pack and updates the
repository with the information fed from the remote end.</p>

<p>This command is usually not invoked directly by the end
user. The UI for the protocol is on the git send-pack side,
and the program pair is meant to be used to push updates to
remote repository. For pull operations, see
git-fetch-pack(1).</p>

<p>The command allows for creation and fast-forwarding of
sha1 refs (heads/tags) on the remote end (strictly speaking,
it is the local end git-receive-pack runs, but to the user
who is sitting at the send-pack end, it is updating the
remote. Confused?)</p>

<p>There are other real-world examples of using update and
post-update hooks found in the Documentation/howto
directory.</p>

<p>git-receive-pack honours the receive.denyNonFastForwards
config option, which tells it if updates to a ref should be
denied if they are not fast-forwards.</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;directory&gt; The repository to sync
into.</p>

<p>PRE-RECEIVE HOOK Before any ref is updated, if
$GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-receive file exists and is executable, it
will be invoked once with no parameters. The standard input
of the hook will be one line per ref to be updated:</p>

<p>sha1-old SP sha1-new SP refname LF</p>

<p>The refname value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the
master head this is &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two
sha1 values before each refname are the object names for the
refname before and after the update. Refs to be created will
have sha1-old equal to 0{40}, while refs to be deleted will
have sha1-new equal to 0{40}, otherwise sha1-old and
sha1-new should be valid objects in the repository.</p>

<p>This hook is called before any refname is updated and
before any fast-forward checks are performed.</p>

<p>If the pre-receive hook exits with a non-zero exit
status no updates will be performed, and the update,
post-receive and post-update hooks will not be invoked
either. This can be useful to quickly bail out if the update
is not to be supported.</p>

<p>UPDATE HOOK Before each ref is updated, if
$GIT_DIR/hooks/update file exists and is executable, it is
invoked once per ref, with three parameters:</p>

<p>$GIT_DIR/hooks/update refname sha1-old sha1-new</p>

<p>The refname parameter is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for
the master head this is &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The
two sha1 arguments are the object names for the refname
before and after the update. Note that the hook is called
before the refname is updated, so either sha1-old is 0{40}
(meaning there is no such ref yet), or it should match what
is recorded in refname.</p>

<p>The hook should exit with non-zero status if it wants to
disallow updating the named ref. Otherwise it should exit
with zero.</p>

<p>Successful execution (a zero exit status) of this hook
does not ensure the ref will actually be updated, it is only
a prerequisite. As such it is not a good idea to send
notices (e.g. email) from this hook. Consider using the
post-receive hook instead.</p>

<p>POST-RECEIVE HOOK After all refs were updated (or
attempted to be updated), if any ref update was successful,
and if $GIT_DIR/hooks/post-receive file exists and is
executable, it will be invoked once with no parameters. The
standard input of the hook will be one line for each
successfully updated ref:</p>

<p>sha1-old SP sha1-new SP refname LF</p>

<p>The refname value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the
master head this is &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two
sha1 values before each refname are the object names for the
refname before and after the update. Refs that were created
will have sha1-old equal to 0{40}, while refs that were
deleted will have sha1-new equal to 0{40}, otherwise
sha1-old and sha1-new should be valid objects in the
repository.</p>

<p>Using this hook, it is easy to generate mails describing
the updates to the repository. This example script sends one
mail message per ref listing the commits pushed to the
repository:</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh # mail out commit update information. while
read oval nval ref do if expr &quot;$oval&quot; :
&acute;0*$&acute; &gt;/dev/null then echo &quot;Created a
new ref, with the following commits:&quot; git rev-list
--pretty &quot;$nval&quot; else echo &quot;New
commits:&quot; git rev-list --pretty &quot;$nval&quot;
&quot;^$oval&quot; fi | mail -s &quot;Changes to ref
$ref&quot; commit-list@mydomain done exit 0</p>

<p>The exit code from this hook invocation is ignored,
however a non-zero exit code will generate an error
message.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible for refname to not have
sha1-new when this hook runs. This can easily occur if
another user modifies the ref after it was updated by
git-receive-pack, but before the hook was able to evaluate
it. It is recommended that hooks rely on sha1-new rather
than the current value of refname.</p>

<p>POST-UPDATE HOOK After all other processing, if at least
one ref was updated, and if $GIT_DIR/hooks/post-update file
exists and is executable, then post-update will be called
with the list of refs that have been updated. This can be
used to implement any repository wide cleanup tasks.</p>

<p>The exit code from this hook invocation is ignored; the
only thing left for git-receive-pack to do at that point is
to exit itself anyway.</p>

<p>This hook can be used, for example, to run git
update-server-info if the repository is packed and is served
via a dumb transport.</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh exec git update-server-info</p>
