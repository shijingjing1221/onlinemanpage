<p>NAME hwstamp_ctl - set time stamping policy at the
driver level</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS hwstamp_ctl -i interface [ -r rx-filter ] [ -t
tx-type ] [ -v ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION hwstamp_ctl is a program used to set and get
the hardware time stamping policy at the network driver
level with the SIOCSHWTSTAMP ioctl(2). The tx-type and
rx-filter values are hints to the driver what it is expected
to do. If the requested fine-grained filtering for incoming
packets is not supported, the driver may time stamp more
than just the requested types of packets.</p>

<p>If neither tx-type nor rx-filter values are passed to
the program, it will use the SIOCGHWTSTAMP ioctl(2) to
non-destructively read the cur- rent hardware time stamping
policy.</p>

<p>This program is a debugging tool. The ptp4l(8) program
does not need this program to function, it will set the
policy automatically as appropriate.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -i interface Specify the network interface of
which the policy should be changed.</p>

<p>-r rx-filter Specify which types of incoming packets
should be time stamped, rx-filter is an integer value.</p>

<p>-t tx-type Enable or disable hardware time stamping for
outgoing packets, tx-type is an integer value.</p>

<p>-h Display a help message and list of possible values
for rx-filter and tx-type.</p>

<p>-v Prints the software version and exits.</p>
