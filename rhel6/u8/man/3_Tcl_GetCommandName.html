<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_CreateObjCommand defines a new command
in interp and associates it with procedure proc such that
whenever name is invoked as a Tcl command (e.g., via a call
to Tcl_EvalObjEx) the Tcl interpreter will call proc to
process the command.</p>

<p>Tcl_CreateObjCommand deletes any existing command name
already associ- ated with the interpreter (however see below
for an exception where the existing command is not deleted).
It returns a token that may be used to refer to the command
in subsequent calls to Tcl_GetCommandName. If name contains
any :: namespace qualifiers, then the command is added to
the specified namespace; otherwise the command is added to
the global namespace. If Tcl_CreateObjCommand is called for
an interpreter that is in the process of being deleted, then
it does not create a new com- mand and it returns NULL. proc
should have arguments and result that match the type
Tcl_ObjCmdProc: typedef int Tcl_ObjCmdProc( ClientData
clientData, Tcl_Interp *interp, int objc, Tcl_Obj *const
objv[]); When proc is invoked, the clientData and interp
parameters will be copies of the clientData and interp
arguments given to Tcl_CreateObj- Command. Typically,
clientData points to an application-specific data structure
that describes what to do when the command procedure is
invoked. Objc and objv describe the arguments to the
command, objc giv- ing the number of argument objects
(including the command name) and objv giving the values of
the arguments. The objv array will contain objc values,
pointing to the argument objects. Unlike argv[argv] used in
a string-based command procedure, objv[objc] will not
contain NULL.</p>

<p>Additionally, when proc is invoked, it must not modify
the contents of the objv array by assigning new pointer
values to any element of the array (for example, objv[2] =
NULL) because this will cause memory to be lost and the
runtime stack to be corrupted. The const in the decla-
ration of objv will cause ANSI-compliant compilers to report
any such attempted assignment as an error. However, it is
acceptable to modify the internal representation of any
individual object argument. For instance, the user may call
Tcl_GetIntFromObj on objv[2] to obtain the integer
representation of that object; that call may change the type
of the object that objv[2] points at, but will not change
where objv[2] points.</p>

<p>proc must return an integer code that is either TCL_OK,
TCL_ERROR, TCL_RETURN, TCL_BREAK, or TCL_CONTINUE. See the
Tcl overview man page for details on what these codes mean.
Most normal commands will only return TCL_OK or TCL_ERROR.
In addition, if proc needs to return a non-empty result, it
can call Tcl_SetObjResult to set the interpreters result. In
the case of a TCL_OK return code this gives the result of
the command, and in the case of TCL_ERROR this gives an
error message. Before invoking a command procedure,
Tcl_EvalObjEx sets interpreters result to point to an object
representing an empty string, so simple commands can return
an empty result by doing nothing at all.</p>

<p>The contents of the objv array belong to Tcl and are not
guaranteed to persist once proc returns: proc should not
modify them. Call Tcl_SetO- bjResult if you want to return
something from the objv array.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, Tcl_CreateObjCommand deletes any existing
command name already associated with the interpreter.
However, if the existing com- mand was created by a previous
call to Tcl_CreateCommand, Tcl_CreateOb- jCommand does not
delete the command but instead arranges for the Tcl
interpreter to call the Tcl_ObjCmdProc proc in the future.
The old string-based Tcl_CmdProc associated with the command
is retained and its address can be obtained by subsequent
Tcl_GetCommandInfo calls. This is done for backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>DeleteProc will be invoked when (if) name is deleted.
This can occur through a call to Tcl_DeleteCommand,
Tcl_DeleteCommandFromToken, or Tcl_DeleteInterp, or by
replacing name in another call to Tcl_CreateOb- jCommand.
DeleteProc is invoked before the command is deleted, and
gives the application an opportunity to release any
structures associ- ated with the command. DeleteProc should
have arguments and result that match the type
Tcl_CmdDeleteProc: typedef void Tcl_CmdDeleteProc(
ClientData clientData); The clientData argument will be the
same as the clientData argument passed to
Tcl_CreateObjCommand.</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteCommand deletes a command from a command
interpreter. Once the call completes, attempts to invoke
cmdName in interp will result in errors. If cmdName is not
bound as a command in interp then Tcl_DeleteCommand does
nothing and returns -1; otherwise it returns 0. There are no
restrictions on cmdName: it may refer to a built-in com-
mand, an application-specific command, or a Tcl procedure.
If name contains any :: namespace qualifiers, the command is
deleted from the specified namespace.</p>

<p>Given a token returned by Tcl_CreateObjCommand,
Tcl_DeleteCommandFrom- Token deletes the command from a
command interpreter. It will delete a command even if that
command has been renamed. Once the call com- pletes,
attempts to invoke the command in interp will result in
errors. If the command corresponding to token has already
been deleted from interp then Tcl_DeleteCommand does nothing
and returns -1; otherwise it returns 0.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetCommandInfo checks to see whether its cmdName
argument exists as a command in interp. cmdName may include
:: namespace qualifiers to identify a command in a
particular namespace. If the command is not found, then it
returns 0. Otherwise it places information about the command
in the Tcl_CmdInfo structure pointed to by infoPtr and
returns 1. A Tcl_CmdInfo structure has the following fields:
typedef struct Tcl_CmdInfo { int isNativeObjectProc;
Tcl_ObjCmdProc *objProc; ClientData objClientData;
Tcl_CmdProc *proc; ClientData clientData; Tcl_CmdDeleteProc
*deleteProc; ClientData deleteData; Tcl_Namespace
*namespacePtr; } Tcl_CmdInfo; The isNativeObjectProc field
has the value 1 if Tcl_CreateObjCommand was called to
register the command; it is 0 if only Tcl_CreateCommand was
called. It allows a program to determine whether it is
faster to call objProc or proc: objProc is normally faster
if isNativeObjectProc has the value 1. The fields objProc
and objClientData have the same meaning as the proc and
clientData arguments to Tcl_CreateObjCommand; they hold
information about the object-based command procedure that
the Tcl interpreter calls to implement the command. The
fields proc and clientData hold information about the
string-based command procedure that implements the command.
If Tcl_CreateCommand was called for this command, this is
the procedure passed to it; otherwise, this is a com-
patibility procedure registered by Tcl_CreateObjCommand that
simply calls the commands object-based procedure after
converting its string arguments to Tcl objects. The field
deleteData is the ClientData value to pass to deleteProc; it
is normally the same as clientData but may be set
independently using the Tcl_SetCommandInfo procedure. The
field namespacePtr holds a pointer to the Tcl_Namespace that
contains the command.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetCommandInfoFromToken is identical to
Tcl_GetCommandInfo except that it uses a command token
returned from Tcl_CreateObjCommand in place of the command
name. If the token parameter is NULL, it returns 0;
otherwise, it returns 1 and fills in the structure
designated by infoPtr.</p>

<p>Tcl_SetCommandInfo is used to modify the procedures and
ClientData val- ues associated with a command. Its cmdName
argument is the name of a command in interp. cmdName may
include :: namespace qualifiers to identify a command in a
particular namespace. If this command does not exist then
Tcl_SetCommandInfo returns 0. Otherwise, it copies the
information from *infoPtr to Tcls internal structure for the
command and returns 1.</p>

<p>Tcl_SetCommandInfoFromToken is identical to
Tcl_SetCommandInfo except that it takes a command token as
returned by Tcl_CreateObjCommand instead of the command
name. If the token parameter is NULL, it returns 0.
Otherwise, it copies the information from *infoPtr to Tcls
internal structure for the command and returns 1.</p>

<p>Note that Tcl_SetCommandInfo and
Tcl_SetCommandInfoFromToken both allow the ClientData for a
commands deletion procedure to be given a differ- ent value
than the ClientData for its command procedure.</p>

<p>Note that neither Tcl_SetCommandInfo nor
Tcl_SetCommandInfoFromToken will change a commands
namespace. Use Tcl_Eval to call the rename command to do
that.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetCommandName provides a mechanism for tracking
commands that have been renamed. Given a token returned by
Tcl_CreateObjCommand when the command was created,
Tcl_GetCommandName returns the string name of the command.
If the command has been renamed since it was created, then
Tcl_GetCommandName returns the current name. This name does
not include any :: namespace qualifiers. The command
corresponding to token must not have been deleted. The
string returned by Tcl_GetCom- mandName is in dynamic memory
owned by Tcl and is only guaranteed to retain its value as
long as the command is not deleted or renamed; callers
should copy the string if they need to keep it for a long
time.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetCommandFullName produces the fully qualified name
of a command from a command token. The name, including all
namespace prefixes, is appended to the object specified by
objPtr.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetCommandFromObj returns a token for the command
specified by the name in a Tcl_Obj. The command name is
resolved relative to the cur- rent namespace. Returns NULL
if the command is not found.</p>
