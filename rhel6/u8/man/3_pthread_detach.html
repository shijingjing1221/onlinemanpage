<p>PTHREAD_DETACH(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_DETACH(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_detach - detach a thread</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_detach() function marks the
thread identified by thread as detached. When a detached
thread terminates, its resources are auto- matically
released back to the system without the need for another
thread to join with the terminated thread.</p>

<p>Attempting to detach an already detached thread results
in unspecified behavior.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, pthread_detach() returns 0; on
error, it returns an error number.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL thread is not a joinable thread.</p>

<p>ESRCH No thread with the ID thread could be found.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Once a thread has been detached, it cant be joined
with pthread_join(3) or be made joinable again.</p>

<p>A new thread can be created in a detached state using
pthread_attr_set- detachstate(3) to set the detached
attribute of the attr argument of pthread_create(3).</p>

<p>The detached attribute merely determines the behavior of
the system when the thread terminates; it does not prevent
the thread from being terminated if the process terminates
using exit(3) (or equivalently, if the main thread
returns).</p>

<p>Either pthread_join(3) or pthread_detach() should be
called for each thread that an application creates, so that
system resources for the thread can be released. (But note
that the resources of all threads are freed when the process
terminates.)</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following statement detaches the calling
thread:</p>

<p>pthread_detach(pthread_self());</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pthread_attr_setdetachstate(3),
pthread_cancel(3), pthread_create(3), pthread_exit(3),
pthread_join(3), pthreads(7)</p>
