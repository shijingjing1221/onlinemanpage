<p>NAME DBE - Double Buffer Extension</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS The Double Buffer Extension (DBE) provides a
standard way to utilize double-buffering within the
framework of the X Window System. Double- buffering uses two
buffers, called front and back, which hold images. The front
buffer is visible to the user; the back buffer is not. Suc-
cessive frames of an animation are rendered into the back
buffer while the previously rendered frame is displayed in
the front buffer. When a new frame is ready, the back and
front buffers swap roles, making the new frame visible.
Ideally, this exchange appears to happen instanta- neously
to the user, with no visual artifacts. Thus, only completely
rendered images are presented to the user, and remain
visible during the entire time it takes to render a new
frame. The result is a flicker-free animation.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Concepts Normal windows are created using
XCreateWindow() or XCreateSim- pleWindow(), which allocate a
set of window attributes and, for InputOutput windows, a
front buffer, into which an image can be drawn. The contents
of this buffer will be displayed when the window is
visible.</p>

<p>This extension enables applications to use
double-buffering with a window. This involves creating a
second buffer, called a back buffer, and associating one or
more back buffer names (XIDs) with the window, for use when
referring to (i.e., drawing to or reading from) the windows
back buffer. The back buffer name is a drawable of type
XdbeBackBuffer.</p>

<p>DBE provides a relative double-buffering model. One XID,
the window, always refers to the front buffer. One or more
other XIDs, the back buffer names, always refer to the back
buffer. After a buffer swap, the window continues to refer
to the (new) front buffer, and the back buffer name
continues to refer to the (new) back buffer. Thus,
applications and toolkits that want to just render to the
back buffer always use the back buffer name for all drawing
requests to the window. Portions of an applica- tion that
want to render to the front buffer always use the win- dow
XID for all drawing requests to the window.</p>

<p>Multiple clients and toolkits can all use
double-buffering on the same window. DBE does not provide a
request for querying whether a window has double-buffering
support, and if so, what the back buffer name is. Given the
asynchronous nature of the X Window System, this would cause
race conditions. Instead, DBE allows multiple back buffer
names to exist for the same window; they all refer to the
same physical back buffer. The first time a back buffer name
is allocated for a window, the window becomes
double-buffered and the back buffer name is associated with
the window. Subsequently, the window already is a
double-buffered window, and nothing about the window changes
when a new back buffer name is allocated, except that the
new back buffer name is associated with the window. The
window remains double- buffered until either the window is
destroyed, or until all of the back buffer names for the
window are deallocated.</p>

<p>In general, both the front and back buffers ae treated
the same. In particular, here are some important
characteristics:</p>

<p>Only one buffer per window can be visible at a time (the
front buffer).</p>

<p>Both buffers associated with a window have the same
visual type, depth, width, height, and shape as the win-
dow.</p>

<p>Both buffers associated with a window are
&quot;visible&quot; (or &quot;obscured&quot;) in the same
way. When an Expose event is generated for a window, this
event is considered to apply to both buffers equally. When a
double-buffered window is exposed, both buffers are tiled
with the window back- ground. Even though the back buffer is
not visible, terms such as obscure apply to the back buffer
as well as to the front buffer.</p>

<p>It is acceptable at any time to pass an XdbeBackBuffer
in any function that expects a drawable. This enables an
application to draw directly into XdbeBackBuffer in the same
fashion as it would draw into any other drawable.</p>

<p>It is an error (Window) to pass an XdbeBackBuffer in a
function that expects a Window.</p>

<p>An XdbeBackBuffer will never be sent in a reply, event,
or error where a Window is specified.</p>

<p>If backing-store and save-under applies to a double-
buffered window, it applies to both buffers equally.</p>

<p>If the XClearArea() or XClearWindow() function is exe-
cuted on a double-buffered window, the same area in both the
front and back buffers is cleared.</p>

<p>The effect of passing a window to a function that
accepts a drawable is unchanged by this extension. The
window and front buffer are synonymous with each other. This
includes obeying the XGetImage() and XGetSubImage()
semantics and the subwindow- mode semantics if a graphics
context is involved. Regardless of whether the window was
explicitly passed in an XGetImage() or XGetSubImage() call,
or implicitly referenced (i.e., one of the window s
ancestors was passed in the function), the front (i.e.
visible) buffer is always referenced. Thus, DBE-naive screen
dump clients will always get the front buffer. XGetImage()
and XGetSubImage() on a back buffer return undefined image
contents for any obscured regions of the back buffer that
fall within the image.</p>

<p>Drawing to a back buffer always uses the clip region
that would be used to draw to the front buffer with a GC
subwindow-mode of ClipByChildren. If an ancestor of a
double-buffered window is drawn to with a GC having a
subwindow-mode of IncludeInferiors, the effect on the
double-buffered window s back buffer depends on the depth of
the double-buffered window and the ancestor. If the depths
are the same, the contents of the back buffer of the
double-buffered window are not changed. If the depths are
dif- ferent, the contents of the back buffer of the
double-buffered window are undefined for the pixels that the
IncludeInferiors drawing touched.</p>

<p>DBE adds no new events. DBE does not extend the
semantics of any existing events with the exception of
adding a new drawable type called XdbeBackBuffer.</p>

<p>If events, replies, or errors that contain a drawable
(e.g., GraphicsExpose) are generated in response to a
request, the drawable returned will be the one specified in
the request.</p>

<p>DBE advertises which visuals support double
buffering.</p>

<p>DBE does not include any timing or synchronization
facilities. Applications that need such facilities (e.g., to
maintain a con- stant frame rate) should investigate the
Synchronization Exten- sion, an X Consortium standard.</p>

<p>Window Management Operations</p>

<p>The basic philosophy of DBE is that both buffers are
treated the same by X window management operations.</p>

<p>When a double-buffered window is destroyed, both buffers
associ- ated with the window are destroyed, and all back
buffer names associated with the window are freed.</p>

<p>If the size of a double-buffered window changes, both
buffers assume the new size. If the window s size increases,
the effect on the buffers depends on whether the
implementation honors bit gravity for buffers. If bit
gravity is implemented, then the contents of both buffers
are moved in accordance with the win- dow s bit gravity, and
the remaining areas are tiled with the window background. If
bit gravity is not implemented, then the entire unobscured
region of both buffers is tiled with the win- dow
background. In either case, Expose events are generated for
the region that is tiled with the window background.</p>

<p>If the XGetGeometry() function is executed on an
XdbeBackBuffer, the returned x, y, and border-width will be
zero.</p>

<p>If the Shape extension ShapeRectangles, ShapeMask,
ShapeCombine, or ShapeOffset request is executed on a
double-buffered window, both buffers are reshaped to match
the new window shape. The region difference D = new shape -
old shape is tiled with the window background in both
buffers, and Expose events are gener- ated for D.</p>

<p>Complex Swap Actions</p>

<p>DBE has no explicit knowledge of ancillary buffers (e.g.
depth buffers or alpha buffers), and only has a limited set
of defined swap actions. Some applications may need a richer
set of swap actions than DBE provides. Some DBE
implementations have knowl- edge of ancillary buffers,
and/or can provide a rich set of swap actions. Instead of
continually extending DBE to increase its set of swap
actions, DBE provides a flexible &quot;idiom&quot;
mechanism. If an applicationss needs are served by the
defined swap actions, it should use them; otherwise, it
should use the fol- lowing method of expressing a complex
swap action as an idiom. Following this policy will ensure
the best possible performance across a wide variety of
implementations.</p>

<p>As suggested by the term &quot;idiom,&quot; a complex
swap action should be expressed as a group/series of
requests. Taken together, this group of requests may be
combined into an atomic operation by the implementation, in
order to maximize performance. The set of idioms actually
recognized for optimization is implemen- tation dependent.
To help with idiom expression and interpreta- tion, an idiom
must be surrounded by two function calls: XdbeBe- ginIdiom()
and XdbeEndIdiom(). Unless this begin-end pair sur- rounds
the idiom, it may not be recognized by a given implemen-
tation, and performance will suffer.</p>

<p>For example, if an application wants to swap buffers for
two windows, and use X to clear only certain planes of the
back buffers, the application would make the following calls
as a group, and in the following order:</p>

<p>XdbeBeginIdiom().</p>

<p>XdbeSwapBuffers() with XIDs for two windows, each of
which uses a swap action of Untouched.</p>

<p>XFillRectangle() to the back buffer of one window.</p>

<p>XFillRectangle() to the back buffer of the other
window.</p>

<p>XdbeEndIdiom().</p>

<p>The XdbeBeginIdiom() and XdbeEndIdiom() functions do not
perform any actions themselves. They are treated as markers
by imple- mentations that can combine certain groups/series
of requests as idioms, and are ignored by other
implementations or for non-rec- ognized groups/series of
requests. If these function calls are made out of order, or
are mismatched, no errors are sent, and the functions are
executed as usual, though performance may suf- fer.</p>

<p>XdbeSwapBuffers() need not be included in an idiom. For
exam- ple, if a swap action of Copied is desired, but only
some of the planes should be copied, XCopyArea() may be used
instead of XdbeSwapBuffers(). If XdbeSwapBuffers() is
included in an idiom, it should immediately follow the
XdbeBeginIdiom() call. Also, when the XdbeSwapBuffers() is
included in an idiom, that request s swap action will still
be valid, and if the swap action might overlap with another
request, then the final result of the idiom must be as if
the separate requests were executed serially. For example,
if the specified swap action is Untouched, and if a
XFillRectangle() using a client clip rectan- gle is done to
the windows back buffer after the XdbeSwap- Buffers() call,
then the contents of the new back buffer (after the idiom)
will be the same as if the idiom was not recognized by the
implementation.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended that API providers define, and
applica- tion developers use, &quot;convenience&quot;
functions that allow client applications to call one
procedure that encapsulates common idioms. These functions
will generate the XdbeBeginIdiom(), idiom, and
XdbeEndIdiom() calls. Usage of these functions will ensure
best possible performance across a wide variety of imple-
mentations.</p>
