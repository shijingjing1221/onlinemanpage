<p>NAME kpsewhere - Expanding kpsewhich to separately
iterate over each texmf tree listed in $TEXMF.</p>

where is for which in tcsh). The intention is to provide a
way to check for conflicts/shadowed files. It will, however,
only find one file per TEXMF tree.</p>

<p>* all other options are directly handed to kpsewhich</p>
