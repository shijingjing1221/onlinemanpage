<p>sane-umax1220u(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-umax1220u(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-umax1220u - SANE backend for the UMAX Astra
1220U and similar scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-umax1220 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend for the the UMAX Astra
1220U and similar scanners.</p>

<p>For more information on this backend, please visit
http://umax1220u-sane.sourceforge.net/.</p>

<p>UMAX ASTRA 1600U/2000U/2100U SUPPORT This backend is
also able to drive the UMAX Astra 1600U/2000U/2100U. The
2100U is confirmed to work. For the other scanners no
reports have been received yet. Please contact us and tell
us if your scanner works
(sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org).</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION Usually, no manual configuration is
necessary. The configuration file for this backend resides
in /etc/sane.d/umax1220u.conf.</p>

<p>Its contents is a list of device names that correspond
to UMAX Astra scanners. Empty lines and lines starting with
a hash mark (#) are ignored. A sample configuration file is
shown below:</p>

<p>#usb vendor product usb 0x1606 0x0010 # Device list for
non-linux systems /dev/scanner /dev/usb/scanner0</p>

<p>See sane-usb(5) for information on how to set the access
permissions on the usb device files.</p>

<p>FILES The backend configuration file:
/etc/sane.d/umax1220u.conf</p>

<p>The static library implementing this backend:
/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-umax1220u.a</p>

<p>The shared library implementing this backend:
/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-umax1220u.so (present on systems
that support dynamic loading)</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_UMAX1220U If the library was
compiled with debug support enabled, this environment
variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
Smaller levels reduce verbosity:</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_UMAX1220U values</p>

<p>Number Remark</p>

<p>1 print failures 2 print information 3 print high-level
function calls 4 print high-level function checkpoints 9
print mid-level function calls 10 print mid-level function
checkpoints 80 print protocol-level function entry 90 print
protocol-level function exit</p>

<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_UMAX1220U=10</p>

<p>KNOWN BUGS 600 dpi scanning may fail for large image
sizes.</p>

<p>If you keep getting I/O errors, try cycling the power on
your scanner to reset it.</p>

<p>There is no way to cancel a scan, since the driver
ignores sane_can- cel().</p>

<p>If you try scanning an image which is too small, you
will get I/O errors. Be sure to adjust the scan area before
doing a scan, since by default, the scan area is zero.</p>

<p>REPORTING BUGS This backend isnt actively maintained.
Nevertheless, bug reports and comments should be sent to the
sane-devel mailing list. When reporting bugs, please run the
backend with SANE_DEBUG_UMAX1220U set to 10 and attach a
copy of the log messages.</p>
