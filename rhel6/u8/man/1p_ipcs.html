<p>IPCS(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual IPCS(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ipcs - report XSI interprocess communication
facilities status</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipcs [-qms][-a | -bcopt]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ipcs utility shall write information
about active interprocess com- munication facilities.</p>

<p>Without options, information shall be written in short
format for mes- sage queues, shared memory segments, and
semaphore sets that are cur- rently active in the system.
Otherwise, the information that is dis- played is controlled
by the options specified.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The ipcs facility supports the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p>The ipcs utility accepts the following options:</p>

<p>-q Write information about active message queues.</p>

<p>-m Write information about active shared memory
segments.</p>

<p>-s Write information about active semaphore sets.</p>

<p>If -q, -m, or -s are specified, only information about
those facilities shall be written. If none of these three
are specified, information about all three shall be written
subject to the following options:</p>

<p>-a Use all print options. (This is a shorthand notation
for -b, -c, -o, -p, and -t.)</p>

<p>-b Write information on maximum allowable size. (Maximum
number of bytes in messages on queue for message queues,
size of segments for shared memory, and number of semaphores
in each set for semaphores.)</p>

<p>-c Write creators user name and group name; see
below.</p>

<p>-o Write information on outstanding usage. (Number of
messages on queue and total number of bytes in messages on
queue for message queues, and number of processes attached
to shared memory seg- ments.)</p>

<p>-p Write process number information. (Process ID of the
last pro- cess to send a message and process ID of the last
process to receive a message on message queues, process ID
of the creating process, and process ID of the last process
to attach or detach on shared memory segments.)</p>

<p>-t Write time information. (Time of the last control
operation that changed the access permissions for all
facilities, time of the last msgsnd() and msgrcv()
operations on message queues, time of the last shmat() and
shmdt() operations on shared memory, and time of the last
semop() operation on semaphores.)</p>

<p>OPERANDS None.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES * The group database</p>

<p>* The user database</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of ipcs:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>TZ Determine the timezone for the date and time strings
written by ipcs. If TZ is unset or null, an unspecified
default timezone shall be used.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT An introductory line shall be written with the
format:</p>

<p>&quot;IPC status from %s as of %n&quot;, &lt;source&gt;,
&lt;date&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;source&gt; indicates the source used to gather
the statistics and &lt;date&gt; is the information that
would be produced by the date command when invoked in the
POSIX locale.</p>

<p>The ipcs utility then shall create up to three reports
depending upon the -q, -m, and -s options. The first report
shall indicate the status of message queues, the second
report shall indicate the status of shared memory segments,
and the third report shall indicate the status of semaphore
sets.</p>

<p>If the corresponding facility is not installed or has
not been used since the last reboot, then the report shall
be written out in the for- mat:</p>

<p>&quot;%s facility not in systemn&quot;,
&lt;facility&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;facility&gt; is Message Queue, Shared Memory,
or Semaphore, as appropriate. If the facility has been
installed and has been used since the last reboot, column
headings separated by one or more spaces and followed by a
&lt;newline&gt; shall be written as indicated below followed
by the facility name written out using the format:</p>

<p>&quot;%sn&quot;, &lt;facility&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;facility&gt; is Message Queues, Shared Memory,
or Semaphores, as appropriate. On the second and third
reports the column headings need not be written if the last
column headings written already provide col- umn headings
for all information in that report.</p>

<p>The column headings provided in the first column below
and the meaning of the information in those columns shall be
given in order below; the letters in parentheses indicate
the options that shall cause the corre- sponding column to
appear; &quot;all&quot; means that the column shall always
appear. Each column is separated by one or more
&lt;space&gt;s. Note that these options only determine what
information is provided for each report; they do not
determine which reports are written.</p>

<p>T (all) Type of facility:</p>

<p>q Message queue.</p>

<p>m Shared memory segment.</p>

<p>s Semaphore.</p>

<p>This field is a single character written using the
format %c .</p>

<p>ID (all) The identifier for the facility entry. This
field shall be writ- ten using the format %d .</p>

<p>KEY (all) The key used as an argument to msgget(),
semget(), or shmget() to create the facility entry.</p>

<p>Note: The key of a shared memory segment is changed to
IPC_PRIVATE when the segment has been removed until all
processes attached to the segment detach it.</p>

<p>This field shall be written using the format 0x%x.</p>

<p>MODE (all) The facility access modes and flags. The mode
shall consist of 11 characters that are interpreted as
follows.</p>

<p>The first character shall be:</p>

<p>S If a process is waiting on a msgsnd() operation.</p>

<p>- If the above is not true.</p>

<p>The second character shall be:</p>

<p>R If a process is waiting on a msgrcv() operation.</p>

<p>C or - If the associated shared memory segment is to be
cleared when the first attach operation is executed.</p>

<p>- If none of the above is true.</p>

<p>The next nine characters shall be interpreted as three
sets of three bits each. The first set refers to the owners
permissions; the next to permissions of others in the
usergroup of the facility entry; and the last to all others.
Within each set, the first character indicates per- mission
to read, the second character indicates permission to write
or alter the facility entry, and the last character is a
minus sign ( - ).</p>

<p>The permissions shall be indicated as follows:</p>

<p>r If read permission is granted.</p>

<p>w If write permission is granted.</p>

<p>a If alter permission is granted.</p>

<p>- If the indicated permission is not granted.</p>

<p>The first character following the permissions specifies
if there is an alternate or additional access control method
associated with the facility. If there is no alternate or
additional access control method associated with the
facility, a single &lt;space&gt; shall be written; other-
wise, another printable character is written.</p>
