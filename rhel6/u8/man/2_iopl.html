<p>NAME iopl - change I/O privilege level</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/io.h&gt;</p>

<p>int iopl(int level);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION iopl() changes the I/O privilege level of
the calling process, as spec- ified in level.</p>

<p>This call is necessary to allow 8514-compatible X
servers to run under Linux. Since these X servers require
access to all 65536 I/O ports, the ioperm(2) call is not
sufficient.</p>

<p>In addition to granting unrestricted I/O port access,
running at a higher I/O privilege level also allows the
process to disable inter- rupts. This will probably crash
the system, and is not recommended.</p>

<p>Permissions are inherited by fork(2) and execve(2).</p>

<p>The I/O privilege level for a normal process is 0.</p>

<p>This call is mostly for the i386 architecture. On many
other architec- tures it does not exist or will always
return an error.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL level is greater than 3.</p>

<p>ENOSYS This call is unimplemented.</p>

<p>EPERM The calling process has insufficient privilege to
call iopl(); the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability is required.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO iopl() is Linux-specific and should not be
used in processes intended to be portable.</p>

<p>NOTES Libc5 treats it as a system call and has a
prototype in &lt;unistd.h&gt;. Glibc1 does not have a
prototype. Glibc2 has a prototype both in &lt;sys/io.h&gt;
and in &lt;sys/perm.h&gt;. Avoid the latter, it is available
on i386 only.</p>
