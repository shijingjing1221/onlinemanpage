<p>FREAD(3) Linux Programmer s Manual FREAD(3)</p>

<p>NAME fread, fwrite - binary stream input/output</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE
*stream);</p>

<p>size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t
nmemb, FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The function fread() reads nmemb elements of
data, each size bytes long, from the stream pointed to by
stream, storing them at the loca- tion given by ptr.</p>

<p>The function fwrite() writes nmemb elements of data,
each size bytes long, to the stream pointed to by stream,
obtaining them from the loca- tion given by ptr.</p>

<p>For non-locking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE fread() and fwrite() return the number of
items successfully read or written (i.e., not the number of
characters). If an error occurs, or the end-of-file is
reached, the return value is a short item count (or
zero).</p>

<p>fread() does not distinguish between end-of-file and
error, and callers must use feof(3) and ferror(3) to
determine which occurred.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C89, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO read(2), write(2), feof(3), ferror(3),
