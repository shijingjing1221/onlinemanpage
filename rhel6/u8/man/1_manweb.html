<p>NAME manweb - browse netpbm (and other)
documentation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS manweb -help</p>

<p>manweb [-config=configfile] [topic [ subtopic ... ]
]</p>

<p>EXAMPLES manweb This gets a master index of
documentation. manweb netpbm This gets the main
documentation page for the Netpbm package, with hyperlinks
to the rest of the documentation. manweb netpbm pngtopam
This goes directly to the documentation page for the
Pngtopam program in the Netpbm package. manweb pngtopam This
also goes directly to the documentation page for the
Pngtopam pro- gram in the Netpbm package, if thats what
would run in response to a pngtopam shell command (your PATH
environment variable is involved). manweb 3 fopen This gets
the traditional man page for the fopen() subroutine using
man. manweb cp This gets the GNU Info manual for the cp
program, using info.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION manweb displays reference documentation via
quick shell commands. It is a replacement for the well-known
man.</p>

<p>Differences Between Man and Manweb manwebs advantages
over man are:</p>

<p>&middot; You can access documentation that is on the
worldwide web instead of having locally installed copies.
This saves installation work and gets you more current
documentation.</p>

<p>&middot; Documentation can be in HTML, which is more
widely known, more widely useful, and more expressive than
the nroff/troff format used by man.</p>

<p>&middot; manweb puts your topics in a tree for
multilevel documen- tation. man is intended for a single
level of documentation. For example, you can have a man page
for each shell command, but not for the subcommands of a
shell command. And you cannot prop- erly have man pages for
the members of multiple subroutine libraries.</p>

<p>&middot; Documentation can be hyperlinked.</p>

<p>Web servers need not be involved -- the documentation
can be in local files. Graphics need not be involved -- the
lynx browser works fine in the same kind of terminals in
which man works.</p>

<p>manweb finds the documentation you specify and calls a
web browser of your choice to display it. The documentation
manweb finds can be either an HTML file on your system, in
which case, manweb gives a file: URL to your browser, or an
explicit URL. That explicit URL might be an http: URL
referring to an HTML file on a web server somewhere, or any-
thing else your browser understands.</p>

<p>If manweb finds neither an HTML file nor a URL, but your
parameters look like they could mean something to man,
manweb calls man. There- fore, you can use a single command
to access the vast body of tradi- tional man pages, plus any
newer manweb documentation. You can make &quot;man&quot; a
shell alias of &quot;manweb&quot;.</p>

<p>manweb finds Info documentation as well. It looks for
the topic you specify as an Info topic after looking for
HTML and URL documentation and before running man. If manweb
finds a corresponding Info topic, it runs the program info
on it. Info is the documentation system that the GNU project
invented to, among other things, replace traditional Unix
man pages. However, HTML and the Worldwide Web were invented
shortly afterward, so Info fizzled. But there is still a lot
of GNU software that is documented as Info topics.</p>

<p>How Manweb Finds Documentation manweb passes a URL to a
web browser. This section tells how your man- web invocation
parameters turn into that URL.</p>

<p>manwebs search starts in the &quot;web directory&quot;
directory. Thats either the value of the webdir keyword in
your manweb configuration file, or the default
/usr/man/web.</p>

<p>Your invocation parameters form a &quot;topic
chain.&quot; Going from left to right, the first parameter
is the main topic, the 2nd is a subtopic of the main topic,
and so on.</p>

<p>Lets look at the simple case where you specify exactly
one parameter -- a main topic. Well call it maintopic and
look at 4 ways manweb might find it:</p>

<p>&middot;</p>

<p>If manweb finds a file named maintopic.html in the web
directory, the URL manweb passes to the browser is just a
file: URL that specifies that .html file.</p>

<p>&middot;</p>

<p>If theres no .html file, but there is a file named
maintopic.url, the contents of the first line of that .url
file is what manweb passes to the browser. It doesnt
interpret the contents at all. If its garbage, the browser
chokes on it.</p>

<p>&middot;</p>

<p>If there s neither a .html nor a .url file, but there is
a directory named maintopic, manweb looks in the directory
for a file named index.html. If there is one, manweb passes
a file: URL specifying that index.html file to the browser.
If there s no index.html, manweb uses a file: URL that
specifies the directory itself.</p>

<p>&middot;</p>

<p>If manweb doesnt find documentation in any of the above
ways, it searches your executable search path (as defined by
your PATH environment variable) for a program named
maintopic. If it finds one, it looks in the directory that
contains the program for a file named doc.url. If it finds
one, it appends maintopic.html to the first line of the file
and passes that to the browser. Unless the first line does
not end with a slash -- in that case, manweb passes the
first line of the file unmodified to the browser.</p>

<p>It gets a little more interesting when you have
subtopics. Looking at each of the 4 cases above:</p>

<p>&middot; Where maintopic.html exists, subtopics are
invalid. You get a warning message and the subtopics are
ignored.</p>

<p>&middot; Where theres no .html file but maintopic.url
exists, manweb appends the subtopic chain to the URL it gets
from the .url file as in the following example: .url file
con- tains http://acme.com/productxyz/ and subtopics are
create and database. The URL manweb passes to the browser is
http://acme.com/productxyz/create/database.html.</p>

<p>manweb doesnt check that this kind of appendage makes
any sense for the URL in question, except that if the URL in
the .url file doesn t end with a slash (/), manweb issues a
warning and doesnt append anything (ignores the
subtopics).</p>

<p>&middot; Where theres neither a .html file nor a .url
file, but theres a maintopic directory, manweb recurses into
that directory and begins a whole new search using the first
subtopic as the main topic and the rest of the subtopics as
subtopics of that.</p>

<p>&middot; When there are subtopics, the PATH thing doesnt
make sense, so manweb doesnt do it.</p>

<p>If you give subtopics, the PATH thing described above
for one topic doesnt apply.</p>

<p>If you give no parameters at all, manweb generates a URL
for the web directory itself as described above for
subdirectories.</p>

<p>The above is simplified by the assumption of a single
web directory. In reality, the webdir keyword in the
configuration file can specify a chain of web directories.
manweb searches each one in turn, doing all the kinds of
searches in each web directory before moving on to the next
one.</p>

<p>The Configuration File The default location of the
manweb configuration file is /etc/man- web.conf. But you can
override this with the environment variable MAN-
WEB_CONF_FILE, and override that with the -config invocation
option.</p>

<p>Lines starting with &quot;#&quot; are comments and are
ignored, as are blank lines.</p>

<p>All other lines have the format keyword=value. The
keywords defined are:</p>

<p>webdir A colon-delimited sequence of directories to
search for documentation as described above. If you don t
specify this, the default is /usr/man/web alone.</p>

<p>browser</p>

<p>The file specification manweb of the web browser manweb
is to invoke to display documentation (except when it uses
man to dis- play a conventional man page). If the file
specification does not include a slash, man- web searches
for the file in the PATH search path.</p>

<p>If you dont specify this, the default is the value of
the BROWSER environment variable, and if that is not set,
lynx.</p>
