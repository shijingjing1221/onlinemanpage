<p>REWIND(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual REWIND(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME rewind - reset the file position indicator in a
stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>void rewind(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The call:</p>

<p>rewind(stream)</p>

<p>shall be equivalent to:</p>

<p>(void) fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET)</p>

<p>except that rewind() shall also clear the error
indicator.</p>

<p>Since rewind() does not return a value, an application
wishing to detect errors should clear errno, then call
rewind(), and if errno is non-zero, assume an error has
occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The rewind() function shall not return a
value.</p>

<p>ERRORS Refer to fseek() with the exception of [EINVAL]
which does not apply.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

Std 1003.1-2001, &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>
