<p>NAME samba - A Windows SMB/CIFS fileserver for UNIX</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS samba</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Samba software suite is a collection of
programs that implements the Server Message Block (commonly
abbreviated as SMB) protocol for UNIX systems. This protocol
is sometimes also referred to as the Common Internet File
System (CIFS). For a more thorough description, see
http://www.ubiqx.org/cifs/. Samba also implements the
NetBIOS protocol in nmbd.</p>

<p>smbd(8) The smbd daemon provides the file and print
services to SMB clients, such as Windows 95/98, Windows NT,
Windows for Workgroups or LanManager. The configuration file
for this daemon is described in smb.conf(5)</p>

<p>nmbd(8) The nmbd daemon provides NetBIOS nameservice and
browsing support. The configuration file for this daemon is
described in smb.conf(5)</p>

<p>smbclient(1) The smbclient program implements a simple
ftp-like client. This is useful for accessing SMB shares on
other compatible servers (such as Windows NT), and can also
be used to allow a UNIX box to print to a printer attached
to any SMB server (such as a PC running Windows NT).</p>

<p>testparm(1) The testparm utility is a simple syntax
checker for Samba&rsquo;s smb.conf(5) configuration
file.</p>

<p>testprns(1) The testprns utility supports testing
printer names defined in your printcap file used by
Samba.</p>

<p>smbstatus(1) The smbstatus tool provides access to
information about the current connections to smbd.</p>

<p>nmblookup(1) The nmblookup tools allows NetBIOS name
queries to be made from a UNIX host.</p>

<p>smbpasswd(8) The smbpasswd command is a tool for
changing LanMan and Windows NT password hashes on Samba and
Windows NT servers.</p>

<p>smbcacls(1) The smbcacls command is a tool to set
ACL&rsquo;s on remote CIFS servers.</p>

<p>smbsh(1) The smbsh command is a program that allows you
to run a unix shell with with an overloaded VFS.</p>

<p>smbtree(1) The smbtree command is a text-based network
neighborhood tool.</p>

<p>smbtar(1) The smbtar can make backups of data on
CIFS/SMB servers.</p>

<p>smbspool(8) smbspool is a helper utility for printing on
printers connected to CIFS servers.</p>

<p>smbcontrol(1) smbcontrol is a utility that can change
the behaviour of running samba daemons.</p>

<p>rpcclient(1) rpcclient is a utility that can be used to
execute RPC commands on remote CIFS servers.</p>

<p>pdbedit(8) The pdbedit command can be used to maintain
the local user database on a samba server.</p>

<p>findsmb(1) The findsmb command can be used to find SMB
servers on the local network.</p>

<p>net(8) The net command is supposed to work similar to
the DOS/Windows NET.EXE command.</p>

<p>swat(8) swat is a web-based interface to configuring
smb.conf.</p>

<p>winbindd(8) winbindd is a daemon that is used for
integrating authentication and the user database into
unix.</p>

<p>wbinfo(1) wbinfo is a utility that retrieves and stores
information related to winbind.</p>

<p>profiles(1) profiles is a command-line utility that can
be used to replace all occurrences of a certain SID with
another SID.</p>

<p>log2pcap(1) log2pcap is a utility for generating pcap
trace files from Samba log files.</p>

<p>vfstest(1) vfstest is a utility that can be used to test
vfs modules.</p>

<p>ntlm_auth(1) ntlm_auth is a helper-utility for external
programs wanting to do NTLM-authentication.</p>

<p>smbmount(8), smbumount(8), smbmnt(8) smbmount,smbumount
and smbmnt are commands that can be used to mount CIFS/SMB
shares on Linux.</p>

<p>smbcquotas(1) smbcquotas is a tool that can set remote
QUOTA&rsquo;s on server with NTFS 5.</p>

<p>COMPONENTS The Samba suite is made up of several
components. Each component is described in a separate manual
page. It is strongly recommended that you read the
documentation that comes with Samba and the manual pages of
those components that you use. If the manual pages and
documents aren&rsquo;t clear enough then please visit
http://devel.samba.org for information on how to file a bug
report or submit a patch.</p>

<p>If you require help, visit the Samba webpage at
http://www.samba.org/ and explore the many option available
to you.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The Samba software suite is licensed under
the GNU Public License(GPL). A copy of that license should
have come with the package in the file COPYING. You are
encouraged to distribute copies of the Samba suite, but
please obey the terms of this license.</p>

<p>The latest version of the Samba suite can be obtained
via anonymous ftp from samba.org in the directory
pub/samba/. It is also available on several mirror sites
worldwide.</p>

<p>You may also find useful information about Samba on the
newsgroup comp.protocol.smb and the Samba mailing list.
Details on how to join the mailing list are given in the
README file that comes with Samba.</p>

<p>If you have access to a WWW viewer (such as Mozilla or
Konqueror) then you will also find lots of useful
information, including back issues of the Samba mailing
list, at http://lists.samba.org.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3 of the
Samba suite.</p>

<p>CONTRIBUTIONS If you wish to contribute to the Samba
project, then I suggest you join the Samba mailing list at
http://lists.samba.org.</p>

<p>If you have patches to submit, visit
http://devel.samba.org/ for information on how to do it
properly. We prefer patches in diff -u format.</p>

<p>CONTRIBUTORS Contributors to the project are now too
numerous to mention here but all deserve the thanks of all
Samba users. To see a full list, look at the change-log in
the source package for the pre-CVS changes and at
http://cvs.samba.org/ for the contributors to Samba
post-CVS. CVS is the Open Source source code control system
used by the Samba Team to develop Samba. The project would
have been unmanageable without it.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer.
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba
2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to
DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander
Bokovoy.</p>
