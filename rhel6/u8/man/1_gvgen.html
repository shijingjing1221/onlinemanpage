<p>NAME gvgen - generate graphs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gvgen [ -d? ] [ -cn ] [ -Cx,y ] [ -g[f]x,y ] [
-G[f]x,y ] [ -hn ] [ -kn ] [ -bx,y ] [ -pn ] [ -sn ] [ -Sn ]
[ -tn ] [ -Tx,y ] [ -wn ] [ -ooutfile ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gvgen generates a variety of simple,
regularly-structured abstract graphs.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>-c n Generate a cycle with n vertices and edges.</p>

<p>-C x,y Generate an x by y cylinder. This will have x*y
vertices and 2*x*y - y edges.</p>

<p>-g [f]x,y Generate an x by y grid. If f is given, the
grid is folded, with an edge attaching each pair of opposing
corner vertices. This will have x*y vertices and 2*x*y - y -
x edges if unfolded and 2*x*y - y - x + 2 edges if
folded.</p>

<p>-G [f]x,y Generate an x by y partial grid. If f is
given, the grid is folded, with an edge attaching each pair
of opposing corner ver- tices. This will have x*y
vertices.</p>

<p>-h n Generate a hypercube of degree n. This will have
2^n vertices and n*2^(n-1) edges.</p>

<p>-k n Generate a complete graph on n vertices with
n*(n-1)/2 edges.</p>

<p>-b x,y Generate a complete x by y bipartite graph. This
will have x+y vertices and x*y edges.</p>

<p>-p n Generate a path on n vertices. This will have n-1
edges.</p>

<p>-s n Generate a star on n vertices. This will have n-1
edges.</p>

<p>-S n Generate a Sierpinski graph of order n. This will
have 3*(3^(n-1) - 1)/2 vertices and 3^n edges.</p>

<p>-t n Generate a binary tree of height n. This will have
2^n-1 ver- tices and 2^n-2 edges.</p>

<p>-T x,y Generate an x by y torus. This will have x*y
vertices and 2*x*y edges.</p>

<p>-w n Generate a path on n vertices. This will have n-1
edges.</p>

<p>-o outfile If specified, the generated graph is written
into the file out- file. Otherwise, the graph is written to
standard out.</p>

<p>-d Make the generated graph directed.</p>

<p>-? Print usage information.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS gvgen exits with 0 on successful completion,
and exits with 1 if given an ill-formed or incorrect flag,
or if the specified output file could not be opened.</p>
