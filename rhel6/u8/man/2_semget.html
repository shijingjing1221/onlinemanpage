<p>NAME semget - get a semaphore set identifier</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/ipc.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/sem.h&gt;</p>

<p>int semget(key_t key, int nsems, int semflg);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The semget() system call returns the
semaphore set identifier associ- ated with the argument key.
A new set of nsems semaphores is created if key has the
value IPC_PRIVATE or if no existing semaphore set is
associated with key and IPC_CREAT is specified in
semflg.</p>

<p>If semflg specifies both IPC_CREAT and IPC_EXCL and a
semaphore set already exists for key, then semget() fails
with errno set to EEXIST. (This is analogous to the effect
of the combination O_CREAT | O_EXCL for open(2).)</p>

<p>Upon creation, the least significant 9 bits of the
argument semflg define the permissions (for owner, group and
others) for the semaphore set. These bits have the same
format, and the same meaning, as the mode argument of
open(2) (though the execute permissions are not mean- ingful
for semaphores, and write permissions mean permission to
alter semaphore values).</p>

<p>The values of the semaphores in a newly created set are
indeterminate. (POSIX.1-2001 is explicit on this point.)
Although Linux, like many other implementations, initializes
the semaphore values to 0, a portable application cannot
rely on this: it should explicitly initial- ize the
semaphores to the desired values.</p>

<p>When creating a new semaphore set, semget() initializes
the sets asso- ciated data structure, semid_ds (see
semctl(2)), as follows:</p>

<p>sem_perm.cuid and sem_perm.uid are set to the effective
user ID of the calling process.</p>

<p>sem_perm.cgid and sem_perm.gid are set to the effective
group ID of the calling process.</p>

<p>The least significant 9 bits of sem_perm.mode are set to
the least significant 9 bits of semflg.</p>

<p>sem_nsems is set to the value of nsems.</p>

<p>sem_otime is set to 0.</p>

<p>sem_ctime is set to the current time.</p>

<p>The argument nsems can be 0 (a dont care) when a
semaphore set is not being created. Otherwise nsems must be
greater than 0 and less than or equal to the maximum number
of semaphores per semaphore set (SEMMSL).</p>

<p>If the semaphore set already exists, the permissions are
verified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the return value will be the
semaphore set identifier (a non-negative integer), otherwise
-1 is returned, with errno indicating the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS On failure errno will be set to one of the
following:</p>

<p>EACCES A semaphore set exists for key, but the calling
process does not have permission to access the set, and does
not have the CAP_IPC_OWNER capability.</p>

<p>EEXIST A semaphore set exists for key and semflg
specified both IPC_CREAT and IPC_EXCL.</p>

<p>EINVAL nsems is less than 0 or greater than the limit on
the number of semaphores per semaphore set (SEMMSL), or a
semaphore set corre- sponding to key already exists, and
nsems is larger than the number of semaphores in that
set.</p>

<p>ENOENT No semaphore set exists for key and semflg did
not specify IPC_CREAT.</p>

<p>ENOMEM A semaphore set has to be created but the system
does not have enough memory for the new data structure.</p>

<p>ENOSPC A semaphore set has to be created but the system
limit for the maximum number of semaphore sets (SEMMNI), or
the system wide maximum number of semaphores (SEMMNS), would
be exceeded.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES IPC_PRIVATE isnt a flag field but a key_t type. If
this special value is used for key, the system call ignores
everything but the least sig- nificant 9 bits of semflg and
creates a new semaphore set (on success).</p>

<p>The following limits on semaphore set resources affect
the semget() call:</p>

<p>SEMMNI System wide maximum number of semaphore sets:
policy dependent (on Linux, this limit can be read and
modified via the fourth field of /proc/sys/kernel/sem).</p>

<p>SEMMSL Maximum number of semaphores per semid:
implementation dependent (on Linux, this limit can be read
and modified via the first field of
/proc/sys/kernel/sem).</p>

<p>SEMMNS System wide maximum number of semaphores: policy
dependent (on Linux, this limit can be read and modified via
the second field of /proc/sys/kernel/sem). Values greater
than SEMMSL * SEMMNI makes it irrelevant.</p>

<p>BUGS The name choice IPC_PRIVATE was perhaps
unfortunate, IPC_NEW would more clearly show its
function.</p>

<p>The semaphores in a set are not initialized by semget().
In order to initialize the semaphores, semctl(2) must be
used to perform a SETVAL or a SETALL operation on the
semaphore set. (Where multiple peers do not know who will be
the first to initialize the set, checking for a non-zero
sem_otime in the associated data structure retrieved by a
sem- ctl(2) IPC_STAT operation can be used to avoid
races.)</p>
