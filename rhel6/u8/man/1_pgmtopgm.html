<p>NAME pgmtopgm - copy PGM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pgmtopgm</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pgmtopgm simply copies a PGM image from Standard Input
to Standard Out- put. This may seem an unnecessary
duplication of cat, but remember that a PGM program can read
a PBM image as if it were PGM. So pgmtopgm can read either a
PBM or PGM image and produce a PGM image as output.</p>

<p>Even that is of limited usefulness because of the fact
that almost any program to which you would feed the
resulting PGM image could also just take the original image
directly. However, sometimes you really need a true PGM
image.</p>

<p>When you know you have a PBM image and want a PGM image,
pbmtopgm is a more general way to do that conversion.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ppmtoppm(1), pamtopam(1), pamtopnm(1),
pbmtopgm(1), pbm(1), pgm(1),</p>

<p>HISTORY This program was added to Netpbm in Release 10.9
(September 2002).</p>
