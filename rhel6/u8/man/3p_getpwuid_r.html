<p>GETPWUID(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GETPWUID(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getpwuid, getpwuid_r - search user database for a
user ID</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pwd.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct passwd *getpwuid(uid_t uid);</p>

<p>int getpwuid_r(uid_t uid, struct passwd *pwd, char
*buffer, size_t bufsize, struct passwd **result);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getpwuid() function shall search the
user database for an entry with a matching uid.</p>

<p>The getpwuid() function need not be reentrant. A
function that is not required to be reentrant is not
required to be thread-safe.</p>

<p>Applications wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to 0 before calling getpwuid(). If
getpwuid() returns a null pointer and errno is set to
non-zero, an error occurred.</p>

<p>The getpwuid_r() function shall update the passwd
structure pointed to by pwd and store a pointer to that
structure at the location pointed to by result. The
structure shall contain an entry from the user database with
a matching uid. Storage referenced by the structure is
allocated from the memory provided with the buffer
parameter, which is bufsize bytes in size. The maximum size
needed for this buffer can be deter- mined with the
{_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX} sysconf() parameter. A NULL pointer
shall be returned at the location pointed to by result on
error or if the requested entry is not found.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The getpwuid() function shall return a
pointer to a struct passwd with the structure as defined in
&lt;pwd.h&gt; with a matching entry if found. A null pointer
shall be returned if the requested entry is not found, or an
error occurs. On error, errno shall be set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>The return value may point to a static area which is
overwritten by a subsequent call to getpwent(), getpwnam(),
or getpwuid().</p>

<p>If successful, the getpwuid_r() function shall return
zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The getpwuid() and getpwuid_r() functions may
fail if:</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error has occurred.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught during getpwuid().</p>

<p>EMFILE {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in
the calling process.</p>

<p>ENFILE The maximum allowable number of files is
currently open in the system.</p>

<p>The getpwuid_r() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ERANGE Insufficient storage was supplied via buffer and
bufsize to con- tain the data to be referenced by the
resulting passwd struc- ture.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Getting an Entry for the Root User The
following example gets the user database entry for the user
with user ID 0 (root).</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;pwd.h&gt; ...
uid_t id = 0; struct passwd *pwd;</p>

<p>pwd = getpwuid(id);</p>

<p>Finding the Name for the Effective User ID The following
example defines pws as a pointer to a structure of type
passwd, which is used to store the structure pointer
returned by the call to the getpwuid() function. The
geteuid() function shall return the effective user ID of the
calling process; this is used as the search criteria for the
getpwuid() function. The call to getpwuid() shall return a
pointer to the structure containing that user ID value.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;pwd.h&gt; ... struct passwd *pws; pws =
getpwuid(geteuid());</p>

<p>Finding an Entry in the User Database The following
example uses getpwuid() to search the user database for a
user ID that was previously stored in a stat structure, then
prints out the user name if it is found. If the user is not
found, the program prints the numeric value of the user ID
for the entry.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;pwd.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; ... struct stat statbuf; struct
passwd *pwd; ... if ((pwd = getpwuid(statbuf.st_uid)) !=
NULL) printf(&quot; %-8.8s&quot;, pwd-&gt;pw_name); else
printf(&quot; %-8d&quot;, statbuf.st_uid);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Three names associated with the
current process can be determined: get- pwuid( geteuid())
returns the name associated with the effective user ID of
the process; getlogin() returns the name associated with the
cur- rent login activity; and getpwuid( getuid()) returns
the name associ- ated with the real user ID of the
process.</p>

<p>The getpwuid_r() function is thread-safe and returns
values in a user- supplied buffer instead of possibly using
a static data area that may be overwritten by each call.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
