<p>NAME nfsmount.conf - Configuration file for NFS
mounts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Configuration file for NFS mounts that allows
options to be set glob- ally, per server or per mount
point.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The configuration file is made up of
multiple sections followed by variables associated with that
section. A section is defined by a string enclosed by [ and
] branches. Variables are assignment state- ments that
assign values to particular variables using the = operator,
as in Proto=Tcp. Sections are broken up into three basic
categories: Global options, Server options and Mount Point
options.</p>

<p>[ NFSMount_Global_Options ] - This statically named
section defines all of the global mount options that can be
applied to every NFS mount.</p>

<p>[ Server Server_Name] - This section defines all the
mount options that should be used on mounts to a particular
NFS server. The Server_Name_ strings needs to be surrounded
by and be an exact match of the server name used in the
mount command.</p>

<p>[ MountPointMount_Point] - This section defines all the
mount options that should be used on a particular mount
point. The Mount_Point_string needs to be surrounded by and
be an exact match of the mount point used in the mount
command.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES These are some example lines of how sections
and variables are defined in the configuration file.</p>

<p>[ NFSMount_Global_Options ] Proto=Tcp</p>

<p>The TCP protocol will be used on every NFS mount.</p>

<p>[ Server nfsserver.foo.com ] rsize=32k wsize=32k</p>

<p>A 33k (32768 bytes) block size will be used as the read
and write size on all mounts to the nfsserver.foo.com
server.</p>

<p>[ MountPoint /export/home ] Background=True</p>

<p>All mounts to the /export/home export will be performed
in the background (i.e. done asynchronously).</p>

<p>FILES /etc/nfsmount.conf Default NFS mount configuration
file</p>
