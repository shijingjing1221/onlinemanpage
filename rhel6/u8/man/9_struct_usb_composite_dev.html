<p>STRUCT USB_COMPOSITE(9) Kernel Mode Gadget API STRUCT
USB_COMPOSITE(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_usb_composite_dev - represents one composite
usb gadget</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct usb_composite_dev { struct usb_gadget *
gadget; struct usb_request * req; unsigned bufsiz; struct
usb_configuration * config; };</p>

<p>MEMBERS gadget read-only, abstracts the gadget&acute;s
usb peripheral controller</p>

<p>req used for control responses; buffer is
pre-allocated</p>

<p>bufsiz size of buffer pre-allocated in req</p>

<p>config the currently active configuration</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION One of these devices is allocated and
initialized before the associated device driver&acute;s bind
is called.</p>

<p>OPEN ISSUE it appears that some WUSB devices will need
to be built by combining a normal (wired) gadget with a
wireless one. This revision of the gadget framework should
probably try to make sure doing that won&acute;t hurt too
much.</p>

<p>ONE NOTION FOR HOW TO HANDLE WIRELESS USB DEVICES
INVOLVES (a) a second gadget here, discovery mechanism TBD,
but likely needing separate register/unregister WUSB gadget
calls; (b) updates to usb_gadget to include flags is it
wireless, is it wired , plus (presumably in a wrapper
structure) bandgroup and PHY info; (c) presumably a
wireless_ep wrapping a usb_ep, and reporting
wireless-specific parameters like maxburst and maxsequence;
(d) configurations that are specific to wireless links; (e)
function drivers that understand wireless configs and will
support wireless for (additional) function instances; (f) a
function to support association setup (like CBAF), not
necessarily requiring a wireless adapter; (g) composite
device setup that can create one or more wireless configs,
including appropriate association setup support; (h) more,
TBD.</p>
