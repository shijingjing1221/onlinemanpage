<p>FUNCTION::CTIME(3stap) Time utility functions
FUNCTION::CTIME(3stap)</p>

<p>NAME function::ctime - Convert seconds since epoch into
human readable date/time string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ctime:string(epochsecs:long)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS epochsecs Number of seconds since epoch (as
returned by gettimeofday_s)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Takes an argument of seconds since the epoch
as returned by gettimeofday_s. Returns a string of the
form</p>

<p>Wed Jun 30 21:49:08 1993</p>

<p>The string will always be exactly 24 characters. If the
time would be unreasonable far in the past (before what can
be represented with a 32 bit offset in seconds from the
epoch) an error will occur (which can be avoided with
try/catch). If the time would be unreasonable far in the
future, an error will also occur.</p>

<p>Note that the epoch (zero) corresponds to</p>

<p>Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 1970</p>

<p>The earliest full date given by ctime, corresponding to
epochsecs -2147483648 is Fri Dec 13 20:45:52 1901. The
latest full date given by ctime, corresponding to epochsecs
2147483647 is Tue Jan 19 03:14:07 2038.</p>

<p>The abbreviations for the days of the week are Sun, Mon
, Tue, Wed , Thu, Fri, and Sat. The abbreviations for the
months are Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct,
Nov, and Dec.</p>

<p>Note that the real C library ctime function puts a
newline (&acute;0&acute;) character at the end of the string
that this function does not. Also note that since the kernel
has no concept of timezones, the returned time is always in
GMT.</p>
