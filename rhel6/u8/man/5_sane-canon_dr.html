<p>sane-canon_dr(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-canon_dr(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-canon_dr - SANE backend for Canon DR-series
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-canon_dr library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend which provides access to
some Canon DR-series scanners.</p>

<p>This document describes backend version 35, which
shipped with SANE 1.0.21.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE This version has only been tested
with a few scanner models. Please see
http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html for
the most recent list.</p>

<p>This backend may support other Canon scanners. The best
way to deter- mine level of support is to test the scanner
directly, or to collect a trace of the windows driver in
action. Please contact the author for help or with test
results.</p>

<p>In general, the larger machines (DR-4000 and up) which
have been tested use a fairly complete protocol, with
hardware support for many modes, resolutions and features.
The smaller machines have many limitations, like missing
horizontal resolutions, missing binary mode, always scan-
ning full-width, etc. There is code in the backend to
address these problems, but there seems to be no way to
detect if they are required, so they must be hard-coded.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Effort has been made to expose most hardware
options, including:</p>

<p>source s Selects the source for the scan. Options may
include &quot;Flatbed&quot;, &quot;ADF Front&quot;,
&quot;ADF Back&quot;, &quot;ADF Duplex&quot;.</p>

<p>mode m Selects the mode for the scan. Options may
include &quot;Lineart&quot;, &quot;Halftone&quot;,
&quot;Gray&quot;, and &quot;Color&quot;.</p>

<p>resolution Controls scan resolution.</p>

<p>tl-x, tl-y, br-x, br-y Sets scan area upper left and
lower right coordinates. These are renamed t, l, x, y by
some frontends.</p>

<p>page-width, page-height Sets paper size. Used by scanner
to determine centering of scan coordinates when using ADF
and to detect double feed errors.</p>

<p>Other options will be available based on the
capabilities of the scan- ner: enhancement, compression,
buttons and sensors, etc.</p>

<p>Additionally, several software options are exposed by
the backend. These are reimplementations of features
provided natively by larger scanners, but running on the
host computer. This enables smaller machines to have similar
capabilites. Please note that these features are somewhat
simplistic, and may not perform as well as the native
implementations. Note also that these features all require
that the driver cache the entire image in memory. This will
almost certainly result in a reduction of scanning
speed.</p>

<p>swcrop Requests the driver to detect the extremities of
the paper within the larger image, and crop the empty
edges.</p>

<p>swdeskew Requests the driver to detect the rotation of
the paper within the larger image, and counter the
rotation.</p>

<p>swdespeck X Requests the driver to find and remove dots
of X diameter or smaller from the image, and fill the space
with the average sur- rounding color.</p>

<p>Use scanimage --help to get a list, but be aware that
some options may be settable only when another option has
been set, and that advanced options may be hidden by some
frontend programs.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
&quot;canon_dr.conf&quot; is used to tell the backend how to
look for scanners, and provide options controlling the
operation of the backend. This file is read each time the
frontend asks the backend for a list of scanners, generally
only when the frontend starts. If the configuration file is
missing, the backend will fail to run.</p>

<p>Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in 4
ways:</p>

<p>&quot;scsi CANON DR&quot; Requests backend to search all
scsi busses in the system for a device which reports itself
to be a scanner made by CANON, with a model name starting
with DR.</p>

<p>&quot;scsi /dev/sg0&quot; (or other scsi device file)
Requests backend to open the named scsi device. Only useful
if you have multiple compatible scanners connected to your
system, and need to specify one. Probably should not be used
with the other &quot;scsi&quot; line above.</p>

<p>&quot;usb 0x04a9 0x1603&quot; (or other vendor/product
ids) Requests backend to search all usb busses in the system
for a device which uses that vendor and product id. The
device will then be queried to determine if it is a Canon
scanner.</p>

<p>&quot;usb /dev/usb/scanner0&quot; (or other device file)
Some systems use a kernel driver to access usb scanners.
This method is untested.</p>

<p>Besides the scsi and usb lines, the configuration file
supports the following option lines:</p>

<p>&quot;option buffer-size [number of bytes]&quot; Set the
number of bytes in the data buffer to something other than
the compiled-in default of 4MB. Large values may cause
timeouts or hangs, small values may cause slow scans.</p>

<p>Note: The backend does not place an upper bound on this
value, as some users required it to be quite large. Values
above the default are not recommended, and may crash your OS
or lockup your scsi card driver. You have been warned.</p>

<p>&quot;option vendor-name [string of text]&quot;
&quot;option model-name [string of text]&quot; &quot;option
version-name [string of text]&quot; These options can be
used collectively to override the values provided by the
scanner, or to provide the values when the scan- ner
cannot.</p>

<p>&quot;option padded-read [0|1]&quot; Some scanners
prepend all data transmitted to host with 12 bytes. Enable
this option if the scanner fails to respond to commands.</p>

<p>Note: option lines may appear multiple times in the
configuration file. They only apply to scanners discovered
by the next scsi/usb line.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The backend uses a single environment
variable, SANE_DEBUG_CANON_DR, which enables debugging
output to stderr. Valid values are:</p>

<p>5 Errors 10 Function trace 15 Function detail 20 Option
commands 25 SCSI/USB trace 30 SCSI/USB detail 35 Useless
noise</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES This backend was entirely reverse
engineered from usb traces of the proprietary driver.
Various advanced features of the machines may not be
enabled. Many machines have not been tested. Their protocol
is unknown.</p>
