<p>NAME XIBarrierReleasePointer, XIBarrierReleasePointers -
allow pointer movement across a pointer barrier</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput2.h&gt;</p>

<p>int XIBarrierReleasePointer( Display *display, int
deviceid, PointerBarrier barrier, BarrierEventID
eventid);</p>

<p>int XIBarrierReleasePointers( Display *display,
XIBarrierReleasePointerInfo *barriers, int
num_barriers);</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>deviceid Specifies the device allowed to move across the
barrier.</p>

<p>barrier Specifies the barrier.</p>

<p>eventid Specifies the unique event ID for this barrier
event sequence.</p>

<p>barriers List of deviceid, barrier, eventid
triplets.</p>

<p>num_barriers Number of elements in barriers.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If a pointer is constrained by a pointer
barrier, release the pointer from the barrier and allow it
to cross the barrier with the next motion. If the pointer
moves away from the barrier, this request does nothing.</p>

<p>This request only releases the pointer for the given
barrier event sequence. If the pointer moves away from or
through the barrier, a XI_BarrierLeave event is generated.
Future pointer movement constrained by this barrier will
assign a new eventid and require a new
XIBarrierReleasePointer request.</p>

<p>If the pointer is not currently blocked by the barrier
or the barrier event sequence has ended, this request does
nothing.</p>

<p>XIBarrierReleasePointer and XIBarrierReleasePointers can
generate a BadDevice or BadValue error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid device was specified.
The device does not exist or is not a master pointer
device.</p>

<p>BadValue A value for a PointerBarrier argument does not
name a defined pointer barrier.</p>
