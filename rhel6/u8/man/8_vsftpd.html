<p>NAME vsftpd - Very Secure FTP Daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vsftpd [configuration file and / or
options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vsftpd is the Very Secure File Transfer
Protocol Daemon. The server can be launched via a
super-server such as inetd(8) or xinetd(8). Alterna- tively,
vsftpd can be launched in standalone mode, in which case
vsftpd itself will listen on the network. This latter mode
is easier to use, and recommended. It is activated by
setting listen=YES in /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf. Direct
execution of the vsftpd binary will then launch the FTP
service ready for immediate client connections.</p>

<p>OPTIONS An optional configuration file or files may be
given on the command line. These files must be owned as root
if running as root. Any command line option not starting
with a &quot;-&quot; character is treated as a config file
that will be loaded. Note that config files are loaded in
the strict order that they are encountered on the command
line. If no config files are specified, the default
configuration file of /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf will be
loaded, after all other command line options are
processed.</p>

<p>Supported options are:</p>

<p>-v Print the version information and exit, even if other
options are encountered.</p>

<p>-ooption=value Set a single option, value pair as per
the format in the config file. Multiple -o options are
supported, and they are applied in strict order relative to
their appearance on the command line, including
intermingling with loading of config files.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES vsftpd -olisten=NO /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
-oftpd_banner=blah</p>

<p>That example overrides vsftpd s built-in default for the
&quot;listen&quot; option to be NO, but then loads
/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf which may override that setting.
Finally, the &quot;ftpd_banner&quot; setting is set to
&quot;blah&quot;, which over- rides any default vsftpd
setting and any identical setting that was in the config
file.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf</p>
