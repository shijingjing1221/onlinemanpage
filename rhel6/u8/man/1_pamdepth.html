<p>NAME pamdepth - change the maxval in a Netpbm image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamdepth newmaxval [netpbmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamdepth reads a Netpbm image as input, scales all the
pixel values, and writes out the image with the new maxval.
Scaling the colors down to a smaller maxval will result in
some loss of information.</p>

<p>This program works on multi-image streams.</p>

<p>Be careful of off-by-one errors when choosing the new
maxval. For instance, if you want the color values to be
five bits wide, use a max- val of 31, not 32.</p>

<p>One important use of pamdepth is to convert a new format
2-byte-per- sample PNM file to the older 1-byte-per-sample
format. Before April 2000, essentially all raw (binary)
format PNM files had a maxval less than 256 and one byte per
sample, and many programs may rely on that. If you specify a
newmaxval less than 256, the resulting file should be
readable by any program that worked with PNM files before
April 2000.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamdepth was new in Netpbm 10.32 (February
2006). It replaced pnmdepth, by Jef Poskanzer. pamdepth is
backward compatible with pnmdepth and adds the ability to
process arbitrary PAM images and the ability to process
multi-image input streams. pnmdepth handled only PNM images
and ignored all but the the first in any stream.</p>
