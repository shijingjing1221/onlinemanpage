<p>NAME wavelan - AT&amp;T GIS WaveLAN ISA device
driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS insmod wavelan_cs.o [io=B,B..] [ irq=I,I..]
[name=N,N..]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION wavelan is the low-level device driver for
the NCR / AT&amp;T / Lucent WaveLAN ISA and Digital (DEC)
RoamAbout DS wireless ethernet adapter. This driver is
available as a module or might be compiled in the ker- nel.
This driver supports multiple cards in both forms (up to 4)
and allocates the next available ethernet device
(eth0..eth#) for each card found, unless a device name is
explicitly specified (see below). This device name will be
reported in the kernel log file with the MAC address, NWID
and frequency used by the card.</p>

<p>Parameters This section apply to the module form
(parameters passed on the ins- mod(8) command line). If the
driver is included in the kernel, use the ether=IRQ,IO,NAME
syntax on the kernel command line.</p>

<p>io Specify the list of base address where to search for
wavelan cards (setting by dip switch on the card). If you
dont specify any io address, the driver will scan 0x390 and
0x3E0 addresses, which might conflict with other
hardware...</p>

<p>irq Set the list of irq that each wavelan card should
use (the value is saved in permanent storage for future
use).</p>

<p>name Set the list of name to be used for each wavelan
cards device (name used by ifconfig(8)).</p>

<p>Wireless Extensions Use iwconfig(8) to manipulate
wireless extensions.</p>

<p>NWID (or domain) Set the network ID [0 to FFFF] or
disable it [off]. As the NWID is stored in the card
Permanent Storage Area, it will be reuse at any fur- ther
invocation of the driver.</p>

<p>Frequency &amp; channels For the 2.4GHz 2.00 Hardware,
you are able to set the frequency by specifying one of the
10 defined channels (2.412, 2.422, 2.425, 2.4305, 2.432,
2.442, 2.452, 2.460, 2.462 or 2.484) or directly by its
value. The frequency is changed immediately and permanently.
Frequency avail- ability depends on the regulations...</p>

<p>Statistics spy Set a list of MAC addresses in the driver
(up to 8) and get the last quality of link for each of those
(see iwspy(8)).</p>

<p>/proc/net/wireless status is the status reported by the
modem. Link quality reports the quality of the modulation on
the air (direct sequence spread spectrum) [max = 16]. Level
and Noise refer to the signal level and noise level [max =
64]. The crypt discarded packet and misc discarded packet
coun- ters are not implemented.</p>

<p>Private Ioctl You may use iwpriv(8) to manipulate
private ioctls.</p>

<p>Quality and Level threshold Enable you the define the
quality and level threshold used by the modem (packet below
that level are discarded).</p>

<p>Histogram This functionality allow to set a number of
signal level intervals and to count the number of packets
received in each of those defined inter- vals. This
distribution might be used to calculate the mean value and
standard deviation of the signal level.</p>

<p>Specific Notes This driver will fail to detect some
non-NCR/ATT&amp;T/Lucent Wavelan cards. If this happens for
you, you must look in the source code on how to add your
card to the detection routine.</p>

<p>Some of the mentioned features are optional. You may
enable to disable them by changing flags in the driver
header and recompile.</p>
