<p>GKEYTOOL(1) GNU GKEYTOOL(1)</p>

<p>NAME gkeytool - Manage private keys and public
certificates</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS keytool [COMMAND] ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Cryptographic credentials, in a Java
environment, are usually stored in a Key Store. The Java SDK
specifies a Key Store as a persistent container of two types
of objects: Key Entries and Trusted Certificates. The
security tool keytool is a Java-based application for
managing those types of objects.</p>

<p>A Key Entry represents the private key part of a
key-pair used in Public-Key Cryptography, and a signed X.509
certificate which authenticates the public key part for a
known entity; i.e. the owner of the key-pair. The X.509
certificate itself contains the public key part of the
key-pair.</p>

<p>A Trusted Certificate is a signed X.509 certificate
issued by a trusted entity. The Trust in this context is
relative to the User of the keytool. In other words, the
existence of a Trusted Certificate in the Key Store
processed by a keytool command implies that the User trusts
the Issuer of that Trusted Certificate to also sign, and
hence authenticates, other Subjects the tool may
process.</p>

<p>Trusted Certificates are important because they allow
the tool to mechanically construct Chains of Trust starting
from one of the Trusted Certificates in a Key Store and
ending with a certificate whose Issuer is potentially
unknown. A valid chain is an ordered list, starting with a
Trusted Certificate (also called the anchor), ending with
the target certificate, and satisfying the condition that
the Subject of certificate &quot;#i&quot; is the Issuer of
certificate &quot;#i + 1&quot;.</p>

<p>The keytool is invoked from the command line as
follows:</p>

<p>keytool [COMMAND] ...</p>

<p>Multiple COMMANDs may be specified at once, each
complete with its own options. keytool will parse all the
arguments, before processing, and executing, each
&quot;COMMAND&quot;. If an exception occurs while executing
one COMMAND keytool will abort. Note however that because
the implementation of the tool uses code to parse command
line options that also supports GNU-style options, you have
to separate each command group with a double-hyphen; e.g</p>

<p>keytool -list -- -printcert -alias mykey</p>

<p>OPTIONS - Add/Update commands -genkey [OPTION]...

<p>Common options</p>

<p>The following OPTIONs are used in more than one COMMAND.
They are described here to reduce redundancy.</p>

<p>-alias Alias Every entry, be it a Key Entry or a Trusted
Certificate, in a key store is uniquely identified by a
user-defined Alias string. Use this option to specify the
Alias to use when referring to an entry in the key store.
Unless specified otherwise, a default value of
&quot;mykey&quot; shall be used when this option is omitted
from the command line.</p>

<p>-keyalg ALGORITHM Use this option to specify the
canonical name of the key-pair generation algorithm. The
default value for this option is &quot;DSS&quot; (a synonym
for the Digital Signature Algorithm also known as DSA).</p>

<p>-keysize SIZE Use this option to specify the number of
bits of the shared modulus (for both the public and private
keys) to use when generating new keys. A default value of
1024 will be used if this option is omitted from the command
line.</p>

<p>-validity DAY_COUNT Use this option to specify the
number of days a newly generated certificate will be valid
for. The default value is 90 (days) if this option is
omitted from the command line.</p>

<p>-storetype STORE_TYPE Use this option to specify the
type of the key store to use. The default value, if this
option is omitted, is that of the property
&quot;keystore.type&quot; in the security properties file,
which is obtained by invoking the static method call
&quot;getDefaultType()&quot; in
&quot;java.security.KeyStore&quot;.</p>

<p>-storepass PASSWORD Use this option to specify the
password protecting the key store. If this option is omitted
from the command line, you will be prompted to provide a
password.</p>

<p>-keystore URL Use this option to specify the location of
the key store to use. The default value is a file URL
referencing the file named .keystore located in the path
returned by the call to
&quot;java.lang.System#getProperty(String)&quot; using
&quot;user.home&quot; as argument.</p>

<p>If a URL was specified, but was found to be malformed
--e.g. missing protocol element-- the tool will attempt to
use the URL value as a file-name (with absolute or relative
path-name) of a key store --as if the protocol was
&quot;file:&quot;.</p>

<p>-provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME A fully qualified class
name of a Security Provider to add to the current list of
Security Providers already installed in the JVM in- use. If
a provider class is specified with this option, and was
successfully added to the runtime --i.e. it was not already
installed-- then the tool will attempt to removed this
Security Provider before exiting.</p>

<p>-file FILE Use this option to designate a file to use
with a command. When specified with this option, the value
is expected to be the fully qualified path of a file
accessible by the File System. Depending on the command, the
file may be used as input or as output. When this option is
omitted from the command line, &quot;STDIN&quot; will be
used instead, as the source of input, and &quot;STDOUT&quot;
will be used instead as the output destination.</p>

<p>-v Unless specified otherwise, use this option to enable
more verbose output.</p>

<p>Add/Update commands</p>

<p>The -genkey command</p>

<p>Use this command to generate a new key-pair (both
private and public keys), and save these credentials in the
key store as a Key Entry, associated with the designated (if
was specified with the -alias option) or default (if the
-alias option is omitted) Alias.</p>

<p>The private key material will be protected with a
user-defined password (see -keypass option). The public key
on the other hand will be part of a self-signed X.509
certificate, which will form a 1-element chain and will be
saved in the key store.</p>

<p>-alias ALIAS See Common Options for more details.</p>

<p>-keyalg ALGORITHM See Common Options for more
details.</p>

<p>-keysize KEY_SIZE See Common Options for more
details.</p>

<p>-sigalg ALGORITHM The canonical name of the digital
signature algorithm to use for signing certificates. If this
option is omitted, a default value will be chosen based on
the type of the key-pair; i.e., the algorithm that ends up
being used by the -keyalg option. If the key-pair generation
algorithm is &quot;DSA&quot;, the value for the signature
algorithm will be &quot;SHA1withDSA&quot;. If on the other
hand the key-pair generation algorithm is &quot;RSA&quot;,
then the tool will use &quot;MD5withRSA&quot; as the
signature algorithm.</p>

<p>-dname NAME This a mandatory value for the command. If
no value is specified --i.e. the -dname option is omitted--
the tool will prompt you to enter a Distinguished Name to
use as both the Owner and Issuer of the generated
self-signed certificate.</p>

<p>See Common Options for more details.</p>

<p>-keypass PASSWORD Use this option to specify the
password which the tool will use to protect the newly
created Key Entry.</p>

<p>If this option is omitted, you will be prompted to
provide a password.</p>

<p>-validity DAY_COUNT See Common Options for more
details.</p>

<p>-storetype STORE_TYPE See Common Options for more
details.</p>

<p>-keystore URL See Common Options for more details.</p>

<p>-storepass PASSWORD See Common Options for more
details.</p>

<p>-provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME See Common Options for
more details.</p>

<p>-v See Common Options for more details.</p>

<p>The -import command</p>

<p>Use this command to read an X.509 certificate, or a
PKCS#7 Certificate Reply from a designated input source and
incorporate the certificates into the key store.</p>

<p>If the Alias does not already exist in the key store,
the tool treats the certificate read from the input source
as a new Trusted Certificate. It then attempts to discover a
chain-of-trust, starting from that certificate and ending at
another Trusted Certificate, already stored in the key
store. If the -trustcacerts option is present, an additional
key store, of type &quot;JKS&quot; named cacerts, and
assumed to be present in ${JAVA_HOME}/lib/security will also
be consulted if found --&quot;${JAVA_HOME}&quot; refers to
the location of an installed Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
If no chain-of-trust can be established, and unless the
&quot;-noprompt&quot; option has been specified, the
certificate is printed to &quot;STDOUT&quot; and the user is
prompted for a confirmation.</p>

<p>If Alias exists in the key store, the tool will treat
the certificate(s) read from the input source as a
Certificate Reply, which can be a chain of certificates,
that eventually would replace the chain of certificates
associated with the Key Entry of that Alias. The
substitution of the certificates only occurs if a
chain-of-trust can be established between the bottom
certificate of the chain read from the input file and the
Trusted Certificates already present in the key store.
Again, if the -trustcacerts option is specified, additional
Trusted Certificates in the same cacerts key store will be
considered. If no chain-of-trust can be established, the
operation will abort.</p>

<p>-alias ALIAS See Common Options for more details.</p>

<p>-file FILE See Common Options for more details.</p>

<p>-keypass PASSWORD Use this option to specify the
password which the tool will use to protect the Key Entry
associated with the designated Alias, when replacing this
Alias chain of certificates with that found in the
certificate reply.</p>

<p>If this option is omitted, and the chain-of-trust for
the certificate reply has been established, the tool will
first attempt to unlock the Key Entry using the same
password protecting the key store. If this fails, you will
then be prompted to provide a password.</p>

<p>-noprompt Use this option to prevent the tool from
prompting the user.</p>

<p>-trustcacerts Use this option to indicate to the tool
that a key store, of type &quot;JKS&quot;, named cacerts,
and usually located in lib/security in an installed Java
Runtime Environment should be considered when trying to
establish chain-of-trusts.</p>

<p>-storetype STORE_TYPE See Common Options for more

<p>-storepass PASSWORD See Common Options for more
details.</p>

<p>-provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME See Common Options for
more details.</p>

<p>-v See Common Options for more details.</p>

<p>The -selfcert command</p>

<p>Use this command to generate a self-signed X.509 version
1 certificate. The newly generated certificate will form a
chain of one element which will replace the previous chain
associated with the designated Alias (if -alias option was
specified), or the default Alias (if -alias option was
omitted).</p>

<p>-alias ALIAS See Common Options for more details.</p>

<p>-sigalg ALGORITHM The canonical name of the digital
signature algorithm to use for signing the certificate. If
this option is omitted, a default value will be chosen based
on the type of the private key associated with the
designated Alias. If the private key is a &quot;DSA&quot;
one, the value for the signature algorithm will be
&quot;SHA1withDSA&quot;. If on the other hand the private
key is an &quot;RSA&quot; one, then the tool will use
&quot;MD5withRSA&quot; as the signature algorithm.</p>

<p>-dname NAME Use this option to specify the Distinguished
Name of the newly generated self-signed certificate. If this
option is omitted, the existing Distinguished Name of the
base certificate in the chain associated with the designated
Alias will be used instead.</p>

<p>See Common Options for more details.</p>

<p>-validity DAY_COUNT See Common Options for more
details.</p>

<p>-keypass PASSWORD Use this option to specify the
password which the tool will use to unlock the Key Entry
associated with the designated Alias.</p>

<p>If this option is omitted, the tool will first attempt
to unlock the Key Entry using the same password protecting
the key store. If this fails, you will then be prompted to
provide a password.</p>

<p>-storepass PASSWORD See Common Options for more
details.</p>

<p>-provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME See Common Options for
more details.</p>

<p>-v See Common Options for more details.</p>

<p>The -cacert command</p>

<p>Use this command to import, a CA certificate and add it
to the key store as a Trusted Certificate. The Alias for
this new entry will be constructed from the FILE s base-name
after replacing hyphens and dots with underscores.</p>

<p>This command is useful when used in a script that
recursively visits a directory of CA certificates to
populate a &quot;cacerts.gkr&quot; Key Store of trusted
certificates which can then be used commands that specify
the -trustcacerts option.</p>

<p>-v See Common Options for more details.</p>

<p>Export commands</p>

<p>The -certreq command</p>

<p>Use this command to generate a PKCS#10 Certificate
Signing Request (CSR) and write it to a designated output
destination. The contents of the destination should look
something like the following:</p>

<p>-----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
MI...QAwXzEUMBIGA1UEAwwLcnNuQGdudS5vcmcxGzAZBgNVBAoMElUg
Q2...A0GA1UEBwwGU3lkbmV5MQwwCgYDVQQIDANOU1cxCzAJBgNVBACC ...
FC...IVwNVOfQLRX+O5kAhQ/a4RTZme2L8PnpvgRwrf7Eg8D6w==
-----END NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Some documentation (e.g. RSA examples) claims
that the &quot;Attributes&quot; field, in the CSR is
&quot;OPTIONAL&quot; while RFC-2986 implies the opposite.
This implementation considers this field, by default, as
&quot;OPTIONAL&quot;, unless the option -attributes is
specified on the command line.</p>

<p>-alias ALIAS See Common Options for more details.</p>

<p>-sigalg ALGORITHM The canonical name of the digital
signature algorithm to use for signing the certificate. If
this option is omitted, a default value will be chosen based
on the type of the private key associated with the
designated Alias. If the private key is a &quot;DSA&quot;
one, the value for the signature algorithm will be
&quot;SHA1withDSA&quot;. If on the other hand the private
key is an &quot;RSA&quot; one, then the tool will use
&quot;MD5withRSA&quot; as the signature algorithm.</p>

<p>-file FILE See Common Options for more details.</p>

<p>-keypass PASSWORD Use this option to specify the
password which the tool will use to unlock the Key Entry
associated with the designated Alias.</p>

<p>If this option is omitted, the tool will first attempt
to unlock the Key Entry using the same password protecting
the key store. If this fails, you will then be prompted to
provide a password.</p>

<p>-storetype STORE_TYPE See Common Options for more
details.</p>

<p>-keystore URL See Common Options for more details.</p>

<p>-storepass PASSWORD See Common Options for more
details.</p>

<p>-provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME See Common Options for
more details.</p>

<p>-v See Common Options for more details.</p>

<p>-attributes Use this option to force the tool to encode
a &quot;NULL&quot; DER value in the CSR as the value of the
&quot;Attributes&quot; field.</p>

<p>The -export command</p>

<p>Use this command to export a certificate stored in a key
store to a designated output destination, either in binary
format (if the -v option is specified), or in RFC-1421
compliant encoding (if the -rfc option is specified
instead).</p>

<p>-alias ALIAS See Common Options for more details.</p>

details.</p>

<p>-provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME See Common Options for
more details.</p>

<p>-rfc Use RFC-1421 specifications when encoding the
output.</p>

<p>-v Output the certificate in binary DER encoding. This
is the default output format of the command if neither -rfc
nor &quot;-v&quot; options were detected on the command
line. If both this option and the -rfc option are detected
on the command line, the tool will opt for the RFC-1421
style encoding.</p>

<p>Display commands</p>

<p>The -list command</p>

<p>Use this command to print one or all of a key store
entries to &quot;STDOUT&quot;. Usually this command will
only print a fingerprint of the certificate, unless either
the -rfc or the -v option is specified.</p>

<p>-alias ALIAS If this option is omitted, the tool will
print ALL the entries found in the key store.</p>

<p>-provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME See Common Options for
more details.</p>

<p>-rfc Use RFC-1421 specifications when encoding the
output.</p>

<p>-v Output the certificate in human-readable format. If
both this option and the -rfc option are detected on the
command line, the tool will opt for the human-readable form
and will not abort the command.</p>

<p>The -printcert command</p>

<p>Use this command to read a certificate from a designated
input source and print it to &quot;STDOUT&quot; in a
human-readable form.</p>
