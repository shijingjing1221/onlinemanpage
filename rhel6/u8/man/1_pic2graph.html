<p>PIC2GRAPH(1) PIC2GRAPH(1)</p>

<p>NAME pic2graph - convert a PIC diagram into a cropped
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pic2graph [ -unsafe ] [ -format fmt ] [ -eqn
delim ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Reads a PIC program as input; produces an
image file (by default in Portable Network Graphics format)
suitable for the Web as output. Also translates eqn(1)
constructs, so it can be used for generating images of
mathematical formulae.</p>

<p>PIC is a rather expressive graphics minilanguage
suitable for producing box-and-arrow diagrams of the kind
frequently used in technical papers and textbooks. The
language is sufficiently flexible to be quite use- ful for
state charts, Petri-net diagrams, flow charts, simple
circuit schematics, jumper layouts, and other kinds of
illustration involving repetitive uses of simple geometric
forms and splines. Because PIC descriptions are procedural
and object-based, they are both compact and easy to
modify.</p>

<p>The PIC language is fully documented in &quot;Making
Pictures With GNU PIC&quot;, a document which is part of the
groff(1) distribution.</p>

<p>Your input PIC code should not be wrapped with the .PS
and .PE macros that normally guard it within groff(1)
macros.</p>

<p>The output image will be a black-on-white graphic
clipped to the small- est possible bounding box that
contains all the black pixels. By spec- ifying command-line
options to be passed to convert(1) you can give it a border,
set the background transparent, set the images pixel den-
sity, or perform other useful transformations.</p>

<p>This program uses pic(1), eqn(1), groff(1), gs(1), and
the ImageMagick convert(1) program. These programs must be
installed on your system and accessible on your $PATH for
pic2graph to work.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -unsafe Run pic(1) and groff(1) in the unsafe
mode enabling the PIC macro sh to execute arbitrary
commands. The default is to for- bid this.</p>

<p>-format fmt Specify an output format; the default is PNG
(Portable Network Graphics). Any format that convert(1) can
emit is supported.</p>

<p>-eqn delim Change the fencepost characters that delimit
eqn(1) directives ($ and $, by default). This option
requires an argument, but an empty string is accepted as a
directive to disable eqn(1) pro- cessing.</p>

<p>Command-line switches and arguments not listed above are
passed to con- vert(1).</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac/eqnrc The eqn(1)
initialization file.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO eqn2graph(1), pic(1), eqn(1), groff(1), gs(1),
convert(1).</p>
