<p>unknown(n) Tcl Built-In Commands unknown(n)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME unknown - Handle attempts to use non-existent
commands</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS unknown cmdName ?arg arg ...?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command is invoked by the Tcl
interpreter whenever a script tries to invoke a command that
does not exist. The default implementation of unknown is a
library procedure defined when Tcl initializes an inter-
preter. You can override the default unknown to change its
functional- ity, or you can register a new handler for
individual namespaces using the namespace unknown command.
Note that there is no default implemen- tation of unknown in
a safe interpreter.</p>

<p>If the Tcl interpreter encounters a command name for
which there is not a defined command (in either the current
namespace, or the global namespace), then Tcl checks for the
existence of an unknown handler for the current namespace.
By default, this handler is a command named ::unknown. If
there is no such command, then the interpreter returns an
error. If the unknown command exists (or a new handler has
been registered for the current namespace), then it is
invoked with argu- ments consisting of the fully-substituted
name and arguments for the original non-existent command.
The unknown command typically does things like searching
through library directories for a command proce- dure with
the name cmdName, or expanding abbreviated command names to
full-length, or automatically executing unknown commands as
sub-pro- cesses. In some cases (such as expanding
abbreviations) unknown will change the original command
slightly and then (re-)execute it. The result of the unknown
command is used as the result for the original non-existent
command.</p>

<p>The default implementation of unknown behaves as
follows. It first calls the auto_load library procedure to
load the command. If this succeeds, then it executes the
original command with its original argu- ments. If the
auto-load fails then unknown calls auto_execok to see if
there is an executable file by the name cmd. If so, it
invokes the Tcl exec command with cmd and all the args as
arguments. If cmd cannot be auto-executed, unknown checks to
see if the command was invoked at top- level and outside of
any script. If so, then unknown takes two addi- tional
steps. First, it sees if cmd has one of the following three
forms: !!, !event, or ^old^new?^?. If so, then unknown
carries out history substitution in the same way that csh
would for these con- structs. Finally, unknown checks to see
if cmd is a unique abbrevia- tion for an existing Tcl
command. If so, it expands the command name and executes the
command with the original arguments. If none of the above
efforts has been able to execute the command, unknown
generates an error return. If the global variable
auto_noload is defined, then the auto-load step is skipped.
If the global variable auto_noexec is defined then the
auto-exec step is skipped. Under normal circumstances the
return value from unknown is the return value from the
command that was eventually executed.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Arrange for the unknown command to have its
standard behavior except for first logging the fact that a
command was not found:</p>

<p># Save the original one so we can chain to it rename
unknown _original_unknown</p>

<p># Provide our own implementation proc unknown args {
puts stderr &quot;WARNING: unknown command: $args&quot;
uplevel 1 [list _original_unknown {*}$args] }</p>
