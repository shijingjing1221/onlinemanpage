<p>SULOGIN(8) Linux System Administrator s Manual
SULOGIN(8)</p>

<p>NAME sulogin - Single-user login</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sulogin [ -e ] [ -p ] [ -t SECONDS ] [ TTY
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sulogin can be invoked by init(8) when the
system goes into single user mode. (This is done through an
entry in inittab(5).) Init also tries to execute sulogin
when the boot loader (e.g., grub(8)) passes it the -b
option.</p>

<p>The user is prompted</p>

<p>Give root password for system maintenance (or type
Control-D for normal startup):</p>

<p>sulogin will be connected to the current terminal, or to
the optional device that can be specified on the command
line (typically /dev/con- sole).</p>

<p>If the -t option is used then the program only waits the
given number of seconds for user input.</p>

<p>If the -p option is used then the single-user shell is
invoked with a dash as the first character in argv[0]. This
causes the shell process to behave as a login shell. The
default is not to do this, so that the shell will not read
/etc/profile or $HOME/.profile at startup.</p>

<p>After the user exits the single-user shell, or presses
control-D at the prompt, the system will (continue to) boot
to the default runlevel.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES sulogin looks for the environment
variable SUSHELL or sushell to deter- mine what shell to
start. If the environment variable is not set, it will try
to execute roots shell from /etc/passwd. If that fails it
will fall back to /bin/sh.</p>

<p>This is very valuable together with the -b option to
init. To boot the system into single user mode, with the
root file system mounted read/write, using a special
&quot;fail safe&quot; shell that is statically linked (this
example is valid for the LILO bootprompt)</p>

<p>boot: linux -b rw sushell=/sbin/sash</p>

<p>FALLBACK METHODS sulogin checks the root password using
the standard method (getpwnam) first. Then, if the -e option
was specified, sulogin examines these files directly to find
the root password:</p>

<p>/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow (if present)</p>

<p>If they are damaged or nonexistent, sulogin will start a
root shell without asking for a password. Only use the -e
option if you are sure the console is physically protected
against unauthorized access.</p>
