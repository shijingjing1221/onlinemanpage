<p>XtGrabKey(3) XT FUNCTIONS XtGrabKey(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtGrabKey, XtUngrabKey, XtGrabKeyboard,
XtUngrabKeyboard, XtGrabButton, XtUngrabButton,
XtGrabPointer, XtUngrabPointer - manage grabs</p>

<p>SYNTAX void XtGrabKey(Widget widget, KeyCode keycode,
Modifiers modifiers, Boolean owner_events, int pointer_mode,
int keyboard_mode);</p>

<p>void XtUngrabKey(Widget widget, KeyCode keycode,
Modifiers modifiers);</p>

<p>int XtGrabKeyboard(Widget widget, Boolean owner_events,
int pointer_mode, int keyboard_mode, Time time);</p>

<p>void XtUngrabKeyboard(Widget widget, Time time);</p>

<p>void XtGrabButton(Widget widget, int button, Modifiers
modifiers, Boolean owner_events, unsigned int event_mask,
int pointer_mode, int keyboard_mode, Window confine_to,
Cursor cursor);</p>

<p>void XtUngrabButton(Widget widget, KeyCode button,
Modifiers modi- fiers);</p>

<p>int XtGrabPointer(Widget widget, Boolean owner_events,
unsigned int event_mask, int pointer_mode, int
keyboard_mode, Window con- fine_to, Cursor cursor, Time
time);</p>

<p>void XtUngrabPointer(Widget widget, Time time);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS widget Specifies the widget in whose window
the grab will occur. Must be of class Core or a subclass
thereof.</p>

<p>keycode modifiers owner_events pointer_mode
keyboard_mode time button confine_to cursor Specifies
arguments to the associated Xlib function call.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XtGrabKey calls XGrabKey specifying the
widgets window as the grab window if the widget is realized.
The remaining arguments are exactly as for XGrabKey. If the
widget is not realized, or is later unreal- ized, the call
to XGrabKey will be performed (again) when the widget is
realized and its window becomes mapped. In the future, if
XtDis- patchEvent is called with a KeyPress event matching
the specified key- code and modifiers (which may be AnyKey
or AnyModifier, respectively) for the widget s window, the
Intrinsics will call XtUngrabKeyboard with the timestamp
from the KeyPress event if either of the following condi-
tions is true:</p>

<p>&middot; There is a modal cascade and the widget is not
in the active subset of the cascade and the keyboard was not
previously grabbed, or</p>

<p>&middot; XFilterEvent returns True.</p>

<p>XtUngrabKey calls XUngrabKey specifying the widgets
window as the ungrab window if the widget is realized. The
remaining arguments are exactly as for XUngrabKey. If the
widget is not realized, XtUngrabKey removes a deferred
XtGrabKey request, if any, for the specified widget,
keycode, and modifiers.</p>

<p>If the specified widget is realized XtGrabKeyboard calls
XGrabKeyboard specifying the widgets window as the grab
window. The remaining argu- ments and return value are
exactly as for XGrabKeyboard. If the widget is not realized,
XtGrabKeyboard immediately returns GrabNotViewable. No
future ungrab is implied by XtGrabKeyboard.</p>

<p>XtUngrabKeyboard calls XUngrabKeyboard with the
specified time.</p>

<p>XtGrabButton calls XGrabButton specifying the widget s
window as the grab window if the widget is realized. The
remaining arguments are exactly as for XGrabButton. If the
widget is not realized, or is later unrealized, the call to
XGrabButton will be performed (again) when the widget is
realized and its window becomes mapped. In the future, if
XtDispatchEvent is called with a ButtonPress event matching
the speci- fied button and modifiers (which may be AnyButton
or AnyModifier, respectively) for the widgets window, the
Intrinsics will call XtUngrabPointer with the timestamp from
the ButtonPress event if either of the following conditions
is true:</p>

<p>&middot; There is a modal cascade and the widget is not
in the active subset of the cascade and the pointer was not
previously grabbed, or</p>

<p>&middot; XFilterEvent returns True.</p>

<p>XtUngrabButton calls XUngrabButton specifying the
widgets window as the ungrab window if the widget is
realized. The remaining arguments are exactly as for
XUngrabButton. If the widget is not realized, XtUngrabButton
removes a deferred XtGrabButton request, if any, for the
specified widget, button, and modifiers.</p>

<p>XtGrabPointer calls XGrabPointer specifying the widgets
window as the grab window. The remaining arguments and
return value are exactly as for XGrabPointer. If the widget
is not realized, XtGrabPointer immedi- ately returns
GrabNotViewable. No future ungrab is implied by XtGrab-
Pointer.</p>

<p>XtUngrabPointer calls XUngrabPointer with the specified
time.</p>
