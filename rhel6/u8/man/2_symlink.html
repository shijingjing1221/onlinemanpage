<p>NAME symlink - make a new name for a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int symlink(const char *oldpath, const char
*newpath);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>symlink(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500 ||
_POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION symlink() creates a symbolic link named
newpath which contains the string oldpath.</p>

<p>Symbolic links are interpreted at run time as if the
contents of the link had been substituted into the path
being followed to find a file or directory.</p>

<p>Symbolic links may contain .. path components, which (if
used at the start of the link) refer to the parent
directories of that in which the link resides.</p>

<p>A symbolic link (also known as a soft link) may point to
an existing file or to a nonexistent one; the latter case is
known as a dangling link.</p>

<p>The permissions of a symbolic link are irrelevant; the
ownership is ignored when following the link, but is checked
when removal or renam- ing of the link is requested and the
link is in a directory with the sticky bit (S_ISVTX)
set.</p>

<p>If newpath exists it will not be overwritten.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES Write access to the directory containing
newpath is denied, or one of the directories in the path
prefix of newpath did not allow search permission. (See also
path_resolution(7).)</p>

<p>EEXIST newpath already exists.</p>

<p>EFAULT oldpath or newpath points outside your accessible
address space.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
resolving newpath.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG oldpath or newpath was too long.</p>

<p>ENOENT A directory component in newpath does not exist
or is a dangling symbolic link, or oldpath is the empty
string.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The device containing the file has no room for
the new directory entry.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component used as a directory in newpath is
not, in fact, a directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The file system containing newpath does not
support the creation of symbolic links.</p>

<p>EROFS newpath is on a read-only file system.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES No checking of oldpath is done.</p>

<p>Deleting the name referred to by a symlink will actually
delete the file (unless it also has other hard links). If
this behavior is not desired, use link(2).</p>
