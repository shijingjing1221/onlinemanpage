<p>Tcl_SplitPath(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_SplitPath(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_SplitPath, Tcl_JoinPath, Tcl_GetPathType -
manipulate platform- dependent file paths</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_SplitPath(path, argcPtr, argvPtr)</p>

<p>char * Tcl_JoinPath(argc, argv, resultPtr)</p>

<p>Tcl_PathType Tcl_GetPathType(path)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS const char *path (in) File path in a form
appro- priate for the current plat- form (see the filename
man- ual entry for acceptable forms for path names).</p>

<p>int *argcPtr (out) Filled in with number of path
elements in path.</p>

<p>const char ***argvPtr (out) *argvPtr will be filled in
with the address of an array of pointers to the strings that
are the extracted ele- ments of path. There will be *argcPtr
valid entries in the array, followed by a NULL entry.</p>

<p>int argc (in) Number of elements in argv.</p>

<p>const char *const *argv (in) Array of path elements to
merge together into a single path.</p>

<p>Tcl_DString *resultPtr (in/out) A pointer to an
initialized Tcl_DString to which the result of Tcl_JoinPath
will be appended.

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures have been superceded by the
objectified procedures in the FileSystem man page, which are
more efficient.</p>

<p>These procedures may be used to disassemble and
reassemble file paths in a platform independent manner: they
provide C-level access to the same functionality as the file
split, file join, and file pathtype com- mands.</p>

<p>Tcl_SplitPath breaks a path into its constituent
elements, returning an array of pointers to the elements
using argcPtr and argvPtr. The area of memory pointed to by
*argvPtr is dynamically allocated; in addition to the array
of pointers, it also holds copies of all the path elements.
It is the callers responsibility to free all of this stor-
age. For example, suppose that you have called Tcl_SplitPath
with the following code: int argc; char *path; char **argv;
... Tcl_SplitPath(string, &amp;argc, &amp;argv); Then you
should eventually free the storage with a call like the fol-
lowing: Tcl_Free((char *) argv);</p>

<p>Tcl_JoinPath is the inverse of Tcl_SplitPath: it takes a
collection of path elements given by argc and argv and
generates a result string that is a properly constructed
path. The result string is appended to resultPtr. ResultPtr
must refer to an initialized Tcl_DString.</p>

<p>If the result of Tcl_SplitPath is passed to
Tcl_JoinPath, the result will refer to the same location,
but may not be in the same form. This is because
Tcl_SplitPath and Tcl_JoinPath eliminate duplicate path sep-
arators and return a normalized form for each platform.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetPathType returns the type of the specified path,
where Tcl_PathType is one of TCL_PATH_ABSOLUTE,
TCL_PATH_RELATIVE, or TCL_PATH_VOLUME_RELATIVE. See the
filename manual entry for a descrip- tion of the path types
for each platform.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS file, filename, join, path, split, type</p>
