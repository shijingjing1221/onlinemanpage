<p>ED(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ED(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ed - edit text</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ed [-p string][-s][file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ed utility is a line-oriented text
editor that uses two modes: com- mand mode and input mode.
In command mode the input characters shall be interpreted as
commands, and in input mode they shall be interpreted as
text. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The ed utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-p string Use string as the prompt string when in
command mode. By default, there shall be no prompt
string.</p>

<p>-s Suppress the writing of byte counts by e, E, r, and w
commands and of the!prompt after a !command.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file If the file argument is given, ed shall simulate an
e command on the file named by the pathname, file, before
accepting commands from the standard input. If the file
operand is - , the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be a text file consisting
of commands, as described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be text files.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of ed:</p>

<p>HOME Determine the pathname of the users home
directory.</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements
within regular expressions.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files) and the behavior of character classes
within regular expres- sions.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS The ed utility shall take the
standard action for all signals (see the ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
section in Utility Description Defaults ) with the following
exceptions:</p>

<p>SIGINT The ed utility shall interrupt its current
activity, write the string &quot;n&quot; to standard output,
and return to command mode (see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
section).</p>

<p>SIGHUP If the buffer is not empty and has changed since
the last write, the ed utility shall attempt to write a copy
of the buffer in a file. First, the file named ed.hup in the
current directory shall be used; if that fails, the file
named ed.hup in the directory named by the HOME environment
variable shall be used. In any case, the ed utility shall
exit without returning to com- mand mode.</p>

<p>SIGQUIT The ed utility shall ignore this event.</p>

<p>STDOUT Various editing commands and the prompting
feature (see -p) write to standard output, as described in
the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES The output files shall be text files whose
formats are dependent on the editing commands given.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION The ed utility shall operate on a
copy of the file it is editing; changes made to the copy
shall have no effect on the file until a w (write) command
is given. The copy of the text is called the buffer.</p>

<p>Commands to ed have a simple and regular structure:
zero, one, or two addresses followed by a single-character
command, possibly followed by parameters to that command.
These addresses specify one or more lines in the buffer.
Every command that requires addresses has default addresses,
so that the addresses very often can be omitted. If the -p
option is specified, the prompt string shall be written to
standard output before each command is read.</p>

<p>In general, only one command can appear on a line.
Certain commands allow text to be input. This text is placed
in the appropriate place in the buffer. While ed is
accepting text, it is said to be in input mode. In this
mode, no commands shall be recognized; all input is merely
col- lected. Input mode is terminated by entering a line
consisting of two characters: a period (.) followed by a
&lt;newline&gt;. This line is not considered part of the
input text.</p>

<p>Regular Expressions in ed The ed utility shall support
basic regular expressions, as described in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 9.3,
Basic Regular Expressions. Since regular expressions in ed
are always matched against single lines (excluding the
terminating &lt;newline&gt;s), never against any larger
section of text, there is no way for a regular expression to
match a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>A null RE shall be equivalent to the last RE
encountered.</p>

<p>Regular expressions are used in addresses to specify
lines, and in some commands (for example, the s substitute
command) to specify portions of a line to be
substituted.</p>

<p>Addresses in ed Addressing in ed relates to the current
line. Generally, the current line is the last line affected
by a command. The current line number is the address of the
current line. If the edit buffer is not empty, the initial
value for the current line shall be the last line in the
edit buffer; otherwise, zero.</p>

<p>Addresses shall be constructed as follows:</p>

<p>1. The period character (.) shall address the current
line.</p>

<p>2. The dollar sign character ($) shall address the last
line of the edit buffer.</p>

<p>3. The positive decimal number n shall address the nth
line of the edit buffer.</p>

<p>4. The apostrophe-x character pair ( x&quot; ) shall
address the line marked with the mark name character x,
which shall be a lowercase letter from the portable
character set. It shall be an error if the character has not
been set to mark a line or if the line that was marked is
not currently present in the edit buffer.</p>

<p>5. A BRE enclosed by slash characters (/) shall address
the first line found by searching forwards from the line
following the cur- rent line toward the end of the edit
buffer and stopping at the first line for which the line
excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the BRE.
The BRE consisting of a null BRE delimited by a pair of
slash characters shall address the next line for which the
line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the
last BRE encountered. In addition, the second slash can be
omitted at the end of a command line. Within the BRE, a
backslash-slash pair ( /&quot; ) shall represent a literal
slash instead of the BRE delim- iter. If necessary, the
search shall wrap around to the beginning of the buffer and
continue up to and including the current line, so that the
entire buffer is searched.</p>

<p>6. A BRE enclosed by question-mark characters (?) shall
address the first line found by searching backwards from the
line preceding the current line toward the beginning of the
edit buffer and stop- ping at the first line for which the
line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the
BRE. The BRE consisting of a null BRE delim- ited by a pair
of question-mark characters ( &quot;??&quot; ) shall address
the previous line for which the line excluding the
terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the last BRE
encountered. In addition, the second question-mark can be
omitted at the end of a command line. Within the BRE, a
backslash-question-mark pair ( &quot; literal question mark
instead of the BRE delimiter. If necessary, the search shall
wrap around to the end of the buffer and continue up to and
including the current line, so that the entire buffer is
searched.</p>

<p>7. A plus-sign (+) or hyphen character (-) followed by a
deci- mal number shall address the current line plus or
minus the number. A plus-sign or hyphen character not
followed by a decimal number shall address the current line
plus or minus 1.</p>

<p>Addresses can be followed by zero or more address
offsets, optionally &lt;blank&gt;-separated. Address offsets
are constructed as follows:</p>

<p>* A plus-sign or hyphen character followed by a decimal
number shall add or subtract, respectively, the indicated
number of lines to or from the address. A plus-sign or
hyphen character not followed by a decimal number shall add
or subtract 1 to or from the address.</p>

<p>* A decimal number shall add the indicated number of
lines to the address.</p>

<p>It shall not be an error for an intermediate address
value to be less than zero or greater than the last line in
the edit buffer. It shall be an error for the final address
value to be less than zero or greater than the last line in
the edit buffer. It shall be an error if a search for a BRE
fails to find a matching line.</p>

<p>Commands accept zero, one, or two addresses. If more
than the required number of addresses are provided to a
command that requires zero addresses, it shall be an error.
Otherwise, if more than the required number of addresses are
provided to a command, the addresses specified first shall
be evaluated and then discarded until the maximum number of
valid addresses remain, for the specified command.</p>

<p>Addresses shall be separated from each other by a comma
(,) or semicolon character (; ). In the case of a semicolon
separator, the current line (.) shall be set to the first
address, and only then will the second address be
calculated. This feature can be used to determine the
starting line for forwards and backwards searches; see rules
5. and 6.</p>

<p>Addresses can be omitted on either side of the comma or
semicolon sepa- rator, in which case the resulting address
pairs shall be as follows:</p>

<p>Specified Resulting , 1 , $, addr 1 , addr addr , addr ,
addr ; . ; $ ; addr . ; addr addr ; addr ; addr</p>

<p>Any &lt;blank&gt;s included between addresses, address
separators, or address offsets shall be ignored.</p>

<p>Commands in ed In the following list of ed commands, the
default addresses are shown in parentheses. The number of
addresses shown in the default shall be the number expected
by the command. The parentheses are not part of the address;
they show that the given addresses are the default.</p>

<p>It is generally invalid for more than one command to
appear on a line. However, any command (except e, E, f, q,
Q, r, w, and !) can be suf- fixed by the letter l, n, or p;
in which case, except for the l, n, and p commands, the
command shall be executed and then the new current line
shall be written as described below under the l, n, and p
commands. When an l, n, or p suffix is used with an l, n, or
p command, the com- mand shall write to standard output as
described below, but it is unspecified whether the suffix
writes the current line again in the requested format or
whether the suffix has no effect. For example, the pl
command (base p command with an l suffix) shall either write
just the current line or write it twice-once as specified
for p and once as specified for l. Also, the g, G, v, and V
commands shall take a com- mand as a parameter.</p>

<p>Each address component can be preceded by zero or more
&lt;blank&gt;s. The command letter can be preceded by zero
or more &lt;blank&gt;s. If a suffix letter ( l, n, or p) is
given, the application shall ensure that it immediately
follows the command.</p>

<p>The e, E, f, r, and w commands shall take an optional
file parameter, separated from the command letter by one or
more &lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p>If changes have been made in the buffer since the last w
command that wrote the entire buffer, ed shall warn the user
if an attempt is made to destroy the editor buffer via the e
or q commands. The ed utility shall write the string:</p>

<p>&quot;n&quot;</p>

<p>(followed by an explanatory message if help mode has
been enabled via the H command) to standard output and shall
continue in command mode with the current line number
unchanged. If the e or q command is repeated with no
intervening command, it shall take effect.</p>

<p>If a terminal disconnect is detected:</p>

<p>* If the buffer is not empty and has changed since the
last write, the ed utility shall attempt to write a copy of
the buffer to a file named ed.hup in the current directory.
If this write fails, ed shall attempt to write a copy of the
buffer to a filename ed.hup in the directory named by the
HOME environment variable. If both these attempts fail, ed
shall exit without saving the buffer.</p>

<p>* The ed utility shall not write the file to the
currently remembered pathname or return to command mode, and
shall terminate with a non- zero exit status.</p>

<p>If an end-of-file is detected on standard input:</p>

<p>* If the ed utility is in input mode, ed shall terminate
input mode and return to command mode. It is unspecified if
any partially entered lines (that is, input text without a
terminating &lt;newline&gt;) are discarded from the input
text.</p>

<p>* If the ed utility is in command mode, it shall act as
if a q command had been entered.</p>

<p>If the closing delimiter of an RE or of a replacement
string (for exam- ple, / ) in a g, G, s, v, or V command
would be the last character before a &lt;newline&gt;, that
delimiter can be omitted, in which case the addressed line
shall be written. For example, the following pairs of
commands are equivalent:</p>

<p>s/s1/s2 s/s1/s2/p g/s1 g/s1/p ?s1 ?s1?</p>

<p>If an invalid command is entered, ed shall write the
string:</p>

<p>&quot;n&quot;</p>

<p>(followed by an explanatory message if help mode has
been enabled via the H command) to standard output and shall
continue in command mode with the current line number
unchanged.</p>

<p>Append Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(.)a &lt;text&gt; .</p>

<p>The a command shall read the given text and append it
after the addressed line; the current line number shall
become the address of the last inserted line or, if there
were none, the addressed line. Address 0 shall be valid for
this command; it shall cause the appended text to be placed
at the beginning of the buffer.</p>

<p>Change Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(.,.)c &lt;text&gt; .</p>

<p>The c command shall delete the addressed lines, then
accept input text that replaces these lines; the current
line shall be set to the address of the last line input; or,
if there were none, at the line after the last line deleted;
if the lines deleted were originally at the end of the
buffer, the current line number shall be set to the address
of the new last line; if no lines remain in the buffer, the
current line num- ber shall be set to zero. Address 0 shall
be valid for this command; it shall be interpreted as if
address 1 were specified.</p>

<p>Delete Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(.,.)d</p>

<p>The d command shall delete the addressed lines from the
buffer. The address of the line after the last line deleted
shall become the cur- rent line number; if the lines deleted
were originally at the end of the buffer, the current line
number shall be set to the address of the new last line; if
no lines remain in the buffer, the current line num- ber
shall be set to zero.</p>

<p>Edit Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>e [file]</p>

<p>The e command shall delete the entire contents of the
buffer and then read in the file named by the pathname file.
The current line number shall be set to the address of the
last line of the buffer. If no path- name is given, the
currently remembered pathname, if any, shall be used (see
the f command). The number of bytes read shall be written to
standard output, unless the -s option was specified, in the
following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;number of bytes read&gt;</p>

<p>The name file shall be remembered for possible use as a
default path- name in subsequent e, E, r, and w commands. If
file is replaced by, the rest of the line shall be taken to
be a shell command line whose output is to be read. Such a
shell command line shall not be remembered as the current
file. All marks shall be discarded upon the completion of a
successful e command. If the buffer has changed since the
last time the entire buffer was written, the user shall be
warned, as described previously.</p>

<p>Edit Without Checking Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>E [file]</p>

<p>The E command shall possess all properties and
restrictions of the e command except that the editor shall
not check to see whether any changes have been made to the
buffer since the last w command.</p>

<p>Filename Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>f [file]</p>

<p>If file is given, the f command shall change the
currently remembered pathname to file; whether the name is
changed or not, it shall then write the (possibly new)
currently remembered pathname to the standard output in the
following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;pathname&gt;</p>

<p>The current line number shall be unchanged.</p>

<p>Global Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(1,$)g/RE/command list</p>

<p>In the g command, the first step shall be to mark every
line for which the line excluding the terminating
&lt;newline&gt; matches the given RE. Then, going
sequentially from the beginning of the file to the end of
the file, the given command list shall be executed for each
marked line, with the current line number set to the address
of that line. Any line modified by the command list shall be
unmarked. When the g command completes, the current line
number shall have the value assigned by the last command in
the command list. If there were no matching lines, the
current line number shall not be changed. A single command
or the first of a list of commands shall appear on the same
line as the global com- mand. All lines of a multi-line list
except the last line shall be ended with a backslash
preceding the terminating &lt;newline&gt;; the a, i, and c
commands and associated input are permitted. The.
terminating input mode can be omitted if it would be the
last line of the command list. An empty command list shall
be equivalent to the p command. The use of the g, G, v, V,
and ! commands in the command list produces undefined
results. Any character other than &lt;space&gt; or
&lt;newline&gt; can be used instead of a slash to delimit
the RE. Within the RE, the RE delim- iter itself can be used
as a literal character if it is preceded by a backslash.</p>

<p>Interactive Global Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(1,$)G/RE/</p>

<p>In the G command, the first step shall be to mark every
line for which the line excluding the terminating
&lt;newline&gt; matches the given RE. Then, for every such
line, that line shall be written, the current line number
shall be set to the address of that line, and any one
command (other than one of the a, c, i, g, G, v, and V
commands) shall be read and executed. A &lt;newline&gt;
shall act as a null command (causing no action to be taken
on the current line); an&amp; shall cause the re-exe- cution
of the most recent non-null command executed within the
current invocation of G. Note that the commands input as
part of the execution of the G command can address and
affect any lines in the buffer. Any line modified by the
command shall be unmarked. The final value of the current
line number shall be the value set by the last command
success- fully executed. (Note that the last command
successfully executed shall be the G command itself if a
command fails or the null command is spec- ified.) If there
were no matching lines, the current line number shall not be
changed. The G command can be terminated by a SIGINT signal.
Any character other than &lt;space&gt; or &lt;newline&gt;
can be used instead of a slash to delimit the RE and the
replacement. Within the RE, the RE delimiter itself can be
used as a literal character if it is preceded by a
backslash.</p>

<p>Help Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>h</p>

<p>The h command shall write a short message to standard
output that explains the reason for the most recent ?
notification. The current line number shall be
unchanged.</p>

<p>Help-Mode Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>H</p>

<p>The H command shall cause ed to enter a mode in which
help messages (see the h command) shall be written to
standard output for all subse- quent ?notifications. The H
command alternately shall turn this mode on and off; it is
initially off. If the help-mode is being turned on, the H
command also explains the previous?notification, if there
was one. The current line number shall be unchanged.</p>

<p>Insert Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(.)i &lt;text&gt; .</p>

<p>The i command shall insert the given text before the
addressed line; the current line is set to the last inserted
line or, if there was none, to the addressed line. This
command differs from the a command only in the placement of
the input text. Address 0 shall be valid for this command;
it shall be interpreted as if address 1 were specified.</p>

<p>Join Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(.,.+1)j</p>

<p>The j command shall join contiguous lines by removing
the appropriate &lt;newline&gt;s. If exactly one address is
given, this command shall do nothing. If lines are joined,
the current line number shall be set to the address of the
joined line; otherwise, the current line number shall be
unchanged.</p>

<p>Mark Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(.)kx</p>

<p>The k command shall mark the addressed line with name x,
which the application shall ensure is a lowercase letter
from the portable char- acter set. The address x&quot; shall
then refer to this line; the current line number shall be
unchanged.</p>

<p>List Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(.,.)l</p>

<p>The l command shall write to standard output the
addressed lines in a visually unambiguous form. The
characters listed in the Base Defini- tions volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, Table 5-1, Escape Sequences and ) shall
Associated Actions b, be written as the corresponding escape
sequence; thnin that table is not applicable. Non-printable
characters not in the table shall be written as one
three-digit octal number (with a preceding backslash
character) for each byte in the character (most significant
byte first). If the size of a byte on the system is greater
than nine bits, the format used for non-printable characters
is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>Long lines shall be folded, with the point of folding
indicated by &lt;newline&gt; preceded by a backslash; the
length at which folding occurs is unspecified, but should be
appropriate for the output device. The end of each line
shall be marked with a, and$ characters within the text
shall be written with a preceding backslash. An l command
can be appended to any other command other than e, E, f, q,
Q, r, w, or !. The current line number shall be set to the
address of the last line written.</p>

<p>Move Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(.,.)maddress</p>

<p>The m command shall reposition the addressed lines after
the line addressed by address. Address 0 shall be valid for
address and cause the addressed lines to be moved to the
beginning of the buffer. It shall be an error if address
address falls within the range of moved lines. The current
line number shall be set to the address of the last line
moved.</p>

<p>Number Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(.,.)n</p>

<p>The n command shall write to standard output the
addressed lines, pre- ceding each line by its line number
and a &lt;tab&gt;; the current line num- ber shall be set to
the address of the last line written. The n command can be
appended to any command other than e, E, f, q, Q, r, w, or
!.</p>

<p>Print Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(.,.)p</p>

<p>The p command shall write to standard output the
addressed lines; the current line number shall be set to the
address of the last line writ- ten. The p command can be
appended to any command other than e, E, f, q, Q, r, w, or
!.</p>

<p>Prompt Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>P</p>

<p>The P command shall cause ed to prompt with an asterisk
( * ) (or string, if -p is specified) for all subsequent
commands. The P command alternatively shall turn this mode
on and off; it shall be initially on if the -p option is
specified; otherwise, off. The current line number shall be
unchanged.</p>

<p>Quit Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>q</p>

<p>The q command shall cause ed to exit. If the buffer has
changed since the last time the entire buffer was written,
the user shall be warned, as described previously.</p>

<p>Quit Without Checking Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>Q</p>

<p>The Q command shall cause ed to exit without checking
whether changes have been made in the buffer since the last
w command.</p>

<p>Read Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>($)r [file]</p>

<p>The r command shall read in the file named by the
pathname file and append it after the addressed line. If no
file argument is given, the currently remembered pathname,
if any, shall be used (see the e and f commands). The
currently remembered pathname shall not be changed unless
there is no remembered pathname. Address 0 shall be valid
for r and shall cause the file to be read at the beginning
of the buffer. If the read is successful, and -s was not
specified, the number of bytes read shall be written to
standard output in the following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;number of bytes read&gt;</p>

<p>The current line number shall be set to the address of
the last line read in. If file is replaced by, the rest of
the line shall be taken to be a shell command line whose
output is to be read. Such a shell command line shall not be
remembered as the current pathname.</p>

<p>Substitute Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(.,.)s/RE/replacement/flags</p>

<p>The s command shall search each addressed line for an
occurrence of the specified RE and replace either the first
or all (non-overlapped) matched strings with the
replacement; see the following description of the g suffix.
It is an error if the substitution fails on every addressed
line. Any character other than &lt;space&gt; or
&lt;newline&gt; can be used instead of a slash to delimit
the RE and the replacement. Within the RE, the RE delimiter
itself can be used as a literal character if it is preceded
by a backslash. The current line shall be set to the address
of the last line on which a substitution occurred.</p>

<p>An ampersand (&amp;) appearing in the replacement shall
be replaced by the string matching the RE on the current
line. The special meaning of &amp; in this context can be
suppressed by preceding it by backslash. As a more general
feature, the character, where n is a digit, shall be
replaced by the text matched by the corresponding
back-reference expression. When the character % is the only
character in the replacement, the replacement used in the
most recent substitute command shall be used as the
replacement in the current substitute command; if there was
no previous substitute command, the use of % in this manner
shall be an error. The%shall lose its special meaning when
it is in a replacement string of more than one character or
is preceded by a backslash. For each backslash ) encountered
in scanning replace- ment from beginning to end, the
following character shall lose its spe- cial meaning (if
any). It is unspecified what special meaning is given to any
character other than,, or digits.</p>

<p>A line can be split by substituting a &lt;newline&gt;
into it. The applica- tion shall ensure it escapes the
&lt;newline&gt; in the replacement by pre- ceding it by
backslash. Such substitution cannot be done as part of a g
or v command list. The current line number shall be set to
the address of the last line on which a substitution is
performed. If no substitu- tion is performed, the current
line number shall be unchanged. If a line is split, a
substitution shall be considered to have been per- formed on
each of the new lines for the purpose of determining the new
current line number. A substitution shall be considered to
have been performed even if the replacement string is
identical to the string that it replaces.</p>

<p>The application shall ensure that the value of flags is
zero or more of:</p>

<p>count Substitute for the countth occurrence only of the
RE found on each addressed line.</p>

<p>g Globally substitute for all non-overlapping instances
of the RE rather than just the first one. If both g and
count are speci- fied, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>l Write to standard output the final line in which a
substitution was made. The line shall be written in the
format specified for the l command.</p>

<p>n Write to standard output the final line in which a
substitution was made. The line shall be written in the
format specified for the n command.</p>

<p>p Write to standard output the final line in which a
substitution was made. The line shall be written in the
format specified for the p command.</p>

<p>Copy Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(.,.)taddress</p>

<p>The t command shall be equivalent to the m command,
except that a copy of the addressed lines shall be placed
after address address (which can be 0); the current line
number shall be set to the address of the last line
added.</p>

<p>Undo Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>u</p>

<p>The u command shall nullify the effect of the most
recent command that modified anything in the buffer, namely
the most recent a, c, d, g, i, j, m, r, s, t, u, v, G, or V
command. All changes made to the buffer by a g, G, v, or V
global command shall be undone as a single change; if no
changes were made by the global command (such as with g/RE/
p), the u command shall have no effect. The current line
number shall be set to the value it had immediately before
the command being undone started.</p>

<p>Global Non-Matched Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(1,$)v/RE/command list</p>

<p>This command shall be equivalent to the global command g
except that the lines that are marked during the first step
shall be those for which the line excluding the terminating
&lt;newline&gt; does not match the RE.</p>

<p>Interactive Global Not-Matched Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(1,$)V/RE/</p>

<p>This command shall be equivalent to the interactive
global command G except that the lines that are marked
during the first step shall be those for which the line
excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; does not match the
RE.</p>

<p>Write Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(1,$)w [file]</p>

<p>The w command shall write the addressed lines into the
file named by the pathname file. The command shall create
the file, if it does not exist, or shall replace the
contents of the existing file. The cur- rently remembered
pathname shall not be changed unless there is no remembered
pathname. If no pathname is given, the currently remembered
pathname, if any, shall be used (see the e and f commands);
the current line number shall be unchanged. If the command
is successful, the num- ber of bytes written shall be
written to standard output, unless the -s option was
specified, in the following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;number of bytes written&gt;</p>

<p>If file begins with, the rest of the line shall be taken
to be a shell command line whose standard input shall be the
addressed lines. Such a shell command line shall not be
remembered as the current path- name. This usage of the
write command with!shall not be considered as a &quot;last w
command that wrote the entire buffer&quot;, as described
previ- ously; thus, this alone shall not prevent the warning
to the user if an attempt is made to destroy the editor
buffer via the e or q commands.</p>

<p>Line Number Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>($)=</p>

<p>The line number of the addressed line shall be written
to standard out- put in the following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;line number&gt;</p>

<p>The current line number shall be unchanged by this
command.</p>

<p>Shell Escape Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>!command</p>

<p>The remainder of the line after the!shall be sent to the
command interpreter to be interpreted as a shell command
line. Within the text of that shell command line, the
unescaped character% shall be replaced with the remembered
pathname; if a! appears as the first character of the
command, it shall be replaced with the text of the previous
shell command executed via! . Thus, &quot;!!&quot; shall
repeat the previous !command. If any replacements of %
or!are performed, the modified line shall be written to the
standard output before command is executed. The ! command
shall write:</p>

<p>&quot;n&quot;</p>

<p>to standard output upon completion, unless the -s option
is specified. The current line number shall be
unchanged.</p>

<p>Null Command Synopsis:</p>

<p>(.+1)</p>

<p>An address alone on a line shall cause the addressed
line to be writ- ten. A &lt;newline&gt; alone shall be
equivalent to &quot;+1p&quot; . The current line number
shall be set to the address of the written line.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion without any file or command
errors.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS When an error in the input script
is encountered, or when an error is detected that is a
consequence of the data (not) present in the file or due to
an external condition such as a read or write error:</p>

<p>* If the standard input is a terminal device file, all
input shall be flushed, and a new command read.</p>

<p>* If the standard input is a regular file, ed shall
terminate with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Because of the extremely terse nature
of the default error messages, the prudent script writer
begins the ed input commands with an H com- mand, so that if
any errors do occur at least some clue as to the cause is
made available.</p>

<p>In previous versions, an obsolescent - option was
described. This is no longer specified. Applications should
use the -s option. Using - as a file operand now produces
unspecified results. This allows implemen- tations to
continue to support the former required behavior.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The initial description of this utility was
adapted from the SVID. It contains some features not found
in Version 7 or BSD-derived systems. Some of the differences
between the POSIX and BSD ed utilities include, but need not
be limited to:</p>

<p>* The BSD - option does not suppress the!prompt after a
! command.</p>

<p>* BSD does not support the special meanings of the%and!
char- acters within a ! command.</p>

<p>* BSD does not support the addresses;and,.</p>

<p>* BSD allows the command/suffix pairs pp, ll, and so on,
which are unspecified in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>* BSD does not support the!character part of the e, r,
or w com- mands.</p>

<p>* A failed g command in BSD sets the line number to the
last line searched if there are no matches.</p>

<p>* BSD does not default the command list to the p
command.</p>

<p>* BSD does not support the G, h, H, n, or V
commands.</p>

<p>* On BSD, if there is no inserted text, the insert
command changes the current line to the referenced line -1;
that is, the line before the specified line.</p>

<p>* On BSD, the join command with only a single address
changes the cur- rent line to that address.</p>

<p>* BSD does not support the P command; moreover, in BSD
it is synony- mous with the p command.</p>

<p>* BSD does not support the undo of the commands j, m, r,
s, or t.</p>

<p>* The Version 7 ed command W, and the BSD ed commands W,
wq, and z are not present in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>The -s option was added to allow the functionality of
the now withdrawn - option in a manner compatible with the
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>In early proposals there was a limit, {ED_FILE_MAX},
that described the historical limitations of some ed
utilities in their handling of large files; some of these
have had problems with files larger than 100000 bytes. It
was this limitation that prompted much of the desire to
include a split command in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001. Since this limit was removed, this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires that implementations document
the file size limits imposed by ed in the conformance
document. The limit {ED_LINE_MAX} was also removed; there-
fore, the global limit {LINE_MAX} is used for input and
output lines.</p>

<p>The manner in which the l command writes non-printable
characters was changed to avoid the historical
backspace-overstrike method. On video display terminals, the
overstrike is ambiguous because most terminals simply
replace overstruck characters, making the l format not
useful for its intended purpose of unambiguously
understanding the content of the line. The historical
backslash escapes were also ambiguous. (The string
&quot;0011&quot; could represent a line containing those six
characters or a line containing the three characters, a byte
with a binary value of 1, and a 1.) In the format required
here, a backslash appear- ing in the line is written as \
biguous. The method of marking the ends of lines was adopted
from the ex editor and is required for any line ending in
&lt;space&gt;s; the$is placed on all lines so that a real$at
the end of a line cannot be misinterpreted.</p>

<p>Systems with bytes too large to fit into three octal
digits must devise other means of displaying non-printable
characters. Consideration was given to requiring that the
number of octal digits be large enough to hold a byte, but
this seemed to be too confusing for applications on the vast
majority of systems where three digits are adequate. It
would be theoretically possible for the application to use
the getconf util- ity to find out the CHAR_BIT value and
deal with such an algorithm; however, there is really no
portable way that an application can use the octal values of
the bytes across various coded character sets, so the
additional specification was not worthwhile.</p>

<p>The description of how a NUL is written was removed. The
NUL character cannot be in text files, and this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 should not dictate behavior in the case
of undefined, erroneous input.</p>

<p>Unlike some of the other editing utilities, the
filenames accepted by the E, e, R, and r commands are not
patterns.</p>

<p>Early proposals stated that the -p option worked only
when standard input was associated with a terminal device.
This has been changed to conform to historical
implementations, thereby allowing applications to interpose
themselves between a user and the ed utility.</p>

<p>The form of the substitute command that uses the n
suffix was limited in some historical documentation (where
this was described incorrectly as
&quot;backreferencing&quot;). This limit has been omitted
because there is no reason why an editor processing lines of
{LINE_MAX} length should have this restriction. The command
s/x/X/2047 should be able to substitute the 2047th
occurrence ofxon a line.</p>

<p>The use of printing commands with printing suffixes
(such as pn, lp, and so on) was made unspecified because
BSD-based systems allow this, whereas System V does not.</p>

<p>Some BSD-based systems exit immediately upon receipt of
end-of-file if all of the lines in the file have been
deleted. Since this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 refers to
the q command in this instance, such behavior is not
allowed.</p>

<p>Some historical implementations returned exit status
zero even if command errors had occurred; this is not
allowed by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>Some historical implementations contained a bug that
allowed a single period to be entered in input mode as
&lt;backslash&gt; &lt;period&gt; &lt;newline&gt;. This is
not allowed by ed because there is no description of
escaping any of the characters in input mode; backslashes
are entered into the buffer exactly as typed. The typical
method of entering a single period has been to precede it
with another character and then use the substi- tute command
to delete that character.</p>

<p>It is difficult under some modes of some versions of
historical operat- ing system terminal drivers to
distinguish between an end-of-file con- dition and terminal
disconnect. IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not require
implementations to distinguish between the two situations,
which per- mits historical implementations of the ed utility
on historical plat- forms to conform. Implementations are
encouraged to distinguish between the two, if possible, and
take appropriate action on terminal disconnect.</p>

<p>Historically, ed accepted a zero address for the a and r
commands in order to insert text at the start of the edit
buffer. When the buffer was empty the command .= returned
zero. IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice.</p>

<p>For consistency with the a and r commands and better
user functional- ity, the i and c commands must also accept
an address of 0, in which case 0i is treated as 1i and
likewise for the c command.</p>

<p>All of the following are valid addresses:</p>

<p>+++ Three lines after the current line.</p>

<p>/pattern/- One line before the next occurrence of
pattern.</p>

<p>-2 Two lines before the current line.</p>

<p>3 ---- 2 Line one (note the intermediate negative
address).</p>

<p>1 2 3 Line six.</p>

<p>Any number of addresses can be provided to commands
taking addresses; for example, &quot;1,2,3,4,5p&quot; prints
lines 4 and 5, because two is the greatest valid number of
addresses accepted by the print command. This, in
combination with the semicolon delimiter, permits users to
create commands based on ordered patterns in the file. For
example, the com- mand &quot;3;/foo/;+2p&quot; will display
the first line after line 3 that con- tains the pattern foo,
plus the next two lines. Note that the address
&quot;3;&quot; must still be evaluated before being
discarded, because the search origin for the
&quot;/foo/&quot; command depends on this.</p>

<p>Historically, ed disallowed address chains, as discussed
above, con- sisting solely of comma or semicolon separators;
for example, &quot;,,,&quot; or &quot;;;;&quot; were
considered an error. For consistency of address specifica-
tion, this restriction is removed. The following table lists
some of the address forms now possible:</p>

<p>Address Addr1 Addr2 Status Comment 7, 7 7 Historical
7,5, 5 5 Historical 7,5,9 5 9 Historical 7,9 7 9
Historical</p>

<p>7,+ 7 8 Historical , 1 $ Historical ,7 1 7 Extension ,,
$ $ Extension ,; $ $ Extension 7; 7 7 Historical 7;5; 5 5
Historical 7;5;9 5 9 Historical 7;5,9 5 9 Historical 7;$;4 $
4 Historical Valid, but erroneous. 7;9 7 9 Historical 7;+ 7
8 Historical ; . $ Historical ;7 . 7 Extension ;; $ $
Extension ;, $ $ Extension</p>

<p>Historically, values could be added to addresses by
including them after one or more &lt;blank&gt;s; for
example, &quot;3 - 5p&quot; wrote the seventh line of the
file, and &quot;/foo/ 5&quot; was the same as &quot;5
/foo/&quot; . However, only absolute values could be added;
for example, &quot;5 /foo/&quot; was an error. IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 requires conformance to historical prac-
tice.</p>

<p>Historically, ed accepted the ^character as an address,
in which case it was identical to the hyphen character. IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 does not require or prohibit this
behavior.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
