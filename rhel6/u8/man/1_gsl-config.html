<p>DESCRIPTION gsl-config is a tool that is used to

that are included with GSL.</p>

<p>--version Print the currently installed version of GSL
on the standard output.</p>

<p>--libs Print the linker flags that are necessary to link
a GSL pro- gram, with cblas</p>

<p>--libs-without-cblas Print the linker flags that are
necessary to link a GSL pro- gram, without cblas</p>

<p>--cflags Print the compiler flags that are necessary to
compile a GSL program.</p>
