<p>H2PH(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide H2PH(1)</p>

<p>NAME h2ph - convert .h C header files to .ph Perl header
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS h2ph [-d destination directory] [-r | -a] [-l]
[headerfiles]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION h2ph converts any C header files specified
to the corresponding Perl header file format. It is most
easily run while in /usr/include:</p>

<p>cd /usr/include; h2ph * sys/*</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>cd /usr/include; h2ph * sys/* arpa/* netinet/*</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>cd /usr/include; h2ph -r -l .</p>

<p>The output files are placed in the hierarchy rooted at
Perls architecture dependent library directory. You can
specify a different hierarchy with a -d switch.</p>

<p>If run with no arguments, filters standard input to
standard output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d destination_dir Put the resulting .ph files
beneath destination_dir, instead of beneath the default Perl
library location
($Config{&rsquo;installsitearch&rsquo;}).</p>

<p>-r Run recursively; if any of headerfiles are
directories, then run h2ph on all files in those directories
(and their subdirectories, etc.). -r and -a are mutually
exclusive.</p>

<p>-a Run automagically; convert headerfiles, as well as
any .h files which they include. This option will search for
.h files in all directories which your C compiler ordinarily
uses. -a and -r are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>-l Symbolic links will be replicated in the destination
directory. If -l is not specified, then links are skipped
over.</p>

<p>-h Put hints in the .ph files which will help in
locating problems with h2ph. In those cases when you require
a .ph file containing syntax errors, instead of the
cryptic</p>

<p>[ some error condition ] at (eval mmm) line nnn</p>

<p>you will see the slightly more helpful</p>

<p>[ some error condition ] at filename.ph line nnn</p>

<p>However, the .ph files almost double in size when built
using -h.</p>

<p>-D Include the code from the .h file as a comment in the
.ph file. This is primarily used for debugging h2ph.</p>

<p>-Q Quiet mode; dont print out the names of the files
being converted.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT No environment variables are used.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/include/*.h /usr/include/sys/*.h</p>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>AUTHOR Larry Wall</p>

<p>SEE ALSO perl(1)</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The usual warnings if it cant read or write
the files involved.</p>

<p>BUGS Doesnt construct the %sizeof array for you.</p>

<p>It doesnt handle all C constructs, but it does attempt
to isolate definitions inside evals so that you can get at
the definitions that it can translate.</p>

<p>Its only intended as a rough tool. You may need to
dicker with the files produced.</p>

<p>You have to run this program by hand; its not run as
part of the Perl installation.</p>

<p>Doesn t handle complicated expressions built piecemeal,
a la:</p>

<p>enum { FIRST_VALUE, SECOND_VALUE, #ifdef ABC THIRD_VALUE
#endif };</p>

<p>Doesn t necessarily locate all of your C compiler s
internally-defined symbols.</p>
