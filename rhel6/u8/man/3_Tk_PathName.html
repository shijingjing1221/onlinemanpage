_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Each window managed by Tk has two names, a
short name that identifies a window among children of the
same parent, and a path name that identi- fies the window
uniquely among all the windows belonging to the same main
window. The path name is used more often in Tk than the
short name; many commands, like bind, expect path names as
arguments.</p>

<p>The Tk_Name macro returns a windows short name, which is
the same as the name argument passed to Tk_CreateWindow when
the window was cre- ated. The value is returned as a Tk_Uid,
which may be used just like a string pointer but also has
the properties of a unique identifier (see the manual entry
for Tk_GetUid for details).</p>

<p>The Tk_PathName macro returns a hierarchical name for
tkwin. Path names have a structure similar to file names in
Unix but with dots between elements instead of slashes: the
main window for an applica- tion has the path name .; its
children have names like .a and .b; their children have
names like .a.aa and .b.bb; and so on. A win- dow is
considered to be a child of another window for naming
purposes if the second window was named as the first windows
parent when the first window was created. This is not always
the same as the X window hierarchy. For example, a pop-up is
created as a child of the root window, but its logical
parent will usually be a window within the application.</p>

<p>The procedure Tk_NameToWindow returns the token for a
window given its path name (the pathName argument) and
another window belonging to the same main window (tkwin). It
normally returns a token for the named window, but if no
such window exists Tk_NameToWindow leaves an error message
in interp-&gt;result and returns NULL. The tkwin argument to
Tk_NameToWindow is needed because path names are only unique
within a single application hierarchy. If, for example, a
single process has opened two main windows, each will have a
separate naming hierarchy and the same path name might
appear in each of the hierarchies. Normally tkwin is the
main window of the desired hierarchy, but this need not be
the case: any window in the desired hierarchy may be
used.</p>
