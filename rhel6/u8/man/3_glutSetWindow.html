<p>NAME glutSetWindow - Select the &lt;i&gt;current
window&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>void glutSetWindow(int ID);</p>

<p>PARAMETERS ID Window identifier</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sets the current window to ID.</p>

<p>All OpenGL rendering goes to the current window . Many
OpenGLUT func- tions also implicitly use the current window
.</p>

<p>Many OpenGLUT callback operations are tied to a window.
When your call- back is invoked, OpenGLUT will set that
particular window to be the cur- rent window . However, some
callbacks---such as that registered via glutIdleFunc()---do
not have associated windows. If a callback is not associated
to a particular window, then when OpenGLUT invokes that
call- back you should always use glutSetWindow() to select
the appropriate window before doing any OpenGL rendering or
doing any OpenGLUT window- related operations.</p>

<p>There may be cases when you can get away with assuming
that the current window is unchanged since some prior time,
but OpenGLUT has consider- able liberaty with respect to
when it invokes your functions. Also, your program may add
more windows or more operations on other windows as you
develop it.</p>

<p>Lastly, this is a convenient way to select among
multiple windows for drawing without actually waiting for
that windows display callback. Simply set the current window
and draw immediately. This is not always advisable, but may
be practical.</p>

<p>It is an error to set the current window to a
non-existant window (e.g., one that you have closed). A
warning will be printed on stderr if you try to do so, and
the current window should be unchanged.</p>
