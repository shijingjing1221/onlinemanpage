<p>NAME htcacheclean - Clean up the disk cache</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS htcacheclean [ -D ] [ -v ] [ -t ] [ -r ] [ -n ]
-ppath -llimit</p>

<p>htcacheclean [ -n ] [ -t ] [ -i ] -dinterval -ppath
-llimit</p>

<p>SUMMARY htcacheclean is used to keep the size of
mod_disk_caches storage within a certain limit. This tool
can run either manually or in daemon mode. When running in
daemon mode, it sleeps in the background and checks the
cache directories at regular intervals for cached content to
be removed. You can stop the daemon cleanly by sending it a
TERM or INT signal.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -dinterval Daemonize and repeat cache cleaning
every interval minutes. This option is mutually exclusive
with the -D, -v and -r options. To shutdown the daemon
cleanly, just send it a SIGTERM or SIGINT.</p>

<p>-D Do a dry run and dont delete anything. This option is
mutually exclusive with the -d option.</p>

<p>-v Be verbose and print statistics. This option is
mutually exclu- sive with the -d option.</p>

<p>-r Clean thoroughly. This assumes that the Apache web
server is not running (otherwise you may get garbage in the
cache). This option is mutually exclusive with the -d option
and implies the -t option.</p>

<p>-n Be nice. This causes slower processing in favour of
other pro- cesses. htcacheclean will sleep from time to time
so that (a) the disk IO will be delayed and (b) the kernel
can schedule other processes in the meantime.</p>

<p>-t Delete all empty directories. By default only cache
files are removed, however with some configurations the
large number of directories created may require attention.
If your configuration requires a very large number of
directories, to the point that inode or file allocation
table exhaustion may become an issue, use of this option is
advised.</p>

<p>-ppath Specify path as the root directory of the disk
cache. This should be the same value as specified with the
CacheRoot direc- tive.</p>

<p>-llimit Specify limit as the total disk cache size
limit. The value is expressed in bytes by default (or
attaching B to the number). Attach K for Kbytes or M for
MBytes.</p>

<p>-i Be intelligent and run only when there was a
modification of the disk cache. This option is only possible
together with the -d option.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS htcacheclean returns a zero status
(&quot;true&quot;) if all operations were suc- cessful, 1
otherwise.</p>
