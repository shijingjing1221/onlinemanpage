<p>CTRLALTDEL(8) Linux Programmer s Manual
CTRLALTDEL(8)</p>

<p>NAME ctrlaltdel - set the function of the Ctrl-Alt-Del
combination</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ctrlaltdel hard|soft</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Based on examination of the
linux/kernel/sys.c code, it is clear that there are two
supported functions that the Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence can
perform: a hard reset, which immediately reboots the
computer without calling sync(2) and without any other
preparation; and a soft reset, which sends the SIGINT
(interrupt) signal to the init process (this is always the
process with PID 1). If this option is used, the init(8)
program must support this feature. Since there are now
several init(8) programs in the Linux community, please
consult the documentation for the version that you are
currently using.</p>

<p>ctrlaltdel is usually used in the /etc/rc.local
file.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/rc.local</p>
