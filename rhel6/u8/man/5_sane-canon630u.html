<p>sane-canon630u(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-canon630u(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-canon630u - SANE backend for the Canon 630u
USB flatbed scanner</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-canon630u library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
the following Canon flatbed scanners:</p>

<p>CanoScan 630u CanoScan 636u</p>

<p>Color scanning is supported at 75, 150, 300, and 600
dpi, and gamma and analog gain are adjustable.</p>

<p>TESTERS ARE WELCOME. Send your bug reports and comments
to Nathan Rut- man &lt;nthn1@yahoo.com&gt;</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the canon630u.conf file is
a list of device names that correspond to Canon USB
scanners. Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark
(#) are ignored. Only one device name can be listed in
canon630u.conf. The program sane-find-scanner helps to find
out the correct device. Under Linux, such a device name
could be /dev/usb/scan- ner0 for example. See sane-usb(5)
for details.</p>

<p>This product-specific scanner driver uses the
lower-level kernel USB driver &quot;scanner&quot;. Check for
&quot;Driver=usbscanner&quot; under /proc/bus/usb/devices.
If &quot;Driver=(none)&quot;, try forcing it with
&quot;insmod scanner vendor=0x04a9 product=0x2204&quot;</p>

<p>NOTES Due to Canon s unwillingness to provide scanner
documentation, this software was developed by analyzing the
USB traffic of the Windows 2000 driver. So things like the
calibration procedure I kind of made up; it seems to work
for my scanner. If you have complaints, let me know.</p>

<p>This driver requires the ability to send USB Control
Messages, avail- able in kernel 2.4.12 or later.</p>

<p>Some users have reported that this driver doesnt work at
all. This seems to be a hardware specific issue, although I
dont know what exactly the problem is. If you are having
problems, please send me the info in /proc/bus/usb/devices,
/proc/pci, the kernel scanner.c driver version from
/var/log/messages, and the output from
&quot;SANE_DEBUG_CANON630U=12 scanimage &gt;
/dev/null&quot;</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/canon630u.conf The backend
configuration file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR
below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-canon630u.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-canon630u.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>/tmp/canon.cal The calibration file used to normalize
pixel brightness. This is calculated every time the scanner
is first used after it has lost power. Deleting this file
will force recalibration.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_CANON630U If the library was compiled with
debug support enabled, this environment variable controls
the debug level for this backend. Higher debug levels
increase the verbosity of the output.</p>

<p>Example: SANE_DEBUG_CANON630U=12 scanimage &gt;
/dev/null</p>
