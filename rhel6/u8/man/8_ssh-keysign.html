<p>SSH-KEYSIGN(8) BSD System Manager s Manual
SSH-KEYSIGN(8)</p>

<p>NAME ssh-keysign - ssh helper program for host-based
authentication</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ssh-keysign</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ssh-keysign is used by ssh(1) to access the
local host keys and generate the digital signature required
during host-based authentication with SSH protocol version
2.</p>

<p>ssh-keysign is disabled by default and can only be
enabled in the global client configuration file
/etc/ssh/ssh_config by setting EnableSSHKeysign to yes.</p>

<p>ssh-keysign is not intended to be invoked by the user,
but from ssh(1). See ssh(1) and sshd(8) for more information
about host-based authentica- tion.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/ssh/ssh_config Controls whether ssh-keysign
is enabled.</p>

<p>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key, /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key,
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key These files contain the private
parts of the host keys used to generate the digital
signature. They should be owned by root, readable only by
root, and not accessible to others. Since they are readable
only by root, ssh-keysign must be set-uid root if host-based
authentication is used.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG The reseeding of the
OpenSSL random generator is usually done from /dev/urandom.
If the SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG environment vari- able is set to
value other than 0 the OpenSSL random generator is reseeded
from /dev/random. The number of bytes read is defined by the
SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG value. Minimum is 14 bytes. This set-
ting is not recommended on the computers without the
hardware random generator because insufficient entropy
causes the connec- tion to be blocked until enough entropy
is available.</p>

sshd(8)</p>

<p>HISTORY ssh-keysign first appeared in OpenBSD 3.2.</p>
