<p>NAME chmod - change file mode bits</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE... chmod
[OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE... chmod [OPTION]...
--reference=RFILE FILE...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents the GNU version
of chmod. chmod changes the file mode bits of each given
file according to mode, which can be either a symbolic
representation of changes to make, or an octal number
representing the bit pattern for the new mode bits.</p>

<p>The format of a symbolic mode is
[ugoa...][[+-=][perms...]...], where perms is either zero or
more letters from the set rwxXst, or a single letter from
the set ugo. Multiple symbolic modes can be given, sepa-
rated by commas.</p>

<p>A combination of the letters ugoa controls which users
access to the file will be changed: the user who owns it
(u), other users in the files group (g), other users not in
the files group (o), or all users (a). If none of these are
given, the effect is as if a were given, but bits that are
set in the umask are not affected.</p>

<p>The operator + causes the selected file mode bits to be
added to the existing file mode bits of each file; - causes
them to be removed; and = causes them to be added and causes
unmentioned bits to be removed except that a directorys
unmentioned set user and group ID bits are not affected.</p>

<p>The letters rwxXst select file mode bits for the
affected users: read (r), write (w), execute (or search for
directories) (x), execute/search only if the file is a
directory or already has execute permission for some user
(X), set user or group ID on execution (s), restricted dele-
tion flag or sticky bit (t). Instead of one or more of these
letters, you can specify exactly one of the letters ugo: the
permissions granted to the user who owns the file (u), the
permissions granted to other users who are members of the
files group (g), and the permissions granted to users that
are in neither of the two preceding categories (o).</p>

<p>A numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7),
derived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.
Omitted digits are assumed to be leading zeros. The first
digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and
restricted deletion or sticky (1) attributes. The second
digit selects permissions for the user who owns the file:
read (4), write (2), and execute (1); the third selects
permissions for other users in the files group, with the
same values; and the fourth for other users not in the file
s group, with the same values.</p>

<p>chmod never changes the permissions of symbolic links;
the chmod system call cannot change their permissions. This
is not a problem since the permissions of symbolic links are
never used. However, for each sym- bolic link listed on the
command line, chmod changes the permissions of the
pointed-to file. In contrast, chmod ignores symbolic links
encoun- tered during recursive directory traversals.</p>

<p>SETUID AND SETGID BITS chmod clears the set-group-ID bit
of a regular file if the files group ID does not match the
users effective group ID or one of the users supplementary
group IDs, unless the user has appropriate privileges.
Additional restrictions may cause the set-user-ID and
set-group-ID bits of MODE or RFILE to be ignored. This
behavior depends on the policy and functionality of the
underlying chmod system call. When in doubt, check the
underlying system behavior.</p>

<p>chmod preserves a directorys set-user-ID and
set-group-ID bits unless you explicitly specify otherwise.
You can set or clear the bits with symbolic modes like u+s
and g-s, and you can set (but not clear) the bits with a
numeric mode.</p>

<p>RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT The restricted
deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose
interpretation depends on the file type. For directories, it
prevents unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file
in the directory unless they own the file or the directory;
this is called the restricted deletion flag for the
directory, and is commonly found on world-writable
directories like /tmp. For regular files on some older
systems, the bit saves the programs text image on the swap
device so it will load more quickly when run; this is called
the sticky bit.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.</p>

<p>-c, --changes like verbose but report only when a change
is made</p>

<p>--no-preserve-root do not treat / specially (the
default)</p>

<p>--preserve-root fail to operate recursively on /</p>

<p>-f, --silent, --quiet suppress most error messages</p>

<p>-v, --verbose output a diagnostic for every file
processed</p>

<p>--reference=RFILE use RFILEs mode instead of MODE
values</p>

<p>-R, --recursive change files and directories
recursively</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>Each MODE is of the form
[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+.</p>
