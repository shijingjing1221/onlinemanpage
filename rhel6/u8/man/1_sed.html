<p>NAME sed - stream editor for filtering and transforming
text</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sed [OPTION]...
{script-only-if-no-other-script} [input-file]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sed is a stream editor. A stream editor is
used to perform basic text transformations on an input
stream (a file or input from a pipeline). While in some ways
similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as
ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s),
and is consequently more efficient. But it is seds ability
to filter text in a pipeline which particularly
distinguishes it from other types of editors.</p>

<p>-n, --quiet, --silent</p>

<p>suppress automatic printing of pattern space</p>

<p>-e script, --expression=script</p>

<p>add the script to the commands to be executed</p>

<p>-f script-file, --file=script-file</p>

<p>add the contents of script-file to the commands to be
executed</p>

<p>--follow-symlinks</p>

<p>follow symlinks when processing in place; hard links
will still be broken.</p>

<p>-i[SUFFIX], --in-place[=SUFFIX]</p>

<p>edit files in place (makes backup if extension
supplied). The default operation mode is to break symbolic
and hard links. This can be changed with --follow-symlinks
and --copy.</p>

<p>-c, --copy</p>

<p>use copy instead of rename when shuffling files in -i
mode. While this will avoid breaking links (symbolic or
hard), the resulting editing operation is not atomic. This
is rarely the desired mode; --follow-symlinks is usually
enough, and it is both faster and more secure.</p>

<p>-l N, --line-length=N</p>

<p>specify the desired line-wrap length for the l
command</p>

<p>--posix</p>

<p>disable all GNU extensions.</p>

<p>-r, --regexp-extended</p>

<p>use extended regular expressions in the script.</p>

<p>-s, --separate</p>

<p>consider files as separate rather than as a single
continuous long stream.</p>

<p>-u, --unbuffered</p>

<p>load minimal amounts of data from the input files and
flush the output buffers more often</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>If no -e, --expression, -f, or --file option is given,
then the first non-option argument is taken as the sed
script to interpret. All remaining arguments are names of
input files; if no input files are specified, then the
standard input is read.</p>

<p>COMMAND SYNOPSIS This is just a brief synopsis of sed
commands to serve as a reminder to those who already know
sed; other documentation (such as the texinfo document) must
be consulted for fuller descriptions.</p>

<p>Zero-addrescommands : label Label for b and t
commands.</p>

<p>#comment The comment extends until the next newline (or
the end of a -e script fragment).</p>

<p>} The closing bracket of a { } block.</p>

<p>Zero- or One- address commands = Print the current line
number.</p>

<p>a text Append text, which has each embedded newline
preceded by a back- slash.</p>

<p>i text Insert text, which has each embedded newline
preceded by a back- slash.</p>

<p>q [exit-code] Immediately quit the sed script without
processing any more input, except that if auto-print is not
disabled the current pattern space will be printed. The exit
code argument is a GNU extension.</p>

<p>Q [exit-code] Immediately quit the sed script without
processing any more input. This is a GNU extension.</p>

<p>r filename Append text read from filename.</p>

<p>R filename Append a line read from filename. Each
invocation of the com- mand reads a line from the file. This
is a GNU extension.</p>

<p>Commands which accept address ranges { Begin a block of
commands (end with a }).</p>

<p>b label Branch to label; if label is omitted, branch to
end of script.</p>

<p>t label If a s/// has done a successful substitution
since the last input line was read and since the last t or T
command, then branch to label; if label is omitted, branch
to end of script.</p>

<p>T label If no s/// has done a successful substitution
since the last input line was read and since the last t or T
command, then branch to label; if label is omitted, branch
to end of script. This is a GNU extension.</p>

<p>c text Replace the selected lines with text, which has
each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.</p>

<p>d Delete pattern space. Start next cycle.</p>

<p>D Delete up to the first embedded newline in the pattern
space. Start next cycle, but skip reading from the input if
there is still data in the pattern space.</p>

<p>h H Copy/append pattern space to hold space.</p>

<p>g G Copy/append hold space to pattern space.</p>

<p>x Exchange the contents of the hold and pattern
spaces.</p>

<p>l List out the current line in a visually unambiguous
form.</p>

<p>l width List out the current line in a visually
unambiguous form, breaking it at width characters. This is a
GNU extension.</p>

<p>n N Read/append the next line of input into the pattern
space.</p>

<p>p Print the current pattern space.</p>

<p>P Print up to the first embedded newline of the current
pattern space.</p>

<p>s/regexp/replacement/ Attempt to match regexp against
the pattern space. If success- ful, replace that portion
matched with replacement. The replacement may contain the
special character &amp; to refer to that portion of the
pattern space which matched, and the special escapes 1
through 9 to refer to the corresponding matching
sub-expressions in the regexp.</p>

<p>w filename Write the current pattern space to
filename.</p>

<p>W filename Write the first line of the current pattern
space to filename. This is a GNU extension.</p>

<p>y/source/dest/ Transliterate the characters in the
pattern space which appear in source to the corresponding
character in dest.</p>

<p>Addresses Sed commands can be given with no addresses,
in which case the command will be executed for all input
lines; with one address, in which case the command will only
be executed for input lines which match that address; or
with two addresses, in which case the command will be exe-
cuted for all input lines which match the inclusive range of
lines starting from the first address and continuing to the
second address. Three things to note about address ranges:
the syntax is addr1,addr2 (i.e., the addresses are separated
by a comma); the line which addr1 matched will always be
accepted, even if addr2 selects an earlier line; and if
addr2 is a regexp, it will not be tested against the line
that addr1 matched.</p>

<p>After the address (or address-range), and before the
command, a ! may be inserted, which specifies that the
command shall only be executed if the address (or
address-range) does not match.</p>

<p>The following address types are supported:</p>

<p>number Match only the specified line number.</p>

<p>first~step Match every stepth line starting with line
first. For example, sed -n 1~2p will print all the
odd-numbered lines in the input stream, and the address 2~5
will match every fifth line, starting with the second. first
can be zero; in this case, sed operates as if it were equal
to step. (This is an extension.)</p>

<p>$ Match the last line.</p>

<p>/regexp/ Match lines matching the regular expression
regexp.</p>

<p>Match lines matching the regular expression regexp. The
c may be any character.</p>

<p>GNU sed also supports some special 2-address forms:</p>

<p>0,addr2 Start out in &quot;matched first address&quot;
state, until addr2 is found. This is similar to 1,addr2,
except that if addr2 matches the very first line of input
the 0,addr2 form will be at the end of its range, whereas
the 1,addr2 form will still be at the beginning of its
range. This works only when addr2 is a regular
expression.</p>

<p>addr1,+N Will match addr1 and the N lines following
addr1.</p>

<p>addr1,~N Will match addr1 and the lines following addr1
until the next line whose input line number is a multiple of
N.</p>

<p>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS POSIX.2 BREs should be supported,
but they aren t completely because of performance problems.
The n sequence in a regular expression matches the newline
character, and similarly fora,t, and other sequences.</p>
