<p>Tcl_BackgroundError(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_BackgroundError(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_BackgroundError - report Tcl error that
occurred in background pro- cessing</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_BackgroundError(interp)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter in which
the error occurred.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This procedure is typically invoked when a
Tcl error occurs during background processing such as
executing an event handler. When such an error occurs, the
error condition is reported to Tcl or to a widget or some
other C code, and there is not usually any obvious way for
that code to report the error to the user. In these cases
the code calls Tcl_BackgroundError with an interp argument
identifying the interpreter in which the error occurred. At
the time Tcl_BackgroundError is invoked, the interpreters
result is expected to contain an error mes- sage.
Tcl_BackgroundError will invoke the command registered in
that interpreter to handle background errors by the interp
bgerror command. The registered handler command is meant to
report the error in an application-specific fashion. The
handler command receives two argu- ments, the result of the
interp, and the return options of the interp at the time the
error occurred. If the application registers no han- dler
command, the default handler command will attempt to call
bgerror to report the error. If an error condition arises
while invoking the handler command, then Tcl_BackgroundError
reports the error itself by printing a message on the
standard error file.</p>

<p>Tcl_BackgroundError does not invoke the handler command
immediately because this could potentially interfere with
scripts that are in pro- cess at the time the error
occurred. Instead, it invokes the handler command later as
an idle callback.</p>

<p>It is possible for many background errors to accumulate
before the han- dler command is invoked. When this happens,
each of the errors is pro- cessed in order. However, if the
handle command returns a break excep- tion, then all
remaining error reports for the interpreter are skipped.</p>
