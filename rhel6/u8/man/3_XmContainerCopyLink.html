<p>NAME XmContainerCopyLink Container widget function to
copy links to the clipboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Container.h&gt; Boolean
XmContainerCopyLink( Widget container, Time timestamp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmContainerCopyLink copies links to the
primary selected items to the clipboard. This routine calls
the XmNconvertCallback procedures, pos- sibly multiple
times, with the selection member of the XmConvertCall-
backStruct set to CLIPBOARD and with the parm member set to
XmLINK. The Container widget itself does not copy any links;
XmNconvertCallback procedures are responsible for copying
the link to the clipboard and for taking any related
actions.</p>

<p>container Specifies the Container widget ID.</p>

<p>timestamp Specifies the server time at which to modify
the selection value.</p>

<p>For a complete definition of Container and its
associated resources, see XmContainer(3).</p>

<p>RETURN The function returns False in the following
cases: if the primary selection is NULL, if the widget does
not own the primary selection, or if the function is unable
to gain ownership of the clipboard selection. Otherwise, it
returns True.</p>
