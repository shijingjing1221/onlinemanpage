<p>MYISAMCHK(1) MySQL Database System MYISAMCHK(1)</p>

<p>NAME myisamchk - MyISAM table-maintenance utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS myisamchk [options] tbl_name ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The myisamchk utility gets information about
your database tables or checks, repairs, or optimizes them.
myisamchk works with MyISAM tables (tables that have .MYD
and .MYI files for storing data and indexes).</p>

<p>You can also use the CHECK TABLE and REPAIR TABLE
statements to check and repair MyISAM tables. See Section
13.7.2.3, CHECK TABLE Syntax, and Section 13.7.2.6, REPAIR
TABLE Syntax.</p>

<p>The use of myisamchk with partitioned tables is not
supported.</p>

<p>Caution It is best to make a backup of a table before
performing a table repair operation; under some
circumstances the operation might cause data loss. Possible
causes include but are not limited to file system
errors.</p>

<p>Invoke myisamchk like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; myisamchk [options] tbl_name ...</p>

<p>The options specify what you want myisamchk to do. They
are described in the following sections. You can also get a
list of options by invoking myisamchk --help.</p>

<p>With no options, myisamchk simply checks your table as
the default operation. To get more information or to tell
myisamchk to take corrective action, specify options as
described in the following discussion.</p>

<p>tbl_name is the database table you want to check or
repair. If you run myisamchk somewhere other than in the
database directory, you must specify the path to the
database directory, because myisamchk has no idea where the
database is located. In fact, myisamchk does not actually
care whether the files you are working on are located in a
database directory. You can copy the files that correspond
to a database table into some other location and perform
recovery operations on them there.</p>

<p>You can name several tables on the myisamchk command
line if you wish. You can also specify a table by naming its
index file (the file with the .MYI suffix). This enables you
to specify all tables in a directory by using the pattern
*.MYI. For example, if you are in a database directory, you
can check all the MyISAM tables in that directory like
this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; myisamchk *.MYI</p>

<p>If you are not in the database directory, you can check
all the tables there by specifying the path to the
directory:</p>

<p>shell&gt; myisamchk /path/to/database_dir/*.MYI</p>

<p>You can even check all tables in all databases by
specifying a wildcard with the path to the MySQL data
directory:</p>

<p>shell&gt; myisamchk /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI</p>

<p>The recommended way to quickly check all MyISAM tables
is:</p>

<p>shell&gt; myisamchk --silent --fast
/path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI</p>

<p>If you want to check all MyISAM tables and repair any
that are corrupted, you can use the following command:</p>

<p>shell&gt; myisamchk --silent --force --fast
--update-state --key_buffer_size=64M
--myisam_sort_buffer_size=64M --read_buffer_size=1M
--write_buffer_size=1M /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI</p>

<p>This command assumes that you have more than 64MB free.
For more information about memory allocation with myisamchk,
see the section called MYISAMCHK MEMORY USAGE.</p>

<p>For additional information about using myisamchk, see
Section 7.6, MyISAM Table Maintenance and Crash
Recovery.</p>

<p>Important You must ensure that no other program is using
the tables while you are running myisamchk. The most
effective means of doing so is to shut down the MySQL server
while running myisamchk, or to lock all tables that
myisamchk is being used on.</p>

<p>Otherwise, when you run myisamchk, it may display the
following error message:</p>

<p>warning: clients are using or haven&rsquo;t closed the
table properly</p>

<p>This means that you are trying to check a table that has
been updated by another program (such as the mysqld server)
that hasn&rsquo;t yet closed the file or that has died
without closing the file properly, which can sometimes lead
to the corruption of one or more MyISAM tables.</p>

<p>If mysqld is running, you must force it to flush any
table modifications that are still buffered in memory by
using FLUSH TABLES. You should then ensure that no one is
using the tables while you are running myisamchk</p>

<p>However, the easiest way to avoid this problem is to use
CHECK TABLE instead of myisamchk to check tables. See
Section 13.7.2.3, CHECK TABLE Syntax.</p>

<p>myisamchk supports the following options, which can be
specified on the command line or in the [myisamchk] group of
an option file. myisamchk also supports the options for
processing option files described at Section 4.2.3.4,
Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling.</p>

<p>MYISAMCHK GENERAL OPTIONS The options described in this
section can be used for any type of table maintenance
operation performed by myisamchk. The sections following
this one describe options that pertain only to specific
operations, such as table checking or repairing.</p>

<p>&middot; --help, -?</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit. Options are grouped by
type of operation.</p>

<p>&middot; --HELP, -H</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit. Options are presented
in a single list.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug=debug_options, -# debug_options</p>

<p>Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
&rsquo;d:t:o,file_name&rsquo;. The default is
&rsquo;d:t:o,/tmp/myisamchk.trace&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&middot; --silent, -s</p>

<p>Silent mode. Write output only when errors occur. You
can use -s twice (-ss) to make myisamchk very silent.</p>

<p>&middot; --verbose, -v</p>

<p>Verbose mode. Print more information about what the
program does. This can be used with -d and -e. Use -v
multiple times (-vv, -vvv) for even more output.</p>

<p>&middot; --version, -V</p>

<p>Display version information and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --wait, -w</p>

<p>Instead of terminating with an error if the table is
locked, wait until the table is unlocked before continuing.
If you are running mysqld with external locking disabled,
the table can be locked only by another myisamchk
command.</p>

<p>You can also set the following variables by using
--var_name=value syntax:</p>

<p>+-----------------------+-------------------+ |Variable
| Default Value |
+-----------------------+-------------------+ |decode_bits |
9 | +-----------------------+-------------------+
|ft_max_word_len | version-dependent |
+-----------------------+-------------------+
|ft_min_word_len | 4 |
+-----------------------+-------------------+
|ft_stopword_file | built-in list |
+-----------------------+-------------------+
|key_buffer_size | 523264 |
+-----------------------+-------------------+
|myisam_block_size | 1024 |
+-----------------------+-------------------+
|myisam_sort_key_blocks | 16 |
+-----------------------+-------------------+
|read_buffer_size | 262136 |
+-----------------------+-------------------+
|sort_buffer_size | 2097144 |
+-----------------------+-------------------+
|sort_key_blocks | 16 |
+-----------------------+-------------------+ |stats_method
| nulls_unequal |
+-----------------------+-------------------+
|write_buffer_size | 262136 |
+-----------------------+-------------------+</p>

<p>The possible myisamchk variables and their default
values can be examined with myisamchk --help:</p>

<p>sort_buffer_size is used when the keys are repaired by
sorting keys, which is the normal case when you use
--recover. As of MySQL 5.1.67, myisam_sort_buffer_size is
available as an alternative name to sort_buffer_size.
myisam_sort_buffer_size is preferable to sort_buffer_size
because its name corresponds to the myisam_sort_buffer_size
server system variable that has a similar meaning.
sort_buffer_size should be considered deprecated.</p>

<p>key_buffer_size is used when you are checking the table
with --extend-check or when the keys are repaired by
inserting keys row by row into the table (like when doing
normal inserts). Repairing through the key buffer is used in
the following cases:</p>

<p>&middot; You use --safe-recover.</p>

<p>&middot; The temporary files needed to sort the keys
would be more than twice as big as when creating the key
file directly. This is often the case when you have large
key values for CHAR, VARCHAR, or TEXT columns, because the
sort operation needs to store the complete key values as it
proceeds. If you have lots of temporary space and you can
force myisamchk to repair by sorting, you can use the
--sort-recover option.</p>

<p>Repairing through the key buffer takes much less disk
space than using sorting, but is also much slower.</p>

<p>If you want a faster repair, set the key_buffer_size and
myisam_sort_buffer_size variables to about 25% of your
available memory. You can set both variables to large
values, because only one of them is used at a time.</p>

<p>myisam_block_size is the size used for index blocks.</p>

<p>stats_method influences how NULL values are treated for
index statistics collection when the --analyze option is
given. It acts like the myisam_stats_method system variable.
For more information, see the description of
myisam_stats_method in Section 5.1.4, Server System
Variables , and Section 8.5.4, InnoDB and MyISAM Index
Statistics Collection.</p>

<p>ft_min_word_len and ft_max_word_len indicate the minimum
and maximum word length for FULLTEXT indexes.
ft_stopword_file names the stopword file. These need to be
set under the following circumstances.</p>

<p>If you use myisamchk to perform an operation that
modifies table indexes (such as repair or analyze), the
FULLTEXT indexes are rebuilt using the default full-text
parameter values for minimum and maximum word length and the
stopword file unless you specify otherwise. This can result
in queries failing.</p>

<p>The problem occurs because these parameters are known
only by the server. They are not stored in MyISAM index
files. To avoid the problem if you have modified the minimum
or maximum word length or the stopword file in the server,
specify the same ft_min_word_len, ft_max_word_len, and
ft_stopword_file values to myisamchk that you use for
mysqld. For example, if you have set the minimum word length
to 3, you can repair a table with myisamchk like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; myisamchk --recover --ft_min_word_len=3
tbl_name.MYI</p>

<p>To ensure that myisamchk and the server use the same
values for full-text parameters, you can place each one in
both the [mysqld] and [myisamchk] sections of an option
file:</p>

<p>[mysqld] ft_min_word_len=3 [myisamchk]
ft_min_word_len=3</p>

<p>An alternative to using myisamchk is to use the REPAIR
TABLE, ANALYZE TABLE, OPTIMIZE TABLE, or ALTER TABLE. These
statements are performed by the server, which knows the
proper full-text parameter values to use.</p>

<p>MYISAMCHK CHECK OPTIONS myisamchk supports the following
options for table checking operations:</p>

<p>&middot; --check, -c</p>

<p>Check the table for errors. This is the default
operation if you specify no option that selects an operation
type explicitly.</p>

<p>&middot; --check-only-changed, -C</p>

<p>Check only tables that have changed since the last
check.</p>

<p>&middot; --extend-check, -e</p>

<p>Check the table very thoroughly. This is quite slow if
the table has many indexes. This option should only be used
in extreme cases. Normally, myisamchk or myisamchk
--medium-check should be able to determine whether there are
any errors in the table.</p>

<p>If you are using --extend-check and have plenty of
memory, setting the key_buffer_size variable to a large
value helps the repair operation run faster.</p>

<p>See also the description of this option under table
repair options.</p>

<p>For a description of the output format, see the section
called OBTAINING TABLE INFORMATION WITH MYISAMCHK.</p>

<p>&middot; --fast, -F</p>

<p>Check only tables that haven&rsquo;t been closed
properly.</p>

<p>&middot; --force, -f</p>

<p>Do a repair operation automatically if myisamchk finds
any errors in the table. The repair type is the same as that
specified with the --recover or -r option.</p>

<p>&middot; --information, -i</p>

<p>Print informational statistics about the table that is
checked.</p>

<p>&middot; --medium-check, -m</p>

<p>Do a check that is faster than an --extend-check
operation. This finds only 99.99% of all errors, which
should be good enough in most cases.</p>

<p>&middot; --read-only, -T</p>

<p>Do not mark the table as checked. This is useful if you
use myisamchk to check a table that is in use by some other
application that does not use locking, such as mysqld when
run with external locking disabled.</p>

<p>&middot; --update-state, -U</p>

<p>Store information in the .MYI file to indicate when the
table was checked and whether the table crashed. This should
be used to get full benefit of the --check-only-changed
option, but you shouldn&rsquo;t use this option if the
mysqld server is using the table and you are running it with
external locking disabled.</p>

<p>MYISAMCHK REPAIR OPTIONS myisamchk supports the
following options for table repair operations (operations
performed when an option such as --recover or --safe-recover
is given):</p>

<p>&middot; --backup, -B</p>

<p>Make a backup of the .MYD file as file_name-time.BAK</p>

<p>&middot; --character-sets-dir=path</p>

<p>The directory where character sets are installed. See
Section 10.5, Character Set Configuration.</p>

<p>&middot; --correct-checksum</p>

<p>Correct the checksum information for the table.</p>

<p>&middot; --data-file-length=len, -D len</p>

<p>The maximum length of the data file (when re-creating
data file when it is full).</p>

<p>&middot; --extend-check, -e</p>

<p>Do a repair that tries to recover every possible row
from the data file. Normally, this also finds a lot of
garbage rows. Do not use this option unless you are
desperate.</p>

<p>See also the description of this option under table
checking options.</p>

<p>For a description of the output format, see the section
called OBTAINING TABLE INFORMATION WITH MYISAMCHK.</p>

<p>&middot; --force, -f</p>

<p>Overwrite old intermediate files (files with names like
tbl_name.TMD) instead of aborting.</p>

<p>&middot; --keys-used=val, -k val</p>

<p>For myisamchk, the option value is a bit-value that
indicates which indexes to update. Each binary bit of the
option value corresponds to a table index, where the first
index is bit 0. An option value of 0 disables updates to all
indexes, which can be used to get faster inserts.
Deactivated indexes can be reactivated by using myisamchk
-r.</p>

<p>&middot; --no-symlinks, -l</p>

<p>Do not follow symbolic links. Normally myisamchk repairs
the table that a symlink points to. This option does not
exist as of MySQL 4.0 because versions from 4.0 on do not
remove symlinks during repair operations.</p>

<p>&middot; --max-record-length=len</p>

<p>Skip rows larger than the given length if myisamchk
cannot allocate memory to hold them.</p>

<p>&middot; --parallel-recover, -p</p>

<p>Use the same technique as -r and -n, but create all the
keys in parallel, using different threads. This is
beta-quality code. Use at your own risk!</p>

<p>&middot; --quick, -q</p>

<p>Achieve a faster repair by modifying only the index
file, not the data file. You can specify this option twice
to force myisamchk to modify the original data file in case
of duplicate keys.</p>

<p>&middot; --recover, -r</p>

<p>Do a repair that can fix almost any problem except
unique keys that are not unique (which is an extremely
unlikely error with MyISAM tables). If you want to recover a
table, this is the option to try first. You should try
--safe-recover only if myisamchk reports that the table
cannot be recovered using --recover. (In the unlikely case
that --recover fails, the data file remains intact.)</p>

<p>If you have lots of memory, you should increase the
value of myisam_sort_buffer_size.</p>

<p>&middot; --safe-recover, -o</p>

<p>Do a repair using an old recovery method that reads
through all rows in order and updates all index trees based
on the rows found. This is an order of magnitude slower than
--recover, but can handle a couple of very unlikely cases
that --recover cannot. This recovery method also uses much
less disk space than --recover. Normally, you should repair
first using --recover, and then with --safe-recover only if
--recover fails.</p>

<p>If you have lots of memory, you should increase the
value of key_buffer_size.</p>

<p>&middot; --set-character-set=name</p>

<p>Change the character set used by the table indexes. This
option was replaced by --set-collation in MySQL 5.0.3.</p>

<p>&middot; --set-collation=name</p>

<p>Specify the collation to use for sorting table indexes.
The character set name is implied by the first part of the
collation name.</p>

<p>&middot; --sort-recover, -n</p>

<p>Force myisamchk to use sorting to resolve the keys even
if the temporary files would be very large.</p>

<p>&middot; --tmpdir=path, -t path</p>

<p>The path of the directory to be used for storing
temporary files. If this is not set, myisamchk uses the
value of the TMPDIR environment variable. --tmpdir can be
set to a list of directory paths that are used successively
in round-robin fashion for creating temporary files. The
separator character between directory names is the colon (:)
on Unix and the semicolon (;) on Windows, NetWare, and
OS/2.</p>

<p>&middot; --unpack, -u</p>

<p>Unpack a table that was packed with myisampack.</p>

<p>OTHER MYISAMCHK OPTIONS myisamchk supports the following
options for actions other than table checks and repairs:</p>

<p>&middot; --analyze, -a</p>

<p>Analyze the distribution of key values. This improves
join performance by enabling the join optimizer to better
choose the order in which to join the tables and which
indexes it should use. To obtain information about the key
distribution, use a myisamchk --description --verbose
tbl_name command or the SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name
statement.</p>

<p>&middot; --block-search=offset, -b offset</p>

<p>Find the record that a block at the given offset belongs
to.</p>

<p>&middot; --description, -d</p>

<p>Print some descriptive information about the table.
Specifying the --verbose option once or twice produces
additional information. See the section called OBTAINING
TABLE INFORMATION WITH MYISAMCHK.</p>

<p>&middot; --set-auto-increment[=value], -A[value]</p>

<p>Force AUTO_INCREMENT numbering for new records to start
at the given value (or higher, if there are existing records
with AUTO_INCREMENT values this large). If value is not
specified, AUTO_INCREMENT numbers for new records begin with
the largest value currently in the table, plus one.</p>

<p>&middot; --sort-index, -S</p>

<p>Sort the index tree blocks in high-low order. This
optimizes seeks and makes table scans that use indexes
faster.</p>

<p>&middot; --sort-records=N, -R N</p>

<p>Sort records according to a particular index. This makes
your data much more localized and may speed up range-based
SELECT and ORDER BY operations that use this index. (The
first time you use this option to sort a table, it may be
very slow.) To determine a table&rsquo;s index numbers, use
SHOW INDEX, which displays a table&rsquo;s indexes in the
same order that myisamchk sees them. Indexes are numbered
beginning with 1.</p>

<p>If keys are not packed (PACK_KEYS=0), they have the same
length, so when myisamchk sorts and moves records, it just
overwrites record offsets in the index. If keys are packed
(PACK_KEYS=1), myisamchk must unpack key blocks first, then
re-create indexes and pack the key blocks again. (In this
case, re-creating indexes is faster than updating offsets
for each index.)</p>

<p>OBTAINING TABLE INFORMATION WITH MYISAMCHK To obtain a
description of a MyISAM table or statistics about it, use
the commands shown here. The output from these commands is
explained later in this section.</p>

<p>&middot; myisamchk -d tbl_name</p>

<p>Runs myisamchk in describe mode to produce a description
of your table. If you start the MySQL server with external
locking disabled, myisamchk may report an error for a table
that is updated while it runs. However, because myisamchk
does not change the table in describe mode, there is no risk
of destroying data.</p>

<p>&middot; myisamchk -dv tbl_name</p>

<p>Adding -v runs myisamchk in verbose mode so that it
produces more information about the table. Adding -v a
second time produces even more information.</p>

<p>&middot; myisamchk -eis tbl_name</p>

<p>Shows only the most important information from a table.
This operation is slow because it must read the entire
table.</p>

<p>&middot; myisamchk -eiv tbl_name</p>

<p>This is like -eis, but tells you what is being done.</p>

<p>The tbl_name argument can be either the name of a MyISAM
table or the name of its index file, as described in
myisamchk(1). Multiple tbl_name arguments can be given.</p>

<p>Suppose that a table named person has the following
structure. (The MAX_ROWS table option is included so that in
the example output from myisamchk shown later, some values
are smaller and fit the output format more easily.)</p>

<p>CREATE TABLE person ( id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
last_name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, first_name VARCHAR(20) NOT
NULL, birth DATE, death DATE, PRIMARY KEY (id), INDEX
(last_name, first_name), INDEX (birth) ) MAX_ROWS =
1000000;</p>

<p>Suppose also that the table has these data and index
file sizes:</p>

<p>-rw-rw---- 1 mysql mysql 9347072 Aug 19 11:47 person.MYD
-rw-rw---- 1 mysql mysql 6066176 Aug 19 11:47 person.MYI</p>

<p>Example of myisamchk -dvv output:</p>

<p>MyISAM file: person Record format: Packed Character set:

<p>Explanations for the types of information myisamchk
produces are given here. Keyfile refers to the index file.
Record and row are synonymous, as are field and column.</p>

<p>The initial part of the table description contains these
values:</p>

<p>&middot; MyISAM file</p>

<p>Name of the MyISAM (index) file.</p>

<p>&middot; Record format</p>

<p>The format used to store table rows. The preceding
examples use Fixed length. Other possible values are
Compressed and Packed. (Packed corresponds to what SHOW
TABLE STATUS reports as Dynamic.)</p>

<p>&middot; Chararacter set</p>

<p>The table default character set.</p>

<p>&middot; File-version</p>

<p>Version of MyISAM format. Currently always 1.</p>

<p>&middot; Creation time</p>

<p>When the data file was created.</p>

<p>&middot; Recover time</p>

<p>When the index/data file was last reconstructed.</p>

<p>&middot; Status</p>

<p>Table status flags. Possible values are crashed, open,
changed, analyzed, optimized keys, and sorted index
pages.</p>

<p>&middot; Auto increment key, Last value</p>

<p>The key number associated the table&rsquo;s
AUTO_INCREMENT column, and the most recently generated value
for this column. These fields do not appear if there is no
such column.</p>

<p>&middot; Data records</p>

<p>The number of rows in the table.</p>

<p>&middot; Deleted blocks</p>

<p>How many deleted blocks still have reserved space. You
can optimize your table to minimize this space. See Section
7.6.4, MyISAM Table Optimization.</p>

<p>&middot; Datafile parts</p>

<p>For dynamic-row format, this indicates how many data
blocks there are. For an optimized table without fragmented
rows, this is the same as Data records.</p>

<p>&middot; Deleted data</p>

<p>How many bytes of unreclaimed deleted data there are.
You can optimize your table to minimize this space. See
Section 7.6.4, MyISAM Table Optimization.</p>

<p>&middot; Datafile pointer</p>

<p>The size of the data file pointer, in bytes. It is
usually 2, 3, 4, or 5 bytes. Most tables manage with 2
bytes, but this cannot be controlled from MySQL yet. For
fixed tables, this is a row address. For dynamic tables,
this is a byte address.</p>

<p>&middot; Keyfile pointer</p>

<p>The size of the index file pointer, in bytes. It is
usually 1, 2, or 3 bytes. Most tables manage with 2 bytes,
but this is calculated automatically by MySQL. It is always
a block address.</p>

<p>&middot; Max datafile length</p>

<p>How long the table data file can become, in bytes.</p>

<p>&middot; Max keyfile length</p>

<p>How long the table index file can become, in bytes.</p>

<p>&middot; Recordlength</p>

<p>How much space each row takes, in bytes.</p>

<p>The table description part of the output includes a list
of all keys in the table. For each key, myisamchk displays
some low-level information:</p>

<p>&middot; Key</p>

<p>This key&rsquo;s number. This value is shown only for
the first column of the key. If this value is missing, the
line corresponds to the second or later column of a
multiple-column key. For the table shown in the example,
there are two table description lines for the second index.
This indicates that it is a multiple-part index with two
parts.</p>

<p>&middot; Start</p>

<p>Where in the row this portion of the index starts.</p>

<p>&middot; Len</p>

<p>How long this portion of the index is. For packed
numbers, this should always be the full length of the
column. For strings, it may be shorter than the full length
of the indexed column, because you can index a prefix of a
string column. The total length of a multiple-part key is
the sum of the Len values for all key parts.</p>

<p>&middot; Index</p>

<p>Whether a key value can exist multiple times in the
index. Possible values are unique or multip. (multiple).</p>

<p>&middot; Type</p>

<p>What data type this portion of the index has. This is a
MyISAM data type with the possible values packed, stripped,
or empty.</p>

<p>&middot; Root</p>

<p>Address of the root index block.</p>

<p>&middot; Blocksize</p>

<p>The size of each index block. By default this is 1024,
but the value may be changed at compile time when MySQL is
built from source.</p>

<p>&middot; Rec/key</p>

<p>This is a statistical value used by the optimizer. It
tells how many rows there are per value for this index. A
unique index always has a value of 1. This may be updated
after a table is loaded (or greatly changed) with myisamchk
-a. If this is not updated at all, a default value of 30 is
given.</p>

<p>The last part of the output provides information about
each column:</p>

<p>&middot; Field</p>

<p>The column number.</p>

<p>&middot; Start</p>

<p>The byte position of the column within table rows.</p>

<p>&middot; Length</p>

<p>The length of the column in bytes.</p>

<p>&middot; Nullpos, Nullbit</p>

<p>For columns that can be NULL, MyISAM stores NULL values
as a flag in a byte. Depending on how many nullable columns
there are, there can be one or more bytes used for this
purpose. The Nullpos and Nullbit values, if nonempty,
indicate which byte and bit contains that flag indicating
whether the column is NULL.</p>

<p>The position and number of bytes used to store NULL
flags is shown in the line for field 1. This is why there
are six Field lines for the person table even though it has
only five columns.</p>

<p>&middot; Type</p>

<p>The data type. The value may contain any of the
following descriptors:</p>

<p>&middot; constant</p>

<p>All rows have the same value.</p>

<p>&middot; no endspace</p>

<p>Do not store endspace.</p>

<p>&middot; no endspace, not_always</p>

<p>Do not store endspace and do not do endspace compression
for all values.</p>

<p>&middot; no endspace, no empty</p>

<p>Do not store endspace. Do not store empty values.</p>

<p>&middot; table-lookup</p>

<p>The column was converted to an ENUM.</p>

<p>&middot; zerofill(N)</p>

<p>The most significant N bytes in the value are always 0
and are not stored.</p>

<p>&middot; no zeros</p>

<p>Do not store zeros.</p>

<p>&middot; always zero</p>

<p>Zero values are stored using one bit.</p>

<p>&middot; Huff tree</p>

<p>The number of the Huffman tree associated with the
column.</p>

<p>&middot; Bits</p>

<p>The number of bits used in the Huffman tree.</p>

<p>The Huff tree and Bits fields are displayed if the table
has been compressed with myisampack. See myisampack(1), for
an example of this information.</p>

<p>myisamchk -eiv output includes the following
information:</p>

<p>&middot; Data records</p>

<p>The number of rows in the table.</p>

<p>&middot; Deleted blocks</p>

<p>How many deleted blocks still have reserved space. You
can optimize your table to minimize this space. See Section
7.6.4, MyISAM Table Optimization.</p>

<p>&middot; Key</p>

<p>The key number.</p>

<p>&middot; Keyblocks used</p>

<p>What percentage of the keyblocks are used. When a table
has just been reorganized with myisamchk, the values are
very high (very near theoretical maximum).</p>

<p>&middot; Packed</p>

<p>MySQL tries to pack key values that have a common
suffix. This can only be used for indexes on CHAR and
VARCHAR columns. For long indexed strings that have similar
leftmost parts, this can significantly reduce the space
used. In the preceding example, the second key is 40 bytes
long and a 97% reduction in space is achieved.</p>

<p>&middot; Max levels</p>

<p>How deep the B-tree for this key is. Large tables with
long key values get high values.</p>

<p>&middot; Records</p>

<p>How many rows are in the table.</p>

<p>&middot; M.recordlength</p>

<p>The average row length. This is the exact row length for
tables with fixed-length rows, because all rows have the
same length.</p>

<p>&middot; Packed</p>

<p>MySQL strips spaces from the end of strings. The Packed
value indicates the percentage of savings achieved by doing
this.</p>

<p>&middot; Recordspace used</p>

<p>What percentage of the data file is used.</p>

<p>&middot; Empty space</p>

<p>What percentage of the data file is unused.</p>

<p>&middot; Blocks/Record</p>

<p>Average number of blocks per row (that is, how many
links a fragmented row is composed of). This is always 1.0
for fixed-format tables. This value should stay as close to
1.0 as possible. If it gets too large, you can reorganize
the table. See Section 7.6.4, MyISAM Table Optimization.</p>

<p>&middot; Recordblocks</p>

<p>How many blocks (links) are used. For fixed-format
tables, this is the same as the number of rows.</p>

<p>&middot; Deleteblocks</p>

<p>How many blocks (links) are deleted.</p>

<p>&middot; Recorddata</p>

<p>How many bytes in the data file are used.</p>

<p>&middot; Deleted data</p>

<p>How many bytes in the data file are deleted
(unused).</p>

<p>&middot; Lost space</p>

<p>If a row is updated to a shorter length, some space is
lost. This is the sum of all such losses, in bytes.</p>

<p>&middot; Linkdata</p>

<p>When the dynamic table format is used, row fragments are
linked with pointers (4 to 7 bytes each). Linkdata is the
sum of the amount of storage used by all such pointers.</p>

<p>MYISAMCHK MEMORY USAGE Memory allocation is important
when you run myisamchk. myisamchk uses no more memory than
its memory-related variables are set to. If you are going to
use myisamchk on very large tables, you should first decide
how much memory you want it to use. The default is to use
only about 3MB to perform repairs. By using larger values,
you can get myisamchk to operate faster. For example, if you
have more than 512MB RAM available, you could use options
such as these (in addition to any other options you might
specify):</p>

<p>shell&gt; myisamchk --myisam_sort_buffer_size=256M
--key_buffer_size=512M --read_buffer_size=64M
--write_buffer_size=64M ...</p>

<p>Using --myisam_sort_buffer_size=16M is probably enough
for most cases.</p>

<p>Be aware that myisamchk uses temporary files in TMPDIR.
If TMPDIR points to a memory file system, out of memory
errors can easily occur. If this happens, run myisamchk with
the --tmpdir=path option to specify a directory located on a
file system that has more space.</p>

<p>When performing repair operations, myisamchk also needs
a lot of disk space:</p>

<p>&middot; Twice the size of the data file (the original
file and a copy). This space is not needed if you do a
repair with --quick; in this case, only the index file is
re-created. This space must be available on the same file
system as the original data file, as the copy is created in
the same directory as the original.</p>

<p>&middot; Space for the new index file that replaces the
old one. The old index file is truncated at the start of the
repair operation, so you usually ignore this space. This
space must be available on the same file system as the
original data file.</p>

<p>&middot; When using --recover or --sort-recover (but not
when using --safe-recover), you need space on disk for
sorting. This space is allocated in the temporary directory
(specified by TMPDIR or --tmpdir=path). The following
formula yields the amount of space required:</p>

<p>(largest_key + row_pointer_length) * number_of_rows *
2</p>

<p>You can check the length of the keys and the
row_pointer_length with myisamchk -dv tbl_name (see the
section called OBTAINING TABLE INFORMATION WITH MYISAMCHK ).
The row_pointer_length and number_of_rows values are the
Datafile pointer and Data records values in the table
description. To determine the largest_key value, check the
Key lines in the table description. The Len column indicates
the number of bytes for each key part. For a multiple-column
index, the key size is the sum of the Len values for all key
parts.</p>

<p>If you have a problem with disk space during repair, you
can try --safe-recover instead of --recover.</p>
