<p>SYSCONF(3) Linux Programmer s Manual SYSCONF(3)</p>

<p>NAME sysconf - Get configuration information at
runtime</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>long sysconf(int name);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION POSIX allows an application to test at
compile or run time whether cer- tain options are supported,
or what the value is of certain config- urable constants or
limits.</p>

<p>At compile time this is done by including
&lt;unistd.h&gt; and/or &lt;limits.h&gt; and testing the
value of certain macros.</p>

<p>At run time, one can ask for numerical values using the
present func- tion sysconf(). On can ask for numerical
values that may depend on the file system a file is in using
the calls fpathconf(3) and pathconf(3). One can ask for
string values using confstr(3).</p>

<p>The values obtained from these functions are system
configuration con- stants. They do not change during the
lifetime of a process.</p>

<p>For options, typically, there is a constant _POSIX_FOO
that may be defined in &lt;unistd.h&gt;. If it is undefined,
one should ask at run time. If it is defined to -1, then the
option is not supported. If it is defined to 0, then
relevant functions and headers exist, but one has to ask at
runtime what degree of support is available. If it is
defined to a value other than -1 or 0, then the option is
supported. Usually the value (such as 200112L) indicates the
year and month of the POSIX revision describing the option.
Glibc uses the value 1 to indicate support as long as the
POSIX revision has not been published yet. The sysconf()
argument will be _SC_FOO. For a list of options, see
posixoptions(7).</p>

<p>For variables or limits, typically, there is a constant
_FOO, maybe defined in &lt;limits.h&gt;, or _POSIX_FOO,
maybe defined in &lt;unistd.h&gt;. The constant will not be
defined if the limit is unspecified. If the con- stant is
defined, it gives a guaranteed value, and a greater value
might actually be supported. If an application wants to take
advantage of values which may change between systems, a call
to sysconf() can be made. The sysconf() argument will be
_SC_FOO.</p>

<p>POSIX.1 Variables We give the name of the variable, the
name of the sysconf() argument used to inquire about its
value, and a short description.</p>

<p>First, the POSIX.1 compatible values.</p>

<p>ARG_MAX - _SC_ARG_MAX The maximum length of the
arguments to the exec(3) family of functions. Must not be
less than _POSIX_ARG_MAX (4096).</p>

<p>CHILD_MAX - _SC_CHILD_MAX The max number of simultaneous
processes per user ID. Must not be less than
_POSIX_CHILD_MAX (25).</p>

<p>HOST_NAME_MAX - _SC_HOST_NAME_MAX Max length of a
hostname, not including the terminating null byte, as
returned by gethostname(2). Must not be less than
_POSIX_HOST_NAME_MAX (255).</p>

<p>LOGIN_NAME_MAX - _SC_LOGIN_NAME_MAX Maximum length of a
login name, including the terminating null byte. Must not be
less than _POSIX_LOGIN_NAME_MAX (9).</p>

<p>clock ticks - _SC_CLK_TCK The number of clock ticks per
second. The corresponding vari- able is obsolete. It was of
course called CLK_TCK. (Note: the macro CLOCKS_PER_SEC does
not give information: it must equal 1000000.)</p>

<p>OPEN_MAX - _SC_OPEN_MAX The maximum number of files that
a process can have open at any time. Must not be less than
_POSIX_OPEN_MAX (20).</p>

<p>PAGESIZE - _SC_PAGESIZE Size of a page in bytes. Must
not be less than 1. (Some sys- tems use PAGE_SIZE
instead.)</p>

<p>RE_DUP_MAX - _SC_RE_DUP_MAX The number of repeated
occurrences of a BRE permitted by regexec(3) and regcomp(3).
Must not be less than _POSIX2_RE_DUP_MAX (255).</p>

<p>STREAM_MAX - _SC_STREAM_MAX The maximum number of
streams that a process can have open at any time. If
defined, it has the same value as the standard C macro
FOPEN_MAX. Must not be less than _POSIX_STREAM_MAX (8).</p>

<p>SYMLOOP_MAX The maximum number of symbolic links seen in
a pathname before resolution returns ELOOP. Must not be less
than _POSIX_SYM- LOOP_MAX (8).</p>

<p>TTY_NAME_MAX - _SC_TTY_NAME_MAX The maximum length of
terminal device name, including the termi- nating null byte.
Must not be less than _POSIX_TTY_NAME_MAX (9).</p>

<p>TZNAME_MAX - _SC_TZNAME_MAX The maximum number of bytes
in a timezone name. Must not be less than _POSIX_TZNAME_MAX
(6).</p>

<p>_POSIX_VERSION - _SC_VERSION indicates the year and
month the POSIX.1 standard was approved in the format
YYYYMML; the value 199009L indicates the Sept. 1990
revision.</p>

<p>POSIX.2 Variables Next, the POSIX.2 values, giving
limits for utilities.</p>

<p>BC_BASE_MAX - _SC_BC_BASE_MAX indicates the maximum
obase value accepted by the bc(1) utility.</p>

<p>BC_DIM_MAX - _SC_BC_DIM_MAX indicates the maximum value
of elements permitted in an array by bc(1).</p>

<p>BC_SCALE_MAX - _SC_BC_SCALE_MAX indicates the maximum
scale value allowed by bc(1).</p>

<p>BC_STRING_MAX - _SC_BC_STRING_MAX indicates the maximum
length of a string accepted by bc(1).</p>

<p>COLL_WEIGHTS_MAX - _SC_COLL_WEIGHTS_MAX indicates the
maximum numbers of weights that can be assigned to an entry
of the LC_COLLATE order keyword in the locale definition
file,</p>

<p>EXPR_NEST_MAX - _SC_EXPR_NEST_MAX is the maximum number
of expressions which can be nested within parentheses by
expr(1).</p>

<p>LINE_MAX - _SC_LINE_MAX The maximum length of a utilitys
input line length, either from standard input or from a
file. This includes length for a trailing newline.</p>

<p>RE_DUP_MAX - _SC_RE_DUP_MAX The maximum number of
repeated occurrences of a regular expres- sion when the
interval notatio{m,} is used.</p>

<p>POSIX2_VERSION - _SC_2_VERSION indicates the version of
the POSIX.2 standard in the format of YYYYMML.</p>

<p>POSIX2_C_DEV - _SC_2_C_DEV indicates whether the POSIX.2
C language development facilities are supported.</p>

<p>POSIX2_FORT_DEV - _SC_2_FORT_DEV indicates whether the
POSIX.2 FORTRAN development utilities are supported.</p>

<p>POSIX2_FORT_RUN - _SC_2_FORT_RUN indicates whether the
POSIX.2 FORTRAN runtime utilities are sup- ported.</p>

<p>_POSIX2_LOCALEDEF - _SC_2_LOCALEDEF indicates whether
the POSIX.2 creation of locates via localedef(1) is
supported.</p>

<p>POSIX2_SW_DEV - _SC_2_SW_DEV indicates whether the
POSIX.2 software development utilities option is
supported.</p>

<p>These values also exist, but may not be standard.</p>

<p>- _SC_PHYS_PAGES The number of pages of physical memory.
Note that it is possi- ble for the product of this value and
the value of _SC_PAGE_SIZE to overflow.</p>

<p>- _SC_AVPHYS_PAGES The number of currently available
pages of physical memory.</p>

<p>- _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF The number of processors
configured.</p>

<p>- _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN The number of processors
currently online (available).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If name is invalid, -1 is returned, and
errno is set to EINVAL. Other- wise, the value returned is
the value of the system resource and errno is not changed.
In the case of options, a positive value is returned if a
queried option is available, and -1 if it is not. In the
case of limits, -1 means that there is no definite
limit.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>BUGS It is difficult to use ARG_MAX because it is not
specified how much of the argument space for exec(3) is
consumed by the users environment variables.</p>

<p>Some returned values may be huge; they are not suitable
for allocating memory.</p>
