TAG_PAGES_FOR_WRITEB(9)</p>

<p>NAME tag_pages_for_writeback - tag pages to be written
by write_cache_pages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void tag_pages_for_writeback(struct
address_space * mapping, pgoff_t start, pgoff_t end);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS mapping address space structure to write</p>

<p>start starting page index</p>

<p>end ending page index (inclusive)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function scans the page range from
start to end (inclusive) and tags all pages that have DIRTY
tag set with a special TOWRITE tag. The idea is that
write_cache_pages (or whoever calls this function) will then
use TOWRITE tag to identify pages eligible for writeback.
This mechanism is used to avoid livelocking of writeback by
a process steadily creating new dirty pages in the file
(thus it is important for this function to be quick so that
it can tag pages faster than a dirtying process can create
them).</p>
