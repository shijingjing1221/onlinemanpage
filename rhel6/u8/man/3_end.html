<p>NAME etext, edata, end - end of program segments</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS extern etext; extern edata; extern end;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The addresses of these symbols indicate the
end of various program seg- ments:</p>

<p>etext This is the first address past the end of the text
segment (the program code).</p>

<p>edata This is the first address past the end of the
initialized data segment.</p>

<p>end This is the first address past the end of the
uninitialized data segment (also known as the BSS
segment).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO Although these symbols have long been
provided on most Unix systems, they are not standardized;
use with caution.</p>

<p>NOTES The program must explicitly declare these symbols;
they are not defined in any header file.</p>

<p>On some systems the names of these symbols are preceded
by underscores, thus: _etext, _edata, and _end. These
symbols are also defined for programs compiled on Linux.</p>

<p>At the start of program execution, the program break
will be somewhere near &amp;end (perhaps at the start of the
following page). However, the break will change as memory is
allocated via brk(2) or malloc(3). Use sbrk(2) with an
argument of zero to find the current value of the pro- gram
break.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE When run, the program below produces output such
as the following:</p>

<p>$ ./a.out First address past: program text (etext)
0x8048568 initialized data (edata) 0x804a01c uninitialized
data (end) 0x804a024</p>

<p>Program source</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>extern char etext, edata, end; /* The symbols must have
some type, or &quot;gcc -Wall&quot; complains */</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { printf(&quot;First
address past:0); printf(&quot; program text (etext) %10p0,
&amp;etext); printf(&quot; initialized data (edata) %10p0,
&amp;edata); printf(&quot; uninitialized data (end) %10p0,
&amp;end);</p>

<p>exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>
