<p>ImageMagick(1) ImageMagick(1)</p>

<p>NAME ImageMagick - is a free software suite for the
creation, modification and display of bitmap images.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS convert input-file [options] output-file</p>

<p>OVERVIEW ImageMagick&reg;, is a software suite to
create, edit, and compose bitmap images. It can read,
convert and write images in a variety of formats (about 100)
including GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PhotoCD, TIFF, and
DPX. Use ImageMagick to translate, flip, mirror, rotate,
scale, shear and transform images, adjust image colors,
apply various special effects, or draw text, lines,
polygons, ellipses and Bzier curves.</p>

<p>ImageMagick is free software delivered as a ready-to-run
binary distri- bution or as source code that you can freely
use, copy, modify, and distribute. Its license is compatible
with the GPL. It runs on all major operating systems.</p>

<p>The functionality of ImageMagick is typically utilized
from the command line or you can use the features from
programs written in your favorite programming language.
Choose from these interfaces: MagickCore (C), MagickWand
(C), ChMagick (Ch), Magick++ (C++), JMagick (Java), L-Magick
(Lisp), PascalMagick (Pascal), PerlMagick (Perl), MagickWand
for PHP (PHP), PythonMagick (Python), RMagick (Ruby), or
TclMagick (Tcl/TK). With a language interface, use
ImageMagick to modify or create images automagically and
dynamically.</p>

<p>ImageMagick includes a number of command-line utilities
for manipulat- ing images. Most of you are probably accustom
to editing images one at a time with a graphical user
interface (GUI) with such programs as gimp or Photoshop.
However, a GUI is not always convenient. Suppose you want to
process an image dynamically from a web script or you want
to apply the same operations to many images or repeat a
specific operation at different times to the same or
different image. For these types of operations, the
command-line image processing utility is appropriate.</p>

<p>In the paragraphs below, find a short description for
each command-line tool.Cl ick on the program name to get
details on the program usage and a list of comman d-line
options that alters how the program performs. If you are
just getting acq uainted with ImageMagick, start at the top
of the list, the convert program, and work your way down.
Also be sure to peruse Anthony Thyssens tutorial on how to
use ImageMagick utilities to convert, compose, or edit
images from the command- line.</p>

<p>convert</p>

<p>convert between image formats as well as resize an
image, blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw on, flip, join,
re-sample, and much more.</p>

<p>identify</p>

<p>describes the format and characteristics of one or more
image files.</p>

<p>mogrify</p>

<p>resize an image, blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw on,
flip, join, re-sample, and much more. Mogrify overwrites the
original image file, whereas, convert writes to a different
image file.</p>

<p>composite</p>

<p>overlaps one image over another.</p>

<p>montage</p>

<p>create a composite image by combining several separate
images. The images are tiled on the composite image
optionally adorned with a border, frame, image name, and
more.</p>

<p>compare</p>

<p>mathematically and visually annotate the difference
between an image and its reconstruction..</p>

<p>stream is a lightweight tool to stream one or more pixel
components of the image or portion of the image to your
choice of storage for- mats. It writes the pixel components
as they are read from the input image a row at a time making
stream desirable when working with large images or when you
require raw pixel components.</p>

<p>display</p>

<p>displays an image or image sequence on any X server.</p>

<p>animate</p>

<p>animates an image sequence on any X server.</p>

<p>import saves any visible window on an X server and
outputs it as an image file. You can capture a single
window, the entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the
screen.</p>

<p>conjure</p>

<p>interprets and executes scripts written in the Magick
Scripting Language (MSL).</p>
