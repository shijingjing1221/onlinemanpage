<p>NAME rpntutorial - Reading RRDtool RPN Expressions by
Steve Rader</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tutorial should help you get to grips
with RRDtool RPN expressions as seen in CDEF arguments of
RRDtool graph.</p>

<p>Reading Comparison Operators The LT, LE, GT, GE and EQ
RPN logic operators are not as tricky as they appear. These
operators act on the two values on the stack preceding them
(to the left). Read these two values on the stack from left
to right inserting the operator in the middle. If the
resulting statement is true, then replace the three values
from the stack with &quot;1&quot;. If the statement if
false, replace the three values with &quot;0&quot;.</p>

<p>For example, think about &quot;2,1,GT&quot;. This RPN
expression could be read as &quot;is two greater than
one?&quot; The answer to that question is &quot;true&quot;.
So the three values should be replaced with &quot;1&quot;.
Thus the RPN expression 2,1,GT evaluates to 1.</p>

<p>Now consider &quot;2,1,LE&quot;. This RPN expression
could be read as &quot;is two less than or equal to
one?&quot;. The natural response is &quot;no&quot; and thus
the RPN expression 2,1,LE evaluates to 0.</p>

<p>Reading the IF Operator The IF RPN logic operator can be
straightforward also. The key to reading IF operators is to
understand that the condition part of the traditional
&quot;if X than Y else Z&quot; notation has *already* been
evaluated. So the IF operator acts on only one value on the
stack: the third value to the left of the IF value. The
second value to the left of the IF corresponds to the true
(&quot;Y&quot;) branch. And the first value to the left of
the IF corresponds to the false (&quot;Z&quot;) branch. Read
the RPN expression &quot;X,Y,Z,IF&quot; from left to right
like so: &quot;if X then Y else Z&quot;.</p>

<p>For example, consider &quot;1,10,100,IF&quot;. It looks
bizarre to me. But when I read &quot;if 1 then 10 else
100&quot; its crystal clear: 1 is true so the answer is 10.
Note that only zero is false; all other values are true.
&quot;2,20,200,IF&quot; (&quot;if 2 then 20 else 200&quot;)
evaluates to 20. And &quot;0,1,2,IF&quot; (&quot;if 0 then 1
else 2) evaluates to 2.</p>

<p>Notice that none of the above examples really simulate
the whole &quot;if X then Y else Z&quot; statement. This is
because computer programmers read this statement as &quot;if
Some Condition then Y else Z&quot;. So its important to be
able to read IF operators along with the LT, LE, GT, GE and
EQ operators.</p>

<p>Some Examples While compound expressions can look overly
complex, they can be considered elegantly simple. To quickly
comprehend RPN expressions, you must know the algorithm for
evaluating RPN expressions: iterate searches from the left
to the right looking for an operator. When its found, apply
that operator by popping the operator and some number of
values (and by definition, not operators) off the stack.</p>

<p>For example, the stack &quot;1,2,3,+,+&quot; gets
&quot;2,3,+&quot; evaluated (as &quot;2+3&quot;) during the
first iteration and is replaced by 5. This results in the
stack &quot;1,5,+&quot;. Finally, &quot;1,5,+&quot; is
evaluated resulting in the answer 6. For convenience, its
useful to write this set of operations as:</p>

<p>1) 1,2,3,+,+ eval is 2,3,+ = 5 result is 1,5,+ 2) 1,5,+
eval is 1,5,+ = 6 result is 6 3) 6</p>

<p>Let s use that notation to conveniently solve some
complex RPN expressions with multiple logic operators:</p>

<p>1) 20,10,GT,10,20,IF eval is 20,10,GT = 1 result is
1,10,20,IF</p>

<p>read the eval as pop &quot;20 is greater than 10&quot;
so push 1</p>

<p>2) 1,10,20,IF eval is 1,10,20,IF = 10 result is 10</p>

<p>read pop &quot;if 1 then 10 else 20&quot; so push 10.
Only 10 is left so 10 is the answer.</p>

<p>Let s read a complex RPN expression that also has the
traditional multiplication operator:</p>

<p>1) 128,8,*,7000,GT,7000,128,8,*,IF eval 128,8,* result
is 1024 2) 1024,7000,GT,7000,128,8,*,IF eval 1024,7000,GT
result is 0 3) 0,128,8,*,IF eval 128,8,* result is 1024 4)
0,7000,1024,IF result is 1024</p>

<p>Now lets go back to the first example of multiple logic
operators, but replace the value 20 with the variable
&quot;input&quot;:</p>

<p>1) input,10,GT,10,input,IF eval is input,10,GT ( lets
call this A )</p>

<p>Read eval as &quot;if input &gt; 10 then true&quot; and
replace &quot;input,10,GT&quot; with &quot;A&quot;:</p>

<p>2) A,10,input,IF eval is A,10,input,IF</p>

<p>read &quot;if A then 10 else input&quot;. Now replace A
with its verbose description again and--voila!--you have a
easily readable description of the expression:</p>

<p>if input &gt; 10 then 10 else input</p>

<p>Finally, let s go back to the first most complex example
and replace the value 128 with &quot;input&quot;:</p>

<p>1) input,8,*,7000,GT,7000,input,8,*,IF eval input,8,*
result is A</p>

<p>where A is &quot;input * 8&quot;</p>

<p>2) A,7000,GT,7000,input,8,*,IF eval is A,7000,GT result
is B</p>

<p>where B is &quot;if ((input * 8) &gt; 7000) then
true&quot;</p>

<p>3) B,7000,input,8,*,IF eval is input,8,* result is C</p>

<p>where C is &quot;input * 8&quot;</p>

<p>4) B,7000,C,IF</p>

<p>At last we have a readable decoding of the complex RPN
expression with a variable:</p>

<p>if ((input * 8) &gt; 7000) then 7000 else (input *
8)</p>

<p>Exercises Exercise 1:</p>

<p>Compute &quot;3,2,*,1,+ and &quot;3,2,1,+,*&quot; by
hand. Rewrite them in traditional notation. Explain why they
have different answers.</p>

<p>Answer 1:</p>

<p>3*2+1 = 7 and 3*(2+1) = 9. These expressions have
different answers because the altering of the plus and times
operators alter the order of their evaluation.</p>

<p>Exercise 2:</p>

<p>One may be tempted to shorten the expression</p>

<p>input,8,*,56000,GT,56000,input,*,8,IF</p>

<p>by removing the redundant use of &quot;input,8,*&quot;
like so:</p>

<p>input,56000,GT,56000,input,IF,8,*</p>

<p>Use traditional notation to show these expressions are
not the same. Write an expression that s equivalent to the
first expression, but uses the LE and DIV operators.</p>

<p>Answer 2:</p>

<p>if (input &lt;= 56000/8 ) { input*8 } else { 56000 }
input,56000,8,DIV,LT,input,8,*,56000,IF</p>

<p>Exercise 3:</p>

<p>Briefly explain why traditional mathematic notation
requires the use of parentheses. Explain why RPN notation
does not require the use of parentheses.</p>

<p>Answer 3:</p>

<p>Traditional mathematic expressions are evaluated by
doing multiplication and division first, then addition and
subtraction. Parentheses are used to force the evaluation of
addition before multiplication (etc). RPN does not require
parentheses because the ordering of objects on the stack can
force the evaluation of addition before multiplication.</p>

<p>Exercise 4:</p>

<p>Explain why it was desirable for the RRDtool developers
to implement RPN notation instead of traditional
mathematical notation.</p>

<p>Answer 4:</p>

<p>The algorithm that implements traditional mathematical
notation is more complex then algorithm used for RPN. So
implementing RPN allowed Tobias Oetiker to write less code!
(The code is also less complex and therefore less likely to
have bugs.)</p>
