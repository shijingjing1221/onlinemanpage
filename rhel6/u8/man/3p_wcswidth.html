<p>WCSWIDTH(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCSWIDTH(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcswidth - number of column positions of a
wide-character string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>int wcswidth(const wchar_t *pwcs, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcswidth() function shall determine the
number of column positions required for n wide-character
codes (or fewer than n wide-character codes if a null
wide-character code is encountered before n wide-char- acter
codes are exhausted) in the string pointed to by pwcs.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wcswidth() function either shall return
0 (if pwcs points to a null wide-character code), or return
the number of column positions to be occupied by the
wide-character string pointed to by pwcs, or return -1 (if
any of the first n wide-character codes in the
wide-character string pointed to by pwcs is not a printable
wide-character code).</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE This function was removed from the
final ISO/IEC 9899:1990/Amendment 1:1995 (E), and the return
value for a non-printable wide character is not
specified.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
