<p>PTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_DESTROY(POSIX Programmer s
MaPTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_DESTROY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_rwlockattr_destroy, pthread_rwlockattr_init
- destroy and ini- tialize the read-write lock attributes
object</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_rwlockattr_destroy(pthread_rwlockattr_t
*attr); int pthread_rwlockattr_init(pthread_rwlockattr_t
*attr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_rwlockattr_destroy() function
shall destroy a read-write lock attributes object. A
destroyed attr attributes object can be reinitialized using
pthread_rwlockattr_init(); the results of otherwise
referencing the object after it has been destroyed are
undefined. An implementation may cause
pthread_rwlockattr_destroy() to set the object referenced by
attr to an invalid value.</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlockattr_init() function shall initialize
a read-write lock attributes object attr with the default
value for all of the attributes defined by the
implementation.</p>

<p>Results are undefined if pthread_rwlockattr_init() is
called specifying an already initialized attr attributes
object.</p>

<p>After a read-write lock attributes object has been used
to initialize one or more read-write locks, any function
affecting the attributes object (including destruction)
shall not affect any previously initial- ized read-write
locks.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the
pthread_rwlockattr_destroy() and pthread_rwlock- attr_init()
functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error number
shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_rwlockattr_destroy() function may
fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlockattr_init() function shall fail
if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to initialize the
read-write lock attributes object.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
