<p>BALANCE_DIRTY_PAGES_(9) Memory Management in Linux
BALANCE_DIRTY_PAGES_(9)</p>

<p>NAME balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited_nr - balance dirty
memory state</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited_nr(struct
address_space * mapping, unsigned long
nr_pages_dirtied);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS mapping address_space which was dirtied</p>

<p>nr_pages_dirtied number of pages which the caller has
just dirtied</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Processes which are dirtying memory should
call in here once for each page which was newly dirtied. The
function will periodically check the system&acute;s dirty
state and will initiate writeback if needed.</p>

<p>On really big machines, get_writeback_state is
expensive, so try to avoid calling it too often
(ratelimiting). But once we&acute;re over the dirty memory
limit we decrease the ratelimiting by a lot, to prevent
individual processes from overshooting the limit by
(ratelimit_pages) each.</p>
