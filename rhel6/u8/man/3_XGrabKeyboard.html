<p>XGrabKeyboard(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XGrabKeyboard(3)</p>

<p>NAME XGrabKeyboard, XUngrabKeyboard - grab the
keyboard</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XGrabKeyboard(Display *display, Window
grab_window, Bool owner_events, int pointer_mode, int
keyboard_mode, Time time);</p>

<p>int XUngrabKeyboard(Display *display, Time time);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>grab_window Specifies the grab window.</p>

<p>keyboard_mode Specifies further processing of keyboard
events. You can pass GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.</p>

<p>owner_events Specifies a Boolean value that indicates
whether the keyboard events are to be reported as usual.</p>

<p>pointer_mode Specifies further processing of pointer
events. You can pass GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.</p>

<p>time Specifies the time. You can pass either a timestamp
or Cur- rentTime.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XGrabKeyboard function actively grabs
control of the keyboard and generates FocusIn and FocusOut
events. Further key events are reported only to the grabbing
client. XGrabKeyboard overrides any active key- board grab
by this client. If owner_events is False, all generated key
events are reported with respect to grab_window. If
owner_events is True and if a generated key event would
normally be reported to this client, it is reported
normally; otherwise, the event is reported with respect to
the grab_window. Both KeyPress and KeyRelease events are
always reported, independent of any event selection made by
the client.</p>

<p>If the keyboard_mode argument is GrabModeAsync, keyboard
event process- ing continues as usual. If the keyboard is
currently frozen by this client, then processing of keyboard
events is resumed. If the key- board_mode argument is
GrabModeSync, the state of the keyboard (as seen by client
applications) appears to freeze, and the X server gener-
ates no further keyboard events until the grabbing client
issues a releasing XAllowEvents call or until the keyboard
grab is released. Actual keyboard changes are not lost while
the keyboard is frozen; they are simply queued in the server
for later processing.</p>

<p>If pointer_mode is GrabModeAsync, pointer event
processing is unaf- fected by activation of the grab. If
pointer_mode is GrabModeSync, the state of the pointer (as
seen by client applications) appears to freeze, and the X
server generates no further pointer events until the
grabbing client issues a releasing XAllowEvents call or
until the key- board grab is released. Actual pointer
changes are not lost while the pointer is frozen; they are
simply queued in the server for later pro- cessing.</p>

<p>If the keyboard is actively grabbed by some other
client, XGrabKeyboard fails and returns AlreadyGrabbed. If
grab_window is not viewable, it fails and returns
GrabNotViewable. If the keyboard is frozen by an active grab
of another client, it fails and returns GrabFrozen. If the
specified time is earlier than the last-keyboard-grab time
or later than the current X server time, it fails and
returns GrabInvalidTime. Otherwise, the last-keyboard-grab
time is set to the specified time (CurrentTime is replaced
by the current X server time).</p>

<p>XGrabKeyboard can generate BadValue and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>The XUngrabKeyboard function releases the keyboard and
any queued events if this client has it actively grabbed
from either XGrabKeyboard or XGrabKey. XUngrabKeyboard does
not release the keyboard and any queued events if the
specified time is earlier than the last-keyboard- grab time
or is later than the current X server time. It also gener-
ates FocusIn and FocusOut events. The X server automatically
performs an UngrabKeyboard request if the event window for
an active keyboard grab becomes not viewable.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadValue Some numeric value falls outside
the range of values accepted by the request. Unless a
specific range is specified for an argument, the full range
defined by the argument s type is accepted. Any argument
defined as a set of alternatives can generate this
error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
