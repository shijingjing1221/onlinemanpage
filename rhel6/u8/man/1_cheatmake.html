<p>NAME cheatmake - fool make into not rebuilding certain
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cheatmake [hidechangefile] [show] [whyfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cheatmake is used to save time when
recompiling. It can fool make into skipping files that
havent changed in a meaningful way. This can be used for
instance when you change a comment in a file but none of the
actual code.</p>

<p>This utility is part of the KDE Software Development
Kit.</p>

<p>OPTIONS hidechange file Hides the fact that file was
changed by setting the timestamp into the past. Use with
care!</p>

<p>show Lists what files make currently needs to
rebuild</p>

<p>why file Explains why make must rebuild file</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT One of the following variables (but not
both) should be set if the source directory is different
from the build directory. If the build directory is simply a
subdirectory of the source directory, the simpler variable
OBJ_SUBDIR should be used.</p>

<p>OBJ_SUBJDIR Indicates that the build directory is in the
given subdirectory of the source directory. For instance, if
the source directory is kdesdk and the build directory is
kdesdk/obj-i386-linux, then OBJ_SUBDIR should be set to
obj-i386-linux.</p>

<p>OBJ_REPLACEMENT A sed expression that is used to
transform the source directory into the build directory. For
instance, if the source directory is kdesdk/obj-i386-linux,
then OBJ_REPLACEMENT should be set to
s#kdesdk#kdesdk-obj#.</p>
