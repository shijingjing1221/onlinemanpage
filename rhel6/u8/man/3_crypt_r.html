<p>CRYPT(3) Linux Programmer s Manual CRYPT(3)</p>

<p>NAME crypt, crypt_r - password and data encryption</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _XOPEN_SOURCE #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *crypt(const char *key, const char *salt);</p>

<p>char *crypt_r(const char *key, const char *salt, struct
crypt_data *data);</p>

<p>Link with -lcrypt.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION crypt() is the password encryption function.
It is based on the Data Encryption Standard algorithm with
variations intended (among other things) to discourage use
of hardware implementations of a key search.</p>

<p>key is a users typed password.</p>

<p>salt is a two-character string chosen from the set
[azAZ0 9./]. This string is used to perturb the algorithm in
one of 4096 different ways.</p>

<p>By taking the lowest 7 bits of each of the first eight
characters of the key, a 56-bit key is obtained. This 56-bit
key is used to encrypt repeatedly a constant string (usually
a string consisting of all zeros). The returned value points
to the encrypted password, a series of 13 printable ASCII
characters (the first two characters represent the salt
itself). The return value points to static data whose
content is overwritten by each call.</p>

<p>Warning: The key space consists of 2**56 equal 7.2e16
possible values. Exhaustive searches of this key space are
possible using massively par- allel computers. Software,
such as crack(1), is available which will search the portion
of this key space that is generally used by humans for
passwords. Hence, password selection should, at minimum,
avoid common words and names. The use of a passwd(1) program
that checks for crackable passwords during the selection
process is recommended.</p>

<p>The DES algorithm itself has a few quirks which make the
use of the crypt() interface a very poor choice for anything
other than password authentication. If you are planning on
using the crypt() interface for a cryptography project, dont
do it: get a good book on encryption and one of the widely
available DES libraries.</p>

<p>crypt_r() is a reentrant version of crypt(). The
structure pointed to by data is used to store result data
and bookkeeping information. Other than allocating it, the
only thing that the caller should do with this structure is
to set data-&gt;initialized to zero before the first call to
crypt_r().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, a pointer to the encrypted
password is returned. On error, NULL is returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS ENOSYS The crypt() function was not implemented,
probably because of U.S.A. export restrictions.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO crypt(): SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
crypt_r() is a GNU extension.</p>

<p>NOTES Glibc Notes The glibc2 version of this function
supports additional encryption algorithms.</p>

<p>If salt is a character string starting with the
characters &quot;$id$&quot; fol- lowed by a string
terminated by &quot;$&quot;:</p>

<p>$id$salt$encrypted</p>

<p>then instead of using the DES machine, id identifies the
encryption method used and this then determines how the rest
of the password string is interpreted. The following values
of id are supported:</p>

<p>ID | Method
--------------------------------------------------------- 1
| MD5 2a | Blowfish (not in mainline glibc; added in some |
Linux distributions) 5 | SHA-256 (since glibc 2.7) 6 |
SHA-512 (since glibc 2.7)</p>

<p>So $5$salt$encrypted is an SHA-256 encoded password and
$6$salt$encrypted is an SHA-512 encoded one.</p>

<p>&quot;salt&quot; stands for the up to 16 characters
following &quot;$id$&quot; in the salt. The encrypted part
of the password string is the actual computed pass- word.
The size of this string is fixed:</p>

<p>MD5 | 22 characters SHA-256 | 43 characters SHA-512 | 86
characters</p>

<p>The characters in &quot;salt&quot; and
&quot;encrypted&quot; are drawn from the set [azAZ09./]. In
the MD5 and SHA implementations the entire key is
significant (instead of only the first 8 bytes in DES).</p>
