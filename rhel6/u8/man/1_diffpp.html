<p>NAME diffpp - pretty-print diff outputs with GNU
enscript</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS diffpp currentfile &lt; diff-file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Diffpp converts diff(1)-programs output
files to a format suitable to be printed with GNU
enscript(1). Program annotates the changes with enscripts
special escapes so enscript can highlight the modified por-
tions of the file. All changed and added lines are printed
with gray-background, deleted lines are marked with minus (-
) characters; diffpp prints one minus character for each
deleted line.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The easiest way to use diffpp is to use it as
an input filter for enscript. If an input filter is
specified for enscript it is used to pre-process the
incoming data-stream. Filtering does not alter any header
strings or file-timestamps which might be printed on
enscript headers; only the incoming data is modified.</p>

<p>enscript -G2re --filterrcsdiff %s | diffpp %s*.c *.h
Print the changes between current source files and their
latest RCS-versions.</p>

<p>enscript -G2re --filterdiff %s~ %s | diffpp %s*.c *.h
Print changes between source files and the corresponding
backup-files.</p>
