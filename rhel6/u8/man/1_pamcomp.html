<p>NAME pamcomp - composite (overlay) two Netpbm images
together</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamcomp</p>

<p>[-align={left|center|right| beyondleft|beyondright}]
[-valign={top|mid- dle|bottom| above|below}] [-xoff=X]
[-yoff=Y] [-alpha=alpha-pgmfile] [-invert]
[-opacity=opacity] [-linear] overlay_file [underlying_file
[output_file]]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamcomp reads two images and produces a composite image
with one of the images overlayed on top of the other,
possible translucently. The images need not be the same
size. The input and outputs are Netpbm format image
files.</p>

<p>In its simplest use, pamcomp simply places the image in
the file over- lay_file on top of the image in the file
underlying_file, blocking out the part of underlying_file
beneath it.</p>

<p>If you add the -alpha option, then pamcomp uses the
image in file alpha-pgmfile as an alpha mask, which means it
determines the level of transparency of each point in the
overlay image. The alpha mask must have the same dimensions
as the overlay image. In places where the alpha mask defines
the overlay image to be opaque, the composite output
contains only the contents of the overlay image; the
underlying image is totally blocked out. In places where the
alpha mask defines the overlay image to be transparent, the
composite output contains none of the overlay image; the
underlying image shows through completely. In places where
the alpha mask shows a value in between opaque and trans-
parent (translucence), the composite image contains a
mixture of the overlay image and the underlying image and
the level of translucence determines how much of each.</p>

<p>The alpha mask is a PGM file in which a white pixel
represents opaque- ness and a black pixel transparency.
Anything in between is translu- cent. (Like any Netpbm
program, pamcomp will see a PBM file as if it is PGM).</p>

<p>If the overlay image is a PAM image of tuple type
RGB_ALPHA or GRAYSCALE_ALPHA, then the overlay image
contains transparency informa- tion itself and pamcomp uses
it the same way as the alpha mask described above. If you
supply both an overlay image that has trans- parency
information and an alpha mask, pamcomp multiplies the two
opac- ities to get the opacity of the overlay pixel.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.25 (October 2004), pamcomp did not
recognize the transparency information in a PAM image -- it
just ignored it. So peo- ple had to make appropriate alpha
masks in order to have a non-opaque overlay. Some Netpbm
programs that convert from image formats such as PNG that
contain transparency information are not able to create
RGB_ALPHA or GRAYSCALE_ALPHA PAM output, so you have to use
the old method -- extract the transparency information from
the original into a separate alpha mask and use that as
input to pamcomp.</p>

<p>The output image is always of the same dimensions as the
underlying image. pamcomp uses only parts of the overlay
image that fit within the underlying image.</p>

<p>To specify where on the underlying image to place the
overlay image, use the -align, -valign, -xoff, and -yoff
options. Without these options, the default horizontal
position is flush left and the default vertical position is
flush top.</p>

<p>The overlay image, in the position you specify, need not
fit entirely within the underlying image. pamcomp uses only
the parts of the over- lay image that appear above the
underlying image. It is possible to specify positioning such
that none of the overlay image is over the underlying image
-- i.e. the overlay is out of frame. If you do that, pamcomp
issues a warning.</p>

<p>The overlay and underlying images may be of different
formats (e.g. overlaying a PBM text image over a full color
PPM image) and have dif- ferent maxvals. The output image
has the more general of the two input formats and a maxval
that is the least common multiple the two maxvals (or the
maximum maxval allowable by the format, if the LCM is more
than that).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -align=alignment This option selects the basic
horizontal position of the overlay image with respect to the
underlying image, in syntax reminis- cent of HTML. left
means flush left, center means centered, and right means
flush right.</p>

<p>The -xoff option modifies this position.</p>

<p>beyondleft means just out of frame to the left -- the
right edge of the overlay is flush with the left edge of the
underlying image. beyondright means just out of frame to the
right. These alignments are useful only if you add a -xoff
option. These two values were added in Netpbm 10.10 (October
2002).</p>

<p>The default is left.</p>

<p>-valign=alignment This option selects the basic vertical
position of the overlay image with respect to the underlying
image, in syntax reminis- cent of HTML. top means flush top,
middle means centered, and bottom means flush bottom.</p>

<p>The -yoff option modifies this position.</p>

<p>above means just out of frame to the top -- the bottom
edge of the overlay is flush with the top edge of the
underlying image. below means just out of frame to the
bottom. These alignments are useful only if you add a -yoff
option. These two values were added in Netpbm 10.10 (October
2002).</p>

<p>The default is top.</p>

<p>-xoff=x This option modifies the horizontal positioning
of the overlay image with respect to the underlying image as
selected by the -align option. pamcomp shifts the overlay
image from that basic position x pixels to the right. x can
be negative to indicate shifting to the left.</p>

<p>The overlay need not fit entirely (or at all) on the
underlying image. pamcomp uses only the parts that lie over
the underlying image.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.10 (October 2002), -xoff was mutually
exclusive with -align and always measured from the left
edge.</p>

<p>-yoff=y This option modifies the vertical positioning of
the overlay image with respect to the underlying image as
selected by the -valign option. pamcomp shifts the overlay
image from that basic position y pixels downward. y can be
negative to indicate shifting upward.</p>

<p>The overlay need not fit entirely (or at all) on the
underlying image. pamcomp uses only the parts that lie over
the underlying image.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.10 (October 2002), -xoff was mutually
exclusive with -valign and always measured from the top
edge.</p>

<p>-alpha=alpha-pgmfile This option names a file that
contains the alpha mask. If you don t specify this option,
there is no alpha mask, which is equivalent to having an
alpha mask specify total opaqueness everywhere.</p>

<p>You can specify - as the value of this option and the
alpha mask will come from Standard Input. If you do this,
dont specify Standard Input as the source of any other input
image.</p>

<p>-invert This option inverts the sense of the values in
the alpha mask, which effectively switches the roles of the
overlay image and the underlying image in places where the
two intersect.</p>

<p>-opacity=opacity This option tells how opaque the
overlay image is to be, i.e. how much of the composite image
should be from the overlay image, as opposed to the
underlying image. opacity is a float- ing point number, with
1.0 meaning the overlay image is totally opaque and 0.0
meaning it is totally transparent. The default is 1.0.</p>

<p>If you specify an alpha mask (the -alpha option),
pamcomp uses the product of the opacity indicated by the
alpha mask (as modi- fied by the -invert option, as a
fraction, and this opacity value. The -invert option does
not apply to this opacity value.</p>

<p>As a simple opacity value, the value makes sense only if
it is between 0 and 1, inclusive. However, pamcomp accepts
all values and performs the same arithmetic computation
using whatever value you provide. An opacity value less than
zero means the underlay image is intensified and then the
overlay image is &quot;subtracted&quot; from it. An opacity
value greater than unity means the overlay image is
intensified and the underlaying image sub- tracted from it.
In either case, pamcomp clips the resulting color component
intensities so they are nonnegative and dont exceed the
output images maxval.</p>

<p>This may seem like a strange thing to do, but it has
uses. You can use it to brighten or darken or saturate or
desaturate areas of the underlaying image. See this
description (1) of the technique.</p>

<p>This option was added in Netpbm 10.6 (July 2002). Before
Netpbm 10.15 (April 2003), values less than zero or greater
than unity were not allowed.</p>

<p>-linear This option indicates that the inputs are not
true Netpbm images but rather a non-gamma-adjusted
variation. This is relevant only when you mix pixels, using
the -opacity option or an alpha mask (the -alpha
option).</p>

<p>The alpha mask and -opacity values indicate a fraction
of the light intensity of a pixel. But the PNM and
PNM-equivalent PAM image formats represent intensities with
gamma-adjusted numbers that are not linearly proportional to
intensity. So pamcomp, by default, performs a calculation on
each sample read from its input and each sample written to
its output to convert between these gamma-adjusted numbers
and internal intensity-proportional numbers.</p>

<p>Sometimes you are not working with true PNM or PAM
images, but rather a variation in which the sample values
are in fact directly proportional to intensity. If so, use
the -linear option to tell pamcomp this. pamcomp then will
skip the conver- sions.</p>

<p>The conversion takes time. And the difference between
inten- sity-proportional values and gamma-adjusted values
may be small enough that you would barely see a difference
in the result if you just pretended that the gamma-adjusted
values were in fact intensity-proportional. So just to save
time, at the expense of some image quality, you can specify
-linear even when you have true PPM input and expect true
PPM output.</p>

<p>For the first 13 years of Netpbm s life, until Netpbm
10.20 (January 2004), pamcomps predecessor pnmcomp always
treated the PPM samples as intensity-proportional even
though they were not, and drew few complaints. So using
-linear as a lie is a reason- able thing to do if speed is
important to you.</p>

<p>Another technique to consider is to convert your PNM
image to the linear variation with pnmgamma, run pamcomp on
it and other transformations that like linear PNM, and then
convert it back to true PNM with pnmgamma -ungamma. pnmgamma
is often faster than pamcomp in doing the conversion.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamcomp was new in Netpbm 10.21 (March 2004).
Its predecessor, pnm- comp, was one of the first programs
added to Netpbm when the project went global in 1993.</p>
