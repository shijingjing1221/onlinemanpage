<p>DLOPEN(3) Linux Programmer s Manual DLOPEN(3)</p>

<p>NAME dladdr, dlclose, dlerror, dlopen, dlsym, dlvsym -
programming interface to dynamic linking loader</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *dlopen(const char *filename, int flag);</p>

<p>char *dlerror(void);</p>

<p>void *dlsym(void *handle, const char *symbol);</p>

<p>int dlclose(void *handle);</p>

<p>Link with -ldl.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The four functions dlopen(), dlsym(),
dlclose(), dlerror() implement the interface to the dynamic
linking loader.</p>

<p>dlerror() The function dlerror() returns a human
readable string describing the most recent error that
occurred from dlopen(), dlsym() or dlclose() since the last
call to dlerror(). It returns NULL if no errors have
occurred since initialization or since it was last
called.</p>

<p>dlopen() The function dlopen() loads the dynamic library
file named by the null- terminated string filename and
returns an opaque &quot;handle&quot; for the dynamic
library. If filename is NULL, then the returned handle is
for the main program. If filename contains a slash
(&quot;/&quot;), then it is interpreted as a (relative or
absolute) pathname. Otherwise, the dynamic linker searches
for the library as follows (see ld.so(8) for further
details):</p>

<p>o (ELF only) If the executable file for the calling
program contains a DT_RPATH tag, and does not contain a
DT_RUNPATH tag, then the directories listed in the DT_RPATH
tag are searched.</p>

<p>o If, at the time that the program was started, the
environment vari- able LD_LIBRARY_PATH was defined to
contain a colon-separated list of directories, then these
are searched. (As a security measure this variable is
ignored for set-user-ID and set-group-ID pro- grams.)</p>

<p>o (ELF only) If the executable file for the calling
program contains a DT_RUNPATH tag, then the directories
listed in that tag are searched.</p>

<p>o The cache file /etc/ld.so.cache (maintained by
ldconfig(8)) is checked to see whether it contains an entry
for filename.</p>

<p>o The directories /lib and /usr/lib are searched (in
that order).</p>

<p>If the library has dependencies on other shared
libraries, then these are also automatically loaded by the
dynamic linker using the same rules. (This process may occur
recursively, if those libraries in turn have dependencies,
and so on.)</p>

<p>One of the following two values must be included in
flag:</p>

<p>RTLD_LAZY Perform lazy binding. Only resolve symbols as
the code that references them is executed. If the symbol is
never referenced, then it is never resolved. (Lazy binding
is only performed for function references; references to
variables are always immedi- ately bound when the library is
loaded.)</p>

<p>RTLD_NOW If this value is specified, or the environment
variable LD_BIND_NOW is set to a non-empty string, all
undefined symbols in the library are resolved before
dlopen() returns. If this cannot be done, an error is
returned.</p>

<p>Zero of more of the following values may also be ORed in
flag:</p>

<p>RTLD_GLOBAL The symbols defined by this library will be
made available for symbol resolution of subsequently loaded
libraries.</p>

<p>RTLD_LOCAL This is the converse of RTLD_GLOBAL, and the
default if neither flag is specified. Symbols defined in
this library are not made available to resolve references in
subsequently loaded libraries.</p>

<p>RTLD_NODELETE (since glibc 2.2) Do not unload the
library during dlclose(). Consequently, the librarys static
variables are not reinitialized if the library is reloaded
with dlopen() at a later time. This flag is not specified in
POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>RTLD_NOLOAD (since glibc 2.2) Dont load the library.
This can be used to test if the library is already resident
(dlopen() returns NULL if it is not, or the librarys handle
if it is resident). This flag can also be used to promote
the flags on a library that is already loaded. For example,
a library that was previously loaded with RTLD_LOCAL can be
re-opened with RTLD_NOLOAD | RTLD_GLOBAL. This flag is not
specified in POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>RTLD_DEEPBIND (since glibc 2.3.4) Place the lookup scope
of the symbols in this library ahead of the global scope.
This means that a self-contained library will use its own
symbols in preference to global symbols with the same name
contained in libraries that have already been loaded. This
flag is not specified in POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>If filename is a NULL pointer, then the returned handle
is for the main program. When given to dlsym(), this handle
causes a search for a sym- bol in the main program, followed
by all shared libraries loaded at program startup, and then
all shared libraries loaded by dlopen() with the flag
RTLD_GLOBAL.</p>

<p>External references in the library are resolved using
the libraries in that library s dependency list and any
other libraries previously opened with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag.
If the executable was linked with the flag
&quot;-rdynamic&quot; (or, synonymously,
&quot;--export-dynamic&quot;), then the global symbols in
the executable will also be used to resolve refer- ences in
a dynamically loaded library.</p>

<p>If the same library is loaded again with dlopen(), the
same file handle is returned. The dl library maintains
reference counts for library handles, so a dynamic library
is not deallocated until dlclose() has been called on it as
many times as dlopen() has succeeded on it. The _init()
routine, if present, is only called once. But a subsequent
call with RTLD_NOW may force symbol resolution for a library
earlier loaded with RTLD_LAZY.</p>

<p>If dlopen() fails for any reason, it returns NULL.</p>

<p>dlsym() The function dlsym() takes a &quot;handle&quot;
of a dynamic library returned by dlopen() and the
null-terminated symbol name, returning the address where
that symbol is loaded into memory. If the symbol is not
found, in the specified library or any of the libraries that
were automati- cally loaded by dlopen() when that library
was loaded, dlsym() returns NULL. (The search performed by
dlsym() is breadth first through the dependency tree of
these libraries.) Since the value of the symbol could
actually be NULL (so that a NULL return from dlsym() need
not indicate an error), the correct way to test for an error
is to call dlerror() to clear any old error conditions, then
call dlsym(), and then call dlerror() again, saving its
return value into a variable, and check whether this saved
value is not NULL.</p>

<p>There are two special pseudo-handles, RTLD_DEFAULT and
RTLD_NEXT. The former will find the first occurrence of the
desired symbol using the default library search order. The
latter will find the next occurrence of a function in the
search order after the current library. This allows one to
provide a wrapper around a function in another shared
library.</p>

<p>dlclose() The function dlclose() decrements the
reference count on the dynamic library handle handle. If the
reference count drops to zero and no other loaded libraries
use symbols in it, then the dynamic library is unloaded.</p>

<p>The function dlclose() returns 0 on success, and
non-zero on error.</p>

<p>The obsolete symbols _init() and _fini() The linker
recognizes special symbols _init and _fini. If a dynamic
library exports a routine named _init(), then that code is
executed after the loading, before dlopen() returns. If the
dynamic library exports a routine named _fini(), then that
routine is called just before the library is unloaded. In
case you need to avoid linking against the system startup
files, this can be done by using the gcc(1) -nostartfiles
command-line option.</p>

<p>Using these routines, or the gcc -nostartfiles or
-nostdlib options, is not recommended. Their use may result
in undesired behavior, since the constructor/destructor
routines will not be executed (unless special measures are
taken).</p>

<p>Instead, libraries should export routines using the
__attribute__((con- structor)) and
__attribute__((destructor)) function attributes. See the gcc
info pages for information on these. Constructor routines
are executed before dlopen() returns, and destructor
routines are executed before dlclose() returns.</p>

<p>Glibc extensions: dladdr() and dlvsym() Glibc adds two
functions not described by POSIX, with prototypes</p>

<p>#define _GNU_SOURCE #include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;</p>

<p>int dladdr(void *addr, Dl_info *info);</p>

<p>void *dlvsym(void *handle, char *symbol, char
*version);</p>

<p>The function dladdr() takes a function pointer and tries
to resolve name and file where it is located. Information is
stored in the Dl_info structure:</p>

<p>typedef struct { const char *dli_fname; /* Pathname of
shared object that contains address */ void *dli_fbase; /*
Address at which shared object is loaded */ const char
*dli_sname; /* Name of nearest symbol with address lower
than addr */ void *dli_saddr; /* Exact address of symbol
named in dli_sname */ } Dl_info;</p>

<p>If no symbol matching addr could be found, then
dli_sname and dli_saddr are set to NULL.</p>

<p>dladdr() returns 0 on error, and non-zero on
success.</p>

<p>The function dlvsym(), provided by glibc since version
2.1, does the same as dlsym() but takes a version string as
an additional argument.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001 describes dlclose(),
dlerror(), dlopen(), and dlsym().</p>

<p>NOTES The symbols RTLD_DEFAULT and RTLD_NEXT are defined
by &lt;dlfcn.h&gt; only when _GNU_SOURCE was defined before
including it.</p>

<p>Since glibc 2.2.3, atexit(3) can be used to register an
exit handler that is automatically called when a library is
unloaded.</p>

<p>History The dlopen interface standard comes from SunOS.
That system also has dladdr(), but not dlvsym().</p>

<p>BUGS Sometimes, the function pointers you pass to
dladdr() may surprise you. On some architectures (notably
i386 and x86_64), dli_fname and dli_fbase may end up
pointing back at the object from which you called dladdr(),
even if the function used as an argument should come from a
dynamically linked library.</p>

<p>The problem is that the function pointer will still be
resolved at com- pile time, but merely point to the plt
(Procedure Linkage Table) sec- tion of the original object
(which dispatches the call after asking the dynamic linker
to resolve the symbol). To work around this, you can try to
compile the code to be position-independent: then, the
compiler cannot prepare the pointer at compile time anymore
and todays gcc(1) will generate code that just loads the
final symbol address from the got (Global Offset Table) at
run time before passing it to dladdr().</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Load the math library, and print the cosine of
2.0:</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char **argv) { void *handle; double
(*cosine)(double); char *error;</p>

<p>handle = dlopen(&quot;libm.so&quot;, RTLD_LAZY); if
(!handle) { fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s0, dlerror());
exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>dlerror(); /* Clear any existing error */</p>

<p>/* Writing: cosine = (double (*)(double)) dlsym(handle,
&quot;cos&quot;); would seem more natural, but the C99
standard leaves casting from &quot;void *&quot; to a
function pointer undefined. The assignment used below is the
POSIX.1-2003 (Technical Corrigendum 1) workaround; see the
Rationale for the POSIX specification of dlsym(). */</p>

<p>*(void **) (&amp;cosine) = dlsym(handle,
&quot;cos&quot;);</p>

<p>if ((error = dlerror()) != NULL) { fprintf(stderr,
&quot;%s0, error); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>printf(&quot;%f0, (*cosine)(2.0)); dlclose(handle);
exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>

<p>If this program were in a file named &quot;foo.c&quot;,
you would build the pro- gram with the following
command:</p>

<p>gcc -rdynamic -o foo foo.c -ldl</p>

<p>Libraries exporting _init() and _fini() will want to be
compiled as follows, using bar.c as the example name:</p>

<p>gcc -shared -nostartfiles -o bar bar.c</p>
