<p>NAME rdesktop - Remote Desktop Protocol client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rdesktop [options] server[:port]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rdesktop is a client for Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP), used in a num- ber of Microsoft products
including Windows NT Terminal Server, Windows 2000 Server,
Windows XP and Windows 2003 Server.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -u &lt;username&gt; Username for authentication
on the server.</p>

<p>-d &lt;domain&gt; Domain for authentication.</p>

<p>-s &lt;shell&gt; Startup shell for the user - starts a
specific application instead of Explorer.</p>

<p>-c &lt;directory&gt; The initial working directory for
the user. Often used in com- bination with -s to set up a
fixed login environment.</p>

<p>-p &lt;password&gt; The password to authenticate with.
Note that this may have no effect if &quot;Always prompt for
password&quot; is enabled on the server. WARNING: if you
specify a password on the command line it may be visible to
other users when they use tools like ps. Use -p - to make
rdesktop request a password at startup (from standard
input).</p>

<p>-n &lt;hostname&gt; Client hostname. Normally rdesktop
automatically obtains the hostname of the client.</p>

<p>-k &lt;keyboard-map&gt; Keyboard layout to emulate. This
requires a corresponding keymap file to be installed. The
standard keymaps provided with rdesktop follow the RFC1766
naming scheme: a language code fol- lowed by a country code
if necessary - e.g. en-us, en-gb, de, fr, sv, etc.</p>

<p>The default keyboard map depends on the current locale
(LC_* and LANG environment variables). If the current locale
is unknown, the default keyboard map is en-us (a US English
keyboard).</p>

<p>The keyboard maps are file names, which means that they
are case sensitive. The standard keymaps are all in
lowercase.</p>

<p>The keyboard maps are searched relative to the
directories $HOME/.rdesktop/keymaps, KEYMAP_PATH (specified
at build time), and $CWD/keymaps, in this order. The
keyboard-map argument can also be an absolute filename.</p>

<p>The special value none can be used instead of a keyboard
map. In this case, rdesktop will guess the scancodes from
the X11 event key codes using an internal mapping method.
This method only supports the basic alphanumeric keys and
may not work properly on all platforms so its use is
discouraged.</p>

<p>-g &lt;geometry&gt; Desktop geometry (WxH). If geometry
is the special word &quot;workarea&quot;, the geometry will
be fetched from the extended win- dow manager hints property
_NET_WORKAREA, from the root window. The geometry can also
be specified as a percentage of the whole screen, e.g.
&quot;-g 80%&quot;.</p>

<p>If the specified geometry depends on the screen size,
and the screen size is changed, rdesktop will automatically
reconnect using the new screen size. This requires that
rdesktop has been compiled with RandR support.</p>

<p>-f Enable fullscreen mode. This overrides the window
manager and causes the rdesktop window to fully cover the
current screen. Fullscreen mode can be toggled at any time
using Ctrl-Alt-Enter.</p>

<p>-b Force the server to send screen updates as bitmaps
rather than using higher-level drawing operations.</p>

<p>-A Enable SeamlessRDP. In this mode, rdesktop creates a
X11 window for each window on the server side. This mode
requires the Seam- lessRDP server side component, which is
available from http://www.cendio.com/seamlessrdp/. When
using this option, you should specify a startup shell which
launches the desired appli- cation through SeamlessRDP.</p>

<p>Example: rdesktop -A -s seamlessrdpshell notepad.</p>

<p>-B Use the BackingStore of the Xserver instead of the
integrated one in rdesktop.</p>

<p>-e Disable encryption. This option is only needed (and
will only work) if you have a French version of NT TSE.</p>

<p>-E Disable encryption from client to server. This sends
an encrypted login packet, but everything after this is
unencrypted (including interactive logins).</p>

<p>-m Do not send mouse motion events. This saves
bandwidth, although some Windows applications may rely on
receiving mouse motion.</p>

<p>-C Use private colourmap. This will improve colour
accuracy on an 8-bit display, but rdesktop will appear in
false colour when not focused.</p>

<p>-D Hide window manager decorations, by using MWM
hints.</p>

<p>-K Do not override window manager key bindings. By
default rdesk- top attempts to grab all keyboard input when
it is in focus.</p>

<p>-S &lt;button size&gt; Enable single application mode.
This option can be used when running a single, maximized
application (via -s). When the mini- mize button of the
windows application is pressed, the rdesktop window is
minimized instead of the remote application. The maxi-
mize/restore button is disabled. For this to work, you must
specify the correct button size, in pixels. The special word
&quot;standard&quot; means 18 pixels.</p>

<p>-T &lt;title&gt; Sets the window title. The title must
be specified using an UTF-8 string.</p>

<p>-N Enable numlock syncronization between the Xserver and
the remote RDP session. This is useful with applications
that looks at the numlock state, but might cause problems
with some Xservers like Xvnc.</p>

<p>-X &lt;windowid&gt; Embed rdesktop-window in another
window. The windowid is expected to be decimal or
hexadecimal (prefixed by 0x).</p>

<p>-a &lt;bpp&gt; Sets the colour depth for the connection
(8, 15, 16, 24 or 32). More than 8 bpp are only supported
when connecting to Windows XP (up to 16 bpp) or newer. Note
that the colour depth may also be limited by the server
configuration. The default value is the depth of the root
window.</p>

<p>-z Enable compression of the RDP datastream.</p>

<p>-x &lt;experience&gt; Changes default bandwidth
performance behaviour for RDP5. By default only theming is
enabled, and all other options are dis- abled (corresponding
to modem (56 Kbps)). Setting experience to b[roadband]
enables menu animations and full window dragging. Setting
experience to l[an] will also enable the desktop wallpa-
per. Setting experience to m[odem] disables all (including
themes). Experience can also be a hexidecimal number
containing the flags.</p>

<p>-P Enable caching of bitmaps to disk (persistent bitmap
caching). This generally improves performance (especially on
low bandwidth connections) and reduces network traffic at
the cost of slightly longer startup and some disk space.
(10MB for 8-bit colour, 20MB for 15/16-bit colour, 30MB for
24-bit colour and 40MB for 32-bit colour sessions)</p>

<p>-r &lt;device&gt; Enable redirection of the specified
device on the client, such that it appears on the server.
Note that the allowed redirec- tions may be restricted by
the server configuration.</p>

<p>Following devices are currently supported:</p>

<p>-r comport:&lt;comport&gt;=&lt;device&gt;,... Redirects
serial devices on your client to the server. Note that if
you need to change any settings on the serial device(s), do
so with an appropriate tool before starting rdesktop. In
most OSes you would use stty. Bidirectional/Read support
requires Windows XP or newer. In Windows 2000 it will create
a port, but its not seamless, most shell programs will not
work with it.</p>

<p>-r disk:&lt;sharename&gt;=&lt;path&gt;,... Redirects a
path to the share \tsclient&lt;sharename&gt; on the server
(requires Windows XP or newer). The share name is limited to
8 characters.</p>

<p>-r lptport:&lt;lptport&gt;=&lt;device&gt;,... Redirects
parallel devices on your client to the server. Bidi-
rectional/Read support requires Windows XP or newer. In
Windows 2000 it will create a port, but it s not seamless,
most shell programs will not work with it.</p>

<p>-r printer:&lt;printername&gt;[=&lt;driver&gt;],...
Redirects a printer queue on the client to the server. The
&lt;printername&gt; is the name of the queue in your local
system. &lt;driver&gt; defaults to a simple PS-driver unless
you specify one. Keep in mind that you need a 100% match in
the server environ- ment, or the driver will fail. The first
printer on the command line will be set as your default
printer.</p>

<p>-r sound:[local|off|remote] Redirects sound generated on
the server to the client. &quot;remote&quot; only has any
effect when you connect to the console with the -0 option.
(Requires Windows XP or newer).</p>

<p>-r lspci Activates the lspci channel, which allows the
server to enumer- ate the clients PCI devices. See the file
lspci-channel.txt in the documentation for more
information.</p>

<p>-r scard[:&lt;Scard Name&gt;=&lt;Alias
Name&gt;[;&lt;Vendor Name&gt;][,...]] Enables redirection of
one or more smart-cards. You can provide static name binding
between linux and windows. To do this you can use optional
parameters as described: &lt;Scard Name&gt; - device name in
Linux/Unix enviroment, &lt;Alias Name&gt; - device name
shown in Windows enviroment &lt;Vendor Name&gt; - optional
device vendor name. For list of examples run rdesktop
without parameters.</p>

<p>-0 Attach to the console of the server (requires Windows
Server 2003 or newer).</p>

<p>-4 Use RDP version 4.</p>

<p>-5 Use RDP version 5 (default).</p>

<p>EXIT VALUES 0 RDP session terminated normally</p>

<p>1 Server initiated disconnect (also returned for logoff
by XP joined to a domain)</p>

<p>2 Server initiated logoff</p>

<p>3 Server idle timeout reached</p>

<p>4 Server logon timeout reached</p>

<p>5 The session was replaced</p>

<p>6 The server is out of memory</p>

<p>7 The server denied the connection</p>

<p>8 The server denied the connection for security
reason</p>

<p>16 Internal licensing error</p>

<p>17 No license server available</p>
