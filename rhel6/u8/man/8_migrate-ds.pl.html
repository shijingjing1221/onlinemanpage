<p>NAME migrate-ds.pl - Directory Server Migration
script</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS migrate-ds.pl [--options] -- [args]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Directory Server Migration script - migrates
Directory Server from older releases to the current
release.</p>

<p>This script will copy instances (data and configuration)
from the old server root directory to their new FHS
locations. This script does a copy only - the data in the
old instances will be left untouched. The old instances must
be shutdown first to ensure that the databases are copied
safely. During migration your migrated instances will be
started.</p>

<p>OPTIONS A summary of options is included below:</p>

<p>--help This message</p>

<p>--version Print the version and exit</p>

<p>--debug Turn on debugging</p>

<p>--oldsroot The old server root directory to migrate
from</p>

<p>--actualsroot This is the old location of the old server
root.</p>

<p>--silent Use silent setup - no user input</p>

<p>--file=name Use the file name in .inf format to supply
the default answers</p>

<p>--keepcache Do not delete the temporary .inf file
generated by this program</p>

<p>--logfile Log migration messages to this file -
otherwise, a temp file will be used</p>

<p>--instance By default, all directory server instances
will be migrated. You can use this argument to specify one
or more (e.g. -i slapd-foo -i slapd-bar) if you do not want
to migrate all of them.</p>

<p>--cross See below.</p>

<p>For all options, you can also use the short name e.g.
-h, -d, etc. For the -d argument, specifying it more than
once will increase the debug level e.g. -ddddd</p>

<p>args: You can supply default .inf data in this
format:</p>

<p>section.param=value</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<p>General.FullMachineName=foo.example.com</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>&quot;slapd.Suffix=dc=example, dc=com&quot;</p>

<p>Values passed in this manner will override values in an
.inf file given with the -f argument.</p>

<p>actualsroot: This is used when you must migrate from one
machine to another. The usual case is that you have mounted
the old server root on a different root directory, either
via a network mount, or by copy- ing a tarball made using a
relative directory on the source machine to the destination
machine and untarring it.</p>

<p>For example: machineA is a 32bit machine, and you want
to migrate your servers to a new 64bit machine. Lets assume
your old server root on machineA was /opt/myds, and your new
machine also wants to use a server root of /opt/myds. There
are a couple of different ways to proceed. Either make a
tarball of opt/myds from machineA using a relative path
(i.e. NOT /opt/myds) or use NFS to mount machineA:/opt/myds
on a dif- ferent mount point (e.g.
machineB:/migration/opt/myds).</p>

<p>If you do this, you should give the old &quot;real&quot;
server root (/opt/myds) as the --actualsroot argument, and
use /migration/opt/myds for the --oldsroot argument. That
is, the oldsroot is the physical location of the files on
disk. The actualsroot is the old value of the server root on
the source machine.</p>

<p>cross: Also known as crossplatform, or c, or x. This is
when the source machine is a different architecture than the
destination machine. In this case, only certain data will be
available for migra- tion. Changelog information will not be
migrated, and replicas will need to be reinitialized (if
migrating masters or hubs). This type of migration requires
that all of your old databases have been dumped to LDIF
format, and the LDIF file must be in the default database
direc- tory (usually /opt/fedora-ds/slapd-instance/db), and
the LDIF file must have the same name as the database
instance directory, with a &quot;.ldif&quot;. For example,
if you have</p>

<p>/opt/fedora-ds/slapd-instance/db/userRoot/ and
/opt/fedora-ds/slapd-instance/db/NetscapeRoot/</p>

<p>you must first use db2ldif to export these databases to
LDIF e.g.</p>

<p>cd /opt/fedora-ds/slapd-instance ./db2ldif -n userRoot
-a /opt/fedora-ds/slapd-instance/db/userRoot.ldif and
./db2ldif -n NetscapeRoot -a
/opt/fedora-ds/slapd-instance/db/NetscapeRoot.ldif</p>

<p>Then you must somehow make your old server root
directory available on the destination machine, either by
creating a tar archive on the source and copying it to the
destination, or by network mounting the source directory on
the destination machine.</p>
