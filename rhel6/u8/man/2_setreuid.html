<p>SETREUID(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SETREUID(2)</p>

<p>NAME setreuid, setregid - set real and/or effective user
or group ID</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setreuid(uid_t ruid, uid_t euid); int setregid(gid_t
rgid, gid_t egid);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>setreuid(), setregid(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE
&gt;= 500</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION setreuid() sets real and effective user IDs
of the calling process.</p>

<p>Supplying a value of -1 for either the real or effective
user ID forces the system to leave that ID unchanged.</p>

<p>Unprivileged processes may only set the effective user
ID to the real user ID, the effective user ID or the saved
set-user-ID.</p>

<p>POSIX: It is unspecified whether unprivileged processes
may set the real user ID to the real user ID, the effective
user ID or the saved set-user-ID.</p>

<p>Linux: Unprivileged users may only set the real user ID
to the real user ID or the effective user ID.</p>

<p>Linux: If the real user ID is set or the effective user
ID is set to a value not equal to the previous real user ID,
the saved set-user-ID will be set to the new effective user
ID.</p>

<p>Completely analogously, setregid() sets real and
effective group IDs of the calling process, and all of the
above holds with &quot;group&quot; instead of
&quot;user&quot;.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EPERM The calling process is not privileged
(Linux: does not have the CAP_SETUID capability in the case
of setreuid(), or the CAP_SET- GID capability in the case of
setregid()) and a change other than (i) swapping the
effective user (group) ID with the real user (group) ID, or
(ii) setting one to the value of the other or (iii) setting
the effective user (group) ID to the value of the saved
set-user-ID (saved set-group-ID) was specified.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD (the setreuid() and
setregid() function calls first appeared in 4.2BSD).</p>

<p>NOTES Setting the effective user (group) ID to the saved
set-user-ID (saved set-group-ID) is possible since Linux
1.1.37 (1.1.38).</p>
