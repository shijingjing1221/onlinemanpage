<p>NAME sa-update - automate SpamAssassin rule updates</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sa-update [options]</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>--channel channel Retrieve updates from this channel Use
multiple times for multiple channels --channelfile file
Retrieve updates from the channels in the file --checkonly
Check for update availability, do not install --install
filename Install updates directly from this file. Signature
verification will use &quot;file.asc&quot; and
&quot;file.sha1&quot; --allowplugins Allow updates to load
plugin code --gpgkey key Trust the key id to sign releases
Use multiple times for multiple keys --gpgkeyfile file Trust
the key ids in the file to sign releases --gpghomedir path
Store the GPG keyring in this directory --gpg and --nogpg
Use (or do not use) GPG to verify updates (--gpg is assumed
by use of the above --gpgkey and --gpgkeyfile options)
--import file Import GPG key(s) from file into
sa-update&rsquo;s keyring. Use multiple times for multiple
files --updatedir path Directory to place updates, defaults
to the SpamAssassin site rules directory (default:
/var/lib/spamassassin/3.003001) --refreshmirrors Force the
MIRRORED.BY file to be updated -D, --debug [area=n,...]
Print debugging messages -v, --verbose Be more verbose, like
print updated channel names -V, --version Print version -h,
--help Print usage message</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sa-update automates the process of
downloading and installing new rules and configuration,
based on channels. The default channel is
updates.spamassassin.org, which has updated rules since the
previous release.</p>

<p>Update archives are verified using SHA1 hashes and GPG
signatures, by default.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;sa-update&quot; will not restart
&quot;spamd&quot; or otherwise cause a scanner to reload the
now-updated ruleset automatically. Instead,
&quot;sa-update&quot; is typically used in something like
the following manner:</p>

<p>sa-update &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/spamassassin reload</p>

<p>This works because &quot;sa-update&quot; only returns an
exit status of 0 if it has successfully downloaded and
installed an updated ruleset.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --channel sa-update can update multiple channels
at the same time. By default, it will only access
&quot;updates.spamassassin.org&quot;, but more channels can
be specified via this option. If there are multiple
additional channels, use the option multiple times, once per
channel. i.e.:</p>

<p>sa-update --channel foo.example.com --channel
bar.example.com</p>

<p>--channelfile Similar to the --channel option, except
specify the additional channels in a file instead of on the
commandline. This is useful when there are a lot of
additional channels.</p>

<p>--checkonly Only check if an update is available, dont
actually download and install it. The exit code will be 0 or
1 as described below.</p>

<p>--install Install updates &quot;offline&quot;, from the
named tar.gz file, instead of performing DNS lookups and
HTTP invocations.</p>

<p>Files named file.sha1 and file.asc will be used for the
SHA-1 and GPG signature, respectively. The filename provided
must contain a version number of at least 3 digits, which
will be used as the channels update version number.</p>

<p>Multiple --channel switches cannot be used with
--install. To install multiple channels from tarballs, run
&quot;sa-update&quot; multiple times with different
--channel and --install switches, e.g.:</p>

<p>sa-update --channel foo.example.com --install
foo-34958.tgz sa-update --channel bar.example.com --install
bar-938455.tgz</p>

<p>--allowplugins Allow downloaded updates to activate
plugins. The default is not to activate plugins; any
&quot;loadplugin&quot; or &quot;tryplugin&quot; lines will
be commented in the downloaded update rules files.</p>

<p>--gpg, --nogpg sa-update by default will verify update
archives by use of a SHA1 checksum and GPG signature. SHA1
hashes can verify whether or not the downloaded archive has
been corrupted, but it does not offer any form of security
regarding whether or not the downloaded archive is
legitimate (aka: non-modifed by evildoers). GPG verification
of the archive is used to solve that problem.</p>

<p>If you wish to skip GPG verification, you can use the
--nogpg option to disable its use. Use of the following
gpgkey-related options will override --nogpg and keep GPG
verification enabled.</p>

<p>Note: Currently, only GPG itself is supported (ie: not
PGP). v1.2 has been tested, although later versions ought to
work as well.</p>

<p>--gpgkey sa-update has the concept of &quot;release
trusted&quot; GPG keys. When an archive is downloaded and
the signature verified, sa-update requires that the
signature be from one of these &quot;release trusted&quot;
keys or else verification fails. This prevents third parties
from manipulating the files on a mirror, for instance, and
signing with their own key.</p>

<p>By default, sa-update trusts key id
&quot;265FA05B&quot;, which is the standard SpamAssassin
release key. Use this option to trust additional keys. See
the --import option for how to add keys to sa-update s
keyring. For sa-update to use a key it must be in sa-
updates keyring and trusted.</p>

<p>For multiple keys, use the option multiple times.
i.e.:</p>

<p>sa-update --gpgkey E580B363 --gpgkey 298BC7D0</p>

<p>Note: use of this option automatically enables GPG
verification.</p>

<p>--gpgkeyfile Similar to the --gpgkey option, except
specify the additional keys in a file instead of on the
commandline. This is extremely useful when there are a lot
of additional keys that you wish to trust.</p>

<p>--gpghomedir Specify a directory path to use as a
storage area for the &quot;sa-update&quot; GPG keyring. By
default, this is</p>

<p>/etc/mail/spamassassin/sa-update-keys</p>

<p>--import Use to import GPG key(s) from a file into the
sa-update keyring which is located in the directory
specified by --gpghomedir. Before using channels from third
party sources, you should use this option to import the GPG
key(s) used by those channels. You must still use the
--gpgkey or --gpgkeyfile options above to get sa- update to
trust imported keys.</p>

<p>To import multiple keys, use the option multiple times.
i.e.:</p>

<p>sa-update --import channel1-GPG.KEY --import
channel2-GPG.KEY</p>

<p>Note: use of this option automatically enables GPG
verification.</p>

<p>--refreshmirrors Force the list of sa-update mirrors for
each channel, stored in the MIRRORED.BY file, to be updated.
By default, the MIRRORED.BY file will be cached for up to 7
days after each time it is downloaded.</p>

<p>--updatedir By default, &quot;sa-update&quot; will use
the system-wide rules update directory:</p>

<p>/var/lib/spamassassin/3.003001</p>

<p>If the updates should be stored in another location,
specify it here.</p>

<p>Note that use of this option is not recommended; if
youre just using sa-update to download updated rulesets for
a scanner, and sa- update is placing updates in the wrong
directory, you probably need to rebuild SpamAssassin with
different &quot;Makefile.PL&quot; arguments, instead of
overriding sa-updates runtime behaviour.</p>

<p>-D [area,...], --debug [area,...] Produce debugging
output. If no areas are listed, all debugging information is
printed. Diagnostic output can also be enabled for each area
individually; area is the area of the code to instrument.
For example, to produce diagnostic output on channel, gpg,
and http, use:</p>

<p>sa-update -D channel,gpg,http</p>

<p>For more information about which areas (also known as
channels) are available, please see the documentation at
&lt;http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/DebugChannels&gt;.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print help message and exit.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print sa-update version and exit.</p>

<p>EXIT CODES An exit code of 0 means an update was
available, and was downloaded and installed successfully if
--checkonly was not specified.</p>

<p>An exit code of 1 means no fresh updates were
available.</p>

<p>An exit code of 2 means that at least one update is
available but that a lint check of the site pre files
failed. The site pre files must pass a lint check before any
updates are attempted.</p>

<p>An exit code of 4 or higher, indicates that errors
occurred while attempting to download and extract
updates.</p>
