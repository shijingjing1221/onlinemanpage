<p>UALARM(3) Linux Programmer s Manual UALARM(3)</p>

<p>NAME ualarm - schedule signal after given number of
microseconds</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>useconds_t ualarm(useconds_t usecs, useconds_t
interval);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>ualarm(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ualarm() function causes the signal
SIGALRM to be sent to the invoking process after (not less
than) usecs microseconds. The delay may be lengthened
slightly by any system activity or by the time spent
processing the call or by the granularity of system
timers.</p>

<p>Unless caught or ignored, the SIGALRM signal will
terminate the pro- cess.</p>

<p>If the interval argument is non-zero, further SIGALRM
signals will be sent every interval microseconds after the
first.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE This function returns the number of
microseconds remaining for any alarm that was previously
set, or 0 if no alarm was pending.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINTR Interrupted by a signal.</p>

<p>EINVAL usecs or interval is not smaller than 1000000.
(On systems where that is considered an error.)</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001. POSIX.1-2001 marks
ualarm() as obsolete. POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification
of ualarm(). 4.3BSD, SUSv2, and POSIX do not define any
errors.</p>

<p>NOTES The type useconds_t is an unsigned integer type
capable of holding integers in the range [0,1000000]. On the
original BSD implementation, and in glibc before version
2.1, the arguments to ualarm() were instead typed as
unsigned int. Programs will be more portable if they never
mention useconds_t explicitly.</p>

<p>The interaction of this function with other timer
functions such as alarm(2), sleep(3), nanosleep(2),
setitimer(2), timer_create(2), timer_delete(2),
timer_getoverrun(2), timer_gettime(2), timer_set- time(2),
usleep(3) is unspecified.</p>

<p>This function is obsolete. Use setitimer(2) or POSIX
interval timers (timer_create(2), etc.) instead.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO alarm(2), getitimer(2), nanosleep(2),
select(2), setitimer(2), usleep(3), time(7)</p>
