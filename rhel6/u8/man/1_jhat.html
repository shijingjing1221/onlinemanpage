<p>NAME jhat - Analyzes the Java heap. This command is
experimental and unsupported.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jhat [ options ] heap-dump-file</p>

<p>options The command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p>heap-dump-file Java binary heap dump file to be browsed.
For a dump file that contains multiple heap dumps, you can
specify which dump in the file by appending #&lt;number&gt;
to the file name, for example, myfile.hprof#3.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The jhat command parses a Java heap dump
file and starts a web server. The jhat command lets you to
browse heap dumps with your favorite web browser. The jhat
command supports predesigned queries such as show all
instances of a known class MyClass, and Object Query
Language (OQL). OQL is similar to SQL, except for querying
heap dumps. Help on OQL is available from the OQL help page
shown by the jhat command. With the default port, OQL help
is available at http://localhost:7000/oqlhelp/</p>

<p>There are several ways to generate a Java heap dump:</p>

<p>&middot; Use the jmap -dump option to obtain a heap dump
at runtime. See jmap(1).</p>

<p>&middot; Use the jconsole option to obtain a heap dump
through HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean at runtime. See jconsole(1)
and the HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean interface description at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jre/api/management/extension/com/sun/management/HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean.html</p>

<p>&middot; Heap dump is generated when an OutOfMemoryError
is thrown by specifying the -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) option.</p>

<p>&middot; Use the hprof command. See the HPROF: A
Heap/CPU Profiling Tool at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/samples/hprof.html</p>

<p>OPTIONS -stack false|true Turns off tracking object
allocation call stack. If allocation site information is not
available in the heap dump, then you have to set this flag
to false. The default is true.</p>

<p>-refs false|true Turns off tracking of references to
objects. Default is true. By default, back pointers, which
are objects that point to a specified object such as
referrers or incoming references, are calculated for all
objects in the heap.</p>

<p>-port port-number Sets the port for the jhat HTTP
server. Default is 7000.</p>

<p>-exclude exclude-file Specifies a file that lists data
members that should be excluded from the reachable objects
query. For example, if the file lists
java.lang.String.value, then, then whenever the list of
objects that are reachable from a specific object o are
calculated, reference paths that involve
java.lang.String.value field are not considered.</p>

<p>-baseline exclude-file Specifies a baseline heap dump.
Objects in both heap dumps with the same object ID are
marked as not being new. Other objects are marked as new.
This is useful for comparing two different heap dumps.</p>

<p>-debug int Sets the debug level for this tool. A level
of 0 means no debug output. Set higher values for more
verbose modes.</p>

<p>-version Reports the release number and exits</p>

<p>-h Dsiplays a help message and exits.</p>

<p>-help Displays a help message and exits.</p>

<p>-Jflag Passes flag to the Java Virtual Machine on which
the jhat command is running. For example, -J-Xmx512m to use
a maximum heap size of 512 MB.</p>
