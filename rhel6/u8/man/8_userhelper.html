<p>USERHELPER(8) USERHELPER(8)</p>

<p>NAME userhelper - A helper interface to PAM.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS userhelper [ -t ] [ -w prog args ] [ -c ] [ -f
full-name ] [ -o office ] [ -p office-phone ] [ -h
home-phone ] [ -s shell ] [ username ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION NOTE this program is NOT intended to be run
interactively. If you want to change this information on the
command line use passwd(1), chfn(1), or chsh(1).</p>

<p>This program provides a basic interface to change a
users password, gecos information, and shell. The main
difference between this program and its traditional
equivalents is that prompts are written to standard out to
make it easy for a GUI wrapper to interface to it as a child
process.</p>

<p>The output is in the form of:</p>

<p>&lt;number&gt; &lt;string&gt;</p>

<p>Where the number is the type of prompt returned from
libpam, and the string is the prompt to give the user.</p>

<p>The prompt numbers are as follows:</p>

<p>1 Prompt with visible input.</p>

<p>2 Prompt with invisible input.</p>

<p>3 Suggested answer for the current prompt.</p>

<p>4 Informational message.</p>

<p>5 Error message.</p>

<p>6 Count of messages sent in this block so far.</p>

<p>7 The name of the service being used.</p>

<p>8 Whether or not the command will be executed as the
user if authentication fails.</p>

<p>9 The name of the user being authenticated.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -t Use text mode authentication instead of the
numbered message types just described; only used with
-w.</p>

<p>-w Specify a program name to be run and arguments to be
passed to it. userhelper will look in the file
/etc/security/con- sole.apps/programname for the name of a
user to authenticate, the path of the binary to be run, and
other settings described below. userhelper will then attempt
to authenticate the user using PAM, specifying programname
as the PAM service name. If authentication succeeds, the
binary will be run with superuser privileges. If the
configuration file specifies that PAM ses- sion management
should be performed, userhelper will also open a PAM session
before starting the program, and close the session when the
program terminates. If authentication fails, user- helper
can be configured run the program with the users privi-
leges instead.</p>

<p>-c Change the current users password. Note that this
option can- not be used with any of the other options. This
is due to the limitation in the interface to libpam.</p>

<p>-f Specify a new Full Name.</p>

<p>-o Specify a new Office.</p>

<p>-p Specify a new Office Phone.</p>

<p>-h Specify a new Home Phone.</p>

<p>-s Specify a new shell.</p>

<p>WRAPPER CONFIGURATION The wrapper configuration file
used with -w contains variable assign- ments and file
inclusions.</p>

<p>A file inclusion line has the following form: . path
(that is a dot and a space, followed by path). If path is
relative, it is interpreted relative to the directory
containing the current file. The file inclusion line is
interpreted by inserting contents of path to the current
file. Nested file inclusions are possible, recursive file
inclusion results in undefined behavior.</p>

<p>A variable assignment line has the following form:
name=value No additional white space is allowed. If value is
surrounded by a matching pair of &quot; or quotes, the
quotes are removed; otherwise, the characters are removed,
except that \is replaced by a single.</p>

<p>The following variables are recognized:</p>

<p>USER The name of the user userhelper should attempt to
authenticate the invoking user as. Typically this is root.
The special value &lt;user&gt; (which is also the default)
indicates that user- helper should authenticate the invoking
user.</p>

<p>The special value &lt;none&gt; indicates that access
should be denied; when used in conjunction with UGROUPS,
members of the given groups can authenticate but all others
are given an Insufficient Rights message.</p>

<p>UGROUPS A comma-separated list of groups whose members
will be authenti- cated as if USER were set to the special
value &lt;user&gt;. If the invoking user is not a member of
one of these groups, the name defined in USER will be used
as normal. For example, setting UGROUPS to wheel and USER to
root allows members of wheel (tra- ditionally used for
administrative privileges) to authenticate with their own
credentials and requires other users to provide the root
password.</p>

<p>PROGRAM The name of the binary to execute if
authentication succeeds. This should always be specified as
an absolute path. If not specified, userhelper will attempt
to run /sbin/programname first, and failing that, it will
attempt to run /usr/sbin/pro- gramname.</p>

<p>SESSION Specifies whether or not userhelper should
perform PAM session management when running the program.
Typically this is needed if the PAM configuration uses a
module such as pam_xauth.so to forward X11 authentication
tokens for use by the program. Valid values are yes and no,
with the default being no.</p>

<p>KEEP_ENV_VARS A comma-separated list of names of
environment variables that should be kept in the environment
of the wrapped program. The environment is cleared by
default and only a few selected vari- ables are kept in the
environment if they do not contain any potentially dangerous
substrings.</p>

<p>RETRY Specifies the number of times userhelper should
attempt to authenticate the user if the initial attempt
fails. The default value is 2, which causes userhelper to
attempt to authenticate the user a total of 3 times.</p>

<p>FALLBACK Specifies whether or not the specified binary
should be run with the invoking users privileges if
authentication fails. This option is useful for running
applications which gain additional abilities when run with
superuser privileges, but which are still useful when run
without them.</p>

<p>NOXOPTION The name of an option which, if passed to
userhelper as an argu- ment for the program it will run,
will cause userhelper to behave as if the -t flag had been
passed to it.</p>

<p>GUI Specifies whether or not userhelper should use
consolehelper to present graphical dialog boxes when
prompting the user for information. This is the inverse of
the -t option. Valid val- ues are yes and no, with the
default being yes.</p>

<p>BANNER Specifies specific text which userhelper should
present to the user when userhelper prompts for information.
The default is a generic message based on the PAM service
name.</p>

<p>BANNER_DOMAIN Specifies the text domain in which
translations of the banner are stored. This setting is
deprecated in favor of the DOMAIN setting.</p>

<p>DOMAIN Specifies the text domain in which translations
of strings are stored. If this setting is specified, it
overrides any setting for BANNER_DOMAIN which may also be
set.</p>

<p>STARTUP_NOTIFICATION_NAME Specifies the startup
notification name used for startup notifi- cation.</p>

<p>STARTUP_NOTIFICATION_DESCRIPTION Specifies the startup
notification name used for startup notifi- cation.</p>

<p>STARTUP_NOTIFICATION_WORKSPACE Specifies the startup
notification workspace used for startup notification.</p>

<p>STARTUP_NOTIFICATION_WMCLASS Specifies the startup
notification binary wmclass used for startup
notification.</p>

<p>STARTUP_NOTIFICATION_BINARY_NAME Specifies the startup
notification binary name used for startup notification.</p>

<p>STARTUP_NOTIFICATION_ICON_NAME Specifies the startup
notification icon name used for startup notification.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS A non-zero exit status indicates an error
occurred. Those errors are:</p>

<p>1 The authentication passwords was incorrect.</p>

<p>2 One or more of the GECOS fields is invalid. This
occurs when there is a colon supplied in one of the
fields.</p>

<p>3 Password resetting error.</p>

<p>4 Some system files are locked.</p>

<p>5 User unknown.</p>

<p>6 Insufficient rights.</p>

<p>7 Invalid call to this program.</p>

<p>8 The shell provided is not valid (i.e., does not exist
in /etc/shells).</p>

<p>9 Ran out of memory.</p>

<p>10 Could not find the program.</p>

<p>11 Executing the program failed even though it
exists.</p>

<p>12 The user canceled the operation.</p>

<p>255 Unknown error.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd The gecos and shell information is
stored in this file.</p>

<p>/etc/shells This file is checked to see if the new shell
supplied is valid.</p>

<p>/etc/security/console.apps/prog This file contains the
values which will be used for the variables when userhelper
is used with the -w flag.</p>

<p>/etc/pam.d/prog This file contains the PAM configuration
used when userhelper is used with the -w flag.</p>
