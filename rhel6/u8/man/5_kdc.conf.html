<p>KDC.CONF(5) KDC.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME kdc.conf - Kerberos V5 KDC configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION kdc.conf specifies per-realm configuration
data to be used by the Ker- beros V5 Authentication Service
and Key Distribution Center (AS/KDC). This includes
database, key and per-realm defaults.</p>

<p>The kdc.conf file uses the same format as the krb5.conf
file. For a basic description of the syntax, please refer to
the krb5.conf descrip- tion.</p>

<p>The following sections are currently used in the
kdc.conf file:</p>

<p>[kdcdefaults] Contains parameters which control the
overall behaviour of the KDC.</p>

<p>[realms] Contains subsections keyed by Kerberos realm
names which describe per-realm KDC parameters.</p>

<p>KDCDEFAULTS SECTION The following relations are defined
in the [kdcdefaults] section:</p>

<p>kdc_ports This relation lists the ports which the
Kerberos server should listen on, by default. This list is a
comma separated list of integers. If this relation is not
specified, the compiled-in default is usually port 88 and
port 750.</p>

<p>kdc_tcp_ports This relation lists the ports on which the
Kerberos server should listen for TCP connections by
default. This list is a comma separated list of integers. If
this relation is not spec- ified, the compiled-in default is
not to listen for TCP connec- tions at all.</p>

<p>If you wish to change this (which we do not recommend,
because the current implementation has little protection
against denial- of-service attacks), the standard port
number assigned for Ker- beros TCP traffic is port 88.</p>

<p>v4_mode This string specifies how the KDC should respond
to Kerberos IV packets. Valid values for this relation are
the same as the valid arguments to the -4 flag to krb5kdc.
If this relation is not specified, the compiled-in default
of none is used.</p>

<p>kdc_max_dgram_reply_size Specifies the maximum packet
size that can be sent over UDP. The default value is 4096
bytes.</p>

<p>REALMS SECTION Each tag in the [realms] section of the
file names a Kerberos realm. The value of the tag is a
subsection where the relations in that sub- section define
KDC parameters for that particular realm.</p>

<p>For each realm, the following tags may be specified in
the [realms] subsection:</p>

<p>acl_file This string specifies the location of the
access control list (acl) file that kadmin uses to determine
which principals are allowed which permissions on the
database. The default value is
/var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl.</p>

<p>admin_keytab This string Specifies the location of the
keytab file that kad- min uses to authenticate to the
database. The default value is
/var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab.</p>

<p>database_name This string specifies the location of the
Kerberos database for this realm.</p>

<p>default_principal_expiration This absolute time string
specifies the default expiration date of principals created
in this realm.</p>

<p>default_principal_flags This flag string specifies the
default attributes of principals created in this realm. The
format for the string is a comma- separated list of flags,
with + before each flag to be enabled and - before each flag
to be disabled. The default is for postdateable,
forwardable, tgt-based, renewable, proxiable, dup- skey,
allow-tickets, and service to be enabled, and all others to
be disabled.</p>

<p>There are a number of possible flags:</p>

<p>postdateable Enabling this flag allows the principal to
obtain post- dateable tickets.</p>

<p>forwardable Enabling this flag allows the principal to
obtain for- wardable tickets.</p>

<p>tgt-based Enabling this flag allows a principal to
obtain tickets based on a ticket-granting-ticket, rather
than repeating the authentication process that was used to
obtain the TGT.</p>

<p>renewable Enabling this flag allows the principal to
obtain renew- able tickets.</p>

<p>proxiable Enabling this flag allows the principal to
obtain proxy tickets.</p>

<p>dup-skey Enabling this flag allows the principal to
obtain a ses- sion key for another user, permitting
user-to-user authentication for this principal.</p>

<p>allow-tickets Enabling this flag means that the KDC will
issue tickets for this principal. Disabling this flag
essentially deactivates the principal within this realm.</p>

<p>preauth If this flag is enabled on a client principal,
then that principal is required to preauthenticate to the
KDC before receiving any tickets. On a service principal,
enabling this flag means that service tickets for this
principal will only be issued to clients with a TGT that has
the preauthenticated ticket set.</p>

<p>hwauth If this flag is enabled, then the principal is
required to preauthenticate using a hardware device before
receiv- ing any tickets.</p>

<p>pwchange Enabling this flag forces a password change for
this principal.</p>

<p>service Enabling this flag allows the the KDC to issue
service tickets for this principal.</p>

<p>pwservice If this flag is enabled, it marks this
principal as a password change service. This should only be
used in special cases, for example, if a user s password has
expired, the user has to get tickets for that principal to
be able to change it without going through the normal
password authentication.</p>

<p>dict_file This string location of the dictionary file
containing strings that are not allowed as passwords. If
this tag is not set or if there is no policy assigned to the
principal, then no check will be done.</p>

<p>kadmind_port This port number specifies the port on
which the kadmind daemon is to listen for this realm.</p>

<p>kpasswd_port This port number specifies the port on
which the kadmind daemon is to listen for this realm.</p>

<p>key_stash_file This string specifies the location where
the master key has been stored with kdb5_stash.</p>

<p>kdc_ports This string specifies the list of ports that
the KDC is to lis- ten to for this realm. By default, the
value of kdc_ports as specified in the [kdcdefaults] section
is used.</p>

<p>kdc_tcp_ports This string specifies the list of ports
that the KDC is to lis- ten to for TCP requests for this
realm. By default, the value of kdc_tcp_ports as specified
in the [kdcdefaults] section is used.</p>

<p>master_key_name This string specifies the name of the
principal associated with the master key. The default value
is K/M.</p>

<p>master_key_type This key type string represents the
master keys key type.</p>

<p>max_life This delta time string specifies the maximum
time period that a ticket may be valid for in this
realm.</p>

<p>max_renewable_life This delta time string specifies the
maximum time period that a ticket may be renewed for in this
realm.</p>

<p>iprop_enable This boolean (&quot;true&quot; or
&quot;false&quot;) specifies whether incremental database
propagation is enabled. The default is
&quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p>iprop_master_ulogsize This numeric value specifies the
maximum number of log entries to be retained for incremental
propagation. The maximum value is 2500; default is 1000.</p>

<p>iprop_slave_poll This delta time string specifies how
often the slave KDC polls for new updates from the master.
Default is &quot;2m&quot; (that is, two minutes).</p>

<p>supported_enctypes list of key:salt strings that
specifies the default key/salt combinations of principals
for this realm</p>

<p>reject_bad_transit this boolean specifies whether or not
the list of transited realms for cross-realm tickets should
be checked against the transit path computed from the realm
names and the [capaths] section of its krb5.conf file</p>
