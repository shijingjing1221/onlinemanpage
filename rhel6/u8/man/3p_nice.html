<p>NICE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual NICE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME nice - change the nice value of a process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int nice(int incr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The nice() function shall add the value of
incr to the nice value of the calling process. A process
nice value is a non-negative number for which a more
positive value shall result in less favorable
scheduling.</p>

<p>A maximum nice value of 2*{NZERO}-1 and a minimum nice
value of 0 shall be imposed by the system. Requests for
values above or below these lim- its shall result in the
nice value being set to the corresponding limit. Only a
process with appropriate privileges can lower the nice
value.</p>

<p>Calling the nice() function has no effect on the
priority of processes or threads with policy SCHED_FIFO or
SCHED_RR. The effect on processes or threads with other
scheduling policies is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The nice value set with nice() shall be applied to the
process. If the process is multi-threaded, the nice value
shall affect all system scope threads in the process.</p>

<p>As -1 is a permissible return value in a successful
situation, an application wishing to check for error
situations should set errno to 0, then call nice(), and if
it returns -1, check to see whether errno is non-zero.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, nice() shall
return the new nice value -{NZERO}. Otherwise, -1 shall be
returned, the process nice value shall not be changed, and
errno shall be set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The nice() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EPERM The incr argument is negative and the calling
process does not have appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Changing the Nice Value The following example
adds the value of the incr argument, -20, to the nice value
of the calling process.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; ... int incr = -20; int
ret;</p>

<p>ret = nice(incr);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
