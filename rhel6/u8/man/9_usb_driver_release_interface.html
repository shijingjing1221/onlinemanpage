<p>NAME usb_driver_release_interface - unbind a driver from
an interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void usb_driver_release_interface(struct
usb_driver * driver, struct usb_interface * iface);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS driver the driver to be unbound</p>

<p>iface the interface from which it will be unbound</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This can be used by drivers to release an
interface without waiting for their disconnect methods to be
called. In typical cases this also causes the driver
disconnect method to be called.</p>

<p>This call is synchronous, and may not be used in an
interrupt context. Callers must own the device lock, so
driver disconnect entries don&acute;t need extra locking,
but other call contexts may need to explicitly claim that
lock.</p>
