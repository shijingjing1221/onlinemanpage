<p>NAME postconf - Postfix configuration utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS postconf [-dhnv] [-c config_dir] [parameter
...]</p>

<p>postconf [-aAmlv] [-c config_dir]</p>

<p>postconf [-ev] [-c config_dir] [parameter=value ...]</p>

<p>postconf [-#v] [-c config_dir] [parameter ...]</p>

<p>postconf [-btv] [-c config_dir] [template_file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The postconf(1) command displays the actual
values of configuration parameters, changes configuration
parameter values, or displays other configuration
information about the Postfix mail system.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>-a List the available SASL server plug-in types. The
SASL plug-in type is selected with the smtpd_sasl_type
configuration parame- ter by specifying one of the names
listed below.</p>

<p>cyrus This server plug-in is available when Postfix is
built with Cyrus SASL support.</p>

<p>dovecot This server plug-in uses the Dovecot
authentication server, and is available when Postfix is
built with any form of SASL support.</p>

<p>This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and
later.</p>

<p>-A List the available SASL client plug-in types. The
SASL plug-in type is selected with the smtp_sasl_type or
lmtp_sasl_type con- figuration parameters by specifying one
of the names listed below.</p>

<p>cyrus This client plug-in is available when Postfix is
built with Cyrus SASL support.</p>

<p>This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and
later.</p>

<p>-b [template_file] Display the message text that appears
at the beginning of deliv- ery status notification (DSN)
messages, with $name expressions replaced by actual values.
To override the built-in message text, specify a template
file at the end of the command line, or specify a template
file in main.cf with the bounce_template_file parameter. To
force selection of the built-in message text tem- plates,
specify an empty template file name (in shell language:
&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p>This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and
later.</p>

<p>-c config_dir The main.cf configuration file is in the
named directory instead of the default configuration
directory.</p>

<p>-d Print default parameter settings instead of actual
settings.</p>

<p>-e Edit the main.cf configuration file. The file is
copied to a temporary file then renamed into place.
Parameters and values are specified on the command line. Use
quotes in order to pro- tect shell metacharacters and
whitespace.</p>

<p>-h Show parameter values only, not the name = label that
nor- mally precedes the value.</p>

<p>-l List the names of all supported mailbox locking
methods. Post- fix supports the following methods:</p>

<p>flock A kernel-based advisory locking method for local
files only. This locking method is available on systems with
a BSD compatible library.</p>

<p>fcntl A kernel-based advisory locking method for local
and remote files.</p>

<p>dotlock An application-level locking method. An
application locks a file named filename by creating a file
named file- name.lock. The application is expected to remove
its own lock file, as well as stale lock files that were
left behind after abnormal termination.</p>

<p>-m List the names of all supported lookup table types.
In Postfix configuration files, lookup tables are specified
as type:name, where type is one of the types listed below.
The table name syn- tax depends on the lookup table type as
described in the DATABASE_README document.</p>

<p>btree A sorted, balanced tree structure. This is
available on systems with support for Berkeley DB
databases.</p>

<p>cdb A read-optimized structure with no support for
incremen- tal updates. This is available on systems with
support for CDB databases.</p>

<p>cidr A table that associates values with Classless
Inter- Domain Routing (CIDR) patterns. This is described in
cidr_table(5).</p>

<p>dbm An indexed file type based on hashing. This is
available on systems with support for DBM databases.</p>

<p>environ The UNIX process environment array. The lookup
key is the variable name. Originally implemented for
testing, some- one may find this useful someday.</p>

<p>hash An indexed file type based on hashing. This is
available on systems with support for Berkeley DB
databases.</p>

<p>ldap (read-only) Perform lookups using the LDAP
protocol. This is described in ldap_table(5).</p>

<p>mysql (read-only) Perform lookups using the MYSQL
protocol. This is described in mysql_table(5).</p>

<p>pcre (read-only) A lookup table based on Perl Compatible
Regular Expres- sions. The file format is described in
pcre_table(5).</p>

<p>pgsql (read-only) Perform lookups using the PostgreSQL
protocol. This is described in pgsql_table(5).</p>

<p>proxy (read-only) A lookup table that is implemented via
the Postfix prox- ymap(8) service. The table name syntax is
type:name.</p>

<p>regexp (read-only) A lookup table based on regular
expressions. The file format is described in
regexp_table(5).</p>

<p>sdbm An indexed file type based on hashing. This is
available on systems with support for SDBM databases.</p>

<p>static (read-only) A table that always returns its name
as lookup result. For example, static:foobar always returns
the string foo- bar as lookup result.</p>

<p>tcp (read-only) Perform lookups using a simple
request-reply protocol that is described in tcp_table(5).
This feature is not included with the stable Postfix
release.</p>

<p>unix (read-only) A limited way to query the UNIX
authentication database. The following tables are
implemented:</p>

<p>unix:passwd.byname The table is the UNIX password
database. The key is a login name. The result is a password
file entry in passwd(5) format.</p>

<p>unix:group.byname The table is the UNIX group database.
The key is a group name. The result is a group file entry in
group(5) format.</p>

<p>Other table types may exist depending on how Postfix was
built.</p>

<p>-n Print parameter settings that are not left at their
built-in default value, because they are explicitly
specified in main.cf.</p>

<p>-t [template_file] Display the templates for delivery
status notification (DSN) messages. To override the built-in
templates, specify a template file at the end of the command
line, or specify a template file in main.cf with the
bounce_template_file parameter. To force selection of the
built-in templates, specify an empty template file name (in
shell language: &quot;&quot;).</p>

<p>This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and
later.</p>

<p>-v Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes.
Multiple -v options make the software increasingly
verbose.</p>

<p>-# Edit the main.cf configuration file. The file is
copied to a temporary file then renamed into place. The
parameters specified on the command line are commented-out,
so that they revert to their default values. Specify a list
of parameter names, not name=value pairs. There is no
postconf command to perform the reverse operation.</p>

<p>This feature is available with Postfix 2.6 and
later.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems are reported to the standard error
stream.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT MAIL_CONFIG Directory with Postfix
configuration files.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS The following main.cf
parameters are especially relevant to this pro- gram.</p>

<p>The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
postconf(5) for more details including examples.</p>

<p>config_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The default
location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf con-
figuration files.</p>

<p>bounce_template_file (empty) Pathname of a configuration
file with bounce message templates.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/postfix/main.cf, Postfix configuration
parameters</p>
