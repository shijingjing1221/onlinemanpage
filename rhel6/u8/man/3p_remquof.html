<p>REMQUO(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual REMQUO(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME remquo, remquof, remquol - remainder functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double remquo(double x, double y, int *quo); float
remquof(float x, float y, int *quo); long double
remquol(long double x, long double y, int *quo);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The remquo(), remquof(), and remquol()
functions shall compute the same remainder as the
remainder(), remainderf(), and remainderl() functions,
respectively. In the object pointed to by quo, they store a
value whose sign is the sign of x/ y and whose magnitude is
congruent modulo 2**n to the magnitude of the integral
quotient of x/ y, where n is an imple- mentation-defined
integer greater than or equal to 3.</p>

<p>An application wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to zero and call
feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an
error has occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE These functions shall return x REM y.</p>

<p>If x or y is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.</p>

<p>If x is &plusmn;Inf or y is zero and the other argument
is non-NaN, a domain error shall occur, and either a NaN (if
supported), or an implementa- tion-defined value shall be
returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>Domain Error The x argument is &plusmn;Inf, or the y
argument is &plusmn;0 and the other argument is non-NaN.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to [EDOM].
If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the invalid floating-point
exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE On error, the expressions
(math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling
&amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each other, but at
least one of them must be non-zero.</p>

<p>RATIONALE These functions are intended for implementing
argument reductions which can exploit a few low-order bits
of the quotient. Note that x may be so large in magnitude
relative to y that an exact representation of the quotient
is not practical.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
