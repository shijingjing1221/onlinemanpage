<p>XIQUERYDEVICE(3) XIQUERYDEVICE(3)</p>

<p>NAME XIQueryDevice, XIFreeDeviceInfo - get information
about devices.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput2.h&gt;</p>

<p>XIDeviceInfo* XIQueryDevice( Display *display, int
deviceid, int *ndevices_return);</p>

<p>XIFreeDeviceInfo( XIDeviceInfo *info);</p>

<p>deviceid Specifies the device to query or XIAllDevices
or XIAllMasterDevices.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>ndevices_return Returns the number of devices
returned.</p>

<p>info A list of device XIDeviceInfo structs to be
freed.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XIQueryDevice returns information about
one or more input devices. If the deviceid specifies a
device, ndevices_return is 1 and the returned information
describes only the requested device. If deviceid is
XIAllDevices or XIAllMasterDevices, ndevices_return is the
number of devices or master devices, respectively, and the
returned information represents all devices or all master
devices, respectively.</p>

<p>To free the XIDeviceInfo array returned by
XIQueryDevice, use XIFreeDeviceInfo.</p>

<p>For each input device requested, the XIQueryDevice
returns an XIDeviceInfo structure. Each structure contains
information about the capabilities of one input device
available to the server.</p>

<p>typedef struct { int deviceid; char *name; int use; int
attachment; Bool enabled; int num_classes; XIAnyClassInfo
**classes; } XIDeviceInfo;</p>

<p>The deviceid is the numeric unique id of the device. A
deviceid is unique for the life-time of a device but a
server may re-use the id once a device has been removed.</p>

<p>The name points to a null-terminated string specifying
the identifier of the device.</p>

<p>The use and attachment fields specify the type of the
device and the current attachment or pairing. - If use is
XIMasterPointer, the device is a master pointer and
attachment specifies the deviceid of the paired master
keyboard. - If use is XIMasterKeyboard, the device is a
master keyboard, and the attachment field specifies the
paired master pointer. - If use is XISlavePointer, the
device is a slave device and currently attached to the
master pointer specified in attachement. - If use is
XISlaveKeyboard, the device is a slave device an currently
attached to the master keyboard specified in attachment. -
If use is XIFloatingSlave, the device is a slave device
currently not attached to any master device. The value of
the attachment field for floating slave devices is
undefined.</p>

<p>The enabled field specifies if the device is currently
enabled and can send events. Disabled devices will not send
events.</p>

<p>The num_classes field specifies the number of input
classes pointed to by classes. The first two fields of all
input classes are identical.</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; int sourceid; }
XIAnyClassInfo;</p>

<p>The type field specifies the type of the input class.
Currently, the following types are defined: XIKeyClass,
XIButtonClass, XIValuatorClass, XIScrollClass,
XITouchClass</p>

<p>In the future, additional types may be added. Clients
are required to ignore unknown input classes.</p>

<p>The sourceid is the deviceid this class originated from.
For master devices, the sourceid is typically the id of the
slave device currently sending events. For slave devices,
the sourceid is typically the device&rsquo;s id.</p>

<p>A device may have zero or one XIButtonClass, denoting
the device&rsquo;s capability to send button events.</p>

<p>typedef struct { int mask_len; unsigned char *mask; }
XIButtonState;</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; int sourceid; int
num_buttons; Atom *labels; XIButtonState state; }
XIButtonClassInfo;</p>

<p>The num_buttons field specifies the number of buttons
available on this device. A device that has an XIButtonClass
must have at least one button.</p>

<p>labels is a list of num_buttons Atoms specifying the
button labels for this device. If the label is not None,
then the label specifies the type of button in physical
device order (i.e. as the buttons are numbered on the
physical input device).</p>

<p>The state is the current button state as seen by clients
(i.e. after button mapping is applied). The mask_len field
specifies the length of mask in bytes. For each button on
the device, the respective bit in mask is set if the button
is currently logically down.</p>

<p>A device may have zero or one XIKeyClass, denoting the
device&rsquo;s capability to send key events.</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; int sourceid; int
num_keycodes; int *keycodes; } XIKeyClassInfo;</p>

<p>The num_keycodes field specifies the number of keycodes
available on this device. A device that has an XIKeyClass
must have at least one keycode.</p>

<p>keycodes is a list of num_keycodes keycodes the device
may send.</p>

<p>A device may have zero or more XIValuatorClass, denoting
the device&rsquo;s capability to send coordinates.</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; int sourceid; int number;
Atom label; double min; double max; double value; int
resolution; int mode; } XIValuatorClassInfo;</p>

<p>The number field specifies the number of the axis on the
physical device.</p>

<p>If the label field is not None, the value of label is an
Atom describing the axis.</p>

<p>min and max are the minimum and maximum values allowed
on this axis. If both are zero, no minumum or maximum values
are set on this device. value is the current value of this
axis.</p>

<p>The resolution field specifies the resolution of the
device in units/m.</p>

<p>The mode specifies the mode of this axis. If the mode is
XIModeAbsolute this axis sends absolute coordinates. If the
mode is XIModeRelative, this device sends relative
coordinates.</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; int sourceid; int number; int
scroll_type; double increment; int flags; }
XIScrollClassInfo;</p>

<p>This class describes scrolling capability on a valuator.
For each XIScrollClassInfo, an XIValuatorClassInfo with the
same number is present on the device.</p>

<p>The number field specifies the valuator number on the
physical device that this scroll information applies to. See
the respective XIValuatorClassInfo for detailed information
on this valuator.</p>

<p>The scroll_type field specifies the type of scrolling,
either XIScrollTypeVertical or XIScrollTypeHorizontal.</p>

<p>The increment specifies the value change considered one
unit of scrolling down.</p>

<p>The flags field specifies flags that apply to this
scrolling information:</p>

<p>If XIScrollFlagNoEmulation is set, the server will not
emulate legacy button events for valuator changes on this
valuator.</p>

<p>If XIScrollFlagPreferred is set, this axis is the
preferred axis for this scroll type and will be used for the
emulation of XI_Motion events when the driver submits legacy
scroll button events.</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; int sourceid; int mode; int
num_touches; } XITouchClassInfo;</p>

<p>A device may have zero or one XITouchClassInfo, denoting
multi-touch capability on the device. A device with a
XITouchClassInfo may send TouchBegin, TouchUpdate, TouchEnd
and TouchOwnership events.</p>

<p>The mode field is either XIDirectTouch for direct-input
touch devices such as touchscreens or XIDependentTouch for
indirect input devices such as touchpads. For XIDirectTouch
devices, touch events are sent to window at the position the
touch occured. For XIDependentTouch devices, touch events
are sent to the window at the position of the device&rsquo;s
sprite.</p>

<p>The num_touches field defines the maximum number of
simultaneous touches the device supports. A num_touches of 0
means the maximum number of simultaneous touches is
undefined or unspecified. This field should be used as a
guide only, devices will lie about their capabilities.</p>

<p>A device with an XITouchClassInfo may still send pointer
events. The valuators must be defined with the respective
XIValuatorClass classes. A valuator may send both pointer
and touch-events.</p>

<p>XIQueryDevice can generate a BadDevice error.</p>

<p>XIFreeDeviceInfo frees the information returned by
XIQueryDevice.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid device was specified.
The device does not exist or is not a pointer device.</p>
