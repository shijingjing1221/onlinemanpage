<p>NAME ppmtoppm - copy PPM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtoppm</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtoppm simply copies a PPM image from Standard Input
to Standard Out- put. This may seem an unnecessary
duplication of cat, but remember that a PPM program can read
a PBM or PGM image, and the right kind of PAM, as if it were
PPM. So ppmtoppm can read either a PBM, PGM, or PPM image
and produce a PPM image as output.</p>

<p>Even that is of limited usefulness because of the fact
that almost any program to which you would feed the
resulting PPM image could also just take the original image
directly. However, sometimes you really need a true PPM
image.</p>

<p>When you know you have a PGM image and want a PPM image,
pgmtoppm is a more general way to do that conversion. When
you know you have a PBM image, use that and pbmtopgm.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pgmtopgm(1), pamtopam(1), pamtopnm(1),
pgmtoppm(1), pbmtopgm(1), ppm(1), ppm(1), ppm(1),</p>

<p>HISTORY This program was added to Netpbm in Release 10.9
(September 2002).</p>
