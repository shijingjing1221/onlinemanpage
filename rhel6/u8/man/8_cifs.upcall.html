<p>CIFS.UPCALL(8) System Administration tools

<p>NAME cifs.upcall - Userspace upcall helper for Common
Internet File System (CIFS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cifs.upcall [--trust-dns|-t] [--version|-v]
[--legacy-uid|-l] [--krb5conf=/path/to/krb5.conf|-k
/path/to/...] {keyid}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool is part of the cifs-utils
suite.</p>

<p>cifs.upcall is a userspace helper program for the linux
CIFS client filesystem. There are a number of activities
that the kernel cannot easily do itself. This program is a
callout program that does these things for the kernel and
then returns the result.</p>

<p>cifs.upcall is generally intended to be run when the
kernel calls request-key(8) for a particular key type. While
it can be run directly from the command-line, it&acute;s not
generally intended to be run that way.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c This option is deprecated and is currently
ignored.</p>

<p>--krb5conf=/path/to/krb5.conf|-k /path/to/krb5.conf This
option allows administrators to set an alternate location
for the krb5.conf file that cifs.upcall will use.</p>

<p>--trust-dns|-t With krb5 upcalls, the name used as the
host portion of the service principal defaults to the
hostname portion of the UNC. This option allows the upcall
program to reverse resolve the network address of the server
in order to get the hostname.</p>

<p>This is less secure than not trusting DNS. When using
this option, it&acute;s possible that an attacker could get
control of DNS and trick the client into mounting a
different server altogether. It&acute;s preferable to
instead add server principals to the KDC for every possible
hostname, but this option exists for cases where that
isn&acute;t possible. The default is to not trust reverse
hostname lookups in this fashion.</p>

<p>--legacy-uid|-l Traditionally, the kernel has sent only
a single uid= parameter to the upcall for the SPNEGO upcall
that&acute;s used to determine what users credential cache
to use. This parameter is affected by the uid= mount option,
which also governs the ownership of files on the mount.</p>

<p>Newer kernels send a creduid= option as well, which
contains what uid it thinks actually owns the credentials
that it&acute;s looking for. At mount time, this is
generally set to the real uid of the user doing the mount.
For multisession mounts, its set to the fsuid of the mount
user. Set this option if you want cifs.upcall to use the
older uid= parameter instead of the creduid= parameter.</p>

<p>--version|-v Print version number and exit.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FOR KEYCTL cifs.upcall is designed to be
called from the kernel via the request-key callout program.
This requires that request-key be told where and how to call
this program. The current cifs.upcall program handles two
different key types:</p>

<p>cifs.spnego This keytype is for retrieving kerberos
session keys</p>

<p>dns_resolver This key type is for resolving hostnames
into IP addresses</p>

<p>To make this program useful for CIFS, you&acute;ll need
to set up entries for them in request-key.conf(5).
Here&acute;s an example of an entry for each key type:</p>

<p>#OPERATION TYPE D C PROGRAM ARG1 ARG2... #=========
============= = = ================================ create
cifs.spnego * * /usr/sbin/cifs.upcall %k create dns_resolver
* * /usr/sbin/cifs.upcall %k</p>

<p>See request-key.conf5() for more info on each field.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO request-key.conf(5), mount.cifs(8)</p>
