<p>NAME bacula_unconfined_script_selinux - Security
Enhanced Linux Policy for the bacula_unconfined_script
processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
bacula_unconfined_script processes via flexible mandatory
access control.</p>

<p>The bacula_unconfined_script processes execute with the
bacula_uncon- fined_script_t SELinux type. You can check if
you have these processes running by executing the ps command
with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep bacula_unconfined_script_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The bacula_unconfined_script_t SELinux type
can be entered via the file_type,
bacula_unconfined_script_exec_t, unlabeled_t, proc_type,
filesystem_type, mtrr_device_t, sysctl_type file types.</p>

<p>The default entrypoint paths for the
bacula_unconfined_script_t domain are the following:</p>

<p>all files on the system, /dev/cpu/mtrr</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux bacula_unconfined_script policy is very
flexible allowing users to setup their
bacula_unconfined_script processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
bacula_unconfined_script:</p>

<p>bacula_unconfined_script_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a bacula_unconfined_script_t
can be used to make the process type
bacula_unconfined_script_t permissive. SELinux does not deny
access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux
denials) messages are still generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. bac- ula_unconfined_script policy is
extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you
to manipulate the policy and run bacula_uncon- fined_script
with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to use other domains
file descriptors, you must turn on the allow_domain_fd_use
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_domain_fd_use 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to make
their heap memory executable. Doing this is a really bad
idea. Probably indicates a badly coded executable, but could
indicate an attack. This executable should be reported in
bugzilla, you must turn on the allow_execheap boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execheap 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to map a
memory region as both executable and writable, this is
dangerous and the executable should be reported in
bugzilla), you must turn on the allow_execmem boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execmem 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all unconfined executables to use
libraries requiring text relocation that are not labeled
textrel_shlib_t), you must turn on the allow_execmod
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execmod 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to make
their stack exe- cutable. This should never, ever be
necessary. Probably indicates a badly coded executable, but
could indicate an attack. This executable should be reported
in bugzilla), you must turn on the allow_execstack boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execstack 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all
processes, you must turn on the allow_ptrace boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ptrace 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load
modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to execute in
fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fips_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable reading of urandom for all
domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P global_ssp 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow certain domains to map low memory
in the kernel, you must turn on the mmap_low_allowed
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P mmap_low_allowed 1</p>

<p>If you want to boolean to determine whether the system
permits loading policy, setting enforcing mode, and changing
boolean values. Set this to true and you have to reboot to
set it back, you must turn on the secure_mode_policyload
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P secure_mode_policyload 1</p>

<p>If you want to support X userspace object manager, you
must turn on the xserver_object_manager boolean. Disabled by
default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xserver_object_manager 1</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type
bacula_unconfined_script_t can manage files labeled with the
following file types. The paths listed are the default paths
for these file types. Note the processes UID still need to
have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
