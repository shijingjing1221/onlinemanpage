VFS_SHADOW_COPY2(8)</p>

<p>NAME vfs_shadow_copy2 - Expose snapshots to Windows
clients as shadow copies.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = shadow_copy2</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The vfs_shadow_copy2 VFS module functionality that is
similar to Microsoft Shadow Copy services. When setup
properly, this module allows Microsoft Shadow Copy clients
to browse &quot;shadow copies&quot; on Samba shares.</p>

<p>This is a 2nd implementation of a shadow copy module.
This version has the following features:</p>

<p>1. You don&rsquo;t need to populate your shares with
symlinks to the snapshots. This can be very important when
you have thousands of shares, or use [homes].</p>

<p>2. The inode number of the files is altered so it is
different from the original. This allows the
&rsquo;restore&rsquo; button to work without a sharing
violation.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION vfs_shadow_copy2 relies on a filesystem
snapshot implementation. Many common filesystems have native
support for this.</p>

<p>Filesystem snapshots must be mounted on specially named
directories in order to be recognized by vfs_shadow_copy2.
The snapshot mount points must be immediate children of a
the directory being shared.</p>

<p>The snapshot naming convention is
@GMT-YYYY.MM.DD-hh.mm.ss, where:</p>

<p>&middot; YYYY is the 4 digit year</p>

<p>&middot; MM is the 2 digit month</p>

<p>&middot; DD is the 2 digit day</p>

<p>&middot; hh is the 2 digit hour</p>

<p>&middot; mm is the 2 digit minute</p>

<p>&middot; ss is the 2 digit second.</p>

<p>The vfs_shadow_copy2 snapshot naming convention can be
produced with the following date(1) command:</p>

<p>TZ=GMT date +@GMT-%Y.%m.%d-%H.%M.%S</p>

<p>OPTIONS shadow:snapdir = SNAPDIR Path to the directory
where snapshots are kept.</p>

<p>shadow:basedir = BASEDIR Path to the base directory that
snapshots are from.</p>

<p>shadow:sort = asc/desc, or not specified for unsorted
(default) By this parameter one can specify that the shadow
copy directories should be sorted before they are sent to
the client. This can be beneficial as unix filesystems are
usually not listed alphabetically sorted. If enabled, you
typically want to specify descending order.</p>

<p>shadow:localtime = yes/no This is an optional parameter
that indicates whether the snapshot names are in UTC/GMT or
in local time. By default UTC is expected.</p>

<p>shadow:format = format specification for snapshot names
This is an optional parameter that specifies the format
specification for the naming of snapshots. The format must
be compatible with the conversion specifications recognized
by str[fp]time. The default value is
&quot;@GMT-%Y.%m.%d-%H.%M.%S&quot;.</p>

<p>shadow:fixinodes = yes/no If you enable shadow:fixinodes
then this module will modify the apparent inode number of
files in the snapshot directories using a hash of the files
path. This is needed for snapshot systems where the
snapshots have the same device:inode number as the original
files (such as happens with GPFS snapshots). If you
don&rsquo;t set this option then the &rsquo;restore&rsquo;
button in the shadow copy UI will fail with a sharing
violation.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Add shadow copy support to user home
directories:</p>

<p>[homes] vfs objects = shadow_copy2 shadow:snapdir =
/data/snapshots shadow:basedir = /data/home shadow:sort =
desc</p>

<p>CAVEATS This is not a backup, archival, or version
control solution.</p>

<p>With Samba or Windows servers, vfs_shadow_copy2 is
designed to be an end-user tool only. It does not replace or
enhance your backup and archival solutions and should in no
way be considered as such. Additionally, if you need version
control, implement a version control system.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.2.7 of
the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
