<p>NAME guile - a Scheme interpreter</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS guile [-q] [-ds] [--help] [--version] [--emacs]
[--debug] [-l FILE] [-e FUNCTION] [] [-c EXPR] [-s SCRIPT]
[--]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION GNU Guile is an interpreter for the Scheme
programming language. It implements R5RS, providing
additional features necessary for real-world use. It is
extremely simple to embed guile into a C program, calling C
from Scheme and Scheme from C. Guiles design makes it very
suitable for use as an &quot;extension&quot; or
&quot;glue&quot; language, but it also works well as a
stand-alone scheme development environment.</p>

<p>The guile executable itself provides a stand-alone
interpreter for scheme programs, for either interactive use
or executing scripts.</p>

<p>This manpage provides only brief instruction in invoking
guile from the command line. Please consult the guile info
documentation (type info guile at a command prompt) for more
information. There is also a tuto- rial (info guile-tut)
available.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -l Load scheme source code from file.</p>

<p>-e After reading script, apply FUNCTION to command-line
arguments</p>

<p>-ds do -s SCRIPT at this point (note that this argument
must be used in conjuction with -s)</p>

<p>--help Describe command line options and exit</p>

<p>--debug Start guile with debugging evaluator and
backtraces enabled (useful for debugging guile scripts)</p>

<p>--version Display guile version and exit.</p>

<p>--emacs Enable emacs protocol for use from within emacs
(experimental)</p>

<p>-- Stop argument processing, start guile in interactive
mode.</p>

<p>-c Stop argument processing, evaluate EXPR as a scheme
expression.</p>

<p>-s Load Scheme source from SCRIPT-FILE and execute as a
script.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT GUILE_LOAD_PATH If $GUILE_LOAD_PATH is set,
its value is used to agument the path to search for scheme
files when loading. It should be a colon separated list of
directories which will be prepended to the default
%load-path.</p>

<p>FILES ~/.guile is a guile script that is executed before
any other processing occurs. For example, the following
.guile activates guiles readline interface:</p>

<p>(use-modules (ice-9 readline)) (activate-readline)</p>

<p>SEE ALSO The full documentation for guile is maintained
as a Texinfo manual. If the info and guile programs are
properly installed at your site, the command</p>

<p>info guile</p>

<p>should give you access to the complete manual.</p>

<p>http://www.schemers.org provides a general introduction
to the Scheme language.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Robert Merkel &lt;rgmerk@mira.net&gt; wrote this
manpage. Rob Browning &lt;rlb@cs.utexas.edu&gt; has added to
it.</p>

<p>guile is GNU software. Guile is originally based on
Aubrey Jaffers SCM interpreter, and is the work of many
individuals.</p>
