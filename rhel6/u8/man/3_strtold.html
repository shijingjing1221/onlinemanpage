<p>STRTOD(3) Linux Programmer s Manual STRTOD(3)</p>

<p>NAME strtod, strtof, strtold - convert ASCII string to
floating-point number</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>double strtod(const char *nptr, char **endptr); float
strtof(const char *nptr, char **endptr); long double
strtold(const char *nptr, char **endptr);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>strtof(), strtold(): _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 ||
_ISOC99_SOURCE; or cc -std=c99</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strtod(), strtof(), and strtold()
functions convert the initial portion of the string pointed
to by nptr to double, float, and long double representation,
respectively.</p>

<p>The expected form of the (initial portion of the) string
is optional leading white space as recognized by isspace(3),
an optional plus (&rsquo;+&rsquo;) or minus sign
(&rsquo;-&rsquo;) and then either (i) a decimal number, or
(ii) a hexadecimal number, or (iii) an infinity, or (iv) a
NAN (not-a-number).</p>

<p>A decimal number consists of a non-empty sequence of
decimal digits possibly containing a radix character
(decimal point, locale-dependent, usually &rsquo;.&rsquo;),
optionally followed by a decimal exponent. A decimal
exponent consists of an &rsquo;E&rsquo; or &rsquo;e&rsquo;,
followed by an optional plus or minus sign, followed by a
non-empty sequence of decimal digits, and indicates
multiplication by a power of 10.</p>

<p>A hexadecimal number consists of a &quot;0x&quot; or
&quot;0X&quot; followed by a non-empty sequence of
hexadecimal digits possibly containing a radix character,
optionally followed by a binary exponent. A binary exponent
consists of a &rsquo;P&rsquo; or &rsquo;p&rsquo;, followed
by an optional plus or minus sign, followed by a non-empty
sequence of decimal digits, and indicates multiplication by
a power of 2. At least one of radix character and binary
exponent must be present.</p>

<p>An infinity is either &quot;INF&quot; or
&quot;INFINITY&quot;, disregarding case.</p>

<p>A NAN is &quot;NAN&quot; (disregarding case) optionally
followed by &rsquo;(&rsquo;, a sequence of characters,
followed by &rsquo;)&rsquo;. The character string speci-
fies in an implementation-dependent way the type of NAN.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE These functions return the converted value,
if any.</p>

<p>If endptr is not NULL, a pointer to the character after
the last char- acter used in the conversion is stored in the
location referenced by endptr.</p>

<p>If no conversion is performed, zero is returned and the
value of nptr is stored in the location referenced by
endptr.</p>

<p>If the correct value would cause overflow, plus or minus
HUGE_VAL (HUGE_VALF, HUGE_VALL) is returned (according to
the sign of the value), and ERANGE is stored in errno. If
the correct value would cause underflow, zero is returned
and ERANGE is stored in errno.</p>

<p>ERRORS ERANGE Overflow or underflow occurred.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C89 describes strtod(), C99 describes the
other two functions.</p>

<p>NOTES Since 0 can legitimately be returned on both
success and failure, the calling program should set errno to
0 before the call, and then deter- mine if an error occurred
by checking whether errno has a non-zero value after the
call.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE See the example on the strtol(3) manual page;
the use of the functions described in this manual page is
similar.</p>
