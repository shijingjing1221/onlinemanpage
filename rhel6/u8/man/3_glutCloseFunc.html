<p>NAME glutCloseFunc - Window destruction callback.</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - windowcallback</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>void glutCloseFunc(void( *callback )( void ));</p>

<p>PARAMETERS callback Client window destruction hook.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When a window is destroyed by user-action in
traditional GLUT, the appli- cation terminates. In freeglut
and OpenGLUT, the application can choose to persist and
treat the window close event as a normal event. This
callback is how that event is transmitted to the
application.</p>

<p>This callback is bound to the current window .</p>

<p>CAVEATS This function is exactly the same as
glutWMCloseFunc(), which has been deprecated. This function
should be used instead.</p>

<p>TODO There needs to be some work to rationalize the
behavior when a window is closed.</p>
