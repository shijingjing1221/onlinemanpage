<p>REPORT_EVENT.CONF(5) LIBREPORT MANUAL
REPORT_EVENT.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME report_event.conf - configuration file for
libreport.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This configuration file specifies which
programs should be run when the specified event occurs in
problem directory lifetime.</p>

<p>It consists of directives and rules.</p>

<p>Directives start with a reserved word. Currently, there
is only one directive, &quot;include&quot;.</p>

<p>include FILE This directive causes files which match
FILE to be read and parsed as if they are inserted textually
where this directive occurs. FILE can use shell pattern
metacharacters (*,?,etc) to specify multiple files. Relative
paths are interpreted relative to current file.</p>

<p>Rule starts with a line with non-space leading
character. All subsequent lines which start with space or
tab form one rule. Note that separating newline is
retained.</p>

<p>Rules may be commented out with #. One # is sufficient
to comment out even a multi-line rule (no need to comment
out every line).</p>

<p>Rules specify which programs to run on the problem
directory. Each rule may have conditions to be checked
before the program is run.</p>

<p>Conditions have form VAR=VAL or VAL~=REGEX, where VAR is
either word &quot;EVENT&quot; or a name of problem directory
element to be checked (for example, &quot;executable&quot;,
&quot;package&quot;, hostname&quot; etc).</p>

<p>If all conditions match, the remaining part of the rule
(the &quot;program&quot; part) is run in the shell. All
shell language constructs are valid. All stdout and stderr
output is captured and passed to ABRT and possibly to ABRTs
frontends and shown to the user.</p>

<p>If the program terminates with nonzero exit code, the
event processing is considered unsuccessful and is stopped.
Last captured output line, if any, is considered to be the
error message indicating the reason of the failure, and may
be used by abrt as such.</p>

<p>If the program terminates successfully, next rule is
read and processed. This process is repeated until the end
of this file.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES EVENT=post-create analyzer=Python
abrt-action-analyze-python</p>

<p>EVENT=post-create getent passwd &quot;cat uid&quot; |
cut -d: -f1 &gt;username</p>
