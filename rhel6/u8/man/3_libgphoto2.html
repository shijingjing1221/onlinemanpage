<p>LIBGPHOTO2(3) The gPhoto2 Reference (the man
LIBGPHOTO2(3)</p>

<p>NAME libgphoto2 - cross-platform digital camera
library</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gphoto2/gphoto2.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gphoto2 library provides applications
with access to a variety of cameras.</p>

<p>This man page will be extended with autogenerated
documentation of the interface types and methods used for
communication between the gphoto2 library and a
frontend.</p>

<p>FILES ~/.gphoto/settings Here gphoto2 applications may
store their configuration used to access gphoto2.</p>

<p>To track down errors, you can add the --debug parameter
to the gphoto2 command line and, if dealing with USB
problems, setting the environment variable USB_DEBUG=1.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CAMLIBS If set, defines the
directory where the libgphoto2 library looks for its camera
drivers (camlibs). You only need to set this on OS/2 systems
and broken/test installations.</p>

<p>IOLIBS If set, defines the directory where the
libgphoto2_port library looks for its I/O drivers (iolibs).
You only need to set this on OS/2 systems and broken/test
installations.</p>

<p>LD_DEBUG Set this to all to receive lots of debug
information regarding library loading on ld based
systems.</p>

<p>USB_DEBUG If set, defines the numeric debug level with
which the libusb library will print messages. In order to
get some debug output, set it to 1.</p>
