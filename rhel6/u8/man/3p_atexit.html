<p>ATEXIT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ATEXIT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME atexit - register a function to run at process
termination</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int atexit(void (*func)(void));</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The atexit() function shall register the
function pointed to by func, to be called without arguments
at normal program termination. At normal program
termination, all functions registered by the atexit()
function shall be called, in the reverse order of their
registration, except that a function is called after any
previously registered functions that had already been called
at the time it was registered. Normal ter- mination occurs
either by a call to exit() or a return from main().</p>

<p>At least 32 functions can be registered with
atexit().</p>

<p>After a successful call to any of the exec functions,
any functions previously registered by atexit() shall no
longer be registered.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, atexit() shall
return 0; otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The functions registered by a call to
atexit() must return to ensure that all registered functions
are called.</p>

<p>The application should call sysconf() to obtain the
value of {ATEXIT_MAX}, the number of functions that can be
registered. There is no way for an application to tell how
many functions have already been registered with
atexit().</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
