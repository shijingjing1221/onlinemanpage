<p>sane-nec(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy sane-nec(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-nec - SANE backend for NEC scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-nec library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) back- end that provides access to
NEC SCSI scanners. This backend should be considered
alpha-quality software! In the current state it is known to
work with PC-IN500/4C scanners. Another MultiReader scanner
series is not supported. PC-IN 500/4C and MultiReader
scanner are only sold in Japan.(except Multi Reader
PetiScan.)</p>

<p>For other scanners, it may or may not work.</p>

<p>The backend has the following known problems: -
ColorLineart mode is not supported. - device name is fixed
to /dev/scanner</p>

<p>At present, the following scanners are known to work
with this backend. Vendor Product id ------ ----------- NEC
PC-IN500/4C</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/nec.conf The backend configuration
file.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-nec.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-nec.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_NEC If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of
128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>
