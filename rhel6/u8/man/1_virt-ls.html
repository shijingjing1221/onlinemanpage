<p>virt-ls(1) Virtualization Support virt-ls(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-ls - List files in a virtual machine</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-ls [--options] -d domname directory
[directory ...]</p>

<p>virt-ls [--options] -a disk.img [-a disk.img ...]
directory [directory ...]</p>

<p>Old style:</p>

<p>virt-ls [--options] domname directory</p>

<p>virt-ls [--options] disk.img [disk.img ...]
directory</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;virt-ls&quot; lists filenames, file
sizes, checksums, extended attributes and more from a
virtual machine or disk image.</p>

<p>Multiple directory names can be given, in which case the
output from each is concatenated.</p>

<p>To list directories from a libvirt guest use the -d
option to specify the name of the guest. For a disk image,
use the -a option.</p>

<p>&quot;virt-ls&quot; can do many simple file listings.
For more complicated cases you may need to use guestfish(1),
or write a program directly to the guestfs(3) API.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Get a list of all files and directories in a
virtual machine:</p>

<p>virt-ls -R -d guest /</p>

<p>List all setuid or setgid programs in a Linux virtual
machine:</p>

<p>virt-ls -lR -d guest / | grep &rsquo;^- [42]&rsquo;</p>

<p>List all public-writable directories in a Linux virtual
machine:</p>

<p>virt-ls -lR -d guest / | grep &rsquo;^d ...7&rsquo;</p>

<p>List all Unix domain sockets in a Linux virtual
machine:</p>

<p>virt-ls -lR -d guest / | grep &rsquo;^s&rsquo;</p>

<p>List all regular files with filenames ending in
.png:</p>

<p>virt-ls -lR -d guest / | grep -i
&rsquo;^-.*.png$&rsquo;</p>

<p>To display files larger than 10MB in home
directories:</p>

<p>virt-ls -lR -d guest /home | awk &rsquo;$3 &gt;
10*1024*1024&rsquo;</p>

<p>Find everything modified in the last 7 days:</p>

<p>virt-ls -lR -d guest --time-days / | awk &rsquo;$6 &lt;=
7&rsquo;</p>

<p>Find regular files modified in the last 24 hours:</p>

<p>virt-ls -lR -d guest --time-days / | grep
&rsquo;^-&rsquo; | awk &rsquo;$6 &lt; 1&rsquo;</p>

<p>DIFFERENCES IN SNAPSHOTS AND BACKING FILES Find the
differences between files in a guest and an earlier snapshot
of the same guest.</p>

<p>virt-ls -lR -a snapshot.img / --uids --time-t &gt; old
virt-ls -lR -a current.img / --uids --time-t &gt; new diff
-u old new | less</p>

<p>The commands above wont find files where the content has
changed but the metadata (eg. file size and modification
date) is the same. To do that, you need to add the
--checksum parameter to both &quot;virt-ls&quot; commands.
--checksum can be quite slow since it has to read and
compute a checksum of every regular file in the virtual
machine.</p>

<p>OUTPUT MODES &quot;virt-ls&quot; has four output modes,
controlled by different combinations of the -l and -R
options.</p>

<p>SIMPLE LISTING A simple listing is like the ordinary
ls(1) command:</p>

<p>$ virt-ls -d guest / bin boot [etc.]</p>

<p>LONG LISTING With the -l (--long) option, the output is
like the &quot;ls -l&quot; command (more specifically, like
the &quot;guestfs_ll&quot; function).</p>

<p>$ virt-ls -l -d guest / total 204 dr-xr-xr-x. 2 root
root 4096 2009-08-25 19:06 bin dr-xr-xr-x. 5 root root 3072
2009-08-25 19:06 boot [etc.]</p>

<p>Note that while this is useful for displaying a
directory, do not try parsing this output in another
program. Use &quot;RECURSIVE LONG LISTING&quot; instead.</p>

<p>RECURSIVE LISTING With the -R (--recursive) option,
&quot;virt-ls&quot; lists the names of files and directories
recursively:</p>

<p>$ virt-ls -R -d guest /tmp foo foo/bar [etc.]</p>

<p>To generate this output, &quot;virt-ls&quot; runs the
&quot;guestfs_find0&quot; function and converts &quot;
&quot; characters to &quot;0.</p>

<p>RECURSIVE LONG LISTING Using -lR options together
changes the output to display directories recursively, with
file stats, and optionally other features such as checksums
and extended attributes.</p>

<p>Most of the interesting features of &quot;virt-ls&quot;
are only available when using -lR mode.</p>

<p>The fields are normally space-separated. Filenames are
not quoted, so you cannot use the output in another program
(because filenames can contain spaces and other unsafe
characters). If the guest was untrusted and someone knew you
were using &quot;virt-ls&quot; to analyze the guest, they
could play tricks on you by creating filenames with embedded
newline characters. To safely parse the output in another
program, use the --csv (Comma-Separated Values) option.</p>

<p>Note that this output format is completely unrelated to
the &quot;ls -lR&quot; command.</p>

<p>$ virt-ls -lR -d guest /bin d 0555 4096 /bin - 0755 123
/bin/alsaunmute - 0755 28328 /bin/arch l 0777 4 /bin/awk
-&gt; gawk - 0755 27216 /bin/basename - 0755 943360
/bin/bash [etc.]</p>

<p>These basic fields are always shown:</p>

<p>type The file type, one of: &quot;-&quot; (regular
file), &quot;d&quot; (directory), &quot;c&quot; (character
device), &quot;b&quot; (block device), &quot;p&quot; (named
pipe), &quot;l&quot; (symbolic link), &quot;s&quot; (socket)
or &quot;u&quot; (unknown).</p>

<p>permissions The Unix permissions, displayed as a 4 digit
octal number.</p>

<p>size The size of the file. This is shown in bytes unless
-h or --human-readable option is given, in which case this
is shown as a human-readable number.</p>

<p>path The full path of the file or directory.</p>

<p>link For symbolic links only, the link target.</p>

<p>In -lR mode, additional command line options enable the
display of more fields.</p>

<p>With the --uids flag, these additional fields are
displayed before the path:</p>

<p>uid gid The UID and GID of the owner of the file
(displayed numerically). Note these only make sense in the
context of a Unix-like guest.</p>

<p>With the --times flag, these additional fields are
displayed:</p>

<p>atime The time of last access.</p>

<p>mtime The time of last modification.</p>

<p>ctime The time of last status change.</p>

<p>The time fields are displayed as string dates and times,
unless one of the --time-t, --time-relative or --time-days
flags is given.</p>

<p>With the --extra-stats flag, these additional fields are
displayed:</p>

<p>device The device containing the file (displayed as
major:minor). This may not match devices as known to the
guest.</p>

<p>inode The inode number.</p>

<p>nlink The number of hard links.</p>

<p>rdev For block and char special files, the device
(displayed as major:minor).</p>

<p>blocks The number of 512 byte blocks allocated to the
file.</p>

<p>With the --checksum flag, the checksum of the file
contents is shown (only for regular files). Computing file
checksums can take a considerable amount of time.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display brief help.</p>

<p>-a file --add file Add file which should be a disk image
from a virtual machine. If the virtual machine has multiple
block devices, you must supply all of them with separate -a
options.</p>

<p>The format of the disk image is auto-detected. To
override this and force a particular format use the
--format=.. option.</p>

<p>--checksum
--checksum=crc|md5|sha1|sha224|sha256|sha384|sha512 Display
checksum over file contents for regular files. With no
argument, this defaults to using md5. Using an argument, you
can select the checksum type to use.</p>

<p>This option only has effect in -lR output mode. See
&quot;RECURSIVE LONG LISTING&quot; above.</p>

<p>-c URI --connect URI If using libvirt, connect to the
given URI. If omitted, then we connect to the default
libvirt hypervisor.</p>

<p>If you specify guest block devices directly (-a), then
libvirt is not used at all.</p>

<p>--csv Write out the results in CSV format
(comma-separated values). This format can be imported easily
into databases and spreadsheets, but read &quot;NOTE ABOUT
CSV FORMAT&quot; below.</p>

<p>-d guest --domain guest Add all the disks from the named
libvirt guest. Domain UUIDs can be used instead of
names.</p>

<p>--echo-keys When prompting for keys and passphrases,
virt-ls normally turns echoing off so you cannot see what
you are typing. If you are not worried about Tempest attacks
and there is no one else in the room you can specify this
flag to see what you are typing.</p>

<p>--extra-stats Display extra stats.</p>

<p>This option only has effect in -lR output mode. See
&quot;RECURSIVE LONG LISTING&quot; above.</p>

<p>--format=raw|qcow2|.. --format The default for the -a
option is to auto-detect the format of the disk image. Using
this forces the disk format for -a options which follow on
the command line. Using --format with no argument switches
back to auto-detection for subsequent -a options.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>virt-ls --format=raw -a disk.img /dir</p>

<p>forces raw format (no auto-detection) for
&quot;disk.img&quot;.</p>

<p>virt-ls --format=raw -a disk.img --format -a another.img
/dir</p>

<p>forces raw format (no auto-detection) for
&quot;disk.img&quot; and reverts to auto-detection for
&quot;another.img&quot;.</p>

<p>If you have untrusted raw-format guest disk images, you
should use this option to specify the disk format. This
avoids a possible security problem with malicious guests
(CVE-2010-3851).</p>

<p>-h --human-readable Display file sizes in human-readable
format.</p>

<p>This option only has effect in -lR output mode. See
&quot;RECURSIVE LONG LISTING&quot; above.</p>

<p>--keys-from-stdin Read key or passphrase parameters from
stdin. The default is to try to read passphrases from the
user by opening &quot;/dev/tty&quot;.</p>

<p>-l --long -R --recursive Select the mode. With neither
of these options, &quot;virt-ls&quot; produces a simple,
flat list of the files in the named directory. See
&quot;SIMPLE LISTING&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;virt-ls -l&quot; produces a &quot;long
listing&quot;, which shows more detail. See &quot;LONG
LISTING&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;virt-ls -R&quot; produces a recursive list of
files starting at the named directory. See &quot;RECURSIVE
LISTING&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;virt-ls -lR&quot; produces a recursive long
listing which can be more easily parsed. See &quot;RECURSIVE
LONG LISTING&quot;.</p>

<p>--times Display time fields.</p>

<p>This option only has effect in -lR output mode. See
&quot;RECURSIVE LONG LISTING&quot; above.</p>

<p>--time-days Display time fields as days before now
(negative if in the future).</p>

<p>Note that 0 in output means &quot;up to 1 day before
now&quot;, or that the age of the file is between 0 and
86399 seconds.</p>

<p>This option only has effect in -lR output mode. See
&quot;RECURSIVE LONG LISTING&quot; above.</p>

<p>--time-relative Display time fields as seconds before
now (negative if in the future).</p>

<p>This option only has effect in -lR output mode. See
&quot;RECURSIVE LONG LISTING&quot; above.</p>

<p>--time-t Display time fields as seconds since the Unix
epoch.</p>

<p>This option only has effect in -lR output mode. See
&quot;RECURSIVE LONG LISTING&quot; above.</p>

<p>--uids Display UID and GID fields.</p>

<p>This option only has effect in -lR output mode. See
&quot;RECURSIVE LONG LISTING&quot; above.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Enable verbose messages for debugging.</p>

<p>-V --version Display version number and exit.</p>

<p>-x Enable tracing of libguestfs API calls.</p>

<p>OLD-STYLE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS Previous versions of
virt-ls allowed you to write either:</p>

<p>virt-ls disk.img [disk.img ...] /dir</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>virt-ls guestname /dir</p>

<p>whereas in this version you should use -a or -d
respectively to avoid the confusing case where a disk image
might have the same name as a guest.</p>

<p>For compatibility the old style is still supported.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT CSV FORMAT Comma-separated values (CSV) is a
deceptive format. It seems like it should be easy to parse,
but it is definitely not easy to parse.</p>

<p>Myth: Just split fields at commas. Reality: This does
not work reliably. This example has two columns:</p>

<p>&quot;foo,bar&quot;,baz</p>

<p>Myth: Read the file one line at a time. Reality: This
does not work reliably. This example has one row:</p>

<p>&quot;foo bar&quot;,baz</p>

<p>For shell scripts, use &quot;csvtool&quot;
(http://merjis.com/developers/csv also packaged in major
Linux distributions).</p>

<p>For other languages, use a CSV processing library (eg.
&quot;Text::CSV&quot; for Perl or Pythons built-in csv
library).</p>

<p>Most spreadsheets and databases can import CSV
directly.</p>

<p>SHELL QUOTING Libvirt guest names can contain arbitrary
characters, some of which have meaning to the shell such as
&quot;#&quot; and space. You may need to quote or escape
these characters on the command line. See the shell manual
page sh(1) for details.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS This program returns 0 if successful, or
non-zero if there was an error.</p>
