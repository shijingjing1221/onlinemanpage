<p>NAME mkfs.gfs2 - Make a GFS2 filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mkfs.gfs2 [OPTION]... DEVICE [ block-count
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mkfs.gfs2 is used to create a Global File
System.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b BlockSize Set the filesystem block size to
BlockSize (must be a power of two). The minimum block size
is 512. The FS block size cannot exceed the machines memory
page size. On the most architec- tures (i386, x86_64, s390,
s390x), the memory page size is 4096 bytes. On other
architectures it may be bigger. The default block size is
4096 bytes. In general, GFS2 filesystems should not deviate
from the default value.</p>

<p>-c MegaBytes Initial size of each journals quota change
file</p>

<p>-D Enable debugging output.</p>

<p>-h Print out a help message describing available
options, then exit.</p>

<p>-J MegaBytes The size of the journals in Megabytes. The
default journal size is 128 megabytes. The minimum size is 8
megabytes.</p>

<p>-j Number The number of journals for gfs2_mkfs to
create. You need at least one journal per machine that will
mount the filesystem. If this option is not specified, one
journal will be created.</p>

<p>-K Keep, do not attempt to discard blocks at mkfs time
(discarding blocks initially is useful on solid state
devices and sparse / thin-provisioned storage).</p>

<p>-O This option prevents gfs2_mkfs from asking for
confirmation before writing the filesystem.</p>

<p>-p LockProtoName LockProtoName is the name of the
locking protocol to use. Acceptable locking protocols are
lock_dlm (for shared storage) or if you are using GFS2 as a
local filesystem (1 node only), you can specify the
lock_nolock protocol. If this option is not specified,
lock_dlm protocol will be assumed.</p>

<p>-q Be quiet. Dont print anything.</p>

<p>-r MegaBytes gfs2_mkfs will try to make Resource Groups
about this big. Min- imum RG size is 32 MB. Maximum RG size
is 2048 MB. A large RG size may increase performance on very
large file systems. If not specified, mkfs.gfs2 will choose
the RG size based on the size of the file system: average
size file systems will have 256 MB RGs, and bigger file
systems will have bigger RGs for better performance.</p>

<p>-t LockTableName The lock table field appropriate to the
lock module youre using. It is clustername:fsname.
Clustername must match that in cluster.conf; only members of
this cluster are permitted to use this file system. Fsname
is a unique file system name used to distinguish this GFS2
file system from others created (1 to 16 characters).
Lock_nolock doesnt use this field. Valid clus- ternames and
fsnames may only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens
(-) and underscores (_).</p>

<p>-u MegaBytes Initial size of each journals unlinked tag
file</p>

<p>-V Print program version information, then exit.</p>

<p>[ block-count ] Make the file system this many blocks in
size. If not speci- fied, the entire length of the specified
device is used.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE gfs2_mkfs -t mycluster:mygfs2 -p lock_dlm -j 2
/dev/vg0/mygfs2 This will make a Global File System on the
block device &quot;/dev/vg0/mygfs2&quot;. It will belong to
&quot;mycluster&quot; and register itself as wanting locking
for &quot;mygfs2&quot;. It will use DLM for locking and make
two journals.</p>

<p>gfs2_mkfs -t mycluster:mygfs2 -p lock_nolock -j 3
/dev/vg0/mygfs2 This will make a Global File System on the
block device &quot;/dev/vg0/mygfs2&quot;. It will belong to
&quot;mycluster&quot; and but have no cluster locking. It
will have three journals.</p>
