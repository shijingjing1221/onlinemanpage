describes color corresponding to background (flat areas).
Illumi- nated edges will be brighter than this and shadowed
edges will be darker than this.</p>

<p>char *colorName (in) Same as objPtr except value is
supplied as a string rather than an object.</p>

<p>Drawable drawable (in) X token for window or pixmap;
indicates where graphics are to be drawn. Must either be the
X window for tkwin or a pixmap with the same screen and
depth as tkwin.</p>

bevel, in pixels.</p>

<p>int height (in) Height of rectangle describing border or
bevel, in pixels.</p>

<p>int borderWidth (in) Width of border in pixels. Posi-
tive means border is inside rect- angle given by x, y,
width, height, negative means border is outside
rectangle.</p>

<p>int relief (in) Indicates 3-D position of inte- rior of
object relative to exte- rior; should be TK_RELIEF_RAISED,
TK_RELIEF_SUNKEN, TK_RELIEF_GROOVE, TK_RELIEF_SOLID, or

positive, border is drawn to left of trajectory given by
pointPtr; if negative, border is drawn to right of
trajectory. If leftRe- lief is TK_RELIEF_GROOVE or
TK_RELIEF_RIDGE then the border is centered on the
trajectory.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures provide facilities for
drawing window borders in a way that produces a
three-dimensional appearance. Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj
allocates colors and Pixmaps needed to draw a border in the
window given by the tkwin argument. The value of objPtr is a
standard Tk color name that determines the border colors.
The color indicated by objPtr will not actually be used in
the border; it indicates the back- ground color for the
window (i.e. a color for flat surfaces). The illuminated
portions of the border will appear brighter than indicated
by objPtr, and the shadowed portions of the border will
appear darker than objPtr.</p>

<p>Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj returns a token that may be used
in later calls to Tk_Draw3DRectangle. If an error occurs in
allocating information for the border (e.g. a bogus color
name was given) then NULL is returned and an error message
is left in interp-&gt;result. If it returns successfully,
Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj caches information about the return
value in objPtr, which speeds up future calls to
Tk_Alloc3DBor- derFromObj with the same objPtr and
tkwin.</p>

<p>Tk_Get3DBorder is identical to Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj
except that the color is specified with a string instead of
an object. This prevents Tk_Get3DBorder from caching the
return value, so Tk_Get3DBorder is less efficient than
Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj.</p>

<p>Tk_Get3DBorderFromObj returns the token for an existing
border, given the window and color name used to create the
border. Tk_Get3DBorder- FromObj does not actually create the
border; it must already have been created with a previous
call to Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj or Tk_Get3DBor- der. The
return value is cached in objPtr, which speeds up future
calls to Tk_Get3DBorderFromObj with the same objPtr and
tkwin.</p>

<p>Once a border structure has been created,
Tk_Draw3DRectangle may be invoked to draw the border. The
tkwin argument specifies the window for which the border was
allocated, and drawable specifies a window or pixmap in
which the border is to be drawn. Drawable need not refer to
the same window as tkwin, but it must refer to a compatible
pixmap or window: one associated with the same screen and
with the same depth as tkwin. The x, y, width, and height
arguments define the bounding box of the border region
within drawable (usually x and y are zero and width and
height are the dimensions of the window), and borderWidth
specifies the number of pixels actually occupied by the
border. The relief argument indicates which of several
three-dimensional effects is desired: TK_RELIEF_RAISED means
that the interior of the rectangle should appear raised
relative to the exterior of the rectangle, and
TK_RELIEF_SUNKEN means that the interior should appear
depressed. TK_RELIEF_GROOVE and TK_RELIEF_RIDGE mean that
there should appear to be a groove or ridge around the
exterior of the rectangle.</p>

<p>Tk_Fill3DRectangle is somewhat like Tk_Draw3DRectangle
except that it first fills the rectangular area with the
background color (one corre- sponding to the color used to
create border). Then it calls Tk_Draw3DRectangle to draw a
border just inside the outer edge of the rectangular area.
The argument relief indicates the desired effect
(TK_RELIEF_FLAT means no border should be drawn; all that
happens is to fill the rectangle with the background
color).</p>

<p>The procedure Tk_Draw3DPolygon may be used to draw more
complex shapes with a three-dimensional appearance. The
pointPtr and numPoints argu- ments define a trajectory,
polyBorderWidth indicates how wide the bor- der should be
(and on which side of the trajectory to draw it), and
leftRelief indicates which side of the trajectory should
appear raised. Tk_Draw3DPolygon draws a border around the
given trajectory using the colors from border to produce a
three-dimensional appearance. If the trajectory is
non-self-intersecting, the appearance will be a raised or
sunken polygon shape. The trajectory may be
self-intersecting, although its not clear how useful this
is.</p>

<p>Tk_Fill3DPolygon is to Tk_Draw3DPolygon what
Tk_Fill3DRectangle is to Tk_Draw3DRectangle: it fills the
polygonal area with the background color from border, then
calls Tk_Draw3DPolygon to draw a border around the area
(unless leftRelief is TK_RELIEF_FLAT; in this case no border
is drawn).</p>

<p>The procedures Tk_3DVerticalBevel and
Tk_3DHorizontalBevel provide lower-level drawing primitives
that are used by procedures such as Tk_Draw3DRectangle.
These procedures are also useful in their own right for
drawing rectilinear border shapes. Tk_3DVerticalBevel draws
a vertical beveled edge, such as the left or right side of a
rectangle, and Tk_3DHorizontalBevel draws a horizontal
beveled edge, such as the top or bottom of a rectangle. Each
procedure takes x, y, width, and height arguments that
describe the rectangular area of the beveled edge (e.g.,
width is the border width for Tk_3DVerticalBevel). The
leftBor- der and topBorder arguments indicate the position
of the border rela- tive to the inside of the object, and
relief indicates the relief of the inside of the object
relative to the outside. Tk_3DVerticalBevel just draws a
rectangular region. Tk_3DHorizontalBevel draws a trape-
zoidal region to generate mitered corners; it should be
called after Tk_3DVerticalBevel (otherwise
Tk_3DVerticalBevel will overwrite the mitering in the
corner). The leftIn and rightIn arguments to Tk_3DHor-
izontalBevel describe the mitering at the corners; a value
of 1 means that the bottom edge of the trapezoid will be
shorter than the top, 0 means it will be longer. For
example, to draw a rectangular border the top bevel should
be drawn with 1 for both leftIn and rightIn, and the bottom
bevel should be drawn with 0 for both arguments.</p>

<p>The procedure Tk_SetBackgroundFromBorder will modify the
background pixel and/or pixmap of tkwin to produce a result
compatible with bor- der. For color displays, the resulting
background will just be the color specified when border was
created; for monochrome displays, the resulting background
will be a light stipple pattern, in order to dis- tinguish
the background from the illuminated portion of the
border.</p>

<p>Given a token for a border, the procedure
Tk_NameOf3DBorder will return the color name that was used
to create the border.</p>

<p>The procedure Tk_3DBorderColor returns the XColor
structure that will be used for flat surfaces drawn for its
border argument by procedures like Tk_Fill3DRectangle. The
return value corresponds to the color name that was used to
create the border. The XColor, and its associ- ated pixel
value, will remain allocated as long as border exists.</p>

<p>The procedure Tk_3DBorderGC returns one of the X
graphics contexts that are used to draw the border. The
argument which selects which one of the three possible GC s:
TK_3D_FLAT_GC returns the context used for flat surfaces,
TK_3D_LIGHT_GC returns the context for light shadows, and
TK_3D_DARK_GC returns the context for dark shadows.</p>

<p>When a border is no longer needed,
Tk_Free3DBorderFromObj or Tk_Free3DBorder should be called
to release the resources associated with it. For
Tk_Free3DBorderFromObj the border to release is specified
with the window and color name used to create the border;
for Tk_Free3DBorder the border to release is specified with
the Tk_3DBorder token for the border. There should be
exactly one call to Tk_Free3DBorderFromObj or
Tk_Free3DBorder for each call to Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj or
Tk_Get3DBorder.</p>
