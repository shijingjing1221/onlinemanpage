<p>NAME xsubpp - compiler to convert Perl XS code into C
code</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xsubpp [-v] [-except] [-s pattern]
[-prototypes] [-noversioncheck] [-nolinenumbers]
[-nooptimize] [-typemap typemap] [-output filename]...
file.xs</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This compiler is typically run by the
makefiles created by ExtUtils::MakeMaker.</p>

<p>xsubpp will compile XS code into C code by embedding the
constructs necessary to let C functions manipulate Perl
values and creates the glue necessary to let Perl access
those functions. The compiler uses typemaps to determine how
to map C function parameters and variables to Perl
values.</p>

<p>The compiler will search for typemap files called
typemap. It will use the following search path to find
default typemaps, with the rightmost typemap taking
precedence.</p>

<p>../../../typemap:../../typemap:../typemap:typemap</p>

<p>It will also use a default typemap installed as
&quot;ExtUtils::typemap&quot;.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Note that the &quot;XSOPT&quot; MakeMaker option
may be used to add these options to any makefiles generated
by MakeMaker.</p>

<p>-hiertype Retains :: in type names so that C++
hierarchical types can be mapped.</p>

<p>-except Adds exception handling stubs to the C code.</p>

<p>-typemap typemap Indicates that a user-supplied typemap
should take precedence over the default typemaps. This
option may be used multiple times, with the last typemap
having the highest precedence.</p>

<p>-output filename Specifies the name of the output file
to generate. If no file is specified, output will be written
to standard output.</p>

<p>-v Prints the xsubpp version number to standard output,
then exits.</p>

<p>-prototypes By default xsubpp will not automatically
generate prototype code for all xsubs. This flag will enable
prototypes.</p>

<p>-noversioncheck Disables the run time test that
determines if the object file (derived from the
&quot;.xs&quot; file) and the &quot;.pm&quot; files have the
same version number.</p>

<p>-nolinenumbers Prevents the inclusion of #line
directives in the output.</p>

<p>-nooptimize Disables certain optimizations. The only
optimization that is currently affected is the use of
targets by the output C code (see perlguts). This may
significantly slow down the generated code, but this is the
way xsubpp of 5.005 and earlier operated.</p>

<p>-noinout Disable recognition of &quot;IN&quot;,
&quot;OUT_LIST&quot; and &quot;INOUT_LIST&quot;
declarations.</p>

<p>-noargtypes Disable recognition of ANSI-like
descriptions of function signature.</p>

<p>-C++ Currently doesnt do anything at all. This flag has
been a no-op for many versions of perl, at least as far back
as perl5.003_07. Its allowed here for backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT No environment variables are used.</p>
