<p>winfo(n) Tk Built-In Commands winfo(n)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME winfo - Return window-related information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS winfo option ?arg arg ...?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The winfo command is used to retrieve
information about windows managed by Tk. It can take any of
a number of different forms, depending on the option
argument. The legal forms are:</p>

<p>winfo atom ?-displayof window? name Returns a decimal
string giving the integer identifier for the atom whose name
is name. If no atom exists with the name name then a new one
is created. If the -displayof option is given then the atom
is looked up on the display of window; otherwise it is
looked up on the display of the applications main
window.</p>

<p>winfo atomname ?-displayof window? id Returns the
textual name for the atom whose integer identifier is id. If
the -displayof option is given then the identifier is looked
up on the display of window; otherwise it is looked up on
the display of the applications main window. This command is
the inverse of the winfo atom command. It generates an error
if no such atom exists.</p>

<p>winfo cells window Returns a decimal string giving the
number of cells in the color map for window.</p>

<p>winfo children window Returns a list containing the path
names of all the children of window. Top-level windows are
returned as children of their log- ical parents. The list is
in stacking order, with the lowest window first, except for
Top-level windows which are not returned in stacking order.
Use the wm stackorder command to query the stacking order of
Top-level windows.</p>

<p>winfo class window Returns the class name for
window.</p>

<p>winfo colormapfull window Returns 1 if the colormap for
window is known to be full, 0 oth- erwise. The colormap for
a window is known to be full if the last attempt to allocate
a new color on that window failed and this application has
not freed any colors in the colormap since the failed
allocation.</p>

<p>winfo containing ?-displayof window? rootX rootY Returns
the path name for the window containing the point given by
rootX and rootY. RootX and rootY are specified in screen
units (i.e. any form acceptable to Tk_GetPixels) in the
coordi- nate system of the root window (if a virtual-root
window manager is in use then the coordinate system of the
virtual root window is used). If the -displayof option is
given then the coordi- nates refer to the screen containing
window; otherwise they refer to the screen of the
application s main window. If no window in this application
contains the point then an empty string is returned. In
selecting the containing window, chil- dren are given higher
priority than parents and among siblings the highest one in
the stacking order is chosen.</p>

<p>winfo depth window Returns a decimal string giving the
depth of window (number of bits per pixel).</p>

<p>winfo exists window Returns 1 if there exists a window
named window, 0 if no such window exists.</p>

<p>winfo fpixels window number Returns a floating-point
value giving the number of pixels in window corresponding to
the distance given by number. Number may be specified in any
of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetScreenMM, such as 2.0c or
1i. The return value may be fractional; for an integer
value, use winfo pixels.</p>

<p>winfo geometry window Returns the geometry for window,
in the form widthxheight+x+y. All dimensions are in
pixels.</p>

<p>winfo height window Returns a decimal string giving
windows height in pixels. When a window is first created its
height will be 1 pixel; the height will eventually be
changed by a geometry manager to ful- fill the window s
needs. If you need the true height immedi- ately after
creating a widget, invoke update to force the geome- try
manager to arrange it, or use winfo reqheight to get the
windows requested height instead of its actual height.</p>

<p>winfo id window Returns a hexadecimal string giving a
low-level platform-spe- cific identifier for window. On Unix
platforms, this is the X window identifier. Under Windows,
this is the Windows HWND. On the Macintosh the value has no
meaning outside Tk.</p>

<p>winfo interps ?-displayof window? Returns a list whose
members are the names of all Tcl inter- preters (e.g. all
Tk-based applications) currently registered for a particular
display. If the -displayof option is given then the return
value refers to the display of window; other- wise it refers
to the display of the applications main window.</p>

<p>winfo ismapped window Returns 1 if window is currently
mapped, 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>winfo manager window Returns the name of the geometry
manager currently responsible for window, or an empty string
if window is not managed by any geometry manager. The name
is usually the name of the Tcl com- mand for the geometry
manager, such as pack or place. If the geometry manager is a
widget, such as canvases or text, the name is the widgets
class command, such as canvas.</p>

<p>winfo name window Returns windows name (i.e. its name
within its parent, as opposed to its full path name). The
command winfo name . will return the name of the
application.</p>

<p>winfo parent window Returns the path name of window s
parent, or an empty string if window is the main window of
the application.</p>

<p>winfo pathname ?-displayof window? id Returns the path
name of the window whose X identifier is id. Id must be a
decimal, hexadecimal, or octal integer and must correspond
to a window in the invoking application. If the -displayof
option is given then the identifier is looked up on the
display of window; otherwise it is looked up on the display
of the applications main window.</p>

<p>winfo pixels window number Returns the number of pixels
in window corresponding to the dis- tance given by number.
Number may be specified in any of the forms acceptable to
Tk_GetPixels, such as 2.0c or 1i. The result is rounded to
the nearest integer value; for a frac- tional result, use
winfo fpixels.</p>

<p>winfo pointerx window If the mouse pointer is on the
same screen as window, returns the pointers x coordinate,
measured in pixels in the screens root window. If a virtual
root window is in use on the screen, the position is
measured in the virtual root. If the mouse pointer is not on
the same screen as window then -1 is returned.</p>

<p>winfo pointerxy window If the mouse pointer is on the
same screen as window, returns a list with two elements,
which are the pointer s x and y coordi- nates measured in
pixels in the screen s root window. If a vir- tual root
window is in use on the screen, the position is com- puted
in the virtual root. If the mouse pointer is not on the same
screen as window then both of the returned coordinates are
-1.</p>

<p>winfo pointery window If the mouse pointer is on the
same screen as window, returns the pointers y coordinate,
measured in pixels in the screens root window. If a virtual
root window is in use on the screen, the position is
computed in the virtual root. If the mouse pointer is not on
the same screen as window then -1 is returned.</p>

<p>winfo reqheight window Returns a decimal string giving
windows requested height, in pixels. This is the value used
by window s geometry manager to compute its geometry.</p>

<p>winfo reqwidth window Returns a decimal string giving
windows requested width, in pixels. This is the value used
by window s geometry manager to compute its geometry.</p>

<p>winfo rgb window color Returns a list containing three
decimal values in the range 0 to 65535, which are the red,
green, and blue intensities that cor- respond to color in
the window given by window. Color may be specified in any of
the forms acceptable for a color option.</p>

<p>winfo rootx window Returns a decimal string giving the
x-coordinate, in the root window of the screen, of the
upper-left corner of windows bor- der (or window if it has
no border).</p>

<p>winfo rooty window Returns a decimal string giving the
y-coordinate, in the root window of the screen, of the
upper-left corner of windows bor- der (or window if it has
no border).</p>

<p>winfo screen window Returns the name of the screen
associated with window, in the form
displayName.screenIndex.</p>

<p>winfo screencells window Returns a decimal string giving
the number of cells in the default color map for windows
screen.</p>

<p>winfo screendepth window Returns a decimal string giving
the depth of the root window of windows screen (number of
bits per pixel).</p>

<p>winfo screenheight window Returns a decimal string
giving the height of windows screen, in pixels.</p>

<p>winfo screenmmheight window Returns a decimal string
giving the height of windows screen, in millimeters.</p>

<p>winfo screenmmwidth window Returns a decimal string
giving the width of window s screen, in millimeters.</p>

<p>winfo screenvisual window Returns one of the following
strings to indicate the default visual class for window s
screen: directcolor, grayscale, pseu- docolor, staticcolor,
staticgray, or truecolor.</p>

<p>winfo screenwidth window Returns a decimal string giving
the width of window s screen, in pixels.</p>

<p>winfo server window Returns a string containing
information about the server for windows display. The exact
format of this string may vary from platform to platform.
For X servers the string has the form XmajorRminor vendor
vendorVersion where major and minor are the version and
revision numbers provided by the server (e.g., X11R5),
vendor is the name of the vendor for the server, and
vendorRelease is an integer release number provided by the
server.</p>

<p>winfo toplevel window Returns the path name of the
top-of-hierarchy window containing window. In standard Tk
this will always be a toplevel widget, but extensions may
create other kinds of top-of-hierarchy wid- gets.</p>

<p>winfo viewable window Returns 1 if window and all of its
ancestors up through the nearest toplevel window are mapped.
Returns 0 if any of these windows are not mapped.</p>

<p>winfo visual window Returns one of the following strings
to indicate the visual class for window: directcolor,
grayscale, pseudocolor, static- color, staticgray, or
truecolor.</p>

<p>winfo visualid window Returns the X identifier for the
visual for window.</p>

<p>winfo visualsavailable window ?includeids? Returns a
list whose elements describe the visuals available for
window s screen. Each element consists of a visual class
fol- lowed by an integer depth. The class has the same form
as returned by winfo visual. The depth gives the number of
bits per pixel in the visual. In addition, if the includeids
argu- ment is provided, then the depth is followed by the X
identifier for the visual.</p>

<p>winfo vrootheight window Returns the height of the
virtual root window associated with window if there is one;
otherwise returns the height of win- dows screen.</p>

<p>winfo vrootwidth window Returns the width of the virtual
root window associated with window if there is one;
otherwise returns the width of windows screen.</p>

<p>winfo vrootx window Returns the x-offset of the virtual
root window associated with window, relative to the root
window of its screen. This is nor- mally either zero or
negative. Returns 0 if there is no virtual root window for
window.</p>

<p>winfo vrooty window Returns the y-offset of the virtual
root window associated with window, relative to the root
window of its screen. This is nor- mally either zero or
negative. Returns 0 if there is no virtual root window for
window.</p>

<p>winfo width window Returns a decimal string giving
window s width in pixels. When a window is first created its
width will be 1 pixel; the width will eventually be changed
by a geometry manager to fulfill the window s needs. If you
need the true width immediately after creating a widget,
invoke update to force the geometry manager to arrange it,
or use winfo reqwidth to get the windows requested width
instead of its actual width.</p>

<p>winfo x window Returns a decimal string giving the
x-coordinate, in windows parent, of the upper-left corner of
windows border (or window if it has no border).</p>

<p>winfo y window Returns a decimal string giving the
y-coordinate, in windows parent, of the upper-left corner of
windows border (or window if it has no border).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Print where the mouse pointer is and what window
it is currently over: lassign [winfo pointerxy .] x y puts
-nonewline &quot;Mouse pointer at ($x,$y) which is &quot;
set win [winfo containing $x $y] if {$win eq &quot;&quot;} {
puts &quot;over no window&quot; } else { puts &quot;over
$win&quot; }</p>
