<p>PERLLEXWARN(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLLEXWARN(1)</p>

<p>NAME perllexwarn - Perl Lexical Warnings</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &quot;use warnings&quot; pragma enables
to control precisely what warnings are to be enabled in
which parts of a Perl program. Its a more flexible
alternative for both the command line flag -w and the
equivalent Perl variable, $^W.</p>

<p>This pragma works just like the &quot;strict&quot;
pragma. This means that the scope of the warning pragma is
limited to the enclosing block. It also means that the
pragma setting will not leak across files (via
&quot;use&quot;, &quot;require&quot; or &quot;do&quot;).
This allows authors to independently define the degree of
warning checks that will be applied to their module.</p>

<p>By default, optional warnings are disabled, so any
legacy code that doesn t attempt to control the warnings
will work unchanged.</p>

<p>All warnings are enabled in a block by either of
these:</p>

<p>use warnings; use warnings &rsquo;all&rsquo;;</p>

<p>Similarly all warnings are disabled in a block by either
of these:</p>

<p>no warnings; no warnings &rsquo;all&rsquo;;</p>

<p>For example, consider the code below:</p>

<p>use warnings; my @a; { no warnings; my $b = @a[0]; } my
$c = @a[0];</p>

<p>The code in the enclosing block has warnings enabled,
but the inner block has them disabled. In this case that
means the assignment to the scalar $c will trip the
&quot;Scalar value @a[0] better written as $a[0]&quot;
warning, but the assignment to the scalar $b will not.</p>

<p>Default Warnings and Optional Warnings Before the
introduction of lexical warnings, Perl had two classes of
warnings: mandatory and optional.</p>

<p>As its name suggests, if your code tripped a mandatory
warning, you would get a warning whether you wanted it or
not. For example, the code below would always produce an
&quot;isn&rsquo;t numeric&quot; warning about the
&quot;2:&quot;.</p>

<p>my $a = &quot;2:&quot; + 3;</p>

<p>With the introduction of lexical warnings, mandatory
warnings now become default warnings. The difference is that
although the previously mandatory warnings are still enabled
by default, they can then be subsequently enabled or
disabled with the lexical warning pragma. For example, in
the code below, an &quot;isn&rsquo;t numeric&quot; warning
will only be reported for the $a variable.</p>

<p>my $a = &quot;2:&quot; + 3; no warnings; my $b =
&quot;2:&quot; + 3;</p>

<p>Note that neither the -w flag or the $^W can be used to
disable/enable default warnings. They are still mandatory in
this case.</p>

<p>Whas wrong with -w and $^W Although very useful, the big
problem with using -w on the command line to enable warnings
is that it is all or nothing. Take the typical scenario when
you are writing a Perl program. Parts of the code you will
write yourself, but its very likely that you will make use
of pre-written Perl modules. If you use the -w flag in this
case, you end up enabling warnings in pieces of code that
you havent written.</p>

<p>Similarly, using $^W to either disable or enable blocks
of code is fundamentally flawed. For a start, say you want
to disable warnings in a block of code. You might expect
this to be enough to do the trick:</p>

<p>{ local ($^W) = 0; my $a =+ 2; my $b; chop $b; }</p>

<p>When this code is run with the -w flag, a warning will
be produced for the $a line -- &quot;Reversed +=
operator&quot;.</p>

<p>The problem is that Perl has both compile-time and
run-time warnings. To disable compile-time warnings you need
to rewrite the code like this:</p>

<p>{ BEGIN { $^W = 0 } my $a =+ 2; my $b; chop $b; }</p>

<p>The other big problem with $^W is the way you can
inadvertently change the warning setting in unexpected
places in your code. For example, when the code below is run
(without the -w flag), the second call to &quot;doit&quot;
will trip a &quot;Use of uninitialized value&quot; warning,
whereas the first will not.</p>

<p>sub doit { my $b; chop $b; }</p>

<p>doit();</p>

<p>{ local ($^W) = 1; doit() }</p>

<p>This is a side-effect of $^W being dynamically
scoped.</p>

<p>Lexical warnings get around these limitations by
allowing finer control over where warnings can or cant be
tripped.</p>

<p>Controlling Warnings from the Command Line There are
three Command Line flags that can be used to control when
warnings are (or arent) produced:</p>

<p>-w This is the existing flag. If the lexical warnings
pragma is not used in any of you code, or any of the modules
that you use, this flag will enable warnings everywhere. See
&quot;Backward Compatibility&quot; for details of how this
flag interacts with lexical warnings.</p>

<p>-W If the -W flag is used on the command line, it will
enable all warnings throughout the program regardless of
whether warnings were disabled locally using &quot;no
warnings&quot; or &quot;$^W =0&quot;. This includes all
files that get included via &quot;use&quot;,
&quot;require&quot; or &quot;do&quot;. Think of it as the
Perl equivalent of the &quot;lint&quot; command.</p>

<p>-X Does the exact opposite to the -W flag, i.e. it
disables all warnings.</p>

<p>Backward Compatibility If you are used with working with
a version of Perl prior to the introduction of lexically
scoped warnings, or have code that uses both lexical
warnings and $^W, this section will describe how they
interact.</p>

<p>How Lexical Warnings interact with -w/$^W:</p>

<p>1. If none of the three command line flags (-w, -W or
-X) that control warnings is used and neither $^W or the
&quot;warnings&quot; pragma are used, then default warnings
will be enabled and optional warnings disabled. This means
that legacy code that doesnt attempt to control the warnings
will work unchanged.</p>

<p>2. The -w flag just sets the global $^W variable as in
5.005 -- this means that any legacy code that currently
relies on manipulating $^W to control warning behavior will
still work as is.</p>

<p>3. Apart from now being a boolean, the $^W variable
operates in exactly the same horrible uncontrolled global
way, except that it cannot disable/enable default
warnings.</p>

<p>4. If a piece of code is under the control of the
&quot;warnings&quot; pragma, both the $^W variable and the
-w flag will be ignored for the scope of the lexical
warning.</p>

<p>5. The only way to override a lexical warnings setting
is with the -W or -X command line flags.</p>

<p>The combined effect of 3 &amp; 4 is that it will allow
code which uses the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma to control
the warning behavior of $^W-type code (using a &quot;local
$^W=0&quot;) if it really wants to, but not vice-versa.</p>

<p>Category Hierarchy A hierarchy of &quot;categories&quot;
have been defined to allow groups of warnings to be
enabled/disabled in isolation.</p>

<p>The current hierarchy is:</p>

<p>all -+ | +- closure | +- deprecated | +- exiting | +-
glob | +- io -----------+ | | | +- closed | | | +- exec | |
| +- layer | | | +- newline | | | +- pipe | | | +- unopened
| +- misc | +- numeric | +- once | +- overflow | +- pack |
+- portable | +- recursion | +- redefine | +- regexp | +-
severe -------+ | | | +- debugging | | | +- inplace | | | +-
internal | | | +- malloc | +- signal | +- substr | +- syntax
-------+ | | | +- ambiguous | | | +- bareword | | | +- digit
| | | +- parenthesis | | | +- precedence | | | +- printf | |
| +- prototype | | | +- qw | | | +- reserved | | | +-
semicolon | +- taint | +- threads | +- uninitialized | +-
unpack | +- untie | +- utf8 | +- void</p>

<p>Just like the &quot;strict&quot; pragma any of these
categories can be combined</p>

<p>use warnings qw(void redefine); no warnings qw(io syntax
untie);</p>

<p>Also like the &quot;strict&quot; pragma, if there is
more than one instance of the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma in
a given scope the cumulative effect is additive.</p>

<p>use warnings qw(void); # only &quot;void&quot; warnings
enabled ... use warnings qw(io); # only &quot;void&quot;
&amp; &quot;io&quot; warnings enabled ... no warnings
qw(void); # only &quot;io&quot; warnings enabled</p>

<p>To determine which category a specific warning has been
assigned to see perldiag.</p>

<p>Note: In Perl 5.6.1, the lexical warnings category
&quot;deprecated&quot; was a sub-category of the
&quot;syntax&quot; category. It is now a top-level category
in its own right.</p>

<p>Fatal Warnings The presence of the word
&quot;FATAL&quot; in the category list will escalate any
warnings detected from the categories specified in the
lexical scope into fatal errors. In the code below, the use
of &quot;time&quot;, &quot;length&quot; and &quot;join&quot;
can all produce a &quot;Useless use of xxx in void
context&quot; warning.</p>

<p>use warnings;</p>

<p>time;</p>

<p>{ use warnings FATAL =&gt; qw(void); length
&quot;abc&quot;; }</p>

<p>join &quot;&quot;, 1,2,3;</p>

<p>print &quot;done0;</p>

<p>When run it produces this output</p>

<p>Useless use of time in void context at fatal line 3.
Useless use of length in void context at fatal line 7.</p>

<p>The scope where &quot;length&quot; is used has escalated
the &quot;void&quot; warnings category into a fatal error,
so the program terminates immediately it encounters the
warning.</p>

<p>To explicitly turn off a &quot;FATAL&quot; warning you
just disable the warning it is associated with. So, for
example, to disable the &quot;void&quot; warning in the
example above, either of these will do the trick:</p>

<p>no warnings qw(void); no warnings FATAL =&gt;
qw(void);</p>

<p>If you want to downgrade a warning that has been
escalated into a fatal error back to a normal warning, you
can use the &quot;NONFATAL&quot; keyword. For example, the
code below will promote all warnings into fatal errors,
except for those in the &quot;syntax&quot; category.</p>

<p>use warnings FATAL =&gt; &rsquo;all&rsquo;, NONFATAL
=&gt; &rsquo;syntax&rsquo;;</p>

<p>Reporting Warnings from a Module The
&quot;warnings&quot; pragma provides a number of functions
that are useful for module authors. These are used when you
want to report a module- specific warning to a calling
module has enabled warnings via the &quot;warnings&quot;
pragma.</p>

<p>Consider the module &quot;MyMod::Abc&quot; below.</p>

<p>package MyMod::Abc;</p>

<p>use warnings::register;</p>

<p>sub open { my $path = shift; if ($path !~ m#^/#) {
warnings::warn(&quot;changing relative path to
/var/abc&quot;) if warnings::enabled(); $path =
&quot;/var/abc/$path&quot;; } }</p>

<p>1;</p>

<p>The call to &quot;warnings::register&quot; will create a
new warnings category called &quot;MyMod::abc&quot;, i.e.
the new category name matches the current package name. The
&quot;open&quot; function in the module will display a
warning message if it gets given a relative path as a
parameter. This warnings will only be displayed if the code
that uses &quot;MyMod::Abc&quot; has actually enabled them
with the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma like below.</p>

<p>use MyMod::Abc; use warnings &rsquo;MyMod::Abc&rsquo;;
... abc::open(&quot;../fred.txt&quot;);</p>

<p>It is also possible to test whether the pre-defined
warnings categories are set in the calling module with the
&quot;warnings::enabled&quot; function. Consider this
snippet of code:</p>

<p>package MyMod::Abc;</p>

<p>sub open { warnings::warnif(&quot;deprecated&quot;,
&quot;open is deprecated, use new instead&quot;); new(@_);
}</p>

<p>sub new ... 1;</p>

<p>The function &quot;open&quot; has been deprecated, so
code has been included to display a warning message whenever
the calling module has (at least) the &quot;deprecated&quot;
warnings category enabled. Something like this, say.</p>

<p>use warnings &rsquo;deprecated&rsquo;; use MyMod::Abc;
... MyMod::Abc::open($filename);</p>

<p>Either the &quot;warnings::warn&quot; or
&quot;warnings::warnif&quot; function should be used to
actually display the warnings message. This is because they
can make use of the feature that allows warnings to be
escalated into fatal errors. So in this case</p>

<p>use MyMod::Abc; use warnings FATAL =&gt;
&rsquo;MyMod::Abc&rsquo;; ...
MyMod::Abc::open(&rsquo;../fred.txt&rsquo;);</p>

<p>the &quot;warnings::warnif&quot; function will detect
this and die after displaying the warning message.</p>

<p>The three warnings functions,
&quot;warnings::warn&quot;, &quot;warnings::warnif&quot; and
&quot;warnings::enabled&quot; can optionally take an object
reference in place of a category name. In this case the
functions will use the class name of the object as the
warnings category.</p>

<p>Consider this example:</p>

<p>package Original;</p>

<p>no warnings; use warnings::register;</p>

<p>sub new { my $class = shift; bless [], $class; }</p>

<p>sub check { my $self = shift; my $value = shift;</p>

<p>if ($value % 2 &amp;&amp; warnings::enabled($self)) {
warnings::warn($self, &quot;Odd numbers are unsafe&quot;) }
}</p>

<p>sub doit { my $self = shift; my $value = shift;
$self-&gt;check($value); # ... }</p>

<p>1;</p>

<p>package Derived;</p>

<p>use warnings::register; use Original; our @ISA = qw(
Original ); sub new { my $class = shift; bless [], $class;
}</p>

<p>1;</p>

<p>The code below makes use of both modules, but it only
enables warnings from &quot;Derived&quot;.</p>

<p>use Original; use Derived; use warnings
&rsquo;Derived&rsquo;; my $a = Original-&gt;new();
$a-&gt;doit(1); my $b = Derived-&gt;new();
$a-&gt;doit(1);</p>

<p>When this code is run only the &quot;Derived&quot;
object, $b, will generate a warning.</p>

<p>Odd numbers are unsafe at main.pl line 7</p>

<p>Notice also that the warning is reported at the line
where the object is first used.</p>
