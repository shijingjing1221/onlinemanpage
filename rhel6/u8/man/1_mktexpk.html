<p>NAME mktexpk - create a PK file for a font</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mktexpk [options] font [redirect]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Kpathsea: A
library for path searching.</p>

<p>mktexpk is used to generate a pk file from the Metafont
source files or type1 sources for font, if possible.</p>

<p>If redirect is given, it must be string of the form
&gt;&amp;n where n is the number of the file descriptor
which is to receive, instead of standard output, the name of
the generated file.</p>

<p>mktexpk is typically called by other programs, rather
than from the command line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS mktexpk accepts the following options:</p>

<p>--bdpi num Set the base device resolution.</p>

<p>--dpi num Generate the font at resolution num.</p>

<p>--help Print help message and exit.</p>

<p>--mag mag The Metafont magnification that corresponds to
the combination of bdpi and dpi that has been specified.</p>

<p>--mfmode mode The Metafont mode to use.</p>

<p>--destdir dir A directory name. If the directory is
absolute, it is used as- is. Otherwise, it is appended to
the root destination directory set in the script.</p>

<p>--version Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>BUGS If the mode is not specified, mktexpk tries to
determine it from bdpi. The manner in which this is done is
primitive. Since bpdi doesnt pro- vide sufficient
information to uniquely determine a mode it is strongly
recommended that it be specified explicitly.</p>

<p>If the mode and bpdi dont match, the mode is
discarded.</p>

<p>The dpi parameter is redundant, but is not checked for
consistency. Worse, the program will fail if the wrong dpi
is specified.</p>
