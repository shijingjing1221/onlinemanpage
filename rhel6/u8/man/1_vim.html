<p>NAME vim - Vi IMproved, a programmers text editor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vim [options] [file ..] vim [options] - vim
[options] -t tag vim [options] -q [errorfile]</p>

<p>ex gex view gvim gview vimx evim eview rvim rview rgvim
rgview</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Vim is a text editor that is upwards
compatible to Vi. It can be used to edit all kinds of plain
text. It is especially useful for editing programs.</p>

<p>There are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level
undo, multi win- dows and buffers, syntax highlighting,
command line editing, filename completion, on-line help,
visual selection, etc.. See &quot;:help vi_diff.txt&quot;
for a summary of the differences between Vim and Vi.</p>

<p>While running Vim a lot of help can be obtained from the
on-line help system, with the &quot;:help&quot; command. See
the ON-LINE HELP section below.</p>

<p>Most often Vim is started to edit a single file with the
command</p>

<p>vim file</p>

<p>More generally Vim is started with:</p>

<p>vim [options] [filelist]</p>

<p>If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with
an empty buffer. Otherwise exactly one out of the following
four may be used to choose one or more files to be
edited.</p>

<p>file .. A list of filenames. The first one will be the
current file and read into the buffer. The cursor will be
posi- tioned on the first line of the buffer. You can get to
the other files with the &quot;:next&quot; command. To edit
a file that starts with a dash, precede the filelist with
&quot;--&quot;.</p>

<p>- The file to edit is read from stdin. Commands are read
from stderr, which should be a TTY.</p>

<p>-t {tag} The file to edit and the initial cursor
position depends on a &quot;tag&quot;, a sort of goto label.
{tag} is looked up in the tags file, the associated file
becomes the current file and the associated command is
executed. Mostly this is used for C programs, in which case
{tag} could be a function name. The effect is that the file
containing that function becomes the current file and the
cursor is positioned on the start of the function. See
&quot;:help tag-commands&quot;.</p>

<p>-q [errorfile] Start in quickFix mode. The file
[errorfile] is read and the first error is displayed. If
[errorfile] is omitted, the filename is obtained from the
errorfile option (defaults to &quot;AztecC.Err&quot; for the
Amiga, &quot;errors.err&quot; on other systems). Further
errors can be jumped to with the &quot;:cn&quot; command.
See &quot;:help quickfix&quot;.</p>

<p>Vim behaves differently, depending on the name of the
command (the exe- cutable may still be the same file).</p>

<p>vim The &quot;normal&quot; way, everything is
default.</p>

<p>ex Start in Ex mode. Go to Normal mode with the
&quot;:vi&quot; command. Can also be done with the
&quot;-e&quot; argument.</p>

<p>view Start in read-only mode. You will be protected from
writing the files. Can also be done with the &quot;-R&quot;
argument.</p>

<p>gvim gview The GUI version. Starts a new window.</p>

<p>gex Starts a new gvim window in Ex mode. Can also be
done with the &quot;-e&quot; argument to gvim</p>

<p>vimx Starts gvim in &quot;Vi&quot; mode similar to
&quot;vim&quot;, but with addi- tional features like xterm
clipboard support</p>

<p>evim eview The GUI version in easy mode. Starts a new
window. Can also be done with the &quot;-y&quot;
argument.</p>

<p>rvim rview rgvim rgview Like the above, but with
restrictions. It will not be possi- ble to start shell
commands, or suspend Vim. Can also be done with the
&quot;-Z&quot; argument.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options may be given in any order, before or
after filenames. Options without an argument can be combined
after a single dash.</p>

<p>+[num] For the first file the cursor will be positioned
on line &quot;num&quot;. If &quot;num&quot; is missing, the
cursor will be positioned on the last line.</p>

<p>+/{pat} For the first file the cursor will be positioned
on the first occurrence of {pat}. See &quot;:help
search-pattern&quot; for the available search patterns.</p>

<p>+{command}</p>

<p>-c {command} {command} will be executed after the first
file has been read. {command} is interpreted as an Ex
command. If the {command} contains spaces it must be
enclosed in double quotes (this depends on the shell that is
used). Example: Vim &quot;+set si&quot; main.c Note: You can
use up to 10 &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-c&quot; commands.</p>

<p>-S {file} {file} will be sourced after the first file
has been read. This is equivalent to -c &quot;source
{file}&quot;. {file} cannot start with - . If {file} is
omitted &quot;Session.vim&quot; is used (only works when -S
is the last argument).</p>

<p>--cmd {command} Like using &quot;-c&quot;, but the
command is executed just before processing any vimrc file.
You can use up to 10 of these commands, independently from
&quot;-c&quot; commands.</p>

<p>-A If Vim has been compiled with ARABIC support for
editing right-to-left oriented files and Arabic keyboard
mapping, this option starts Vim in Arabic mode, i.e. arabic
is set. Otherwise an error message is given and Vim
aborts.</p>

<p>-b Binary mode. A few options will be set that makes it
pos- sible to edit a binary or executable file.</p>

<p>-C Compatible. Set the compatible option. This will make
Vim behave mostly like Vi, even though a .vimrc file
exists.</p>

<p>-d Start in diff mode. There should be two, three or
four file name arguments. Vim will open all the files and
show differences between them. Works like vimdiff(1).</p>

<p>-d {device} Open {device} for use as a terminal. Only on
the Amiga. Example: &quot;-d con:20/30/600/150&quot;.</p>

<p>-D Debugging. Go to debugging mode when executing the
first command from a script.</p>

<p>-e Start Vim in Ex mode, just like the executable was
called &quot;ex&quot;.</p>

<p>-E Start Vim in improved Ex mode, just like the
executable was called &quot;exim&quot;.</p>

<p>-f Foreground. For the GUI version, Vim will not fork
and detach from the shell it was started in. On the Amiga,
Vim is not restarted to open a new window. This option
should be used when Vim is executed by a program that will
wait for the edit session to finish (e.g. mail). On the
Amiga the &quot;:sh&quot; and &quot;:!&quot; commands will
not work.</p>

<p>--nofork Foreground. For the GUI version, Vim will not
fork and detach from the shell it was started in.</p>

<p>-F If Vim has been compiled with FKMAP support for
editing right-to-left oriented files and Farsi keyboard
mapping, this option starts Vim in Farsi mode, i.e. fkmap
and rightleft are set. Otherwise an error message is given
and Vim aborts.</p>

<p>-g If Vim has been compiled with GUI support, this
option enables the GUI. If no GUI support was compiled in,
an error message is given and Vim aborts.</p>

<p>-h Give a bit of help about the command line arguments
and options. After this Vim exits.</p>

<p>-H If Vim has been compiled with RIGHTLEFT support for
editing right-to-left oriented files and Hebrew keyboard
mapping, this option starts Vim in Hebrew mode, i.e. hkmap
and rightleft are set. Otherwise an error message is given
and Vim aborts.</p>

<p>-i {viminfo} When using the viminfo file is enabled,
this option sets the filename to use, instead of the default
&quot;~/.viminfo&quot;. This can also be used to skip the
use of the .viminfo file, by giving the name
&quot;NONE&quot;.</p>

<p>-L Same as -r.</p>

<p>-l Lisp mode. Sets the lisp and showmatch options
on.</p>

<p>-m Modifying files is disabled. Resets the write option.
You can still modify the buffer, but writing a file is not
possible.</p>

<p>-M Modifications not allowed. The modifiable and write
options will be unset, so that changes are not allowed and
files can not be written. Note that these options can be set
to enable making modifications.</p>

<p>-N No-compatible mode. Reset the compatible option. This
will make Vim behave a bit better, but less Vi compatible,
even though a .vimrc file does not exist.</p>

<p>-n No swap file will be used. Recovery after a crash
will be impossible. Handy if you want to edit a file on a
very slow medium (e.g. floppy). Can also be done with
&quot;:set uc=0&quot;. Can be undone with &quot;:set
uc=200&quot;.</p>

<p>-nb Become an editor server for NetBeans. See the docs
for details.</p>

<p>-o[N] Open N windows stacked. When N is omitted, open
one window for each file.</p>

<p>-O[N] Open N windows side by side. When N is omitted,
open one window for each file.</p>

<p>-p[N] Open N tab pages. When N is omitted, open one tab
page for each file.</p>

<p>-R Read-only mode. The readonly option will be set. You
can still edit the buffer, but will be prevented from acci-
dentally overwriting a file. If you do want to overwrite a
file, add an exclamation mark to the Ex command, as in
&quot;:w!&quot;. The -R option also implies the -n option
(see below). The readonly option can be reset with
&quot;:set noro&quot;. See &quot;:help readonly&quot;.</p>

<p>-r List swap files, with information about using them
for recovery.</p>

<p>-r {file} Recovery mode. The swap file is used to
recover a crashed editing session. The swap file is a file
with the same filename as the text file with
&quot;.swp&quot; appended. See &quot;:help
recovery&quot;.</p>

<p>-s Silent mode. Only when started as &quot;Ex&quot; or
when the &quot;-e&quot; option was given before the
&quot;-s&quot; option.</p>

<p>-s {scriptin} The script file {scriptin} is read. The
characters in the file are interpreted as if you had typed
them. The same can be done with the command &quot;:source!
{scriptin}&quot;. If the end of the file is reached before
the editor exits, further characters are read from the
keyboard.</p>

<p>-T {terminal} Tells Vim the name of the terminal you are
using. Only required when the automatic way doesnt work.
Should be a terminal known to Vim (builtin) or defined in
the termcap or terminfo file.</p>

<p>-u {vimrc} Use the commands in the file {vimrc} for
initializations. All the other initializations are skipped.
Use this to edit a special kind of files. It can also be
used to skip all initializations by giving the name
&quot;NONE&quot;. See &quot;:help initialization&quot;
within vim for more details.</p>

<p>-U {gvimrc} Use the commands in the file {gvimrc} for
GUI initializa- tions. All the other GUI initializations are
skipped. It can also be used to skip all GUI initializations
by giving the name &quot;NONE&quot;. See &quot;:help
gui-init&quot; within vim for more details.</p>

<p>-V[N] Verbose. Give messages about which files are
sourced and for reading and writing a viminfo file. The
optional num- ber N is the value for verbose . Default is
10.</p>

<p>-v Start Vim in Vi mode, just like the executable was
called &quot;vi&quot;. This only has effect when the
executable is called &quot;ex&quot;.</p>

<p>-w {scriptout} All the characters that you type are
recorded in the file {scriptout}, until you exit Vim. This
is useful if you want to create a script file to be used
with &quot;vim -s&quot; or &quot;:source!&quot;. If the
{scriptout} file exists, characters are appended.</p>

<p>-W {scriptout} Like -w, but an existing file is
overwritten.</p>

<p>-x Use encryption when writing files. Will prompt for a
crypt key.</p>

<p>-X Don t connect to the X server. Shortens startup time
in a terminal, but the window title and clipboard will not
be used.</p>

<p>-y Start Vim in easy mode, just like the executable was
called &quot;evim&quot; or &quot;eview&quot;. Makes Vim
behave like a click-and-type editor.</p>

<p>-Z Restricted mode. Works like the executable starts
with &quot;r&quot;.</p>

<p>-- Denotes the end of the options. Arguments after this
will be handled as a file name. This can be used to edit a
filename that starts with a -.</p>

<p>--echo-wid GTK GUI only: Echo the Window ID on
stdout.</p>

<p>--help Give a help message and exit, just like
&quot;-h&quot;.</p>

<p>--literal Take file name arguments literally, do not
expand wild- cards. This has no effect on Unix where the
shell expands wildcards.</p>

<p>--noplugin Skip loading plugins. Implied by -u NONE.</p>

<p>--remote Connect to a Vim server and make it edit the
files given in the rest of the arguments. If no server is
found a warning is given and the files are edited in the
current Vim.</p>

<p>--remote-expr {expr} Connect to a Vim server, evaluate
{expr} in it and print the result on stdout.</p>

<p>--remote-send {keys} Connect to a Vim server and send
{keys} to it.</p>

<p>--remote-silent As --remote, but without the warning
when no server is found.</p>

<p>--remote-wait As --remote, but Vim does not exit until
the files have been edited.</p>

<p>--remote-wait-silent As --remote-wait, but without the
warning when no server is found.</p>

<p>--remote-tab[-wait][-silent] As --remote but use tab
page per file</p>

<p>--role Set a unique role to identify the main window</p>

<p>--serverlist List the names of all Vim servers that can
be found.</p>

<p>--servername {name} Use {name} as the server name. Used
for the current Vim, unless used with a --remote argument,
then its the name of the server to connect to.</p>

<p>--socketid {id} GTK GUI only: Use the GtkPlug mechanism
to run gvim in another window.</p>

<p>--version Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>ON-LINE HELP Type &quot;:help&quot; in Vim to get
started. Type &quot;:help subject&quot; to get help on a
specific subject. For example: &quot;:help ZZ&quot; to get
help for the &quot;ZZ&quot; command. Use &lt;Tab&gt; and
CTRL-D to complete subjects (&quot;:help cmd-
line-completion&quot;). Tags are present to jump from one
place to another (sort of hypertext links, see
&quot;:help&quot;). All documentation files can be viewed in
this way, for example &quot;:help syntax.txt&quot;.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/vim/vim74/doc/*.txt The Vim
documentation files. Use &quot;:help doc-file-list&quot; to
get the complete list.</p>

<p>/usr/share/vim/vim74/doc/tags The tags file used for
finding information in the docu- mentation files.</p>

<p>AUTHOR Most of Vim was made by Bram Moolenaar, with a
lot of help from others. See &quot;:help credits&quot; in
Vim. Vim is based on Stevie, worked on by: Tim Thompson,
Tony Andrews and G.R. (Fred) Walter. Although hardly any of
the original code remains.</p>

<p>BUGS Probably. See &quot;:help todo&quot; for a list of
known problems.</p>

<p>Note that a number of things that may be regarded as
bugs by some, are in fact caused by a too-faithful
reproduction of Vi s behaviour. And if you think other
things are bugs &quot;because Vi does it differently&quot;,
you should take a closer look at the vi_diff.txt file (or
type :help vi_diff.txt when in Vim). Also have a look at the
compatible and cpoptions options.</p>
