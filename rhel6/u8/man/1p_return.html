<p>RETURN(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual RETURN(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME return - return from a function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS return [n]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The return utility shall cause the shell to
stop executing the current function or dot script. If the
shell is not currently executing a func- tion or dot script,
the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES None.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The value of the special parameter?shall be
set to n, an unsigned decimal integer, or to the exit status
of the last command executed if n is not specified. If the
value of n is greater than 255, the results are undefined.
When return is executed in a trap action, the last com- mand
is considered to be the command that executed immediately
preced- ing the trap action.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The behavior of return when not in a function
or dot script differs between the System V shell and the
KornShell. In the System V shell this is an error, whereas
in the KornShell, the effect is the same as exit.</p>

<p>The results of returning a number greater than 255 are
undefined because of differing practices in the various
historical implementa- tions. Some shells AND out all but
the low-order 8 bits; others allow larger values, but not of
unlimited size.</p>

<p>See the discussion of appropriate exit status values
under exit .</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
