<p>ADDSEVERITY(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
ADDSEVERITY(3)</p>

<p>NAME addseverity - introduce new severity classes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;fmtmsg.h&gt;</p>

<p>int addseverity(int severity, const char *s);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>addseverity(): _SVID_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function allows the introduction of new
severity classes which can be addressed by the severity
argument of the fmtmsg(3) function. By default that latter
function only knows how to print messages for severity 0-4
(with strings (none), HALT, ERROR, WARNING, INFO). This call
attaches the given string s to the given value severity. If
s is NULL, the severity class with the numeric value
severity is removed. It is not possible to overwrite or
remove one of the default severity classes. The severity
value must be non-negative.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon success, the value MM_OK is returned.
Upon error, the return value is MM_NOTOK. Possible errors
include: out of memory, attempt to remove a nonexistent or
default severity class.</p>

<p>VERSIONS addseverity() is provided in glibc since
version 2.1.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function is not specified in the
X/Open Portability Guide although the fmtmsg(3) function is.
It is available on System V systems.</p>

<p>NOTES New severity classes can also be added by setting
the environment vari- able SEV_LEVEL.</p>
