<p>NAME XmProcessTraversal A function that determines which
component receives keyboard events when a widget has the
focus</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt; Boolean
XmProcessTraversal( Widget widget, XmTraversalDirection
direction);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmProcessTraversal determines which
component of a hierarchy receives keyboard events when the
hierarchy that contains the given widget has keyboard
focus.</p>

<p>XmProcessTraversal changes focus only when the keyboard
focus policy of the widget hierarchy is explicit. If the
XmNkeyboardFocusPolicy of the nearest shell ancestor of the
given widget is not XmEXPLICIT, XmPro- cessTraversal returns
False without making any focus changes.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the widget ID of the widget whose
hierarchy is to be traversed</p>

<p>direction Specifies the direction of traversal</p>

<p>DEFINITIONS In order to be eligible to receive keyboard
focus when the shells XmNkeyboardFocusPolicy is XmEXPLICIT,
a widget or gadget must meet the following conditions:</p>

<p>&middot; The widget and its ancestors are not in the
process of being destroyed.</p>

<p>&middot; The widget and its ancestors are sensitive. A
widget is sensi- tive when its XmNsensitive and
XmNancestorSensitive resources are both True.</p>

<p>&middot; The XmNtraversalOn resource for the widget and
its ancestors is True.</p>

<p>&middot; The widget is viewable. This means that the
widget and its ancestors are managed, realized, and (except
for gadgets) mapped. Furthermore, in general, some part of
the widget s rectangular area must be unobscured by the
widgets ancestors. If an applica- tion unmaps a widget that
has its XmNmappedWhenManaged resource set to True, the
result is undefined.</p>

<p>In a ScrolledWindow with an XmNscrollingPolicy of
XmAUTO- MATIC, a widget that is obscured because it is not
within the clip window may be able to receive focus if some
part of the widget is within the work area and if an
XmNtraverseObscured- Callback routine can make the widget at
least partially visi- ble by scrolling the window.</p>

<p>In general only primitives, gadgets, and Drawing Area
are eligible to receive focus. Most managers cannot receive
focus even if they meet all these conditions.</p>

<p>The direction argument identifies the kind of traversal
action to take. The descriptions of these actions below
refer to traversable non-tab- group widgets and traversable
tab groups.</p>

<p>&middot; A traversable non-tab-group widget is a widget
that is not a tab group and that meets all the conditions
for receiving focus described above.</p>

<p>&middot; A traversable tab group widget is a tab group
widget that meets the same conditions, except that a manager
that is a tab group and meets the other conditions is also
eligible for traversal as long as it contains a descendant
that can receive focus.</p>

<p>A tab group is a widget whose XmNnavigationType is:</p>

<p>&middot; XmTAB_GROUP or XmSTICKY_TAB_GROUP, if the
hierarchy (up to the nearest shell ancestor) that contains
the widget has no widget whose XmNnavigationType is
XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</p>

<p>&middot; XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP or XmSTICKY_TAB_GROUP, if
the hierarchy (up to the nearest shell ancestor) that
contains the widget has any widget whose XmNnavigationType
is XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP</p>

<p>TRAVERSAL ACTIONS The hierarchy to be traversed is that
containing the widget argument. This hierarchy is traversed
only up to the nearest shell; XmPro- cessTraversal does not
move focus from one shell to another. If the shell
containing widget does not currently have the focus, any
change that XmProcessTraversal makes to the element with
focus within that shell does not take effect until the next
time the shell receives focus.</p>

<p>XmProcessTraversal begins the traversal action from the
widget in the hierarchy that currently has keyboard focus or
that last had focus when the user traversed away from the
shell hierarchy.</p>

<p>The value of the direction argument determines which of
three kinds of traversal action to take:</p>

<p>&middot; Traversal to a non-tab-group widget. This kind
of traversal is possible only when the widget that currently
has focus is not a tab group; otherwise, XmProcessTraversal
returns False for these actions.</p>

<p>These actions do not move focus from one tab group to
another. The actions first determine the containing tab
group. This is the tab group containing the widget that cur-
rently has focus. The actions traverse only to a non-tab-
group widget within the containing tab group.</p>

<p>A non-tab-group widget is eligible for this kind of
traversal if the widget is traversable and has no tab group
ancestors up to the containing tab group. If the tab group
contains no traversable non-tab-group widgets,
XmProcessTraversal returns False.</p>

<p>Following are the possible values of the direction
argument. Note that when actions wrap, wrapping occurs in
the traversal direction. The following describes what
happens in a left to right environment:</p>

<p>&middot; XmTRAVERSE_RIGHTIf the XmNnavigationType of the
con- taining tab group is not XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP, focus
moves to the next traversable non-tab-group widget to the
right of the widget that currently has focus. In a left to
right environment, at the right side of the tab group this
action wraps to the non-tab-group widget at the left side
and next toward the bottom. At the rightmost widget in the
bottom row of the tab group this action wraps to the
non-tab-group widget at the leftmost widget in the upper
row.</p>

<p>In a right to left environment, at the right side of the
tab group, this action wraps to the non-tab- group widget at
the left side and next toward the top. At the rightmost
widget in the upper row of the tab group this action wraps
to the non-tab- group widget at the leftmost widget in the
bottom row.</p>

<p>If the XmNnavigationType of the containing tab group is
XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP, focus moves to the next traversable
non-tab-group widget in the tab group, proceeding in the
order in which the widgets appear in their parents
XmNchildren lists. After the last widget in the tab group,
this action wraps to the first non-tab-group widget.</p>

<p>&middot; XmTRAVERSE_LEFTIf the XmNnavigationType of the
con- taining tab group is not XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP, focus
moves to the next traversable non-tab-group widget to the
left of the widget that currently has focus. In a left to
right environment, at the left side of the tab group this
action wraps to the non-tab-group widget at the right side
and next toward the top. At the left- most widget in the
upper row of the tab group this action wraps to the
non-tab-group widget at the right- most widget in the bottom
row.</p>

<p>In a right to left environment, at the left side of the
tab group this action wraps to the non-tab- group widget at
the right side and next toward the bottom. At the leftmost
widget in the bottom row of the tab group this action wraps
to the non-tab- group widget at the rightmost widget in the
upper row.</p>

<p>If the XmNnavigationType of the containing tab group is
XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP, focus moves to the previous
traversable non-tab-group widget in the tab group,
proceeding in the reverse order in which the widgets appear
in their parents XmNchildren lists. After the first widget
in the tab group, this action wraps to the last
non-tab-group widget.</p>

<p>&middot; XmTRAVERSE_DOWNIf the XmNnavigationType of the
con- taining tab group is not XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP, focus
moves to the next traversable non-tab-group widget below the
widget that currently has focus. In a left to right
environment, at the bottom of the tab group this action
wraps to the non-tab-group widget at the top and next toward
the right. At the bottom widget in the rightmost column of
the tab group this action wraps to the non-tab-group widget
at the top widget in the leftmost column.</p>

<p>In a right to left environment, at the bottom of the tab
group this action wraps to the non-tab- group widget at the
top and next toward the left. At the bottom widget of the
leftmost widget of the tab group this action wraps to the
non-tab-group widget at the top widget of the rightmost
column.</p>

<p>If the XmNnavigationType of the containing tab group is
XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP, focus moves to the next traversable
non-tab-group widget in the tab group, proceeding in the
order in which the widgets appear in their parents
XmNchildren lists. After the last widget in the tab group,
this action wraps to the first non-tab-group widget.</p>

<p>&middot; XmTRAVERSE_UPIf the XmNnavigationType of the
contain- ing tab group is not XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP, focus
moves to the next traversable non-tab-group widget above the
widget that currently has focus. In a left to right
environment, at the top of the tab group this action wraps
to the non-tab-group widget at the bottom and next toward
the left. At the top widget of the left- most column of the
tab group this action wraps to the non-tab-group widget at
the bottom widget of the right- most column.</p>

<p>In a right to left environment, at the top of the tab
group this action wraps to the non-tab-group widget at the
bottom and next toward the right. At the top widget of the
right most column of the tab group this action wraps to the
non-tab-group widget at the bottom widget of the leftmost
column.</p>

<p>If the XmNnavigationType of the containing tab group is
XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP, focus moves to the previous
traversable non-tab-group widget in the tab group,
proceeding in the reverse order in which the widgets appear
in their parents XmNchildren lists. After the first widget
in the tab group, this action wraps to the last
non-tab-group widget.</p>

<p>&middot; XmTRAVERSE_NEXTFocus moves to the next
traversable non-tab-group widget in the tab group,
proceeding in the order in which the widgets appear in their
parents XmNchildren lists. After the last widget in the tab
group, this action wraps to the first non-tab-group
widget.</p>

<p>&middot; XmTRAVERSE_PREVFocus moves to the previous
traversable non-tab-group widget in the tab group,
proceeding in the reverse order in which the widgets appear
in their parents XmNchildren lists. After the first widget
in the tab group, this action wraps to the last non-tab-
group widget.</p>

<p>&middot; XmTRAVERSE_HOME If the XmNnavigationType of the
con- taining tab group is not XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP, focus
moves to the first traversable non-tab-group widget at the
initial focus of the tab group.</p>

<p>If the XmNnavigationType of the containing tab group is
XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP, focus moves to the first traversable
non-tab-group widget in the tab group, according to the
order in which the widgets appear in their parents
XmNchildren lists.</p>

<p>&middot; Traversal to a tab group. These actions first
determine the cur- rent widget hierarchy and the containing
tab group. The current widget hierarchy is the widget
hierarchy whose root is the near- est shell ancestor of the
widget that currently has focus. The containing tab group is
is the tab group containing the widget that currently has
focus. If the current widget hierarchy con- tains no
traversable tab groups, XmProcessTraversal returns
False.</p>

<p>Following are the possible values of the direction
argument. If any tab group in the current widget hierarchy
has an XmNnavigationType of XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP, traversal
of tab groups in the hierarchy proceeds to widgets in the
order in which their XmNnavigationType resources were
specified as XmEXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP or
XmSTICKY_TAB_GROUP.:</p>

<p>&middot; XmTRAVERSE_NEXT_TAB_GROUP Finds the hierarchy
that con- tains widget, finds the active tab group (if any),
and makes the next tab group the active tab group in the
hierarchy.</p>

<p>&middot; XmTRAVERSE_PREV_TAB_GROUP Finds the hierarchy
that con- tains widget, finds the active tab group (if any),
and makes the previous tab group the active tab group in the
hierarchy.</p>

<p>&middot; Traversal to any widget. In this case the
widget argument is the widget to which XmProcessTraversal
tries to give focus. If the widget is not traversable,
XmProcessTraversal returns False.</p>

<p>Following are the possible values of the direction
argument:</p>

<p>&middot; XmTRAVERSE_CURRENT Finds the hierarchy and the
tab group that contain widget. If this tab group is not the
active tab group, this action makes it the active tab group.
If widget is an item in the active tab group, this action
makes it the active item. If widget is the active tab group,
this action makes the first traversable item in the tab
group the active item.</p>

<p>CAUTIONS Using XmProcessTraversal to traverse to
MenuBars, Pulldown menu panes, or Popup menu panes is not
supported.</p>

<p>XmProcessTraversal cannot be called recursively. In
particular, an application cannot call this routine from an
XmNfocusCallback or XmN- losingFocusCallback procedure.</p>

<p>RETURN Returns True if the traversal action succeeded.
Returns False if the XmNkeyboardFocusPolicy of the nearest
shell ancestor of widget is not XmEXPLICIT, if the traversal
action finds no traversable widget to receive focus, or if
the call to the routine has invalid arguments.</p>
