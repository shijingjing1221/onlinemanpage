<p>NAME gai.conf - getaddrinfo(3) configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A call to getaddrinfo(3) might return
multiple answers. According to RFC 3484 these answers must
be sorted so that the answer with the high- est success rate
is first in the list. The RFC provides and algorithm for the
sorting. The static rules are not always adequate, though.
For this reason the RFC also requires that system
administrators get the chance to dynamically change the
sorting. For the glibc implemen- tation this can be achieved
with the /etc/gai.conf file.</p>

<p>Each line in the configuration file consists of a
keyword and its parameters. White spaces in any place are
ignored. Lines starting with # are comments and are
ignored.</p>

<p>The keywords currently recognized are:</p>

<p>label netmask precedence The value is added to the label
table used in the RFC 3484 sort- ing. If any label
definition is present in the configuration file is present
the default table is not used. All the label definitions of
the default table which are to be maintained have to be
duplicated. Following the keyword the line has to contain a
network mask and a label value.</p>

<p>precedence netmask precedence This keyword is similar to
label but instead the value is added to the precedence table
as specified in RFC 3484. Once again, the presence of a
single precedence line in the configuration file causes the
default table to not be used.</p>

<p>reload &lt;yes|no&gt; This keyword control whether a
process checks whether the con- figuration file has been
changes since the last time it was read. If the value is yes
the file is re-read. This might cause problems in
multi-threaded applications and is generally a bad idea. The
default is no.</p>

<p>scopev4 mask value Add another rule to the RFC 3484
scope table for IPv4 address. By default the scope IDs
described in section 3.2 in RFC 3438 are used. Changing
these defaults should hardly ever be neces- sary.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The default table according to RFC 3484 would be
specified with the following configuration file:</p>

<p>label ::1/128 0 label ::/0 1 label 2002::/16 2 label
::/96 3 label ::ffff:0:0/96 4 precedence ::1/128 50
precedence ::/0 40 precedence 2002::/16 30 precedence ::/96
20 precedence ::ffff:0:0/96 10</p>
