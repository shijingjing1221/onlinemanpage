<p>NAME pnmremap - replace colors in a PNM image with
colors from another set</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmremap</p>

<p>-mapfile=palettefile</p>

<p>[-floyd|-fs|-nfloyd|-nofs]</p>

<p>[-norandom]</p>

<p>[-firstisdefault]</p>

<p>[-verbose]</p>

<p>[-missingcolor=color]</p>

<p>[pnmfile]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate
an option. You may use either white space or an equals sign
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmremap replaces the colors in an input image with
those from a palette you specify. Where colors in the input
are present in the palette, they just stay the same in the
output. But where the input contains a color that is not in
the palette, pnmremap gives you these choices:</p>

<p>&middot; Choose the closest color from the palette.</p>

<p>&middot; Choose the first color from the palette.</p>

<p>&middot; Use a color specified by a command option
(-missing).</p>

<p>&middot; Dither. This means rather than mapping pixel by
pixel, pnmremap uses colors from the palette to try to make
multi-pixel regions of the output have the same average
color as the input (for another kind of dithering, see
ppmdither).</p>

<p>Two reasons to use this program are: 1) you want to
reduce the number of colors in the input image; and 2) you
need to feed the image to something that can handle only
certain colors.</p>

<p>To reduce colors, you can generate the palette with
pnmcolormap.</p>

<p>By default, pnmremap maps an input color that is not in
the palette to the closest color that is in the palette.
Closest means with the smallest cartesian distance in the
red, green, blue brightness space (smallest sum of the
squares of the differences in red, green, and blue ITU-R
Recommedation BT.709 gamma-adjusted intensities).</p>

<p>You can instead specify a single default color for
pnmremap to use for any color in the input image that is not
in the palette. Use the -missing option for this.</p>

<p>You can also specify that the first color in the palette
image is the default. Use the -firstisdefault option for
this.</p>

<p>The palette is simply a PNM image. The colors of the
pixels in the image are the colors in the palette. Where the
pixels appear in the image, and the dimensions of the image,
are irrelevant. Multiple pix- els of the same color are
fine. However, a palette image is typically a single row
with one pixel per color.</p>

<p>If you specify -missing, the color you so specify is in
the palette in addition to whatever is in the palette
image.</p>

<p>For historical reasons, Netpbm sometimes calls the
palette a col- ormap. But it doesn t really map anything.
pnmremap creates its own map, based on the palette, to map
colors from the input image to output colors.</p>

<p>Palette/Image Type Mismatch In the simple case, the
palette image is of the same depth (number of planes, i.e.
number of components in each tuple (pixel)) as the input
image and pnmremap just does a straightforward search of the
palette for each input tuple (pixel). In fact, pnmremap
doesnt even care if the image is a visual image.</p>

<p>But what about when the depths differ? In that case,
pnmremap converts the input image (in its own memory) to
match the palette and then pro- ceeds as above.</p>

<p>There are only two such cases in which pnmremap knows
how to do the conversion: when one of them is tuple type
RGB, depth 3, and the other is tuple type GRAYSCALE or
BLACKANDWHITE, depth 1; and vice versa.</p>

<p>In any other case, pnmremap issues and error message and
fails.</p>

<p>Note that as long as your input and palette images are
PNM, theyll always fall into one of the cases pnmremap can
handle. Theres an issue only if youre using some exotic PAM
image.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005), pnmremap could not
handle the case of a palette of greater depth than the input
image. (It would issue an error message and fail in that
case). You can use ppmtoppm to increase the depth of the
input image to work around this limitation.</p>

<p>In any case, the output image has the same tuple type
and depth as the palette image.</p>

<p>Multiple Image Stream pnmremap handles a multiple image
input stream, producing a multiple image output stream. The
input images need not be similar in any way.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005), pnmremap ignored any
image after the first.</p>

<p>Examples pnmcolormap testimg.ppm 256 &gt;palette.ppm</p>

<p>pnmremap -map=palette.ppm testimg.ppm
&gt;reduced_testimg.ppm</p>

<p>To limit colors to a certain set, a typical example is
to create an image for posting on the World Wide Web, where
different browsers know different colors. But all browsers
are supposed to know the 216 web safe colors which are
essentially all the colors you can represent in a PPM image
with a maxval of 5. So you can do this:</p>

<p>pamseq 3 5 &gt;websafe.pam</p>

<p>pnmremap -map=websafe.pam testimg.ppm
&gt;websafe_testimg.ppm</p>

<p>Another useful palette is one for the 8 color IBM TTL
color set, which you can create with pamseq 3 1
&gt;ibmttl.pam</p>

<p>If you want to quantize one image to use the colors in
another one, just use the second one as the palette. You
dont have to reduce it down to only one pixel of each color,
just use it as is.</p>

<p>The output image has the same type and maxval as the
palette image.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS There is one parameter, which is required:
The file specification of the input PNM file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -mapfile=palettefilename This names the file
that contains the palette image.</p>

<p>This option is mandatory.</p>

<p>-floyd</p>

<p>-fs</p>

<p>-nofloyd</p>

<p>-nofs These options determine whether pnmremap does
Floyd-Steinberg dithering. Without Floyd-Steinberg, pnmremap
selects the output color of a pixel based on the color of
only the corresponding input pixel. With Floyd-Steinberg,
pnmremap considers regions of pixels such that the average
color of a region is the same in the output as in the input.
The dithering effect appears as a dot pattern up close, but
from a distance, the dots blend so that you see more colors
than are present in the color map.</p>

<p>As an example, if your color map contains only black and
white, and the input image has 4 adjacent pixels of gray,
pnmremap with Floyd-Steinberg would generate output pixels
black, white, black, white, which from a distance looks
gray. But without Floyd-Steinberg, pnmremap would generate 4
white pixels, white being the single-pixel approximation of
gray.</p>

<p>Floyd-Steinberg gives vastly better results on images
where unmodified quantization has banding or other
artifacts, espe- cially when going to a small number of
colors such as the above IBM set. However, it does take
substantially more CPU time.</p>

<p>-fs is a synomym for -floyd. -nofs is a synonym for
-nofloyd.</p>

<p>The default is -nofloyd.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.46 (March 2009), dithering doesn t work
quite as you expect if the color map has a lower maxval than
the input. pnmremap reduces the color resolution to the
color maps maxval before doing any dithering, so the
dithering does not have the effect of making the image, at a
distance, appear to have the original maxval. In current
Netpbm, it does.</p>

<p>-norandom This option affects a detail of the
Floyd-Steinberg dithering process. It has no effect if you
arent doing Floyd-Steinberg dithering.</p>

<p>By default, pnmremap initializes the error propagation
accumula- tor to random values to avoid the appearance of
unwanted pat- terns. This is an extension of the original
Floyd-Steinberg algorithm.</p>

<p>A drawback of this is that the same pnmremap on the same
input produces slightly different output every time, which
makes com- parison difficult.</p>

<p>With -norandom, pnmremap initializes the error
accumulators to zero and the output is completely
predictable.</p>

<p>-norandom was new in Netpbm 10.39 (June 2007).</p>

<p>-firstisdefault This tells pnmremap to map any input
color that is not in the palette to the first color in the
palette (the color of the pixel in the top left corner of
the palette image)</p>

<p>See DESCRIPTION .</p>

<p>If you specify -firstisdefault, the maxval of your input
must match the maxval of your palette image.</p>

<p>-missingcolor=color This specifies the default color for
pnmremap to map to a color in the input image that isn t in
the palette. color may or may not be in the palette image;
it is part of the palette regard- less.</p>

<p>If you specify -missingcolor, the maxval of your input
must match the maxval of your palette image.</p>

<p>-verbose Display helpful messages about the mapping
process.</p>

<p>HISTORY pnmremap first appeared in Netpbm 9.23 (January
2002). Before that, its function was available only as part
of the function of pnmquant (which was derived from the much
older ppmquant). Color quantization really has two main
subfunctions, so Netpbm 9.23 split it out into two separate
programs: pnmcolormap and pnmremap and then Netpbm 9.24
replaced pnmquant with a program that simply calls
pnmcolormap and pnmremap.</p>
