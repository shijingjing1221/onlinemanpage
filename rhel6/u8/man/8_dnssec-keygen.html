{name}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dnssec-keygen generates keys for DNSSEC
(Secure DNS), as defined in RFC 2535 and RFC 4034. It can
also generate keys for use with TSIG (Transaction
Signatures) as defined in RFC 2845, or TKEY (Transaction
Key) as defined in RFC 2930.</p>

<p>The name of the key is specified on the command line.
For DNSSEC keys, this must match the name of the zone for
which the key is being generated.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a algorithm Selects the cryptographic
algorithm. For DNSSEC keys, the value of algorithm must be
one of RSAMD5, RSASHA1, DSA, NSEC3RSASHA1, NSEC3DSA,
RSASHA256, RSASHA512 or ECCGOST. For TSIG/TKEY, the value
must be DH (Diffie Hellman), HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1,
HMAC-SHA224, HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-SHA384, or HMAC-SHA512. These
values are case insensitive.</p>

<p>If no algorithm is specified, then RSASHA1 will be used
by default, unless the -3 option is specified, in which case
NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used instead. (If -3 is used and an
algorithm is specified, that algorithm will be checked for
compatibility with NSEC3.)</p>

<p>Note 1: that for DNSSEC, RSASHA1 is a mandatory to
implement algorithm, and DSA is recommended. For TSIG,
HMAC-MD5 is mandatory.</p>

<p>Note 2: DH, HMAC-MD5, and HMAC-SHA1 through HMAC-SHA512
automatically set the -T KEY option.</p>

<p>-b keysize Specifies the number of bits in the key. The
choice of key size depends on the algorithm used. RSA keys
must be between 512 and 2048 bits. Diffie Hellman keys must
be between 128 and 4096 bits. DSA keys must be between 512
and 1024 bits and an exact multiple of 64. HMAC keys must be
between 1 and 512 bits.</p>

<p>The key size does not need to be specified if using a
default algorithm. The default key size is 1024 bits for
zone signing keys (ZSK s) and 2048 bits for key signing keys
(KSKs, generated with -f KSK). However, if an algorithm is
explicitly specified with the -a, then there is no default
key size, and the -b must be used.</p>

<p>-n nametype Specifies the owner type of the key. The
value of nametype must either be ZONE (for a DNSSEC zone key
(KEY/DNSKEY)), HOST or ENTITY (for a key associated with a
host (KEY)), USER (for a key associated with a user(KEY)) or
OTHER (DNSKEY). These values are case insensitive. Defaults
to ZONE for DNSKEY generation.</p>

<p>-3 Use an NSEC3-capable algorithm to generate a DNSSEC
key. If this option is used and no algorithm is explicitly
set on the command line, NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used by
default. Note that RSASHA256, RSASHA512 and ECCGOST
algorithms are NSEC3-capable.</p>

<p>-C Compatibility mode: generates an old-style key,
without any metadata. By default, dnssec-keygen will include
the keys creation date in the metadata stored with the
private key, and other dates may be set there as well
(publication date, activation date, etc). Keys that include
this data may be incompatible with older versions of BIND;
the -C option suppresses them.</p>

<p>-c class Indicates that the DNS record containing the
key should have the specified class. If not specified, class
IN is used.</p>

<p>-E engine Uses a crypto hardware (OpenSSL engine) for
random number and, when supported, key generation. When
compiled with PKCS#11 support it defaults to pkcs11; the
empty name resets it to no engine.</p>

<p>-e If generating an RSAMD5/RSASHA1 key, use a large
exponent.</p>

<p>-f flag Set the specified flag in the flag field of the
KEY/DNSKEY record. The only recognized flags are KSK (Key
Signing Key) and REVOKE.</p>

<p>-G Generate a key, but do not publish it or sign with
it. This option is incompatible with -P and -A.</p>

<p>-g generator If generating a Diffie Hellman key, use
this generator. Allowed values are 2 and 5. If no generator
is specified, a known prime from RFC 2539 will be used if
possible; otherwise the default is 2.</p>

<p>-h Prints a short summary of the options and arguments
to dnssec-keygen.</p>

<p>-K directory Sets the directory in which the key files
are to be written.</p>

<p>-k Deprecated in favor of -T KEY.</p>

<p>-p protocol Sets the protocol value for the generated
key. The protocol is a number between 0 and 255. The default
is 3 (DNSSEC). Other possible values for this argument are
listed in RFC 2535 and its successors.</p>

<p>-q Quiet mode: Suppresses unnecessary output, including
progress indication. Without this option, when dnssec-keygen
is run interactively to generate an RSA or DSA key pair, it
will print a string of symbols to stderr indicating the
progress of the key generation. A . indicates that a random
number has been found which passed an initial sieve test; +
means a number has passed a single round of the Miller-Rabin
primality test; a space means that the number has passed all
the tests and is a satisfactory key.</p>

<p>-r randomdev Specifies the source of randomness. If the
operating system does not provide a /dev/random or
equivalent device, the default source of randomness is
keyboard input. randomdev specifies the name of a character
device or file containing random data to be used instead of
the default. The special value keyboard indicates that
keyboard input should be used.</p>

<p>-S key Create a new key which is an explicit successor
to an existing key. The name, algorithm, size, and type of
the key will be set to match the existing key. The
activation date of the new key will be set to the
inactivation date of the existing one. The publication date
will be set to the activation date minus the prepublication
interval, which defaults to 30 days.</p>

<p>-s strength Specifies the strength value of the key. The
strength is a number between 0 and 15, and currently has no
defined purpose in DNSSEC.</p>

<p>-T rrtype Specifies the resource record type to use for
the key. rrtype must be either DNSKEY or KEY. The default is
DNSKEY when using a DNSSEC algorithm, but it can be
overridden to KEY for use with SIG(0). Using any TSIG
algorithm (HMAC-* or DH) forces this option to KEY.</p>

<p>-t type Indicates the use of the key. type must be one
of AUTHCONF, NOAUTHCONF, NOAUTH, or NOCONF. The default is
AUTHCONF. AUTH refers to the ability to authenticate data,
and CONF the ability to encrypt data.</p>

<p>-v level Sets the debugging level.</p>

<p>TIMING OPTIONS Dates can be expressed in the format
YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the argument begins with a +
or -, it is interpreted as an offset from the present time.
For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one of the
suffixes y, mo, w, d, h, or mi, then the offset is computed
in years (defined as 365 24-hour days, ignoring leap years),
months (defined as 30 24-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or
minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is
computed in seconds.</p>

<p>-P date/offset Sets the date on which a key is to be
published to the zone. After that date, the key will be
included in the zone but will not be used to sign it. If not
set, and if the -G option has not been used, the default is
&quot;now&quot;.</p>

<p>-A date/offset Sets the date on which the key is to be
activated. After that date, the key will be included in the
zone and used to sign it. If not set, and if the -G option
has not been used, the default is &quot;now&quot;.</p>

<p>-R date/offset Sets the date on which the key is to be
revoked. After that date, the key will be flagged as
revoked. It will be included in the zone and will be used to
sign it.</p>

<p>-I date/offset Sets the date on which the key is to be
retired. After that date, the key will still be included in
the zone, but it will not be used to sign it.</p>

<p>-D date/offset Sets the date on which the key is to be
deleted. After that date, the key will no longer be included
in the zone. (It may remain in the key repository,
however.)</p>

<p>-i interval Sets the prepublication interval for a key.
If set, then the publication and activation dates must be
separated by at least this much time. If the activation date
is specified but the publication date isn t, then the
publication date will default to this much time before the
activation date; conversely, if the publication date is
specified but activation date isnt, then activation will be
set to this much time after publication.</p>

<p>If the key is being created as an explicit successor to
another key, then the default prepublication interval is 30
days; otherwise it is zero.</p>

<p>As with date offsets, if the argument is followed by one
of the suffixes y, mo, w, d, h, or mi, then the interval is
measured in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes,
respectively. Without a suffix, the interval is measured in
seconds.</p>

<p>GENERATED KEYS When dnssec-keygen completes
successfully, it prints a string of the form
Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii to the standard output. This is an
identification string for the key it has generated.</p>

<p>&middot; nnnn is the key name.</p>

<p>&middot; aaa is the numeric representation of the
algorithm.</p>

<p>&middot; iiiii is the key identifier (or footprint).</p>

<p>dnssec-keygen creates two files, with names based on the
printed string. Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key contains the public
key, and Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private contains the private
key.</p>

<p>The .key file contains a DNS KEY record that can be
inserted into a zone file (directly or with a $INCLUDE
statement).</p>

<p>The .private file contains algorithm-specific fields.
For obvious security reasons, this file does not have
general read permission.</p>

<p>Both .key and .private files are generated for symmetric
encryption algorithms such as HMAC-MD5, even though the
public and private key are equivalent.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE To generate a 768-bit DSA key for the domain
example.com, the following command would be issued:</p>

<p>dnssec-keygen -a DSA -b 768 -n ZONE example.com</p>

<p>The command would print a string of the form:</p>

<p>Kexample.com.+003+26160</p>

<p>In this example, dnssec-keygen creates the files
Kexample.com.+003+26160.key and
Kexample.com.+003+26160.private.</p>
