<p>SETRESUID(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SETRESUID(2)</p>

<p>NAME setresuid, setresgid - set real, effective and
saved user or group ID</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setresuid(uid_t ruid, uid_t euid, uid_t suid); int
setresgid(gid_t rgid, gid_t egid, gid_t sgid);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION setresuid() sets the real user ID, the
effective user ID, and the saved set-user-ID of the calling
process.</p>

<p>Unprivileged user processes may change the real UID,
effective UID, and saved set-user-ID, each to one of: the
current real UID, the current effective UID or the current
saved set-user-ID.</p>

<p>Privileged processes (on Linux, those having the
CAP_SETUID capability) may set the real UID, effective UID,
and saved set-user-ID to arbitrary values.</p>

<p>If one of the arguments equals -1, the corresponding
value is not changed.</p>

<p>Regardless of what changes are made to the real UID,
effective UID, and saved set-user-ID, the file system UID is
always set to the same value as the (possibly new) effective
UID.</p>

<p>Completely analogously, setresgid() sets the real GID,
effective GID, and saved set-group-ID of the calling process
(and always modifies the file system GID to be the same as
the effective GID), with the same restrictions for
non-privileged processes.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN uid does not match the current UID and
this call would bring that user ID over its RLIMIT_NPROC
resource limit.</p>

<p>EPERM The calling process is not privileged (did not
have the CAP_SETUID capability) and tried to change the IDs
to values that are not permitted.</p>

<p>VERSIONS These calls are available under Linux since
Linux 2.1.44.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These calls are non-standard; they also
appear on HP-UX and some of the BSDs.</p>

<p>NOTES Under HP-UX and FreeBSD the prototype is found in
&lt;unistd.h&gt;. Under Linux the prototype is provided by
glibc since version 2.3.2.</p>
