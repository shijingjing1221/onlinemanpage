<p>GITHOOKS(5) Git Manual GITHOOKS(5)</p>

<p>NAME githooks - Hooks used by git</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $GIT_DIR/hooks/*</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Hooks are little scripts you can place in
$GIT_DIR/hooks directory to trigger action at certain
points. When git init is run, a handful of example hooks are
copied into the hooks directory of the new repository, but
by default they are all disabled. To enable a hook, rename
it by removing its .sample suffix.</p>

<p>Note It is also a requirement for a given hook to be
executable. However - in a freshly initialized repository -
the .sample files are executable by default.</p>

<p>This document describes the currently defined hooks.</p>

<p>HOOKS applypatch-msg This hook is invoked by git am
script. It takes a single parameter, the name of the file
that holds the proposed commit log message. Exiting with
non-zero status causes git am to abort before applying the
patch.</p>

<p>The hook is allowed to edit the message file in place,
and can be used to normalize the message into some project
standard format (if the project has one). It can also be
used to refuse the commit after inspecting the message
file.</p>

<p>The default applypatch-msg hook, when enabled, runs the
commit-msg hook, if the latter is enabled.</p>

<p>pre-applypatch This hook is invoked by git am. It takes
no parameter, and is invoked after the patch is applied, but
before a commit is made.</p>

<p>If it exits with non-zero status, then the working tree
will not be committed after applying the patch.</p>

<p>It can be used to inspect the current working tree and
refuse to make a commit if it does not pass certain
test.</p>

<p>The default pre-applypatch hook, when enabled, runs the
pre-commit hook, if the latter is enabled.</p>

<p>post-applypatch This hook is invoked by git am. It takes
no parameter, and is invoked after the patch is applied and
a commit is made.</p>

<p>This hook is meant primarily for notification, and
cannot affect the outcome of git am.</p>

<p>pre-commit This hook is invoked by git commit, and can
be bypassed with --no-verify option. It takes no parameter,
and is invoked before obtaining the proposed commit log
message and making a commit. Exiting with non-zero status
from this script causes the git commit to abort.</p>

<p>The default pre-commit hook, when enabled, catches
introduction of lines with trailing whitespaces and aborts
the commit when such a line is found.</p>

<p>All the git commit hooks are invoked with the
environment variable GIT_EDITOR=: if the command will not
bring up an editor to modify the commit message.</p>

<p>prepare-commit-msg This hook is invoked by git commit
right after preparing the default log message, and before
the editor is started.</p>

<p>It takes one to three parameters. The first is the name
of the file that contains the commit log message. The second
is the source of the commit message, and can be: message (if
a -m or -F option was given); template (if a -t option was
given or the configuration option commit.template is set);
merge (if the commit is a merge or a .git/MERGE_MSG file
exists); squash (if a .git/SQUASH_MSG file exists); or
commit, followed by a commit SHA1 (if a -c, -C or --amend
option was given).</p>

<p>If the exit status is non-zero, git commit will
abort.</p>

<p>The purpose of the hook is to edit the message file in
place, and it is not suppressed by the --no-verify option. A
non-zero exit means a failure of the hook and aborts the
commit. It should not be used as replacement for pre-commit
hook.</p>

<p>The sample prepare-commit-msg hook that comes with git
comments out the Conflicts: part of a merges commit
message.</p>

<p>commit-msg This hook is invoked by git commit, and can
be bypassed with --no-verify option. It takes a single
parameter, the name of the file that holds the proposed
commit log message. Exiting with non-zero status causes the
git commit to abort.</p>

<p>The hook is allowed to edit the message file in place,
and can be used to normalize the message into some project
standard format (if the project has one). It can also be
used to refuse the commit after inspecting the message
file.</p>

<p>The default commit-msg hook, when enabled, detects
duplicate &quot;Signed-off-by&quot; lines, and aborts the
commit if one is found.</p>

<p>post-commit This hook is invoked by git commit. It takes
no parameter, and is invoked after a commit is made.</p>

<p>This hook is meant primarily for notification, and
cannot affect the outcome of git commit.</p>

<p>pre-rebase This hook is called by git rebase and can be
used to prevent a branch from getting rebased.</p>

<p>post-checkout This hook is invoked when a git checkout
is run after having updated the worktree. The hook is given
three parameters: the ref of the previous HEAD, the ref of
the new HEAD (which may or may not have changed), and a flag
indicating whether the checkout was a branch checkout
(changing branches, flag=1) or a file checkout (retrieving a
file from the index, flag=0). This hook cannot affect the
outcome of git checkout.</p>

<p>It is also run after git clone, unless the --no-checkout
(-n) option is used. The first parameter given to the hook
is the null-ref, the second the ref of the new HEAD and the
flag is always 1.</p>

<p>This hook can be used to perform repository validity
checks, auto-display differences from the previous HEAD if
different, or set working dir metadata properties.</p>

<p>post-merge This hook is invoked by git merge, which
happens when a git pull is done on a local repository. The
hook takes a single parameter, a status flag specifying
whether or not the merge being done was a squash merge. This
hook cannot affect the outcome of git merge and is not
executed, if the merge failed due to conflicts.</p>

<p>This hook can be used in conjunction with a
corresponding pre-commit hook to save and restore any form
of metadata associated with the working tree (eg:
permissions/ownership, ACLS, etc). See
contrib/hooks/setgitperms.perl for an example of how to do
this.</p>

<p>pre-receive This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack on
the remote repository, which happens when a git push is done
on a local repository. Just before starting to update refs
on the remote repository, the pre-receive hook is invoked.
Its exit status determines the success or failure of the
update.</p>

<p>This hook executes once for the receive operation. It
takes no arguments, but for each ref to be updated it
receives on standard input a line of the format:</p>

<p>&lt;old-value&gt; SP &lt;new-value&gt; SP
&lt;ref-name&gt; LF</p>

<p>where &lt;old-value&gt; is the old object name stored in
the ref, &lt;new-value&gt; is the new object name to be
stored in the ref and &lt;ref-name&gt; is the full name of
the ref. When creating a new ref, &lt;old-value&gt; is 40
0.</p>

<p>If the hook exits with non-zero status, none of the refs
will be updated. If the hook exits with zero, updating of
individual refs can still be prevented by the update
hook.</p>

<p>Both standard output and standard error output are
forwarded to git send-pack on the other end, so you can
simply echo messages for the user.</p>

<p>update This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack on the
remote repository, which happens when a git push is done on
a local repository. Just before updating the ref on the
remote repository, the update hook is invoked. Its exit
status determines the success or failure of the ref
update.</p>

<p>The hook executes once for each ref to be updated, and
takes three parameters:</p>

<p>&middot; the name of the ref being updated,</p>

<p>&middot; the old object name stored in the ref,</p>

<p>&middot; and the new objectname to be stored in the
ref.</p>

<p>A zero exit from the update hook allows the ref to be
updated. Exiting with a non-zero status prevents
git-receive-pack from updating that ref.</p>

<p>This hook can be used to prevent forced update on
certain refs by making sure that the object name is a commit
object that is a descendant of the commit object named by
the old object name. That is, to enforce a
&quot;fast-forward only&quot; policy.</p>

<p>It could also be used to log the old..new status.
However, it does not know the entire set of branches, so it
would end up firing one e-mail per ref when used naively,
though. The post-receive hook is more suited to that.</p>

<p>Another use suggested on the mailing list is to use this
hook to implement access control which is finer grained than
the one based on filesystem group.</p>

<p>Both standard output and standard error output are
forwarded to git send-pack on the other end, so you can
simply echo messages for the user.</p>

<p>The default update hook, when enabled and with
hooks.allowunannotated config option unset or set to false
prevents unannotated tags to be pushed.</p>

<p>post-receive This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack on
the remote repository, which happens when a git push is done
on a local repository. It executes on the remote repository
once after all the refs have been updated.</p>

<p>This hook executes once for the receive operation. It
takes no arguments, but gets the same information as the
pre-receive hook does on its standard input.</p>

<p>This hook does not affect the outcome of
git-receive-pack, as it is called after the real work is
done.</p>

<p>This supersedes the post-update hook in that it gets
both old and new values of all the refs in addition to their
names.</p>

<p>Both standard output and standard error output are
forwarded to git send-pack on the other end, so you can
simply echo messages for the user.</p>

<p>The default post-receive hook is empty, but there is a
sample script post-receive-email provided in the
contrib/hooks directory in git distribution, which
implements sending commit emails.</p>

<p>post-update This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack on
the remote repository, which happens when a git push is done
on a local repository. It executes on the remote repository
once after all the refs have been updated.</p>

<p>It takes a variable number of parameters, each of which
is the name of ref that was actually updated.</p>

<p>This hook is meant primarily for notification, and
cannot affect the outcome of git-receive-pack.</p>

<p>The post-update hook can tell what are the heads that
were pushed, but it does not know what their original and
updated values are, so it is a poor place to do log
old..new. The post-receive hook does get both original and
updated values of the refs. You might consider it instead if
you need them.</p>

<p>When enabled, the default post-update hook runs git
update-server-info to keep the information used by dumb
transports (e.g., HTTP) up-to-date. If you are publishing a
git repository that is accessible via HTTP, you should
probably enable this hook.</p>

<p>Both standard output and standard error output are
forwarded to git send-pack on the other end, so you can
simply echo messages for the user.</p>

<p>pre-auto-gc This hook is invoked by git gc --auto. It
takes no parameter, and exiting with non-zero status from
this script causes the git gc --auto to abort.</p>

<p>post-rewrite This hook is invoked by commands that
rewrite commits (git commit --amend, git-rebase; currently
git-filter-branch does not call it!). Its first argument
denotes the command it was invoked by: currently one of
amend or rebase. Further command-dependent arguments may be
passed in the future.</p>

<p>The hook receives a list of the rewritten commits on
stdin, in the format</p>

<p>&lt;old-sha1&gt; SP &lt;new-sha1&gt; [ SP
&lt;extra-info&gt; ] LF</p>

<p>The extra-info is again command-dependent. If it is
empty, the preceding SP is also omitted. Currently, no
commands pass any extra-info.</p>

<p>The hook always runs after the automatic note copying
(see &quot;notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;&quot; in
linkgit:git-config.txt) has happened, and thus has access to
these notes.</p>

<p>The following command-specific comments apply:</p>

<p>rebase For the squash and fixup operation, all commits
that were squashed are listed as being rewritten to the
squashed commit. This means that there will be several lines
sharing the same new-sha1.</p>

<p>The commits are guaranteed to be listed in the order
that they were processed by rebase.</p>

<p>There is no default post-rewrite hook, but see the
post-receive-copy-notes script in contrib/hooks for an
example that copies your git-notes to the rewritten
commits.</p>
