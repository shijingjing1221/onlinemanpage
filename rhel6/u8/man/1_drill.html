<p>NAME drill - get (debug) information out of DNS(SEC)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS drill [ OPTIONS ] name [ @server ] [ type ] [
class ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION drill is a tool to designed to get all sorts
of information out of the DNS. It is specificly designed to
be used with DNSSEC.</p>

<p>The name drill is a pun on dig. With drill you should be
able get even more information than with dig.</p>

<p>If no arguments are given class defaults to IN and type
to A. The server(s) specified in /etc/resolv.conf are used
to query against.</p>

<p>name Ask for this name.</p>

<p>@server Send to query to this server. If not specified
use the name- servers from /etc/resolv.conf.</p>

<p>type Ask for this RR type. If type is not given on the
command line it defaults to A. Except when doing to reverse
lookup when it defaults to PTR.</p>

<p>class Use this class when querying.</p>

<p>SAMPLE USAGE drill mx miek.nl Show the MX records of the
domain miek.nl</p>

<p>drill -S jelte.nlnetlabs.nl Chase any signatures in the
jelte.nlnetlab.nl domain. This option is only available when
ldns has been compiled with openssl-support.</p>

<p>drill -TD www.example.com Do a DNSSEC (-D) trace (-T)
from the rootservers down to www.example.com. This option
only works when ldns has been com- piled with openssl
support.</p>

<p>drill -s dnskey jelte.nlnetlabs.nl Show the DNSKEY
record(s) for jelte.nlnetlabs.nl. For each found DNSKEY
record also print the DS record.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -D Enable DNSSEC in the query. When querying for
DNSSEC types (DNSKEY, RRSIG, DS and NSEC) this is not
automaticly enabled.</p>

<p>-T Trace name from the root down. When using this option
the @server and the type arguments are not used.</p>

<p>-S Chase the signature(s) of name to a known key or as
high up in the tree as possible.</p>

<p>-V level Be more verbose. Set level to 5 to see the
actual query that is sent.</p>

<p>-Q Quiet mode, this overrules -V.</p>

<p>-f file Read the query from a file. The query must be
dumped with -w.</p>

<p>-i file read the answer from the file instead from the
network. This aids in debugging and can be used to check if
a query on disk is valid. If the file contains binary data
it is assumed to be a query in network order.</p>

<p>-w file Write an answer packet to file.</p>

<p>-q file Write the query packet to file.</p>

<p>-v Show drills version.</p>

<p>-h Show a short help message.</p>

<p>QUERY OPTIONS -4 Stay on ip4. Only send queries to ip4
enabled nameservers.</p>

<p>-6 Stay on ip6. Only send queries to ip6 enabled
nameservers.</p>

<p>-a Use the resolver structures fallback mechanism if the
answer is truncated (TC=1). If a truncated packet is
received and this option is set, drill will first send a new
query with EDNS0 buffer size 4096.</p>

<p>If the EDNS0 buffer size was already set to 512+ bytes,
or the above retry also results in a truncated answer, the
resolver structure will fall back to TCP.</p>

<p>-b size Use size as the buffer size in the EDNS0 pseudo
RR.</p>

<p>-c file Use file instead of /etc/resolv.conf for
nameserver configura- tion.</p>

<p>-d domain When tracing (-T), start from this domain
instead of the root.</p>

<p>-t Use TCP/IP when querying a server</p>

<p>-k keyfile Use this file to read a (trusted) key from.
When this options is given drill tries to validate the
current answer with this key. No chasing is done. When drill
is doing a secure trace, this key will be used as trust
anchor. Can contain a DNSKEY or a DS record.</p>

<p>Alternatively, when DNSSEC enabled tracing (-TD) or
signature chasing (-S), if -k is not specified, and a
default trust anchor (/var/lib/unbound/root.key) exists and
contains a valid DNSKEY or DS record, it will be used as the
trust anchor.</p>

<p>-o mnemonic Use this option to set or unset specific
header bits. A bit is set by using the bit mnemonic in
CAPITAL letters. A bit is unset when the mnemonic is given
in lowercase. The following mnemonics are understood by
drill:</p>

<p>QR, qr: set, unset QueRy (default: on) AA, aa: set,
unset Authoritative Answer (default: off) TC, tc: set, unset
TrunCated (default: off) RD, rd: set, unset Recursion
Desired (default: on) CD, cd: set, unset Checking Disabled
(default: off) RA, ra: set, unset Recursion Available
(default: off) AD, ad: set, unset Authenticated Data
(default: off)</p>

<p>Thus: -o CD, will enable Checking Disabled, which
instructs the cache to not validate the answers it gives
out.</p>

<p>-p port Use this port instead of the default of 53.</p>

<p>-r file When tracing (-T), use file as a root servers
hint file.</p>

<p>-s When encountering a DNSKEY print the equivalent DS
also.</p>

<p>-u Use UDP when querying a server. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-w file write the answer to a file. The file will
contain a hexadecimal dump of the query. This can be used in
conjunction with -f.</p>

<p>-x Do a reverse loopup. The type argument is not used,
it is preset to PTR.</p>

<p>-y &lt;name:key[:algo]&gt; specify named base64 tsig
key, and optional an algorithm (defaults to
hmac-md5.sig-alg.reg.int)</p>

<p>-z don t randomize the nameserver list before sending
queries.</p>

<p>FILES /var/lib/unbound/root.key The file from which
trusted keys are loaded when no -k option is given.</p>
