<p>HASH(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual HASH(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME hash - remember or report utility locations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS hash [utility...]</p>

<p>hash -r</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The hash utility shall affect the way the
current shell environment remembers the locations of
utilities found as described in Command Search and Execution
. Depending on the arguments specified, it shall add utility
locations to its list of remembered locations or it shall
purge the contents of the list. When no arguments are
specified, it shall report on the contents of the list.</p>

<p>Utilities provided as built-ins to the shell shall not
be reported by hash.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The hash utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-r Forget all previously remembered utility
locations.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>utility The name of a utility to be searched for and
added to the list of remembered locations. If utility
contains one or more slashes, the results are
unspecified.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of hash:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>PATH Determine the location of utility, as described in
the Base Def- initions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Chapter 8, Environment Variables.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output of hash shall be used when no
arguments are speci- fied. Its format is unspecified, but
includes the pathname of each utility in the list of
remembered locations for the current shell envi- ronment.
This list shall consist of those utilities named in previous
hash invocations that have been invoked, and may contain
those invoked and found through the normal command search
process.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Since hash affects the current shell
execution environment, it is always provided as a shell
regular built-in. If it is called in a sepa- rate utility
execution environment, such as one of the following:</p>

<p>nohup hash -r find . -type f | xargs hash</p>

<p>it does not affect the command search process of the
callers environ- ment.</p>

<p>The hash utility may be implemented as an alias-for
example, alias -t -, in which case utilities found through
normal command search are not listed by the hash
command.</p>

<p>The effects of hash -r can also be achieved portably by
resetting the value of PATH ; in the simplest form, this can
be:</p>

<p>PATH=&quot;$PATH&quot;</p>

<p>The use of hash with utility names is unnecessary for
most applica- tions, but may provide a performance
improvement on a few implementa- tions; normally, the
hashing process is included by default.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
