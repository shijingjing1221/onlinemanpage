<p>NAME dhcp-eval - ISC DHCP conditional evaluation</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP client
and server both provide the ability to perform conditional
behavior depending on the contents of packets they receive.
The syntax for specifying this conditional behaviour is
documented here.</p>

<p>REFERENCE: CONDITIONAL BEHAVIOUR Conditional behaviour
is specified using the if statement and the else or elsif
statements. A conditional statement can appear anywhere that
a regular statement (e.g., an option statement) can appear,
and can enclose one or more such statements. A typical
conditional statement in a server might be:</p>

<p>if option dhcp-user-class = &quot;accounting&quot; {
max-lease-time 17600; option domain-name
&quot;accounting.example.org&quot;; option
domain-name-servers ns1.accounting.example.org,
ns2.accounting.example.org; } elsif option dhcp-user-class =
&quot;sales&quot; { max-lease-time 17600; option domain-name
&quot;sales.example.org&quot;; option domain-name-servers
ns1.sales.example.org, ns2.sales.example.org; } elsif option
dhcp-user-class = &quot;engineering&quot; { max-lease-time
17600; option domain-name
&quot;engineering.example.org&quot;; option
domain-name-servers ns1.engineering.example.org,
ns2.engineering.example.org; } else { max-lease-time 600;
option domain-name &quot;misc.example.org&quot;; option
domain-name-servers ns1.misc.example.org,
ns2.misc.example.org; }</p>

<p>On the client side, an example of conditional evaluation
might be:</p>

<p># example.org filters DNS at its firewall, so we have to
use their DNS # servers when we connect to their network. If
we are not at # example.org, prefer our own DNS server. if
not option domain-name = &quot;example.org&quot; { prepend
domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1; }</p>

<p>The if statement and the elsif continuation statement
both take boolean expressions as their arguments. That is,
they take expressions that, when evaluated, produce a
boolean result. If the expression evaluates to true, then
the statements enclosed in braces following the if state-
ment are executed, and all subsequent elsif and else clauses
are skipped. Otherwise, each subsequent elsif clauses
expression is checked, until an elsif clause is encountered
whose test evaluates to true. If such a clause is found, the
statements in braces following it are executed, and then any
subsequent elsif and else clauses are skipped. If all the if
and elsif clauses are checked but none of their expressions
evaluate true, then if there is an else clause, the
statements enclosed in braces following the else are
evaluated. Boolean expressions that evaluate to null are
treated as false in con- ditionals.</p>

<p>BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS The following is the current list of
boolean expressions that are sup- ported by the DHCP
distribution.</p>

<p>data-expression-1 = data-expression-2</p>

<p>The = operator compares the values of two data
expressions, return- ing true if they are the same, false if
they are not. If either the left-hand side or the right-hand
side are null, the result is also null.</p>

<p>data-expression-1 ~= data-expression-2 data-expression-1
~~ data- expression-2</p>

<p>The ~= and ~~ operators (not available on all systems)
perform extended regex(7) matching of the values of two data
expressions, returning true if data-expression-1 matches
against the regular expression evaluated by
data-expression-2, or false if it does not match or
encounters some error. If either the left-hand side or the
right-hand side are null or empty strings, the result is
also false. The ~~ operator differs from the ~= operator in
that it is case- insensitive.</p>

<p>boolean-expression-1 and boolean-expression-2</p>

<p>The and operator evaluates to true if the boolean
expression on the left-hand side and the boolean expression
on the right-hand side both evaluate to true. Otherwise, it
evaluates to false. If either the expression on the
left-hand side or the expression on the right- hand side are
null, the result is null.</p>

<p>boolean-expression-1 or boolean-expression-2</p>

<p>The or operator evaluates to true if either the boolean
expression on the left-hand side or the boolean expression
on the right-hand side evaluate to true. Otherwise, it
evaluates to false. If either the expression on the
left-hand side or the expression on the right- hand side are
null, the result is null.</p>

<p>not boolean-expression</p>

<p>The not operator evaluates to true if boolean-expression
evaluates to false, and returns false if boolean-expression
evaluates to true. If boolean-expression evaluates to null,
the result is also null.</p>

<p>exists option-name</p>

<p>The exists expression returns true if the specified
option exists in the incoming DHCP packet being processed.
known</p>

<p>The known expression returns true if the client whose
request is currently being processed is known - that is, if
theres a host dec- laration for it. static</p>

<p>The static expression returns true if the lease assigned
to the client whose request is currently being processed is
derived from a static address assignment.</p>

<p>DATA EXPRESSIONS Several of the boolean expressions
above depend on the results of eval- uating data
expressions. A list of these expressions is provided
here.</p>

<p>substring (data-expr, offset, length)</p>

<p>The substring operator evaluates the data expression and
returns the substring of the result of that evaluation that
starts offset bytes from the beginning, continuing for
length bytes. Offset and length are both numeric
expressions. If data-expr, offset or length evalu- ate to
null, then the result is also null. If offset is greater
than or equal to the length of the evaluated data, then a
zero- length data string is returned. If length is greater
then the remaining length of the evaluated data after
offset, then a data string containing all data from offset
to the end of the evaluated data is returned.</p>

<p>suffix (data-expr, length)</p>

<p>The suffix operator evaluates data-expr and returns the
last length bytes of the result of that evaluation. Length
is a numeric expres- sion. If data-expr or length evaluate
to null, then the result is also null. If suffix evaluates
to a number greater than the length of the evaluated data,
then the evaluated data is returned.</p>

<p>lcase (data-expr)</p>

<p>The lcase function returns the result of evaluating
data-expr con- verted to lower case. If data-expr evaluates
to null, then the result is also null.</p>

<p>ucase (data-expr)</p>

<p>The ucase function returns the result of evaluating
data-expr con- verted to upper case. If data-expr evaluates
to null, then the result is also null.</p>

<p>option option-name</p>

<p>The option operator returns the contents of the
specified option in the packet to which the server is
responding.</p>

<p>config-option option-name</p>

<p>The config-option operator returns the value for the
specified option that the DHCP client or server has been
configured to send.</p>

<p>hardware</p>

<p>The hardware operator returns a data string whose first
element is the type of network interface indicated in packet
being considered, and whose subsequent elements are client s
link-layer address. If there is no packet, or if the RFC2131
hlen field is invalid, then the result is null. Hardware
types include ethernet (1), token- ring (6), and fddi (8).
Hardware types are specified by the IETF, and details on how
the type numbers are defined can be found in RFC2131 (in the
ISC DHCP distribution, this is included in the doc/
subdirectory).</p>

<p>packet (offset, length)</p>

<p>The packet operator returns the specified portion of the
packet being considered, or null in contexts where no packet
is being con- sidered. Offset and length are applied to the
contents packet as in the substring operator.</p>

<p>string</p>

<p>A string, enclosed in quotes, may be specified as a data
expression, and returns the text between the quotes, encoded
in ASCII. The backslash ( ) character is treated specially,
as in C programming: means newline, and m e a n s b e l l .
A n y o c t a l v a means carriage return, 0 l0n, means TAB,
u e c a n b e s p e c i f i e d w i t h where nnn is any
positive octal number less than 0400. Any hexadec- imal
value can be specified with , where nn is any positive
hexadecimal number less than or equal to 0xff.</p>

<p>colon-separated hexadecimal list</p>

<p>A list of hexadecimal octet values, separated by colons,
may be specified as a data expression.</p>

<p>concat (data-expr1, ..., data-exprN) The expressions are
evaluated, and the results of each evaluation are
concatenated in the sequence that the subexpressions are
listed. If any subexpression evaluates to null, the result
of the concatena- tion is null.</p>

<p>reverse (numeric-expr1, data-expr2) The two expressions
are evaluated, and then the result of evaluating the data
expression is reversed in place, using hunks of the size
specified in the numeric expression. For example, if the
numeric expression evaluates to four, and the data
expression evaluates to twelve bytes of data, then the
reverse expression will evaluate to twelve bytes of data,
consisting of the last four bytes of the the input data,
followed by the middle four bytes, followed by the first
four bytes.</p>

<p>leased-address In any context where the client whose
request is being processed has been assigned an IP address,
this data expression returns that IP address. In any context
where the client whose request is being processed has not
been assigned an ip address, if this data expres- sion is
found in executable statements executed on that clients
behalf, a log message indicating &quot;there is no lease
associated with this client&quot; is syslogged to the debug
level (this is considered dhcpd.conf debugging
information).</p>

<p>binary-to-ascii (numeric-expr1, numeric-expr2,
data-expr1, data-expr2) Converts the result of evaluating
data-expr2 into a text string con- taining one number for
each element of the result of evaluating data-expr2. Each
number is separated from the other by the result of
evaluating data-expr1. The result of evaluating
numeric-expr1 specifies the base (2 through 16) into which
the numbers should be converted. The result of evaluating
numeric-expr2 specifies the width in bits of each number,
which may be either 8, 16 or 32.</p>

<p>As an example of the preceding three types of
expressions, to pro- duce the name of a PTR record for the
IP address being assigned to a client, one could write the
following expression:</p>

<p>concat (binary-to-ascii (10, 8, &quot;.&quot;, reverse
(1, leased-address)), &quot;.in-addr.arpa.&quot;);</p>

<p>encode-int (numeric-expr, width) Numeric-expr is
evaluated and encoded as a data string of the speci- fied
width, in network byte order (most significant byte first).
If the numeric expression evaluates to the null value, the
result is also null.</p>

<p>pick-first-value (data-expr1 [ ... exprn ] ) The
pick-first-value function takes any number of data
expressions as its arguments. Each expression is evaluated,
starting with the first in the list, until an expression is
found that does not evalu- ate to a null value. That
expression is returned, and none of the subsequent
expressions are evaluated. If all expressions evaluate to a
null value, the null value is returned.</p>

<p>host-decl-name The host-decl-name function returns the
name of the host declaration that matched the client whose
request is currently being processed, if any. If no host
declaration matched, the result is the null value.</p>

<p>NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS Numeric expressions are expressions
that evaluate to an integer. In general, the maximum size of
such an integer should not be assumed to be representable in
fewer than 32 bits, but the precision of such inte- gers may
be more than 32 bits.</p>

<p>extract-int (data-expr, width)</p>

<p>The extract-int operator extracts an integer value in
network byte order from the result of evaluating the
specified data expression. Width is the width in bits of the
integer to extract. Currently, the only supported widths are
8, 16 and 32. If the evaluation of the data expression
doesnt provide sufficient bits to extract an integer of the
specified size, the null value is returned.</p>

<p>lease-time</p>

<p>The duration of the current lease - that is, the
difference between the current time and the time that the
lease expires.</p>

<p>number</p>

<p>Any number between zero and the maximum representable
size may be specified as a numeric expression.</p>

<p>client-state</p>

<p>The current state of the client instance being
processed. This is only useful in DHCP client configuration
files. Possible values are:</p>

<p>&middot; Booting - DHCP client is in the INIT state, and
does not yet have an IP address. The next message
transmitted will be a DHCPDIS- COVER, which will be
broadcast.</p>

<p>&middot; Reboot - DHCP client is in the INIT-REBOOT
state. It has an IP address, but is not yet using it. The
next message to be trans- mitted will be a DHCPREQUEST,
which will be broadcast. If no response is heard, the client
will bind to its address and move to the BOUND state.</p>

<p>&middot; Select - DHCP client is in the SELECTING state
- it has received at least one DHCPOFFER message, but is
waiting to see if it may receive other DHCPOFFER messages
from other servers. No messages are sent in the SELECTING
state.</p>

<p>&middot; Request - DHCP client is in the REQUESTING
state - it has received at least one DHCPOFFER message, and
has chosen which one it will request. The next message to be
sent will be a DHCPREQUEST mes- sage, which will be
broadcast.</p>

<p>&middot; Bound - DHCP client is in the BOUND state - it
has an IP address. No messages are transmitted in this
state.</p>

<p>&middot; Renew - DHCP client is in the RENEWING state -
it has an IP address, and is trying to contact the server to
renew it. The next message to be sent will be a DHCPREQUEST
message, which will be unicast directly to the server.</p>

<p>&middot; Rebind - DHCP client is in the REBINDING state
- it has an IP address, and is trying to contact any server
to renew it. The next message to be sent will be a
DHCPREQUEST, which will be broadcast.</p>

<p>REFERENCE: ACTION EXPRESSIONS log (priority,
data-expr)</p>

<p>Logging statements may be used to send information to
the standard logging channels. A logging statement includes
an optional priority (fatal, error, info, or debug), and a
data expression.</p>

<p>Logging statements take only a single data expression
argument, so if you want to output multiple data values, you
will need to use the concat operator to concatenate
them.</p>

<p>execute (command-path [, data-expr1, ...
data-exprN]);</p>

<p>The execute statement runs an external command. The
first argument is a string literal containing the name or
path of the command to run. The other arguments, if present,
are either string literals or data- expressions which
evaluate to text strings, to be passed as command-line
arguments to the command.</p>

<p>execute is synchronous; the program will block until the
external command being run has finished. Please note that
lengthy program execution (for example, in an &quot;on
commit&quot; in dhcpd.conf) may result in bad performance
and timeouts. Only external applications with very short
execution times are suitable for use.</p>

<p>Passing user-supplied data to an external application
might be dan- gerous. Make sure the external application
checks input buffers for validity. Non-printable ASCII
characters will be converted into dhcpd.conf language octal
escapes (&quot;777&quot;), make sure your external command
handles them as such.</p>

<p>It is possible to use the execute statement in any
context, not only on events. If you put it in a regular
scope in the configuration file you will execute that
command every time a scope is evaluated.</p>

<p>REFERENCE: DYNAMIC DNS UPDATES The DHCP client and
server have the ability to dynamically update the Domain
Name System. Within the configuration files, you can define
how you want the Domain Name System to be updated. These
updates are RFC 2136 compliant so any DNS server supporting
RFC 2136 should be able to accept updates from the DHCP
server.</p>

<p>SECURITY Support for TSIG and DNSSEC is not yet
available. When you set your DNS server up to allow updates
from the DHCP server or client, you may be exposing it to
unauthorized updates. To avoid this, the best you can do
right now is to use IP address-based packet filtering to
prevent unauthorized hosts from submitting update requests.
Obviously, there is currently no way to provide security for
client updates - this will require TSIG or DNSSEC, neither
of which is yet available in the DHCP distribution.</p>

<p>Dynamic DNS (DDNS) updates are performed by using the
dns-update expression. The dns-update expression is a
boolean expression that takes four parameters. If the update
succeeds, the result is true. If it fails, the result is
false. The four parameters that the are the resource record
type (RR), the left hand side of the RR, the right hand side
of the RR and the ttl that should be applied to the record.
The simplest example of the use of the function can be found
in the reference section of the dhcpd.conf file, where
events are described. In this example several statements are
being used to make the arguments to the dns-update.</p>

<p>In the example, the first argument to the first
Bdns-update expression is a data expression that evaluates
to the A RR type. The second argu- ment is constructed by
concatenating the DHCP host-name option with a text string
containing the local domain, in this case &quot;ssd.exam-
ple.net&quot;. The third argument is constructed by
converting the address the client has been assigned from a
32-bit number into an ascii string with each byte separated
by a &quot;.&quot;. The fourth argument, the TTL, spec-
ifies the amount of time remaining in the lease (note that
this isnt really correct, since the DNS server will pass
this TTL out whenever a request comes in, even if that is
only a few seconds before the lease expires).</p>

<p>If the first dns-update statement succeeds, it is
followed up with a second update to install a PTR RR. The
installation of a PTR record is similar to installing an A
RR except that the left hand side of the record is the
leased address, reversed, with &quot;.in-addr.arpa&quot;
concate- nated. The right hand side is the fully qualified
domain name of the client to which the address is being
leased.</p>
