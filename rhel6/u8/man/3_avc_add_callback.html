<p>avc_add_callback(3) SELinux API documentation
avc_add_callback(3)</p>

<p>NAME avc_add_callback - additional event notification
for SELinux userspace object managers.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;selinux/selinux.h&gt;</p>

<p>#include &lt;selinux/avc.h&gt;</p>

<p>int avc_add_callback(int (*callback)(uint32_t event,
security_id_t ssid,</p>

<p>security_id_t tsid,</p>

<p>security_class_t tclass,</p>

<p>access_vector_t perms,</p>

<p>access_vector_t *out_retained), uint32_t events,
security_id_t ssid,</p>

<p>security_id_t tsid, security_class_t tclass,</p>

<p>access_vector_t perms);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION avc_add_callback is used to register
callback functions on security events. The purpose of this
functionality is to allow userspace object managers to take
additional action when a policy change, usually a pol- icy
reload, causes permissions to be granted or revoked.</p>

<p>events is the bitwise-or of security events on which to
register the callback; see SECURITY EVENTS below.</p>

<p>ssid, tsid, tclass, and perms specify the source and
target SIDs, tar- get class, and specific permissions that
the callback wishes to moni- tor. The special symbol
SECSID_WILD may be passed as the source or target and will
cause any SID to match.</p>

<p>callback is the callback function provided by the
userspace object man- ager. The event argument indicates the
security event which occured; the remaining arguments are
interpreted according to the event as described below. The
return value of the callback should be zero on success, -1
on error with errno set appropriately (but see RETURN VALUE
below).</p>

<p>SECURITY EVENTS In all cases below, ssid and/or tsid may
be set to SECSID_WILD, indi- cating that the change applies
to all source and/or target SIDs. Unless otherwise
indicated, the out_retained parameter is unused.</p>

<p>AVC_CALLBACK_GRANT Previously denied permissions are now
granted for ssid, tsid with respect to tclass. perms
indicates the permissions to grant.</p>

<p>AVC_CALLBACK_TRY_REVOKE Previously granted permissions
are now conditionally revoked for ssid, tsid with respect to
tclass. perms indicates the permis- sions to revoke. The
callback should set out_retained to the subset of perms
which are retained as migrated permissions. Note that
out_retained is ignored if the callback returns -1.</p>

<p>AVC_CALLBACK_REVOKE Previously granted permissions are
now unconditionally revoked for ssid, tsid with respect to
tclass. perms indicates the per- missions to revoke.</p>

<p>AVC_CALLBACK_RESET Indicates that the cache was flushed.
The SID, class, and per- mission arguments are unused and
are set to NULL.</p>

<p>AVC_CALLBACK_AUDITALLOW_ENABLE The permissions given by
perms should now be audited when granted for ssid, tsid with
respect to tclass.</p>

<p>AVC_CALLBACK_AUDITALLOW_DISABLE The permissions given by
perms should no longer be audited when granted for ssid,
tsid with respect to tclass.</p>

<p>AVC_CALLBACK_AUDITDENY_ENABLE The permissions given by
perms should now be audited when denied for ssid, tsid with
respect to tclass.</p>

<p>AVC_CALLBACK_AUDITDENY_DISABLE The permissions given by
perms should no longer be audited when denied for ssid, tsid
with respect to tclass.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, avc_add_callback returns zero.
On error, -1 is returned and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>A return value of -1 from a callback is interpreted as a
failed policy operation. If such a return value is
encountered, all remaining call- backs registered on the
event are called. In threaded mode, the netlink handler
thread may then terminate and cause the userspace AVC to
return EINVAL on all further permission checks until
avc_destroy(3) is called. In non-threaded mode, the
permission check on which the error occurred will return -1
and the value of errno encountered to the caller. In both
cases, a log message is produced and the kernel may be
notified of the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS ENOMEM An attempt to allocate memory failed.</p>

<p>NOTES If the userspace AVC is running in threaded mode,
callbacks registered via avc_add_callback may be executed in
the context of the netlink han- dler thread. This will
likely introduce synchronization issues requir- ing the use
of locks. See avc_init(3).</p>

<p>Support for dynamic revocation and retained permissions
is mostly unim- plemented in the SELinux kernel module. The
only security event that currently gets excercised is
AVC_CALLBACK_RESET.</p>
