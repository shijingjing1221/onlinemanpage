<p>GETCONF(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GETCONF(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getconf - get configuration values</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS getconf [ -v specification ] system_var</p>

<p>getconf [ -v specification ] path_var pathname</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In the first synopsis form, the getconf
utility shall write to the standard output the value of the
variable specified by the system_var operand.</p>

<p>In the second synopsis form, the getconf utility shall
write to the standard output the value of the variable
specified by the path_var operand for the path specified by
the pathname operand.</p>

<p>The value of each configuration variable shall be
determined as if it were obtained by calling the function
from which it is defined to be available by this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 or by the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (see the OPERANDS section). The value
shall reflect conditions in the current operating environ-
ment.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The getconf utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-v specification</p>

<p>Indicate a specific specification and version for which
configu- ration variables shall be determined. If this
option is not specified, the values returned correspond to
an implementation default conforming compilation
environment.</p>

<p>If the command:</p>

<p>getconf _POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFF32</p>

<p>does not write &quot;-n&quot; or &quot;undefinen&quot;
to standard output, then com- mands of the form:</p>

<p>getconf -v POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFF32 ...</p>

<p>determine values for configuration variables
corresponding to the POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFF32 compilation
environment specified in c99, the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>If the command:</p>

<p>getconf _POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG</p>

<p>does not write &quot;-n&quot; or &quot;undefinen&quot;
to standard output, then com- mands of the form:</p>

<p>getconf -v POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG ...</p>

<p>determine values for configuration variables
corresponding to the POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG compilation
environment specified in c99, the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>If the command:</p>

<p>getconf _POSIX_V6_LP64_OFF64</p>

<p>does not write &quot;-n&quot; or &quot;undefinen&quot;
to standard output, then com- mands of the form:</p>

<p>getconf -v POSIX_V6_LP64_OFF64 ...</p>

<p>determine values for configuration variables
corresponding to the POSIX_V6_LP64_OFF64 compilation
environment specified in c99, the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>If the command:</p>

<p>getconf _POSIX_V6_LPBIG_OFFBIG</p>

<p>does not write &quot;-n&quot; or &quot;undefinen&quot;
to standard output, then com- mands of the form:</p>

<p>getconf -v POSIX_V6_LPBIG_OFFBIG ...</p>

<p>determine values for configuration variables
corresponding to the POSIX_V6_LPBIG_OFFBIG compilation
environment specified in c99, the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>path_var A name of a configuration variable. All of the
variables in the Variable column of the table in the
DESCRIPTION of the fpath- conf() function defined in the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, without
the enclosing braces, shall be supported. The implementation
may add other local variables.</p>

<p>pathname A pathname for which the variable specified by
path_var is to be determined.</p>

<p>system_var A name of a configuration variable. All of
the following vari- ables shall be supported:</p>

<p>* The names in the Variable column of the table in the
DESCRIP- TION of the sysconf() function in the System
Interfaces vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, except for the
entries corre- sponding to _SC_CLK_TCK,
_SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX, and _SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX, without the
enclosing braces.</p>

<p>For compatibility with earlier versions, the following
variable names shall also be supported:</p>

<p>POSIX2_C_BIND POSIX2_C_DEV POSIX2_CHAR_TERM
POSIX2_FORT_DEV POSIX2_FORT_RUN POSIX2_LOCALEDEF
POSIX2_SW_DEV POSIX2_UPE POSIX2_VERSION</p>

<p>and shall be equivalent to the same name prefixed with
an under- score. This requirement may be removed in a future
version.</p>

<p>* The names of the symbolic constants used as the name
argument of the confstr() function in the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, without the _CS_ prefix.</p>

<p>* The names of the symbolic constants listed under the
headings Maximum Values and Minimum Values in the
description of the &lt;limits.h&gt; header in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, without the
enclosing braces.</p>

<p>For compatibility with earlier versions, the following
variable names shall also be supported:</p>

<p>POSIX2_BC_BASE_MAX POSIX2_BC_DIM_MAX POSIX2_BC_SCALE_MAX
POSIX2_BC_STRING_MAX POSIX2_COLL_WEIGHTS_MAX
POSIX2_EXPR_NEST_MAX POSIX2_LINE_MAX POSIX2_RE_DUP_MAX</p>

<p>and shall be equivalent to the same name prefixed with
an under- score. This requirement may be removed in a future
version.</p>

<p>The implementation may add other local values.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of get- conf:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If the specified variable is defined on the
system and its value is described to be available from the
confstr() function defined in the System Interfaces volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, its value shall be written in the
following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;value&gt;</p>

<p>Otherwise, if the specified variable is defined on the
system, its value shall be written in the following
format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;value&gt;</p>

<p>If the specified variable is valid, but is undefined on
the system, getconf shall write using the following
format:</p>

<p>&quot;undefinen&quot;</p>

<p>If the variable name is invalid or an error occurs,
nothing shall be written to standard output.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 The specified variable is valid and information about
its cur- rent state was written successfully.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following example illustrates the value of
{NGROUPS_MAX}:</p>

<p>getconf NGROUPS_MAX</p>

<p>The following example illustrates the value of
{NAME_MAX} for a spe- cific directory:</p>

<p>getconf NAME_MAX /usr</p>

<p>The following example shows how to deal more carefully
with results that might be unspecified:</p>

<p>if value=$(getconf PATH_MAX /usr); then if [
&quot;$value&quot; = &quot;undefined&quot; ]; then echo
PATH_MAX in /usr is infinite. else echo PATH_MAX in /usr is
$value. fi else echo Error in getconf. fi</p>

<p>Note that:</p>

<p>sysconf(_SC_POSIX_C_BIND);</p>

<p>and:</p>

<p>system(&quot;getconf POSIX2_C_BIND&quot;);</p>

<p>in a C program could give different answers. The
sysconf() call sup- plies a value that corresponds to the
conditions when the program was either compiled or executed,
depending on the implementation; the sys- tem() call to
getconf always supplies a value corresponding to condi-
tions when the program is executed.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The original need for this utility, and for
the confstr() function, was to provide a way of finding the
configuration-defined default value for the PATH environment
variable. Since PATH can be modified by the user to include
directories that could contain utilities replacing the stan-
dard utilities, shell scripts need a way to determine the
system-sup- plied PATH environment variable value that
contains the correct search path for the standard utilities.
It was later suggested that access to the other variables
described in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 could also
be useful to applications.</p>

<p>This functionality of getconf would not be adequately
subsumed by another command such as:</p>

<p>grep var /etc/conf</p>

<p>because such a strategy would provide correct values for
neither those variables that can vary at runtime, nor those
that can vary depending on the path.</p>

<p>Early proposal versions of getconf specified exit status
1 when the specified variable was valid, but not defined on
the system. The output string &quot;undefined&quot; is now
used to specify this case with exit code 0 because so many
things depend on an exit code of zero when an invoked
utility is successful.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
