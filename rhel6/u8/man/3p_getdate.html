<p>GETDATE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GETDATE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getdate - convert user format date and time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct tm *getdate(const char *string);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getdate() function shall convert a
string representation of a date or time into a broken-down
time.</p>

<p>The external variable or macro getdate_err is used by
getdate() to return error values.</p>

<p>Templates are used to parse and interpret the input
string. The tem- plates are contained in a text file
identified by the environment vari- able DATEMSK. The
DATEMSK variable should be set to indicate the full pathname
of the file that contains the templates. The first line in
the template that matches the input specification is used
for interpreta- tion and conversion into the internal time
format.</p>

<p>The following conversion specifications shall be
supported:</p>

<p>%% Equivalent to % .</p>

<p>%a Abbreviated weekday name.</p>

<p>%A Full weekday name.</p>

<p>%b Abbreviated month name.</p>

<p>%B Full month name.</p>

<p>%c Locales appropriate date and time representation.</p>

<p>%C Century number [00,99]; leading zeros are permitted
but not required.</p>

<p>%d Day of month [01,31]; the leading 0 is optional.</p>

<p>%D Date as %m / %d / %y .</p>

<p>%e Equivalent to %d .</p>

<p>%h Abbreviated month name.</p>

<p>%H Hour [00,23].</p>

<p>%I Hour [01,12].</p>

<p>%m Month number [01,12].</p>

<p>%M Minute [00,59].</p>

<p>%n Equivalent to &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>%p Locales equivalent of either AM or PM.</p>

<p>%r The locales appropriate representation of time in AM
and PM notation. In the POSIX locale, this shall be
equivalent to %I : %M : %S %p .</p>

<p>%R Time as %H : %M .</p>

<p>%S Seconds [00,60]. The range goes to 60 (rather than
stopping at 59) to allow positive leap seconds to be
expressed. Since leap seconds cannot be predicted by any
algorithm, leap second data must come from some external
source.</p>

<p>%t Equivalent to &lt;tab&gt;.</p>

<p>%T Time as %H : %M : %S .</p>

<p>%w Weekday number (Sunday = [0,6]).</p>

<p>%x Locales appropriate date representation.</p>

<p>%X Locales appropriate time representation.</p>

<p>%y Year within century. When a century is not otherwise
specified, values in the range [69,99] shall refer to years
1969 to 1999 inclusive, and values in the range [00,68]
shall refer to years 2000 to 2068 inclusive.</p>

<p>Note: It is expected that in a future version of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 the default century inferred from a 2-digit
year will change. (This would apply to all commands
accepting a 2-digit year as input.)</p>

<p>%Y Year as &quot;ccyy&quot; (for example, 2001).</p>

<p>%Z Timezone name or no characters if no timezone exists.
If the timezone supplied by %Z is not the timezone that
getdate() expects, an invalid input specification error
shall result. The getdate() function calculates an expected
timezone based on information supplied to the function (such
as the hour, day, and month).</p>

<p>The match between the template and input specification
performed by getdate() shall be case-insensitive.</p>

<p>The month and weekday names can consist of any
combination of upper and lowercase letters. The process can
request that the input date or time specification be in a
specific language by setting the LC_TIME category (see
setlocale()).</p>

<p>Leading zeros are not necessary for the descriptors that
allow leading zeros. However, at most two digits are allowed
for those descriptors, including leading zeros. Extra
whitespace in either the template file or in string shall be
ignored.</p>

<p>The results are undefined if the conversion
specifications %c, %x, and %X include unsupported conversion
specifications.</p>

<p>The following rules apply for converting the input
specification into the internal format:</p>

<p>* If %Z is being scanned, then getdate() shall
initialize the broken- down time to be the current time in
the scanned timezone. Otherwise, it shall initialize the
broken-down time based on the current local time as if
localtime() had been called.</p>

<p>* If only the weekday is given, the day chosen shall be
the day, starting with today and moving into the future,
which first matches the named day.</p>

<p>* If only the month (and no year) is given, the month
chosen shall be the month, starting with the current month
and moving into the future, which first matches the named
month. The first day of the month shall be assumed if no day
is given.</p>

<p>* If no hour, minute, and second are given, the current
hour, minute, and second shall be assumed.</p>

<p>* If no date is given, the hour chosen shall be the
hour, starting with the current hour and moving into the
future, which first matches the named hour.</p>

<p>If a conversion specification in the DATEMSK file does
not correspond to one of the conversion specifications
above, the behavior is unspeci- fied.</p>

<p>The getdate() function need not be reentrant. A function
that is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, getdate() shall
return a pointer to a struct tm. Otherwise, it shall return
a null pointer and set get- date_err to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The getdate() function shall fail in the
following cases, setting get- date_err to the value shown in
the list below. Any changes to errno are unspecified.</p>

<p>1. The DATEMSK environment variable is null or
undefined.</p>

<p>2. The template file cannot be opened for reading.</p>

<p>3. Failed to get file status information.</p>

<p>4. The template file is not a regular file.</p>

<p>5. An I/O error is encountered while reading the
template file.</p>

<p>6. Memory allocation failed (not enough memory
available).</p>

<p>7. There is no line in the template that matches the
input.</p>

<p>8. Invalid input specification. For example, February
31; or a time is specified that cannot be represented in a
time_t (representing the time in seconds since the
Epoch).</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. The following example shows the possible
contents of a template:</p>

<p>%m %A %B %d, %Y, %H:%M:%S %A %B %m/%d/%y %I %p %d,%m,%Y
%H:%M at %A the %dst of %B in %Y run job at %I %p,%B %dnd %A
den %d. %B %Y %H.%M Uhr</p>

<p>2. The following are examples of valid input
specifications for the template in Example 1:</p>

<p>getdate(&quot;10/1/87 4 PM&quot;);
getdate(&quot;Friday&quot;); getdate(&quot;Friday September
18, 1987, 10:30:30&quot;); getdate(&quot;24,9,1986
10:30&quot;); getdate(&quot;at monday the 1st of december in
1986&quot;); getdate(&quot;run job at 3 PM, december
2nd&quot;);</p>

<p>If the LC_TIME category is set to a German locale that
includes freitag as a weekday name and oktober as a month
name, the following would be valid:</p>

<p>getdate(&quot;freitag den 10. oktober 1986 10.30
Uhr&quot;);</p>

<p>3. The following example shows how local date and time
specification can be defined in the template:</p>

<p>Invocation Line in Template
getdate(&quot;11/27/86&quot;) %m/%d/%y
getdate(&quot;27.11.86&quot;) %d.%m.%y
getdate(&quot;86-11-27&quot;) %y-%m-%d getdate(&quot;Friday
12:00:00&quot;) %A %H:%M:%S</p>

<p>4. The following examples help to illustrate the above
rules assuming that the current date is Mon Sep 22 12:19:47
EDT 1986 and the LC_TIME category is set to the default C
locale:</p>

<p>Input Line in Template Date Mon %a Mon Sep 22 12:19:47
EDT 1986 Sun %a Sun Sep 28 12:19:47 EDT 1986 Fri %a Fri Sep
26 12:19:47 EDT 1986 September %B Mon Sep 1 12:19:47 EDT
1986 January %B Thu Jan 1 12:19:47 EST 1987 December %B Mon
Dec 1 12:19:47 EST 1986 Sep Mon %b %a Mon Sep 1 12:19:47 EDT
1986 Jan Fri %b %a Fri Jan 2 12:19:47 EST 1987 Dec Mon %b %a
Mon Dec 1 12:19:47 EST 1986 Jan Wed 1989 %b %a %Y Wed Jan 4
12:19:47 EST 1989 Fri 9 %a %H Fri Sep 26 09:00:00 EDT
1986</p>

<p>Feb 10:30 %b %H:%S Sun Feb 1 10:00:30 EST 1987 10:30
%H:%M Tue Sep 23 10:30:00 EDT 1986 13:30 %H:%M Mon Sep 22
13:30:00 EDT 1986</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Although historical versions of
getdate() did not require that &lt;time.h&gt; declare the
external variable getdate_err, this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 does require it. The standard developers
encourage applications to remove declarations of getdate_err
and instead incorpo- rate the declaration by including
&lt;time.h&gt;.</p>

<p>Applications should use %Y (4-digit years) in preference
to %y (2-digit years).</p>

<p>RATIONALE In standard locales, the conversion
specifications %c, %x, and %X do not include unsupported
conversion specifiers and so the text regarding results
being undefined is not a problem in that case.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

1003.1-2001, &lt;time.h&gt;</p>
