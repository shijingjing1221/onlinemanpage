<p>NAME i2cdetect - detect I2C chips</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS i2cdetect [-y] [-a] [-q|-r] i2cbus [first last]
i2cdetect -F i2cbus i2cdetect -V i2cdetect -l</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION i2cdetect is a userspace program to scan an
I2C bus for devices. It outputs a table with the list of
detected devices on the specified bus. i2cbus indicates the
number or name of the I2C bus to be scanned, and should
correspond to one of the busses listed by i2cdetect -l. The
optional parameters first and last restrict the scanning
range (default: from 0x03 to 0x77).</p>

<p>i2cdetect can also be used to query the functionalities
of an I2C bus (see option -F.)</p>

<p>WARNING This program can confuse your I2C bus, cause
data loss and worse!</p>

<p>INTERPRETING THE OUTPUT Each cell in the output table
will contain one of the following sym- bols:</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;--&quot;. The address was probed but no
chip answered.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;UU&quot;. Probing was skipped, because
this address is currently in use by a driver. This strongly
suggests that there is a chip at this address.</p>

<p>&middot; An address number in hexadecimal, e.g.
&quot;2d&quot; or &quot;4e&quot;. A chip was found at this
address.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -y Disable interactive mode. By default,
i2cdetect will wait for a confirmation from the user before
messing with the I2C bus. When this flag is used, it will
perform the operation directly. This is mainly meant to be
used in scripts.</p>

<p>-a Force scanning of non-regular addresses. Not
recommended.</p>

<p>-q Use SMBus &quot;quick write&quot; commands for
probing (by default, the command used is the one believed to
be the safest for each address). Not recommended. This is
known to corrupt the Atmel AT24RF08 EEPROM found on many IBM
Thinkpad laptops.</p>

<p>-r Use SMBus &quot;read byte&quot; commands for probing
(by default, the com- mand used is the one believed to be
the safest for each address). Not recommended. This is known
to lock SMBus on vari- ous write-only chips (most notably
clock chips at address 0x69).</p>

<p>-F Display the list of functionalities implemented by
the adapter and exit.</p>

<p>-V Display the version and exit.</p>

<p>-l Output a list of installed busses.</p>
