<p>NAME XmForm The Form widget class</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Form.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Form is a container widget with no input
semantics of its own. Con- straints are placed on children
of the Form to define attachments for each of the childs
four sides. These attachments can be to the Form, to another
child widget or gadget, to a relative position within the
Form, or to the initial position of the child. The
attachments deter- mine the layout behavior of the Form when
resizing occurs.</p>

<p>The default value for XmNinitialFocus is the value of
XmNdefaultButton.</p>

<p>Following are some important considerations in using a
Form:</p>

<p>&middot; Every child must have an attachment on either
the left or the right. If initialization or XtSetValues
leaves a widget without such an attachment, the result
depends upon the value of XmNrub- berPositioning.</p>

<p>If XmNrubberPositioning is False, the child is given an
XmN- leftAttachment of XmATTACH_FORM and an XmNleftOffset
equal to its current x value.</p>

<p>If XmNrubberPositioning is True, the child is given an
XmN- leftAttachment of XmATTACH_POSITION and an
XmNleftPosition proportional to the current x value divided
by the width of the Form.</p>

<p>In either case, if the child has not been previously
given an x value, its x value is taken to be 0 (zero), which
places the child at the left side of the Form.</p>

<p>&middot; If you want to create a child without any
attachments, and then later (for example, after creating and
managing it, but before realizing it) give it a right
attachment through XtSetValues, you must set its
XmNleftAttachment to XmATTACH_NONE at the same time.</p>

<p>&middot; The XmNresizable resource controls only whether
a geometry request by the child will be granted. It has no
effect on whether the childs size can be changed because of
changes in geometry of the Form or of other children.</p>

<p>&middot; Every child has a preferred width, based on
geometry requests it makes (whether they are granted or
not).</p>

<p>&middot; If a child has attachments on both the left and
the right sides, its size is completely controlled by the
Form. It can be shrunk below its preferred width or enlarged
above it, if necessary, due to other constraints. In
addition, the childs geometry requests to change its own
width may be refused.</p>

<p>&middot; If a child has attachments on only its left or
right side, it will always be at its preferred width (if
resizable, otherwise at is current width). This may cause it
to be clipped by the Form or by other children.</p>

<p>&middot; If a child s left (or right) attachment is set
to XmATTACH_SELF, its corresponding left (or right) offset
is forced to 0 (zero). The attachment is then changed to
XmATTACH_POSITION, with a posi- tion that corresponds to the
x value of the childs left (or right) edge. To fix the
position of a side at a specific x value, use XmATTACH_FORM
or XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_FORM with the x value as the left (or
right) offset.</p>

<p>&middot; Unmapping a child has no effect on the Form
except that the child is not mapped.</p>

<p>&middot; Unmanaging a child unmaps it. If no other child
is attached to it, or if all children attached to it and all
children recur- sively attached to them are also all
unmanaged, all of those children are treated as if they did
not exist in determining the size of the Form.</p>

<p>&middot; When using XtSetValues to change the XmNx
resource of a child, you must simultaneously set its left
attachment to either XmAT- TACH_SELF or XmATTACH_NONE.
Otherwise, the request is not granted. If XmNresizable is
False, the request is granted only if the childs size can
remain the same.</p>

<p>&middot; A left (or right) attachment of
XmATTACH_WIDGET, where XmNleft- Widget (or XmNrightWidget)
is NULL, acts like an attachment of XmATTACH_FORM.</p>

<p>&middot; If an attachment is made to a widget that is
not a child of the Form, but an ancestor of the widget is a
child of the Form, the attachment is made to the
ancestor.</p>

<p>All these considerations are true of top and bottom
attachments as well, with top acting like left, bottom
acting like right, y acting like x, and height acting like
width.</p>

<p>Classes Form inherits behavior, resources, and traits
from Core, Composite, Constraint, XmManager, and
XmBulletinBoard.</p>

<p>The class pointer is xmFormWidgetClass.</p>

<p>The class name is XmForm.</p>

<p>New Resources The following table defines a set of
widget resources used by the pro- grammer to specify data.
The programmer can also set the resource val- ues for the
inherited classes to set attributes for this widget. To
reference a resource by name or by class in a .Xdefaults
file, remove the XmN or XmC prefix and use the remaining
letters. To specify one of the defined values for a resource
in a .Xdefaults file, remove the Xm prefix and use the
remaining letters (in either lowercase or uppercase, but
include any underscores between words). The codes in the
access column indicate if the given resource can be set at
creation time (C), set by using XtSetValues (S), retrieved
by using XtGetValues (G), or is not applicable (N/A).</p>

XmNfractionBase Specifies the denominator used in
calculating the relative position of a child widget using
XmATTACH_POSITION constraints. The value must not be 0
(zero).</p>

<p>If the value of a childs XmNleftAttachment (or
XmNrightAt- tachment) is XmATTACH_POSITION, the position of
the left (or right) side of the child is relative to the
left side of the Form and is a fraction of the width of the
Form. This frac- tion is the value of the child s
XmNleftPosition (or XmN- rightPosition) resource divided by
the value of the Forms XmNfractionBase.</p>

<p>If the value of a childs XmNtopAttachment (or
XmNbottomAt- tachment) is XmATTACH_POSITION, the position of
the top (or bottom) side of the child is relative to the top
side of the Form and is a fraction of the height of the
Form. This frac- tion is the value of the child s
XmNtopPosition (or XmNbot- tomPosition) resource divided by
the value of the Forms XmN- fractionBase.</p>

<p>XmNhorizontalSpacing Specifies the offset for right and
left attachments. This resource is only used if no offset
resource is specified (when attaching to a widget), or if no
margin resource is specified (when attaching to the
Form).</p>

<p>XmNrubberPositioning Indicates the default near (left)
and top attachments for a child of the Form. (Note that
whether this resource actually applies to the left or right
side of the child and its attachment depends on the value of
the XmNlayoutDirection.)</p>

<p>The default left attachment is applied whenever
initializa- tion or XtSetValues leaves the child without
either a left or right attachment. The default top
attachment is applied whenever initialization or XtSetValues
leaves the child with- out either a top or bottom
attachment.</p>

<p>If this Boolean resource is set to False,
XmNleftAttachment and XmNtopAttachment default to
XmATTACH_FORM, XmNleftOffset defaults to the current x value
of the left side of the child, and XmNtopOffset defaults to
the current y value of the child. The effect is to position
the child according to its absolute distance from the left
or top side of the Form.</p>

<p>If this resource is set to True, XmNleftAttachment and
XmN- topAttachment default to XmATTACH_POSITION,
XmNleftPosition defaults to a value proportional to the
current x value of the left side of the child divided by the
width of the Form, and XmNtopPosition defaults to a value
proportional to the current y value of the child divided by
the height of the Form. The effect is to position the child
relative to the left or top side of the Form and in
proportion to the width or height of the Form.</p>

<p>XmNverticalSpacing Specifies the offset for top and
bottom attachments. This resource is only used if no offset
resource is specified (when attaching to a widget), or if no
margin resource is specified (when attaching to the
Form).</p>

XmNbottomAttachment Specifies attachment of the bottom side
of the child. It can have the following values:</p>

<p>XmATTACH_NONE Do not attach the bottom side of the
child.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_FORM Attach the bottom side of the child to the
bottom side of the Form.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_FORM Attach the bottom side of the
child to the top side of the Form. XmNbottomOffset can be
used to deter- mine the visibility of the child.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_WIDGET Attach the bottom side of the child to
the top side of the widget or gadget specified in the
XmNbot- tomWidget resource. If XmNbottomWidget is NULL,
XmATTACH_WIDGET is replaced by XmATTACH_FORM, and the child
is attached to the bottom side of the Form.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_WIDGET Attach the bottom side of the
child to the bottom side of the widget or gadget specified
in the XmN- bottomWidget resource.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_POSITION Attach the bottom side of the child to
a position that is relative to the top side of the Form and
in proportion to the height of the Form. This posi- tion is
determined by the XmNbottomPosition and XmNfractionBase
resources.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_SELF Attach the bottom side of the child to a
position that is proportional to the current y value of the
bottom of the child divided by the height of the Form. This
position is determined by the XmNbot- tomPosition and
XmNfractionBase resources. XmNbot- tomPosition is set to a
value proportional to the current y value of the bottom of
the child divided by the height of the Form.</p>

<p>XmNbottomOffset Specifies the constant offset between
the bottom side of the child and the object to which it is
attached. The relation- ship established remains, regardless
of any resizing opera- tions that occur. When this resource
is explicitly set, the value of XmNverticalSpacing is
ignored.</p>

<p>XmNbottomPosition This resource is used to determine the
position of the bottom side of the child when the child s
XmNbottomAttachment is set to XmATTACH_POSITION. In this
case the position of the bot- tom side of the child is
relative to the top side of the Form and is a fraction of
the height of the Form. This fraction is the value of the
child s XmNbottomPosition resource divided by the value of
the Form s XmNfractionBase. For example, if the childs
XmNbottomPosition is 50, the Forms XmNfractionBase is 100,
and the Forms height is 200, the position of the bottom side
of the child is 100.</p>

<p>XmNbottomWidget Specifies the widget or gadget to which
the bottom side of the child is attached. This resource is
used if the XmNbot- tomAttachment resource is set to either
XmATTACH_WIDGET or XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_WIDGET.</p>

<p>A string-to-widget resource converter is automatically
installed for use with this resource. With this converter,
the widget that is to be the value of the resource must
exist at the time the widget that has the resource is
created.</p>

<p>XmNleftAttachment Specifies attachment of the near
(left) side of the child. (Note that whether this resource
actually applies to the left or right side of the child and
its attachment depends on the value of the
XmNlayoutDirection resource.) It can have the following
values:</p>

<p>XmATTACH_NONE Do not attach the left side of the child.
If XmN- rightAttachment is also XmATTACH_NONE, this value is
ignored and the child is given a default left
attachment.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_FORM Attach the left side of the child to the
left side of the Form.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_FORM Attach the left side of the child
to the right side of the Form. XmNleftOffset can be used to
deter- mine the visibility of the child.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_WIDGET Attach the left side of the child to the
right side of the widget or gadget specified in the XmNleft-
Widget resource. If XmNleftWidget is NULL, XmAT- TACH_WIDGET
is replaced by XmATTACH_FORM, and the child is attached to
the left side of the Form.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_WIDGET Attach the left side of the
child to the left side of the widget or gadget specified in
the XmNleftWidget resource.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_POSITION Attach the left side of the child to a
position that is relative to the left side of the Form and
in proportion to the width of the Form. This posi- tion is
determined by the XmNleftPosition and XmN- fractionBase
resources.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_SELF Attach the left side of the child to a
position that is proportional to the current x value of the
left side of the child divided by the width of the Form.
This position is determined by the XmNleft- Position and
XmNfractionBase resources. XmNleftPo- sition is set to a
value proportional to the cur- rent x value of the left side
of the child divided by the width of the Form.</p>

<p>XmNleftOffset Specifies the constant offset between the
near (left) side of the child and the object to which it is
attached. (Note that whether this resource actually applies
to the left or right side of the child and its attachment
depends on the value of the XmNlayoutDirection resource.)
The relationship estab- lished remains, regardless of any
resizing operations that occur. When this resource is
explicitly set, the value of XmNhorizontalSpacing is
ignored.</p>

<p>XmNleftPosition This resource is used to determine the
position of the near (left) side of the child when the
childs XmNleftAttachment is set to XmATTACH_POSITION. (Note
that whether this resource actually applies to the left or
right side of the child and its attachment depends on the
value of the XmNlay- outDirection resource.)</p>

<p>In this case, the position of the left side of the child
is relative to the left side of the Form and is a fraction
of the width of the Form. This fraction is the value of the
childs XmNleftPosition resource divided by the value of the
Form s XmNfractionBase. For example, if the childs XmNleft-
Position is 50, the Form s XmNfractionBase is 100, and the
Forms width is 200, the position of the left side of the
child is 100.</p>

<p>XmNleftWidget Specifies the widget or gadget to which
the near (left) side of the child is attached. (Note that
whether this resource actually applies to the left or right
side of the child and its attachment depends on the value of
the XmNlayoutDirection resource.) The XmNleftWidget resource
is used if the XmNlef- tAttachment resource is set to either
XmATTACH_WIDGET or XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_WIDGET.</p>

<p>A string-to-widget resource converter is automatically
installed for use with this resource. With this converter,
the widget that is to be the value of the resource must
exist at the time the widget that has the resource is
created.</p>

<p>XmNresizable This Boolean resource specifies whether or
not a childs request for a new size is (conditionally)
granted by the Form. If this resource is set to True the
request is granted if possible. If this resource is set to
False the request is always refused.</p>

<p>If a child has both left and right attachments, its
width is completely controlled by the Form, regardless of
the value of the childs XmNresizable resource. If a child
has a left or right attachment but not both, the child s
XmNwidth is used in setting its width if the value of the
child s XmNresizable resource is True. These conditions are
also true for top and bottom attachments, with height acting
like width.</p>

<p>XmNrightAttachment Specifies attachment of the far
(right) side of the child. (Note that whether this resource
actually applies to the left or right side of the child and
its attachment depends on the value of the
XmNlayoutDirection resource.) It can have the following
values:</p>

<p>XmATTACH_NONE Do not attach the right side of the
child.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_FORM Attach the right side of the child to the
right side of the Form.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_FORM Attach the right side of the
child to the left side of the Form. XmNrightOffset can be
used to deter- mine the visibility of the child.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_WIDGET Attach the right side of the child to
the left side of the widget or gadget specified in the XmN-
rightWidget resource. If XmNrightWidget is NULL,
XmATTACH_WIDGET is replaced by XmATTACH_FORM, and the child
is attached to the right side of the Form.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_WIDGET Attach the right side of the
child to the right side of the widget or gadget specified in
the XmNrightWidget resource.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_POSITION Attach the right side of the child to
a position that is relative to the left side of the Form and
in proportion to the width of the Form. This posi- tion is
determined by the XmNrightPosition and XmN- fractionBase
resources.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_SELF Attach the right side of the child to a
position that is proportional to the current x value of the
right side of the child divided by the width of the Form.
This position is determined by the XmNright- Position and
XmNfractionBase resources. XmNright- Position is set to a
value proportional to the cur- rent x value of the right
side of the child divided by the width of the Form.</p>

<p>XmNrightOffset Specifies the constant offset between the
far (right) side of the child and the object to which it is
attached. (Note that whether this resource actually applies
to the left or right side of the child and its attachment
depends on the value of the XmNlayoutDirection resource.)
The relationship estab- lished remains, regardless of any
resizing operations that occur. When this resource is
explicitly set, the value of XmNhorizontalSpacing is
ignored.</p>

<p>XmNrightPosition This resource is used to determine the
position of the far (right) side of the child when the
childs XmNrightAttachment is set to XmATTACH_POSITION. (Note
that whether this resource actually applies to the left or
right side of the child and its attachment depends on the
value of the XmNlay- outDirection resource.)</p>

<p>In this case the position of the right side of the child
is relative to the left side of the Form and is a fraction
of the width of the Form. This fraction is the value of the
childs XmNrightPosition resource divided by the value of the
Form s XmNfractionBase. For example, if the childs XmN-
rightPosition is 50, the Forms XmNfractionBase is 100, and
the Form s width is 200, the position of the right side of
the child is 100.</p>

<p>XmNrightWidget Specifies the widget or gadget to which
the far (right) side of the child is attached. (Note that
whether this resource actually applies to the left or right
side of the child and its attachment depends on the value of
the XmNlayoutDirection resource.) The XmNrightWidget
resource is used if the XmN- rightAttachment resource is set
to either XmATTACH_WIDGET or XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_WIDGET.</p>

<p>A string-to-widget resource converter is automatically
installed for use with this resource. With this converter,
the widget that is to be the value of the resource must
exist at the time the widget that has the resource is
created.</p>

<p>XmNtopAttachment Specifies attachment of the top side of
the child. It can have following values:</p>

<p>XmATTACH_NONE Do not attach the top side of the child.
If the XmNbottomAttachment resource is also XmATTACH_NONE,
this value is ignored and the child is given a default top
attachment.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_FORM Attach the top side of the child to the
top side of the Form.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_FORM Attach the top side of the child
to the bottom side of the Form. XmNtopOffset can be used to
determine the visibility of the child.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_WIDGET Attach the top side of the child to the
bottom side of the widget or gadget specified in the
XmNtopWid- get resource. If XmNtopWidget is NULL, XmAT-
TACH_WIDGET is replaced by XmATTACH_FORM and the child is
attached to the top side of the Form.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_WIDGET Attach the top side of the
child to the top side of the widget or gadget specified in
the XmNtopWidget resource.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_POSITION Attach the top side of the child to a
position that is relative to the top side of the Form and in
pro- portion to the height of the Form. This position is
determined by the XmNtopPosition and XmNfrac- tionBase
resources.</p>

<p>XmATTACH_SELF Attach the top side of the child to a
position that is proportional to the current y value of the
child divided by the height of the Form. This position is
determined by the XmNtopPosition and XmNfrac- tionBase
resources. XmNtopPosition is set to a value proportional to
the current y value of the child divided by the height of
the Form.</p>

<p>XmNtopOffset Specifies the constant offset between the
top side of the child and the object to which it is
attached. The relation- ship established remains, regardless
of any resizing opera- tions that occur. When this resource
is explicitly set, the value of XmNverticalSpacing is
ignored.</p>

<p>XmNtopPosition This resource is used to determine the
position of the top side of the child when the child s
XmNtopAttachment is set to XmATTACH_POSITION. In this case,
the position of the top side of the child is relative to the
top side of the Form and is a fraction of the height of the
Form. This fraction is the value of the childs
XmNtopPosition resource divided by the value of the Forms
XmNfractionBase. For example, if the child s XmNtopPosition
is 50, the Form s XmNfractionBase is 100, and the Form s
height is 200, the position of the top side of the child is
100.</p>

<p>XmNtopWidget Specifies the widget or gadget to which the
top side of the child is attached. This resource is used if
XmNtopAttachment is set to a value of either XmATTACH_WIDGET
or XmATTACH_OPPO- SITE_WIDGET.</p>

<p>A string-to-widget resource converter is automatically
installed for use with this resource. With this converter,
the widget that is to be the value of the resource must
exist at the time the widget that has the resource is
created.</p>
