<p>MQ_NOTIFY(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
MQ_NOTIFY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mq_notify - notify process that a message is
available (REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;mqueue.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mq_notify(mqd_t mqdes, const struct sigevent
*notification);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the argument notification is not NULL,
this function shall register the calling process to be
notified of message arrival at an empty mes- sage queue
associated with the specified message queue descriptor,
mqdes. The notification specified by the notification
argument shall be sent to the process when the message queue
transitions from empty to non-empty. At any time, only one
process may be registered for notifi- cation by a message
queue. If the calling process or any other process has
already registered for notification of message arrival at
the spec- ified message queue, subsequent attempts to
register for that message queue shall fail.</p>

<p>If notification is NULL and the process is currently
registered for notification by the specified message queue,
the existing registration shall be removed.</p>

<p>When the notification is sent to the registered process,
its registra- tion shall be removed. The message queue shall
then be available for registration.</p>

<p>If a process has registered for notification of message
arrival at a message queue and some thread is blocked in
mq_receive() waiting to receive a message when a message
arrives at the queue, the arriving message shall satisfy the
appropriate mq_receive(). The resulting behavior is as if
the message queue remains empty, and no notification shall
be sent.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the mq_notify()
function shall return a value of zero; otherwise, the
function shall return a value of -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The mq_notify() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The mqdes argument is not a valid message queue
descriptor.</p>

<p>EBUSY A process is already registered for notification
by the message queue.</p>
