<p>NAME hunspell - spell checker, stemmer and morphological
analyzer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS hunspell [-1aDGHhLlmnstvw] [--check-url] [-d
dict[,dict2,...]] [--help] [-i enc] [-p dict] [-vv]
[--version] [file(s)]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Hunspell is fashioned after the Ispell
program. The most common usage is &quot;hunspell&quot; or
&quot;hunspell filename&quot;. Without filename parameter,
hun- spell checks the standard input. Typing &quot;cat&quot;
and &quot;exsample&quot; in two input lines, we got an
asterisk (it means &quot;cat&quot; is a correct word) and a
line with corrections:</p>

<p>$ hunspell -d en_US Hunspell 1.2.3 * &amp; exsample 4 0:
example, examples, ex sample, ex-sample</p>

<p>Correct words signed with an *, + or -, unrecognized
words signed with # or &amp; in output lines (see later).
(Close the standard input with Ctrl-d on Unix/Linux and
Ctrl-Z Enter or Ctrl-C on Windows.)</p>

<p>With filename parameters, hunspell will display each
word of the files which does not appear in the dictionary at
the top of the screen and allow you to change it. If there
are &quot;near misses&quot; in the dictionary, then they are
also displayed on following lines. Finally, the line
containing the word and the previous line are printed at the
bottom of the screen. If your terminal can display in
reverse video, the word itself is highlighted. You have the
option of replacing the word com- pletely, or choosing one
of the suggested words. Commands are single characters as
follows (case is ignored):</p>

<p>R Replace the misspelled word completely.</p>

<p>Space Accept the word this time only.</p>

<p>A Accept the word for the rest of this hunspell
session.</p>

<p>I Accept the word, capitalized as it is in the file, and
update private dictionary.</p>

<p>U Accept the word, and add an uncapitalized (actually,
all lower-case) version to the private dictionary.</p>

<p>S Ask a stem and a model word and store them in the
private dictionary. The stem will be accepted also with the
affixes of the model word.</p>

<p>0-n Replace with one of the suggested words.</p>

<p>X Write the rest of this file, ignoring misspellings,
and start next file.</p>

<p>Q Exit immediately and leave the file unchanged.</p>

<p>^Z Suspend hunspell.</p>

<p>? Give help screen.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -1 Check only first field in lines (delimiter =
tabulator).</p>

<p>-a The -a option is intended to be used from other
programs through a pipe. In this mode, hunspell prints a
one-line version iden- tification message, and then begins
reading lines of input. For each input line, a single line
is written to the standard output for each word checked for
spelling on the line. If the word was found in the main
dictionary, or your personal dictionary, then the line
contains only a *. If the word was found through affix
removal, then the line contains a + , a space, and the root
word. If the word was found through compound formation
(concatenation of two words, then the line contains only a
-.</p>

<p>If the word is not in the dictionary, but there are near
misses, then the line contains an &amp; , a space, the
misspelled word, a space, the number of near misses, the
number of characters between the beginning of the line and
the beginning of the mis- spelled word, a colon, another
space, and a list of the near misses separated by commas and
spaces.</p>

<p>Also, each near miss or guess is capitalized the same as
the input word unless such capitalization is illegal; in the
latter case each near miss is capitalized correctly
according to the dictionary.</p>

<p>Finally, if the word does not appear in the dictionary,
and there are no near misses, then the line contains a #, a
space, the misspelled word, a space, and the character
offset from the beginning of the line. Each sentence of text
input is termi- nated with an additional blank line,
indicating that hunspell has completed processing the input
line.</p>

<p>These output lines can be summarized as follows:</p>

<p>OK: *</p>

<p>Root: + &lt;root&gt;</p>

<p>Compound: -</p>

<p>Miss: &amp; &lt;original&gt; &lt;count&gt;
&lt;offset&gt;: &lt;miss&gt;, &lt;miss&gt;, ...</p>

<p>None: # &lt;original&gt; &lt;offset&gt;</p>

<p>For example, a dummy dictionary containing the words
&quot;fray&quot;, &quot;Frey&quot;, &quot;fry&quot;, and
&quot;refried&quot; might produce the following response to
the command &quot;echo frqy refries | hunspell -a&quot;: (#)
Hunspell 0.4.1 (beta), 2005-05-26 &amp; frqy 3 0: fray,
Frey, fry &amp; refries 1 5: refried</p>

<p>This mode is also suitable for interactive use when you
want to figure out the spelling of a single word (but this
is the default behavior of hunspell without -a, too).</p>

<p>When in the -a mode, hunspell will also accept lines of
single words prefixed with any of *, &amp;, @, +, -, ~, #, !
, % , , or ^. A line starting with * tells hunspell to
insert the word into the user s dictionary (similar to the I
command). A line starting with &amp; tells hunspell to
insert an all-lowercase version of the word into the user s
dictionary (similar to the U command). A line starting with
@ causes hunspell to accept this word in the future (similar
to the A command). A line starting with + , followed
immediately by tex or nroff will cause hunspell to parse
future input according the syntax of that formatter. A line
consisting solely of a + will place hunspell in TeX/LaTeX
mode (similar to the -t option) and - returns hunspell to
nroff/troff mode (but these commands are obsolete). However,
the string character type is not changed; the ~ command must
be used to do this. A line start- ing with ~ causes hunspell
to set internal parameters (in par- ticular, the default
string character type) based on the file- name given in the
rest of the line. (A file suffix is suffi- cient, but the
period must be included. Instead of a file name or suffix, a
unique name, as listed in the language affix file, may be
specified.) However, the formatter parsing is not changed;
the + command must be used to change the formatter. A line
prefixed with # will cause the personal dictionary to be
saved. A line prefixed with ! will turn on terse mode (see
below), and a line prefixed with % will return hunspell to
normal (non-terse) mode. A line prefixed with will turn on
verbose-correction mode (see below); this mode can only be
dis- abled by turning on terse mode with %.</p>

<p>Any input following the prefix characters +, - , #, !, %
, or is ignored, as is any input following the filename on a
~ line. To allow spell-checking of lines beginning with
these characters, a line starting with ^ has that character
removed before it is passed to the spell-checking code. It
is recommended that programmatic interfaces prefix every
data line with an uparrow to protect themselves against
future changes in hunspell.</p>

<p>To summarize these:</p>

<p>* Add to personal dictionary</p>

<p>@ Accept word, but leave out of dictionary</p>

<p># Save current personal dictionary</p>

<p>~ Set parameters based on filename</p>

<p>+ Enter TeX mode</p>

<p>- Exit TeX mode</p>

<p>! Enter terse mode</p>

<p>% Exit terse mode</p>

<p>Enter verbose-correction mode</p>

<p>^ Spell-check rest of line</p>

<p>In terse mode, hunspell will not print lines beginning
with *, +, or -, all of which indicate correct words. This
signifi- cantly improves running speed when the driving
program is going to ignore correct words anyway.</p>

<p>In verbose-correction mode, hunspell includes the
original word immediately after the indicator character in
output lines begin- ning with *, + , and - , which
simplifies interaction for some programs.</p>

<p>--check-url Check URLs, e-mail addresses and directory
paths.</p>

<p>-D Show detected path of the loaded dictionary, and list
of the search path and the available dictionaries.</p>

<p>-d dict,dict2,... Set dictionaries by their base names
with or without paths. Example of the syntax:</p>

<p>-d en_US,en_geo,en_med,de_DE,de_med</p>

<p>en_US and de_DE are base dictionaries, they consist of
aff and dic file pairs: en_US.aff, en_US.dic and de_DE.aff,
de_DE.dic. En_geo, en_med, de_med are special dictionaries:
dictionaries without affix file. Spe- cial dictionaries are
optional extension of the base dictionaries usu- ally with
special (medical, law etc.) terms. There is no naming con-
vention for special dictionaries, only the &quot;.dic&quot;
extension: dictionar- ies without affix file will be an
extension of the preceding base dic- tionary (right order of
the parameter list needs for good suggestions). First item
of -d parameter list must be a base dictionary.</p>

<p>-G Print only correct words or lines.</p>

<p>-H The input file is in SGML/HTML format.</p>

<p>-h, --help Short help.</p>

<p>-i enc Set input encoding.</p>

<p>-L Print lines with misspelled words.</p>

<p>-l The &quot;list&quot; option is used to produce a list
of misspelled words from the standard input.</p>

<p>-m Analyze the words of the input text (see also
hunspell(4) about morphological analysis). Without
dictionary morphological data, signs the flags of the
affixes of the word forms for dictionary developers.</p>

<p>-n The input file is in nroff/troff format.</p>

<p>-P password Set password for encrypted dictionaries.</p>

<p>-p dict Set path of personal dictionary. The default
dictionary depends on the locale settings. The following
environment variables are searched: LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, and
LANG. If none are set then the default personal dictionary
is $HOME/.hunspell_default.</p>

<p>Setting -d or the DICTIONARY environmental variable,
personal dictionary will be $HOME/.hunspell_dicname</p>

<p>-s Stem the words of the input text (see also
hunspell(4) about stemming). It depends from the dictionary
data.</p>

<p>-t The input file is in TeX or LaTeX format.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print version number.</p>

<p>-vv Print ispell(1) compatible version number.</p>

<p>-w Print misspelled words (= lines) from one word/line
input.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES hunspell -d en_US english.html</p>

<p>hunspell -d en_US,en_US_med medical.txt</p>

<p>hunspell -d ~/openoffice.org2.4/share/dict/ooo/de_DE</p>

<p>hunspell *.html</p>

<p>hunspell -l text.html</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DICTIONARY Similar to -d.</p>

<p>DICPATH Dictionary path.</p>

<p>WORDLIST Equivalent to -p.</p>

<p>FILES The default dictionary depends on the locale
settings. The following environment variables are searched:
LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, and LANG. If none are set then the
following fallbacks are used:</p>

<p>/usr/share/myspell/default.aff Path of default affix
file. See hun- spell(4).</p>

<p>/usr/share/myspell/default.dic Path of default
dictionary file. See hunspell(4).</p>

<p>$HOME/.hunspell_default. Default path to personal
dictionary.</p>
