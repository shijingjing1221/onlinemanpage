<p>getty_selinux(8) SELinux Policy getty
getty_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME getty_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the getty processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the getty
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The getty processes execute with the getty_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep getty_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The getty_t SELinux type can be entered via
the getty_exec_t file type.</p>

<p>The default entrypoint paths for the getty_t domain are
the following:</p>

<p>/sbin/.*getty</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux getty policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their getty pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for getty:</p>

<p>getty_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a getty_t can be used to make
the process type getty_t permissive. SELinux does not deny
access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux
denials) messages are still gener- ated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. getty policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run getty with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow all daemons the ability to
read/write terminals, you must turn on the
allow_daemons_use_tty boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_daemons_use_tty 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to use other domains
file descriptors, you must turn on the allow_domain_fd_use
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_domain_fd_use 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all
processes, you must turn on the allow_ptrace boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ptrace 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load
modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to execute in
fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fips_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable reading of urandom for all
domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P global_ssp 1</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type getty_t can
manage files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>getty_lock_t</p>

<p>getty_log_t</p>

<p>/var/log/mgetty.log.* /var/log/vgetty.log..*</p>

<p>getty_tmp_t</p>

<p>getty_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/spool/fax(/.*)? /var/spool/voice(/.*)?
/var/run/mgetty.pid.*</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>initrc_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/utmp /var/run/random-seed /var/run/runlevel.dir
/var/run/setmixer_flag</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/rhev /misc</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /tmp-inst /var/tmp-inst
/var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/.* /var/run /var/spool/postfix/pid</p>

<p>wtmp_t</p>

<p>/var/log/wtmp.*</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux getty policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their getty processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>STANDARD FILE CONTEXT</p>

<p>SELinux defines the file context types for the getty, if
you wanted to store files with these types in a diffent
paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify
alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels
on disk.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t getty_var_run_t
/srv/mygetty_content(/.*)? restorecon -R -v
/srv/mygetty_content</p>

<p>Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify
labels that match multiple files.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for getty:</p>

<p>getty_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the getty_etc_t type, if you want to
store getty files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>getty_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the getty_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the getty_t domain.</p>

<p>getty_lock_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the getty_lock_t type, if you want to
treat the files as getty lock data, stored under the
/var/lock directory</p>

<p>getty_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the getty_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as getty log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/log/mgetty.log.*, /var/log/vgetty.log..*</p>

<p>getty_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the getty_tmp_t type, if you want to
store getty tem- porary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>getty_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the getty_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the getty files under the /run or /var/run
directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/spool/fax(/.*)?, /var/spool/voice(/.*)?,
/var/run/mgetty.pid.*</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
