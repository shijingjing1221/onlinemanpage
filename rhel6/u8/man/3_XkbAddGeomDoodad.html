<p>XkbAddGeomDoodad(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbAddGeomDoodad(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbAddGeomDoodad - Add one doodad to a section of a
keyboard geometry or to the top-level geometry</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS XkbDoodadPtr XkbAddGeomDoodad (XkbGeometryPtr
geom, XkbSectionPtr sec- tion, Atom name);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - geom geometry to which the doodad is
added</p>

<p>- section section, if any, to which the doodad is
added</p>

<p>- name name of the new doodad</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkb provides functions to add a single new
element to the top-level keyboard geometry. In each case the
num_ * fields of the corresponding structure is incremented
by 1. These functions do not change sz_* unless there is no
more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the
values of the element s structure from the arguments. For
other functions, you must explicitly write code to fill the
structures ele- ments.</p>

<p>The top-level geometry description includes a list of
geometry proper- ties. A geometry property associates an
arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary name. Programs
that display images of keyboards can use geometry properties
as hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other
geometry structures refer to geometry properties.</p>

<p>A doodad describes some visible aspect of the keyboard
that is not a key and is not a section. XkbAddGeomDoodad
adds a doodad with name specified by name to the geometry
geom if section is NULL or to the section of the geometry
specified by section if section is not NULL.
XkbAddGeomDoodad returns NULL if any of the parameters is
empty or if it was not able to allocate space for the
doodad. If there is already a doodad with the name name in
the doodad array for the geometry (if sec- tion is NULL) or
the section (if section is non-NULL), a pointer to that
doodad is returned. To allocate space for an arbitrary
number of doodads to a section, use the
XkbAllocGeomSectionDoodads function. To allocate space for
an arbitrary number of doodads to a keyboard geome- try, use
the XkbAllocGeomDoodads function.</p>
