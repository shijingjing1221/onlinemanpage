<p>FFTW-WISDOM-TO-CONF(1) fftw FFTW-WISDOM-TO-CONF(1)</p>

<p>NAME fftw-wisdom-to-conf - generate FFTW wisdom
(pre-planned transforms)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fftw-wisdom-to-conf [&lt; INPUT] [&gt;
OUTPUT]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fftw-wisdom-to-conf is a utility to generate
C configuration routines from FFTW wisdom files, where the
latter contain saved information about how to optimally
compute (Fourier) transforms of various sizes. A
configuration routine is a C subroutine that you link into
your pro- gram, replacing a routine of the same name in the
FFTW library, that determines which parts of FFTW are
callable by your program.</p>

<p>The reason to do this is that, if you only need
transforms of a limited set of sizes and types, and if you
are statically linking your program, then using a
configuration file generated from wisdom for those types can
substantially reduce the size of your executable.
(Otherwise, because of FFTW s dynamic nature, all of FFTWs
transform code must be linked into any program using
FFTW.)</p>

<p>FFTW is a free library to compute discrete Fourier
transforms in one or more dimensions, for arbitrary sizes,
and of both real and complex data, among other related
operations. More information on FFTW can be found at the
FFTW home page: http://www.fftw.org</p>

<p>fftw-wisdom-to-conf reads wisdom from standard input and
writes the configuration to standard output. It can easily
be combined with the fftw-wisdom tool, for example:</p>

<p>fftw-wisdom -n cof1024 cob1024 -o wisdom
fftw-wisdom-to-conf &lt; wisdom &gt; conf.c</p>

<p>will create a configuration &quot;conf.c&quot;
containing only those parts of FFTW needed for the optimized
complex forwards and backwards out-of- place transforms of
size 1024 (also saving the wisdom itself in &quot;wis-
dom&quot;).</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can run your actual program, export
wisdom for all plans that were created (ideally in
FFTW_PATIENT or FFTW_EXHAUSTIVE mode), use this as input for
fftw-wisdom-to-conf, and then re-link your program with the
resulting configuration routine.</p>

<p>Note that the configuration routine does not contain the
wisdom, only the routines necessary to implement the wisdom,
so your program should also import the wisdom in order to
benefit from the pre-optimized plans.</p>
