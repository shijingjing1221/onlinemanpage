<p>NAME Tk_ImageChanged - notify widgets that image needs
to be redrawn</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_ImageChanged(imageMaster, x, y, width, height,

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_ImageMaster imageMaster (in) Token for
image, which was passed to images createProc when the image
was created.</p>

<p>int x (in) X-coordinate of upper-left corner of region
that needs redisplay (measured from upper-left corner of
image).</p>

<p>int y (in) Y-coordinate of upper-left corner of region
that needs redisplay (measured from upper-left corner of
image).</p>

<p>int width (in) Width of region that needs to be redrawn,
in pixels.</p>

<p>int height (in) Height of region that needs to be

_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION An image manager calls Tk_ImageChanged for
an image whenever anything happens that requires the image
to be redrawn. As a result of calling Tk_ImageChanged, any
widgets using the image are notified so that they can
redisplay themselves appropriately. The imageMaster argument
iden- tifies the image, and x, y, width, and height specify
a rectangular region within the image that needs to be
redrawn. imageWidth and imageHeight specify the images (new)
size.</p>

<p>An image manager should call Tk_ImageChanged during its
createProc to specify the images initial size and to force
redisplay if there are existing instances for the image. If
any of the pixel values in the image should change later on,
Tk_ImageChanged should be called again with x, y, width, and
height values that cover all the pixels that changed. If the
size of the image should change, then Tk_ImageChanged must
be called to indicate the new size, even if no pixels need
to be redisplayed.</p>
