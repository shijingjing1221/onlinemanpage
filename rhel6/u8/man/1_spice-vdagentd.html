<p>NAME spice-vdagentd - Spice guest agent daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS spice-vdagent [OPTIONS]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The spice guest agent for Linux consists of
2 parts, a system wide dae- mon spice-vdagentd and a X11
session agent spice-vdagent of which there is one per X11
session. spice-vdagentd gets started through a Sys-V
initscript or a systemd unit.</p>

<p>FEATURES The spice guest agent adds the following
features to spice Linux guests:</p>

<p>Client mouse mode (no need to grab mouse by client, no
mouse lag)</p>

<p>Automatic adjustment of the X11 session s number of
virtual monitors, and their resolution, to the number of
client windows and their resolu- tion</p>

<p>Support of copy and paste (text and images) between the
active X11 ses- sion and the client, this supports both the
primary selection and the clipboard</p>

<p>Support for transfering files from the client to the
agent</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Print a short description of all command line
options</p>

<p>-d Log debug messages (use twice for extra info)</p>

<p>-s port Set virtio serial port (default:
/dev/virtio-ports/com.red- hat.spice.0)</p>

<p>-u device Set uinput device (default: /dev/uinput)</p>

<p>-x Dont daemonize</p>

<p>-X Disable session info usage, spice-vdagentd needs to
know which spice-vdagent is in the currently active X11
session. spice- vdagentd uses console kit or systemd-logind
(compile time option) for this; The -X option disables this,
if no session info is available only one spice-vdagent is
allowed</p>

<p>FILES The Sys-V initscript or systemd unit parses the
following files:</p>

<p>/etc/sysconfig/spice-vdagentd Default cmdline options
can be passed to spice-vdagentd by set- ting them in the
SPICE_VDAGENTD_EXTRA_ARGS variable in this file</p>
