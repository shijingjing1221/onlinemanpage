<p>NAME pbmto4425 - Display PBM images on an AT&amp;T 4425
terminal</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmto4425 [pbmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pbmto4425 displays PBM format images on an AT&amp;T 4425
ASCII terminal using that terminal s mosaic graphics
character set. The program should also work with other
VT100-like terminals with mosaic graphics character sets
such as the C. Itoh CIT-101, but it has not yet been tested
on terminals other than the 4425.</p>

<p>Pbmto4425 puts the terminal into 132 column mode to
achieve the maxi- mum resolution of the terminal. In this
mode the terminal has a reso- lution of 264 columns by 69
rows. The pixels have an aspect ratio of 1:2.6, therefore an
image should be processed before being displayed in a manner
such as this:</p>

<p>% pamscale -xscale 2.6 pamfile | pamscale -xysize 264 69
| ppmtopgm | pamditherbw | pbmto4425</p>
