<p>NAME dictionary - RADIUS dictionary file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The master RADIUS dictionary file resides in
/etc/raddb/dictionary. It references other dictionary files
located in /usr/local/share/freera- dius/. Each dictionary
file contains a list of RADIUS attributes and values, which
the server uses to map between descriptive names and on-
the-wire data. The names have no meaning outside of the
RADIUS server itself, and are never exchanged between server
and clients.</p>

<p>That is, editing the dictionaries will have NO EFFECT on
anything other than the server that is reading those files.
Adding new attributes to the dictionaries will have NO
EFFECT on RADIUS clients, and will not make RADIUS clients
magically understand those attributes. The dictio- naries
are solely for local administrator convenience, and are
specific to each version of FreeRADIUS.</p>

<p>The dictionaries in /usr/local/share SHOULD NOT be
edited unless you know exactly what you are doing. Changing
them will most likely break your RADIUS deployment.</p>

<p>If you need to add new attributes, please edit the
/etc/raddb/dictio- nary file. Its sole purpose is to contain
site-local defintions that are added by the local
administrator.</p>

<p>FORMAT Every line starting with a hash sign (#) is
treated as comment and ignored.</p>

<p>Each line of the file can contain one of the following
strings</p>

<p>ATTRIBUTE name number type [vendor|options] Define a
RADIUS attribute name to number mapping. The name field can
be any non-space text, but is usually taken from RFC2865,
and other related documents. The number field is also taken
from the relevant documents, for that name. The type field
can be one of string, octets, ipaddr, integer, date, ifid,
ipv6addr, ipv6prefix, or ether abinary. See the RFC s, or
the main dictionary file for a description of the various
types.</p>

<p>The last (optional) field of an attribute definition can
have either a vendor name, or options for that attribute.
When a ven- dor name is given, the attribute is defined to
be a vendor spe- cific attribute. Alternately, the options
may be the a comma-sep- arated list of the following
options:</p>

<p>encrypt=[1-3]</p>

<p>Mark the attribute as being encrypted with one of three
methods. &quot;1&quot; means that the attribute is encrypted
with the method as defined in RFC2865 for the User-Password
attribute. &quot;2&quot; means that the password is
encrypted with the method as defined in RFC2868 for the
Tunnel-Password attribute. &quot;3&quot; means that the
attribute is encrypted as per Ascends definitions for the
Ascend- Send-Secret attribute.</p>

<p>has_tag</p>

<p>Mark the attribute as being permitted to have a tag, as
defined in RFC2868. The purpose of the tag is to allow
grouping of attributes for tunnelled users. See RFC2868 for
more details.</p>

<p>When the server receives an encoded attribute in a
RADIUS packet, it looks up that attribute by number in the
dictionary, and uses the name found there for printing
diagnostic and log messages.</p>

<p>VALUE attribute-name value-name number Define an
attribute value name to number mapping, for an attribute of
type integer. The attribute-name field MUST be previously
defined by an ATTRIBUTE entry. The value-name field can be
any non-space text, but is usually taken from RFC2865, or
other docu- ments.. The number field is also taken from the
relevant docu- ments, for that name.</p>

<p>When the server receives an encoded value in a RADIUS
packet, it looks up the value of that attribute by number in
the dictionary, and uses the name found there for printing
diagnostic and log mes- sages.</p>

<p>VENDOR vendor-name number [format=t,l] Define a Vendor
Specific Attribute encapsulation for vendor-name to number.
For a list of vendor names and numbers, see
http://www.iana.org/enterprise-numbers.txt.</p>

<p>The &quot;format=t,l&quot; statement tells the server
how many octets to use to encode/decode the vendor
&quot;type&quot; and &quot;length&quot; fields in the
attributes. The default is &quot;format=1,1&quot;, which
does not have to be specified. For USR VSAs, the format is
&quot;format=4,0&quot;, for Lucent VSAs its &quot;for-
mat=2,1&quot;, and for Starent VSAs its
&quot;format=2,2&quot;.</p>

<p>The supported values for the number of type octets (i.e.
the first digit) are 1, 2, and 4. The support values for the
number of length octets (i.e. the second digit) are 0, 1,
and 2. Any combination of those values will work.</p>

<p>$INCLUDE filename Include dictionary entries from the
file filename. The filename is taken as relative to the
location of the file which is asking for the inclusion.</p>
