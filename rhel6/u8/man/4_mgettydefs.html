<p>NAME mgettydefs - speed and terminal settings used by
mgetty</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The /etc/gettydefs file contains information
used by mgetty(1) to set up the speed and terminal settings
for a line. It also supplies infor- mation on what the login
prompt should look like.</p>

<p>Many versions of UNIX have a version of getty(1) that
also reads /etc/gettydefs. Both mgetty and getty expect
similar formats in /etc/gettydefs except that, when used by
mgetty, extended functionality is available. Even so, the
additional functions are simply ignored by standard getty,
so they can co-exist using the same file. Note, how- ever,
that mgetty can be compiled to use a file different from
/etc/gettydefs if your getty gets upset about the
extensions. This manual page documents /etc/gettydefs and
describes the extended func- tionality available when used
by mgetty(1). This document will refer to getty(1) except
where mgettys behaviour is different.</p>

<p>Each entry in /etc/gettydefs has the following
format:</p>

<p>label# initial-flags # final-flags # login-prompt
#next-label</p>

<p>Each entry is followed by a blank line. The login prompt
field can contain quoted characters which will be converted
to other values. The sequences and their substitutions
are:</p>

<p>n newline</p>

<p>r carriage return</p>

<p>g beep</p>

<p>b b a c k s p a c e</p>

<p>vertical tab (VT)</p>

<p>f formfeed</p>

<p>t tab</p>

<p>portname</p>

<p>time in ctime(3) format.</p>

<p>number of users currently logged in</p>

<p>U number of users currently logged in</p>

<p>T time in hh:mm:ss format</p>

<p>I modem CONNECT attributes</p>

<p>equence where &quot;sequence&quot; is a valid strtol
format, such as: nnn (octal), xnnn (hex), or 0n
(decimal).</p>

<p>a n Note that standard getty usually only supports d
0</p>

<p>The various fields are:</p>

<p>label This is the string against which getty tries to
match its second argument. It is often the speed, such as
1200, at which the terminal is supposed to run, but it need
not be (see below).</p>

<p>initial-flags These flags are the initial ioctl(2)
settings to which the terminal is to be set if a terminal
type is not specified to getty. The flags that getty
understands are the ones listed in termio(7)). mgetty is
usually compiled for termios(7) and often has a more
complete set than getty.</p>

<p>Normally only the speed flag is required in the
initial-flags. getty automatically sets the terminal to raw
input mode and takes care of the other flags. If the
&quot;-s&quot; option is used with mgetty(1) the speed
setting is ignored. The initial-flag settings remain in
effect until getty executes login(1).</p>

<p>final-flags These flags take the same values as the
initial-flags and are set just before getty executes login.
The speed flag is again required, except with mgetty if the
-s flag was supplied. Two other commonly specified final-
flags are TAB3, so that tabs are sent to the terminal as
spaces, and HUPCL, so that the line is hung up on the final
close.</p>

<p>login-prompt This entire field is printed as the
login-prompt. Unlike the above fields where white space (a
space, tab or new-line) is ignored, they are included in the
login- prompt field. This field is ignored if the
&quot;-p&quot; option has been specified to mgetty(1).</p>

<p>next-label specifies the label to use if the user user
types a &lt;break&gt; character, or getty detects a
reception error. Getty searches for the entry with
next-label as its label field and set up the terminal for
those settings. Usually, a series of speeds are linked
together in this fashion, into a closed set; for instance,
2400 linked to 1200, which in turn is linked to 300, which
finally is linked to 2400. next-label is ignored with
mgetty(1).</p>

<p>Several additional composite settings are available for
initial-flags and final-flags. The following composite flags
are supported by mgetty and are usually supported by
getty:</p>

<p>SANE equivalent to stty sane. (BRKINT, IGNPAR, ISTRIP,
ICRNL, IXON, OPOST, CS8, CREAD, ISIG, ICANON, ECHO,
ECHOK)</p>

<p>ODDP Odd parity (CS7, PARENB, PARODD)</p>

<p>PARITY,EVENP even parity (CS7, PARENB)</p>

<p>-ODDP,-PARITY,-EVENP no parity (resets PARENB, PARODD,
and sets CS8)</p>

<p>RAW raw I/O (no canonical processing) (turns off OPOST,
ICANON)</p>

<p>-RAW,COOKED enable canonical processing (turns on OPOST,
ICANON)</p>

<p>NL Ignore newlines. (ICRNL, ONLCR)</p>

<p>-NL Respect newlines (turns INLCR, IGNCR, ICRNL, ONLCR,
OCRNL, ONLRET off)</p>

<p>LCASE Ignore case - treat all as lowercase. (IUCLC,
OLCUC, XCASE) Is set if mgetty believes login is entirely
uppercase.</p>

<p>-LCASE Repect case (turns off IUCLC, OLCUC and
XCASE)</p>

<p>TABS output tabs as tabs</p>

<p>-TABS,TAB3 output tabs as spaces</p>

<p>EK Sets VERASE to &quot;#&quot; and VKILL to CKILL
respectively. (note that while many gettys default VERASE to
&quot;#&quot;. mgetty defaults VERASE to backspace.)</p>

<p>Additionally, mgetty (but not getty) can set any of the
control charac- ters listed in the c_cc termio(termios)
structure by the use of two tokens:</p>

<p>&lt;character name&gt; &lt;value&gt;</p>

<p>Eg:</p>

<p>VERASE ^h</p>

<p>The value can be set as ^&lt;character&gt;, 0n or
&lt;character&gt; (normal UNIX escapes).</p>

<p>See the termio(7) or termios(7) manual pages to a list
of which V variables can be changed. Note that many of these
can be changed in the c_cc array, but wont have any
effect.</p>

<p>If getty is called without a second argument, the first
entry of /etc/gettydefs is used by getty, thus making the
first entry of /etc/gettydefs the default entry. It is also
used if getty cannot find the specified label. Mgetty use a
default label of n, but this can be changed in the
configuration. If /etc/gettydefs itself is missing, there is
one entry built into the command which brings up a terminal
at 300 (configuration parameter in mgetty) baud.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended that after making or
modifying /etc/getty- defs, it be run through getty with the
check option to be sure there are no errors.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following two lines show an example of
300/1200 baud toggle, which is useful for dial-up ports:</p>

<p>1200# B1200 HUPCL # B1200 SANE IXANY TAB3 #login: #300
300# B300 HUPCL # B300 SANE IXANY TAB3 #login: #1200</p>

<p>The following line shows a typical 9600 baud entry for a
hard-wired connection (not currently supported for
mgetty):</p>

<p>9600# B9600 # B9600 SANE IXANY IXANY ECHOE TAB3 #login:
#9600</p>

<p>The following line is a typical smart-modem setup,
suitable for mgetty:</p>

<p>19200mg# B19200 # V I B19200 SANE VERASE N 03 HUPCL # T
R 0D T Users @!login: #19200mg</p>

<p>FILES /etc/gettydefs</p>
