<p>unbound-host(1) unbound 1.4.20 unbound-host(1)</p>

<p>NAME unbound-host - unbound DNS lookup utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS unbound-host [-vdhr46] [-c class] [-t type]
hostname [-y key] [-f key- file] [-F namedkeyfile] [-C
configfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Unbound-host uses the unbound validating
resolver to query for the hostname and display results. With
the -v option it displays validation status: secure,
insecure, bogus (security failure).</p>

<p>By default it reads no configuration file whatsoever. It
attempts to reach the internet root servers. With -C an
unbound config file and with -r resolv.conf can be read.</p>

<p>The available options are:</p>

<p>hostname This name is resolved (looked up in the DNS).
If a IPv4 or IPv6 address is given, a reverse lookup is
performed.</p>

<p>-h Show the version and commandline option help.</p>

<p>-v Enable verbose output and it shows validation
results, on every line. Secure means that the NXDOMAIN (no
such domain name), nodata (no such data) or positive data
response validated cor- rectly with one of the keys.
Insecure means that that domain name has no security set up
for it. Bogus (security failure) means that the response
failed one or more checks, it is likely wrong, outdated,
tampered with, or broken.</p>

<p>-d Enable debug output to stderr. One -d shows what the
resolver and validator are doing and may tell you what is
going on. More times, -d -d, gives a lot of output, with
every packet sent and received.</p>

<p>-c class Specify the class to lookup for, the default is
IN the internet class.</p>

<p>-t type Specify the type of data to lookup. The default
looks for IPv4, IPv6 and mail handler data, or domain name
pointers for reverse queries.</p>

<p>-y key Specify a public key to use as trust anchor. This
is the base for a chain of trust that is built up from the
trust anchor to the response, in order to validate the
response message. Can be given as a DS or DNSKEY record. For
example -y &quot;example.com DS 31560 5 1
1CFED84787E6E19CCF9372C1187325972FE546CD&quot;.</p>

<p>-f keyfile Reads keys from a file. Every line has a DS
or DNSKEY record, in the format as for -y. The zone file
format, the same as dig and drill produce.</p>

<p>-F namedkeyfile Reads keys from a BIND-style named.conf
file. Only the trusted-key {}; entries are read.</p>

<p>-C configfile Uses the specified unbound.conf to prime
libunbound(3).</p>

<p>-r Read /etc/resolv.conf, and use the forward DNS
servers from there (those could have been set by DHCP). More
info in resolv.conf(5). Breaks validation if those servers
do not sup- port DNSSEC.</p>

<p>-4 Use solely the IPv4 network for sending packets.</p>

<p>-6 Use solely the IPv6 network for sending packets.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Some examples of use. The keys shown below are
fakes, thus a security failure is encountered.</p>

<p>$ unbound-host www.example.com</p>

<p>$ unbound-host -v -y &quot;example.com DS 31560 5 1
1CFED84787E6E19CCF9372C1187325972FE546CD&quot;
www.example.com</p>

<p>$ unbound-host -v -y &quot;example.com DS 31560 5 1
1CFED84787E6E19CCF9372C1187325972FE546CD&quot;
192.0.2.153</p>

<p>EXIT CODE The unbound-host program exits with status
code 1 on error, 0 on no error. The data may not be
available on exit code 0, exit code 1 means the lookup
encountered a fatal error.</p>
