<p>XSERVER(1) XSERVER(1)</p>

<p>NAME Xserver - X Window System display server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS X [option ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION X is the generic name for the X Window
System display server. It is frequently a link or a copy of
the appropriate server binary for driv- ing the most
frequently used server on a given machine.</p>

<p>STARTING THE SERVER The X server is usually started from
the X Display Manager program xdm(1) or a similar display
manager program. This utility is run from the system boot
files and takes care of keeping the server running,
prompting for usernames and passwords, and starting up the
user ses- sions.</p>

<p>Installations that run more than one window system may
need to use the xinit(1) utility instead of a display
manager. However, xinit is to be considered a tool for
building startup scripts and is not intended for use by end
users. Site administrators are strongly urged to use a dis-
play manager, or build other interfaces for novice
users.</p>

<p>The X server may also be started directly by the user,
though this method is usually reserved for testing and is
not recommended for nor- mal operation. On some platforms,
the user must have special permis- sion to start the X
server, often because access to certain devices (e.g.
/dev/mouse) is restricted.</p>

<p>When the X server starts up, it typically takes over the
display. If you are running on a workstation whose console
is the display, you may not be able to log into the console
while the server is running.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Many X servers have device-specific command line
options. See the man- ual pages for the individual servers
for more details; a list of server-specific manual pages is
provided in the SEE ALSO section below.</p>

<p>All of the X servers accept the command line options
described below. Some X servers may have alternative ways of
providing the parameters described here, but the values
provided via the command line options should override values
specified via other mechanisms.</p>

<p>:displaynumber The X server runs as the given
displaynumber, which by default is 0. If multiple X servers
are to run simultaneously on a host, each must have a unique
display number. See the DISPLAY NAMES section of the X(7)
manual page to learn how to specify which display number
clients should try to use.</p>

<p>-a number sets pointer acceleration (i.e. the ratio of
how much is reported to how much the user actually moved the
pointer).</p>

<p>-ac disables host-based access control mechanisms.
Enables access by any host, and permits any host to modify
the access control list. Use with extreme caution. This
option exists primarily for running test suites
remotely.</p>

<p>-audit level sets the audit trail level. The default
level is 1, meaning only connection rejections are reported.
Level 2 additionally reports all successful connections and
disconnects. Level 4 enables messages from the SECURITY
extension, if present, including generation and revocation
of authorizations and vio- lations of the security policy.
Level 0 turns off the audit trail. Audit lines are sent as
standard error output.</p>

<p>-auth authorization-file specifies a file which contains
a collection of authorization records used to authenticate
access. See also the xdm(1) and Xsecurity(7) manual
pages.</p>

<p>-background none Asks the driver not to clear the
background on startup, if the driver supports that. May be
useful for smooth transition with eg. fbdev driver. For
security reasons this is not the default as the screen
contents might show a previous user session.</p>

<p>-br sets the default root window to solid black instead
of the standard root weave pattern. This is the default
unless -retro or -wr is specified.</p>

<p>-bs disables backing store support on all screens.</p>

<p>-c turns off key-click.</p>

<p>c volume sets key-click volume (allowable range:
0-100).</p>

<p>-cc class sets the visual class for the root window of
color screens. The class numbers are as specified in the X
protocol. Not obeyed by all servers.</p>

<p>-core causes the server to generate a core dump on fatal
errors.</p>

<p>-displayfd fd specifies a file descriptor in the
launching process. Rather than specify a display number, the
X server will attempt to listen on successively higher
display numbers, and upon finding a free one, will write the
display number back on this file descriptor as a
newline-terminated string. The -pn option is ignored when
using -displayfd.</p>

<p>-deferglyphs whichfonts specifies the types of fonts for
which the server should attempt to use deferred glyph
loading. whichfonts can be all (all fonts), none (no fonts),
or 16 (16 bit fonts only).</p>

<p>-dpi resolution sets the resolution for all screens, in
dots per inch. To be used when the server cannot determine
the screen size(s) from the hardware.</p>

<p>dpms enables DPMS (display power management services),
where sup- ported. The default state is platform and
configuration spe- cific.</p>

<p>-dpms disables DPMS (display power management services).
The default state is platform and configuration
specific.</p>

<p>-extensionextensionName disables named extension. If an
unknown extension name is specified, a list of accepted
extension names is printed.</p>

<p>+extensionextensionName enables named extension. If an
unknown extension name is specified, a list of accepted
extension names is printed.</p>

<p>-f volume sets beep (bell) volume (allowable range:
0-100).</p>

<p>-fc cursorFont sets default cursor font.</p>

<p>-fn font sets the default font.</p>

<p>-fp fontPath sets the search path for fonts. This path
is a comma separated list of directories which the X server
searches for font databases. See the FONTS section of this
manual page for more information and the default list.</p>

<p>-help prints a usage message.</p>

<p>-I causes all remaining command line arguments to be
ignored.</p>

<p>-iglx Prohibit creating indirect GLX contexts. Indirect
GLX is of limited use, since it lacks support for many
modern OpenGL fea- tures and extensions; it s slower than
direct contexts; and it opens a large attack surface for
protocol parsing errors. This is the default unless +iglx is
specified.</p>

<p>+iglx Allow creating indirect GLX contexts.</p>

<p>-maxbigreqsize size sets the maximum big request to size
MB.</p>

<p>-nocursor disable the display of the pointer cursor.</p>

<p>-nolisten trans-type disables a transport type. For
example, TCP/IP connections can be disabled with -nolisten
tcp. This option may be issued mul- tiple times to disable
listening to different transport types.</p>

<p>-listen trans-type enables a transport type. For
example, TCP/IP connections can be enabled with -listen tcp.
This option may be issued multi- ple times to enable
listening to different transport types.</p>

<p>-noreset prevents a server reset when the last client
connection is closed. This overrides a previous -terminate
command line option.</p>

<p>-p minutes sets screen-saver pattern cycle time in
minutes.</p>

<p>-pn permits the server to continue running if it fails
to establish all of its well-known sockets (connection
points for clients), but establishes at least one. This
option is set by default.</p>

<p>-nopn causes the server to exit if it fails to establish
all of its well-known sockets (connection points for
clients).</p>

<p>-r turns off auto-repeat.</p>

<p>r turns on auto-repeat.</p>

<p>-retro starts the server with the classic stipple and
cursor visible. The default is to start with a black root
window, and to sup- press display of the cursor until the
first time an application calls XDefineCursor(). For kdrive
servers, this implies -zap.</p>

<p>-s minutes sets screen-saver timeout time in
minutes.</p>

<p>-su disables save under support on all screens.</p>

<p>-seat seat seat to run on. Takes a string identifying a
seat in a platform specific syntax. On platforms which
support this feature this may be used to limit the server to
expose only a specific sub- set of devices connected to the
system.</p>

<p>-t number sets pointer acceleration threshold in pixels
(i.e. after how many pixels pointer acceleration should take
effect).</p>

<p>-terminate causes the server to terminate at server
reset, instead of con- tinuing to run. This overrides a
previous -noreset command line option.</p>

<p>-to seconds sets default connection timeout in
seconds.</p>

<p>-tst disables all testing extensions (e.g., XTEST,
XTrap, XTestEx- tension1, RECORD).</p>

<p>ttyxx ignored, for servers started the ancient way (from
init).</p>

<p>v sets video-off screen-saver preference.</p>

<p>-v sets video-on screen-saver preference.</p>

<p>-wm forces the default backing-store of all windows to
be When- Mapped. This is a backdoor way of getting
backing-store to apply to all windows. Although all mapped
windows will have backing store, the backing store attribute
value reported by the server for a window will be the last
value established by a client. If it has never been set by a
client, the server will report the default value, NotUseful.
This behavior is required by the X protocol, which allows
the server to exceed the client s backing store expectations
but does not provide a way to tell the client that it is
doing so.</p>

<p>-wr sets the default root window to solid white instead
of the standard root weave pattern.</p>

<p>-x extension loads the specified extension at init. This
is a no-op for most implementations.</p>

<p>[+-]xinerama enables(+) or disables(-) the XINERAMA
extension. The default state is platform and configuration
specific.</p>

<p>SERVER DEPENDENT OPTIONS Some X servers accept the
following options:</p>

<p>-ld kilobytes sets the data space limit of the server to
the specified number of kilobytes. A value of zero makes the
data size as large as possible. The default value of -1
leaves the data space limit unchanged.</p>

<p>-lf files sets the number-of-open-files limit of the
server to the speci- fied number. A value of zero makes the
limit as large as possible. The default value of -1 leaves
the limit unchanged.</p>

<p>-ls kilobytes sets the stack space limit of the server
to the specified num- ber of kilobytes. A value of zero
makes the stack size as large as possible. The default value
of -1 leaves the stack space limit unchanged.</p>

<p>-maxclients 64|128|256|512 Set the maximum number of
clients allowed to connect to the X server. Acceptable
values are 64, 128, 256 or 512.</p>

<p>-render default|mono|gray|color sets the color
allocation policy that will be used by the render
extension.</p>

<p>default selects the default policy defined for the
display depth of the X server.</p>

<p>mono dont use any color cell.</p>

<p>gray use a gray map of 13 color cells for the X render
extension.</p>

<p>color use a color cube of at most 4*4*4 colors (that is
64 color cells).</p>

<p>-dumbSched disables smart scheduling on platforms that
support the smart scheduler.</p>

<p>-schedInterval interval sets the smart schedulers
scheduling interval to interval mil- liseconds.</p>

<p>XDMCP OPTIONS X servers that support XDMCP have the
following options. See the X Display Manager Control
Protocol specification for more information.</p>

<p>-query hostname enables XDMCP and sends Query packets to
the specified host- name.</p>

<p>-broadcast enable XDMCP and broadcasts BroadcastQuery
packets to the net- work. The first responding display
manager will be chosen for the session.</p>

<p>-multicast [address [hop count]] Enable XDMCP and
multicast BroadcastQuery packets to the net- work. The first
responding display manager is chosen for the session. If an
address is specified, the multicast is sent to that address.
If no address is specified, the multicast is sent to the
default XDMCP IPv6 multicast group. If a hop count is
specified, it is used as the maximum hop count for the mul-
ticast. If no hop count is specified, the multicast is set
to a maximum of 1 hop, to prevent the multicast from being
routed beyond the local network.</p>

<p>-indirect hostname enables XDMCP and send IndirectQuery
packets to the specified hostname.</p>

<p>-port port-number uses the specified port-number for
XDMCP packets, instead of the default. This option must be
specified before any -query, -broadcast, -multicast, or
-indirect options.</p>

<p>-from local-address specifies the local address to
connect from (useful if the con- necting host has multiple
network interfaces). The local- address may be expressed in
any form acceptable to the host platforms gethostbyname(3)
implementation.</p>

<p>-once causes the server to terminate (rather than reset)
when the XDMCP session ends.</p>

<p>-class display-class XDMCP has an additional display
qualifier used in resource lookup for display-specific
options. This option sets that value, by default it is
&quot;MIT-unspecified&quot; (not a very useful value).</p>

<p>-cookie xdm-auth-bits When testing XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1,
a private key is shared between the server and the manager.
This option sets the value of that private data (not that it
is very private, being on the command line!).</p>

<p>-displayID display-id Yet another XDMCP specific value,
this one allows the display manager to identify each display
so that it can locate the shared key.</p>

<p>XKEYBOARD OPTIONS X servers that support the XKEYBOARD
(a.k.a. &quot;XKB&quot;) extension accept the following
options. All layout files specified on the command line must
be located in the XKB base directory or a subdirectory, and
speci- fied as the relative path from the XKB base
directory. The default XKB base directory is
/usr/lib/X11/xkb.</p>

<p>[+-]accessx [ timeout [ timeout_mask [ feedback [
options_mask ] ] ] ] enables(+) or disables(-) AccessX key
sequences.</p>

<p>-xkbdir directory base directory for keyboard layout
files. This option is not available for setuid X servers
(i.e., when the X servers real and effective uids are
different).</p>

<p>-ardelay milliseconds sets the autorepeat delay (length
of time in milliseconds that a key must be depressed before
autorepeat starts).</p>

<p>-arinterval milliseconds sets the autorepeat interval
(length of time in milliseconds that should elapse between
autorepeat-generated keystrokes).</p>

<p>-xkbmap filename loads keyboard description in filename
on server startup.</p>

<p>NETWORK CONNECTIONS The X server supports client
connections via a platform-dependent sub- set of the
following transport types: TCP/IP, Unix Domain sockets, and
several varieties of SVR4 local connections. See the DISPLAY
NAMES section of the X(7) manual page to learn how to
specify which transport type clients should try to use.</p>

<p>GRANTING ACCESS The X server implements a
platform-dependent subset of the following authorization
protocols: MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1, XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1, XDM-
AUTHORIZATION-2, SUN-DES-1, and MIT-KERBEROS-5. See the
Xsecurity(7) manual page for information on the operation of
these protocols.</p>

<p>Authorization data required by the above protocols is
passed to the server in a private file named with the -auth
command line option. Each time the server is about to accept
the first connection after a reset (or when the server is
starting), it reads this file. If this file contains any
authorization records, the local host is not automat- ically
allowed access to the server, and only clients which send
one of the authorization records contained in the file in
the connection setup information will be allowed access. See
the Xau manual page for a description of the binary format
of this file. See xauth(1) for main- tenance of this file,
and distribution of its contents to remote hosts.</p>

<p>The X server also uses a host-based access control list
for deciding whether or not to accept connections from
clients on a particular machine. If no other authorization
mechanism is being used, this list initially consists of the
host on which the server is running as well as any machines
listed in the file /etc/Xn.hosts, where n is the dis- play
number of the server. Each line of the file should contain
either an Internet hostname (e.g. expo.lcs.mit.edu) or a
complete name in the format family:name as described in the
xhost(1) manual page. There should be no leading or trailing
spaces on any lines. For example:</p>

<p>joesworkstation corporate.company.com inet:bigcpu
local:</p>

<p>Users can add or remove hosts from this list and enable
or disable access control using the xhost command from the
same machine as the server.</p>

<p>If the X FireWall Proxy (xfwp) is being used without a
sitepolicy, host-based authorization must be turned on for
clients to be able to connect to the X server via the xfwp.
If xfwp is run without a config- uration file and thus no
sitepolicy is defined, if xfwp is using an X server where
xhost + has been run to turn off host-based authorization
checks, when a client tries to connect to this X server via
xfwp, the X server will deny the connection. See xfwp(1) for
more information about this proxy.</p>

<p>The X protocol intrinsically does not have any notion of
window opera- tion permissions or place any restrictions on
what a client can do; if a program can connect to a display,
it has full run of the screen. X servers that support the
SECURITY extension fare better because clients can be
designated untrusted via the authorization they use to
connect; see the xauth(1) manual page for details.
Restrictions are imposed on untrusted clients that curtail
the mischief they can do. See the SECU- RITY extension
specification for a complete list of these restrictions.</p>

<p>Sites that have better authentication and authorization
systems might wish to make use of the hooks in the libraries
and the server to pro- vide additional security models.</p>

<p>SIGNALS The X server attaches special meaning to the
following signals:</p>

<p>SIGHUP This signal causes the server to close all
existing connec- tions, free all resources, and restore all
defaults. It is sent by the display manager whenever the
main users main application (usually an xterm or window
manager) exits to force the server to clean up and prepare
for the next user.</p>

<p>SIGTERM This signal causes the server to exit
cleanly.</p>

<p>SIGUSR1 This signal is used quite differently from
either of the above. When the server starts, it checks to
see if it has inherited SIGUSR1 as SIG_IGN instead of the
usual SIG_DFL. In this case, the server sends a SIGUSR1 to
its parent process after it has set up the various
connection schemes. Xdm uses this feature to recognize when
connecting to the server is possible.</p>

<p>FONTS The X server can obtain fonts from directories
and/or from font servers. The list of directories and font
servers the X server uses when trying to open a font is
controlled by the font path.</p>

<p>The default font path is
catalogue:/etc/X11/fontpath.d,built-ins .</p>

<p>A special kind of directory can be specified using the
catalogue: pre- fix. Directories specified this way can
contain symlinks pointing to the real font directories. See
the FONTPATH.D section for details.</p>

<p>The font path can be set with the -fp option or by
xset(1) after the server has started.</p>

<p>FONTPATH.D You can specify a special kind of font path
in the form cata- logue:&lt;dir&gt;. The directory specified
after the catalogue: prefix will be scanned for symlinks and
each symlink destination will be added as a local fontfile
FPE.</p>

<p>The symlink can be suffixed by attributes such as
unscaled, which will be passed through to the underlying
fontfile FPE. The only excep- tion is the newly introduced
pri attribute, which will be used for ordering the font
paths specified by the symlinks.</p>

<p>An example configuration:</p>

<p>75dpi:unscaled:pri=20 -&gt; /usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi
ghostscript:pri=60 -&gt;
/usr/share/fonts/default/ghostscript misc:unscaled:pri=10
-&gt; /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc type1:pri=40 -&gt;
/usr/share/X11/fonts/Type1 type1:pri=50 -&gt;
/usr/share/fonts/default/Type1</p>

<p>This will add /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc as the first FPE
with the attribute &rsquo;unscaled , second FPE will be
/usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi, also with the attribute unscaled
etc. This is functionally equivalent to setting the
following font path:</p>

<p>/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled,
/usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled,
/usr/share/X11/fonts/Type1, /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1,
/usr/share/fonts/default/ghostscript</p>

<p>FILES /etc/Xn.hosts Initial access control list for
display number n</p>


<p>/usr/share/fonts/X11/misc,/usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi,/usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi
Bitmap font directories</p>

<p>/usr/share/fonts/X11/TTF,/usr/share/fonts/X11/Type1
Outline font directories</p>

<p>/tmp/.X11-unix/Xn Unix domain socket for display number
n</p>

<p>/usr/adm/Xnmsgs Error log file for display number n if
run from init(8)</p>

<p>/usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-errors Default error log file if
the server is run from xdm(1)</p>
