<p>INET_NTOP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
INET_NTOP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME inet_ntop, inet_pton - convert IPv4 and IPv6
addresses between binary and text form</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;</p>

<p>const char *inet_ntop(int af, const void *restrict src,
char *restrict dst, socklen_t size); int inet_pton(int af,
const char *restrict src, void *restrict dst);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The inet_ntop() function shall convert a
numeric address into a text string suitable for
presentation. The af argument shall specify the family of
the address. This can be AF_INET or AF_INET6. The src argu-
ment points to a buffer holding an IPv4 address if the af
argument is AF_INET, or an IPv6 address if the af argument
is AF_INET6; the address must be in network byte order. The
dst argument points to a buffer where the function stores
the resulting text string; it shall not be NULL. The size
argument specifies the size of this buffer, which shall be
large enough to hold the text string (INET_ADDRSTRLEN
charac- ters for IPv4, INET6_ADDRSTRLEN characters for
IPv6).</p>

<p>The inet_pton() function shall convert an address in its
standard text presentation form into its numeric binary
form. The af argument shall specify the family of the
address. The AF_INET and AF_INET6 address families shall be
supported. The src argument points to the string being
passed in. The dst argument points to a buffer into which
the function stores the numeric address; this shall be large
enough to hold the numeric address (32 bits for AF_INET, 128
bits for AF_INET6).</p>

<p>If the af argument of inet_pton() is AF_INET, the src
string shall be in the standard IPv4 dotted-decimal
form:</p>

<p>ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd</p>

<p>where &quot;ddd&quot; is a one to three digit decimal
number between 0 and 255 (see inet_addr()). The inet_pton()
function does not accept other for- mats (such as the octal
numbers, hexadecimal numbers, and fewer than four numbers
that inet_addr() accepts).</p>

<p>If the af argument of inet_pton() is AF_INET6, the src
string shall be in one of the following standard IPv6 text
forms:</p>

<p>1. The preferred form is &quot;x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x&quot;,
where thex s are the hexadecimal values of the eight 16-bit
pieces of the address. Lead- ing zeros in individual fields
can be omitted, but there shall be at least one numeral in
every field.</p>

<p>2. A string of contiguous zero fields in the preferred
form can be shown as &quot;::&quot; . The &quot;::&quot; can
only appear once in an address. Unspecified addresses (
&quot;0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0&quot; ) may be represented sim- ply as
&quot;::&quot; .</p>

<p>3. A third form that is sometimes more convenient when
dealing with a mixed environment of IPv4 and IPv6 nodes is
&quot;x:x:x:x:x:x:d.d.d.d&quot;, where the x s are the
hexadecimal values of the six high-order 16-bit pieces of
the address, and the ds are the decimal values of the four
low-order 8-bit pieces of the address (standard IPv4
representation).</p>

<p>Note: A more extensive description of the standard
representations of IPv6 addresses can be found in RFC
2373.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The inet_ntop() function shall return a
pointer to the buffer contain- ing the text string if the
conversion succeeds, and NULL otherwise, and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>The inet_pton() function shall return 1 if the
conversion succeeds, with the address pointed to by dst in
network byte order. It shall return 0 if the input is not a
valid IPv4 dotted-decimal string or a valid IPv6 address
string, or -1 with errno set to [EAFNOSUPPORT] if the af
argument is unknown.</p>

<p>ERRORS The inet_ntop() and inet_pton() functions shall
fail if:</p>

<p>EAFNOSUPPORT</p>

<p>The af argument is invalid.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The size of the inet_ntop() result buffer is
inadequate.</p>
