<p>WRITE(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WRITE(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME write - write to another user</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS write user_name [terminal]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The write utility shall read lines from the
users standard input and write them to the terminal of
another user. When first invoked, it shall write the
message:</p>

<p>Message from sender-login-id (sending-terminal)
[date]...</p>

<p>to user_name. When it has successfully completed the
connection, the sender s terminal shall be alerted twice to
indicate that what the sender is typing is being written to
the recipient s terminal.</p>

<p>If the recipient wants to reply, this can be
accomplished by typing:</p>

<p>write sender-login-id [sending-terminal]</p>

<p>upon receipt of the initial message. Whenever a line of
input as delim- ited by an NL, EOF, or EOL special character
(see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Chapter 11, General Terminal Interface) is accumulated while
in canonical input mode, the accumulated data shall be
written on the other user s terminal. Characters shall be
processed as follows:</p>

<p>* Typing &lt;alert&gt; shall write the alert character
to the recipients terminal.</p>

<p>* Typing the erase and kill characters shall affect the
senders ter- minal in the manner described by the termios
interface in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 11, General Ter- minal Interface.</p>

<p>* Typing the interrupt or end-of-file characters shall
cause write to write an appropriate message (
&quot;EOn&quot; in the POSIX locale) to the recipients
terminal and exit.</p>

<p>* Typing characters from LC_CTYPE classifications print
or space shall cause those characters to be sent to the
recipient s terminal.</p>

<p>* When and only when the stty iexten local mode is
enabled, the exis- tence and processing of additional
special control characters and multi-byte or single-byte
functions is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>* Typing other non-printable characters shall cause
implementation- defined sequences of printable characters to
be written to the recipients terminal.</p>

<p>To write to a user who is logged in more than once, the
terminal argu- ment can be used to indicate which terminal
to write to; otherwise, the recipient s terminal is selected
in an implementation-defined manner and an informational
message is written to the senders standard out- put,
indicating which terminal was chosen.</p>

<p>Permission to be a recipient of a write message can be
denied or granted by use of the mesg utility. However, a
users privilege may further constrain the domain of
accessibility of other users termi- nals. The write utility
shall fail when the user lacks the appropriate privileges to
perform the requested action.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>user_name Login name of the person to whom the message
shall be written. The application shall ensure that this
operand is of the form returned by the who utility.</p>

<p>terminal Terminal identification in the same format
provided by the who utility.</p>

<p>STDIN Lines to be copied to the recipients terminal are
read from standard input.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of write:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files). If the recipients locale does not use an
LC_CTYPE equivalent to the senders, the results are
undefined.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS If an interrupt signal is received,
write shall write an appropriate message on the recipients
terminal and exit with a status of zero. It shall take the
standard action for all other signals.</p>

<p>STDOUT An informational message shall be written to
standard output if a recipient is logged in more than
once.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES The recipients terminal is used for
output.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 The addressed user is not logged on or the
addressed user denies permission.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The talk utility is considered by some
users to be a more usable util- ity on full-screen
terminals.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The write utility was included in this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 since it can be implemented on all
terminal types. The standard devel- opers considered the
talk utility, which cannot be implemented on cer- tain
terminals, to be a &quot;better&quot; communications
interface. Both of these programs are in widespread use on
historical implementations. Therefore, the standard
developers decided that both utilities should be
specified.</p>

<p>The format of the terminal name is unspecified, but the
descriptions of ps, talk, who, and write require that they
all use or accept the same format.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
