<p>Tcl_DetachPids(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_DetachPids(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_DetachPids, Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs, Tcl_WaitPid
- manage child pro- cesses in background</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_DetachPids(numPids, pidPtr)</p>

<p>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs()</p>

<p>Tcl_Pid Tcl_WaitPid(pid, statusPtr, options)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS int numPids (in) Number of process ids
contained in the array pointed to by pidPtr.</p>

<p>int *pidPtr (in) Address of array containing numPids
process ids.</p>

<p>Tcl_Pid pid (in) The id of the process (pipe) to wait
for.</p>

<p>int *statusPtr (out) The result of waiting on a process
(pipe). Either 0 or ECHILD.</p>

<p>int options (in) The options controlling the wait. WNO-
HANG specifies not to wait when check- ing the process.

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_DetachPids and Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs
provide a mechanism for manag- ing subprocesses that are
running in background. These procedures are needed because
the parent of a process must eventually invoke the wait- pid
kernel call (or one of a few other similar kernel calls) to
wait for the child to exit. Until the parent waits for the
child, the child s state cannot be completely reclaimed by
the system. If a par- ent continually creates children and
doesnt wait on them, the systems process table will
eventually overflow, even if all the children have
exited.</p>

<p>Tcl_DetachPids may be called to ask Tcl to take
responsibility for one or more processes whose process ids
are contained in the pidPtr array passed as argument. The
caller presumably has started these processes running in
background and does not want to have to deal with them
again.</p>

<p>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs invokes the waitpid kernel call on
each of the background processes so that its state can be
cleaned up if it has exited. If the process has not exited
yet, Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs does not wait for it to exit; it
will check again the next time it is invoked. Tcl
automatically calls Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs each time the exec
command is executed, so in most cases it is not necessary
for any code outside of Tcl to invoke Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs.
However, if you call Tcl_DetachPids in situations where the
exec command may never get executed, you may wish to call
Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs from time to time so that background
processes can be cleaned up.</p>

<p>Tcl_WaitPid is a thin wrapper around the facilities
provided by the operating system to wait on the end of a
spawned process and to check a whether spawned process is
still running. It is used by Tcl_ReapDe- tachedProcs and the
channel system to portably access the operating system.</p>
