<p>GLIB-MKENUMS(1) User Commands GLIB-MKENUMS(1)</p>

<p>NAME glib-mkenums - C language enum description
generation utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS glib-mkenums [options...] [files...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION glib-mkenums is a small perl-script utility
that parses C code to extract enum definitions and produces
enum descriptions based on text templates specified by the
user. Most frequently this script is used to produce C code
that contains enum values as strings so programs can provide
value name strings for introspection.</p>

<p>INVOCATION glib-mkenums takes a list of valid C code
files as input. The options specified control the text that
is output, certain substitutions are performed on the text
templates for keywords enclosed in @ characters.</p>

<p>Options --fhead text Put out text prior to processing
input files.</p>

<p>--fprod text Put out text everytime a new input file is
being processed.</p>

<p>--ftail text Put out text after all input files have
been processed.</p>

<p>--eprod text Put out text everytime an enum is
encountered in the input files.</p>

<p>--vhead text Put out text before iterating over the set
of values of an enum.</p>

<p>--vprod text Put out text for every value of an
enum.</p>

<p>--vtail text Put out text after iterating over all
values of an enum.</p>

<p>--comments text Template for auto-generated comments,
the default (for C code generations) is &quot;/* @comment@
*/&quot;.</p>

<p>--template file Read templates from the given file. The
templates are enclosed in specially-formatted C comments</p>

<p>/*** BEGIN section ***/ /*** END section ***/</p>

<p>where section may be file-header, file-production,
file-tail, enumeration-production, value-header,
value-production, value-tail or comment.</p>

<p>--help Print brief help and exit.</p>

<p>--version Print version and exit.</p>

<p>Production text substitutions Certain keywords enclosed
in @ characters will be substituted in the emitted text. For
the substitution examples of the keywords below, the
following example enum definition is assumed:</p>

<p>typedef enum { PREFIX_THE_XVALUE = 1 &lt;&lt; 3,
PREFIX_ANOTHER_VALUE = 1 &lt;&lt; 4 } PrefixTheXEnum;</p>

<p>@EnumName@ The name of the enum currently being
processed, enum names are assumed to be properly namespaced
and to use mixed capitalization to separate words (e.g.
PrefixTheXEnum).</p>

<p>@enum_name@ The enum name with words lowercase and
word-separated by underscores (e.g. prefix_the_xenum).</p>

<p>@ENUMNAME@ The enum name with words uppercase and
word-separated by underscores (e.g. PREFIX_THE_XENUM).</p>

<p>@ENUMSHORT@ The enum name with words uppercase and
word-separated by underscores, prefix stripped (e.g.
THE_XENUM).</p>

<p>@VALUENAME@ The enum value name currently being
processed with words uppercase and word-separated by
underscores, this is the assumed literal notation of enum
values in the C sources (e.g. PREFIX_THE_XVALUE).</p>

<p>@valuenick@ A nick name for the enum value currently
being processed, this is usually generated by stripping
common prefix words of all the enum values of the current
enum, the words are lowercase and underscores are
substituted by a minus (e.g. the-xvalue).</p>

<p>@valuenum@ The integer value for the enum value
currently being processed. This is calculated by using perl
to attempt to evaluate the expression as it appears in the C
source code. If evaluation fails then glib-mkenums will exit
with an error status, but this only happens if @valuenum@
appears in your value production template. (Since: 2.26)</p>

<p>@type@ This is substituted either by &quot;enum&quot; or
&quot;flags&quot;, depending on whether the enum value
definitions contained bit-shift operators or not (e.g.
flags).</p>

<p>@Type@ The same as @type@ with the first letter
capitalized (e.g. Flags).</p>

<p>@TYPE@ The same as @type@ with all letters uppercased
(e.g. FLAGS).</p>

<p>@filename@ The name of the input file currently being
processed (e.g. foo.h).</p>

<p>@basename@ The base name of the input file currently
being processed (e.g. foo.h). (Since: 2.22)</p>

<p>Trigraph extensions Some C comments are treated
specially in the parsed enum definitions, such comments
start out with the trigraph sequence /*&lt; and end with the
trigraph sequence &gt;*/. Per enum definition, the options
&quot;skip&quot; and &quot;flags&quot; can be specified, to
indicate this enum definition to be skipped, or for it to be
treated as a flags definition, or to specify the common
prefix to be stripped from all values to generate value
nicknames, respectively. The &quot;lowercase_name&quot;
option can be used to specify the word separation used in
the *_get_type() function. For instance, /*&lt;
lowercase_name=gnome_vfs_uri_hide_options &gt;*/.</p>

<p>Per value definition, the options &quot;skip&quot; and
&quot;nick&quot; are supported. The former causes the value
to be skipped, and the latter can be used to specify the
otherwise auto-generated nickname. Examples:</p>

<p>typedef enum /*&lt; skip &gt;*/ { PREFIX_FOO }
PrefixThisEnumWillBeSkipped; typedef enum /*&lt;
flags,prefix=PREFIX &gt;*/ { PREFIX_THE_ZEROTH_VALUE, /*&lt;
skip &gt;*/ PREFIX_THE_FIRST_VALUE, PREFIX_THE_SECOND_VALUE,
PREFIX_THE_THIRD_VALUE, /*&lt; nick=the-last-value &gt;*/ }
PrefixTheFlagsEnum;</p>
