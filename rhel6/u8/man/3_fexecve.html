<p>FEXECVE(3) Linux Programmer s Manual FEXECVE(3)</p>

<p>NAME fexecve - execute program specified via file
descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fexecve(int fd, char *const argv[], char *const
envp[]);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fexecve() performs the same task as
execve(2), with the difference that the file to be executed
is specified via a file descriptor, fd, rather than via a
pathname. The file descriptor fd must be opened read-only,
and the caller must have permission to execute the file that
it refers to.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE A successful call to fexecve() never
returns. On error, the function returns, with a result value
of -1, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS Errors are as for execve(2), with the following
additions:</p>

<p>EINVAL fd is not a valid file descriptor, or argv is
NULL, or envp is NULL.</p>

<p>ENOSYS The /proc file system could not be accessed.</p>

<p>VERSIONS fexecve() is implemented since glibc 2.3.2.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2008. This function is not
specified in POSIX.1-2001, and is not widely available on
other systems.</p>

<p>NOTES On Linux, fexecve() is implemented using the
proc(5) file system, so /proc needs to be mounted and
available at the time of the call.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO execve(2)</p>

man-pages project. A description of the project, and
