] [ -portrait ] [ -plane number ] [ -gray ] [ -rv ] [
-compact ] [ -output filename ] [ -append filename ] [ -noff
] [ -split n ] [ -psfig ] [ -density dpi ] [ -cutoff level ]
[ -noposition ] [ -gamma correction ] [ -render algorithm ]
[ -slide ] [ filename ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xpr takes as input a window dump file
produced by xwd(1) and formats it for output on PostScript
printers, the Digital LN03 or LA100, the IBM PP3812 page
printer, the HP LaserJet (or other PCL printers), or the HP
PaintJet. If no file argument is given, the standard input
is used. By default, xpr prints the largest possible
representation of the win- dow on the output page. Options
allow the user to add headers and trailers, specify margins,
adjust the scale and orientation, and append multiple window
dumps to a single output file. Output is to standard output
unless -output is specified.</p>

<p>Command Options</p>

<p>-device devtype Specifies the device on which the file
will be printed. Cur- rently supported: la100 Digital LA100
ljet HP LaserJet series and other monochrome PCL devices
such as ThinkJet, QuietJet, RuggedWriter, HP2560 series, and
HP2930 series printers ln03 Digital LN03 pjet HP PaintJet
(color mode) pjetxl HP HP PaintJet XL Color Graphics Printer
(color mode) pp IBM PP3812 ps PostScript printer</p>

<p>The default is PostScript. -device lw (LaserWriter) is
equiva- lent to -device ps and is provided only for
backwards compati- bility.</p>

<p>-scale scale Affects the size of the window on the page.
The PostScript, LN03, and HP printers are able to translate
each bit in a window pixel map into a grid of a specified
size. For example each bit might translate into a 3x3 grid.
This would be specified by -scale 3. By default a window is
printed with the largest scale that will fit onto the page
for the specified orientation.</p>

<p>-height inches Specifies the maximum height of the
page.</p>

<p>-width inches Specifies the maximum width of the
page.</p>

<p>-left inches Specifies the left margin in inches.
Fractions are allowed. By default the window is centered in
the page.</p>

<p>-top inches Specifies the top margin for the picture in
inches. Fractions are allowed.</p>

<p>-header string Specifies a header string to be printed
above the window.</p>

<p>-trailer string Specifies a trailer string to be printed
below the window.</p>

<p>-landscape Forces the window to printed in landscape
mode. By default a window is printed such that its longest
side follows the long side of the paper.</p>

<p>-plane number Specifies which bit plane to use in an
image. The default is to use the entire image and map values
into black and white based on color intensities.</p>

<p>-gray 2 | 3 | 4 Uses a simple 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4 gray
scale conversion on a color image, rather than mapping to
strictly black and white. This doubles, triples, or
quadruples the effective width and height of the image.</p>

<p>-portrait Forces the window to be printed in portrait
mode. By default a window is printed such that its longest
side follows the long side of the paper.</p>

<p>-rv Forces the window to be printed in reverse
video.</p>

<p>-compact Uses simple run-length encoding for compact
representation of windows with lots of white pixels.</p>

<p>-output filename Specifies an output file name. If this
option is not specified, standard output is used.</p>

<p>-append filename Specifies a filename previously
produced by xpr to which the window is to be appended.</p>

<p>-noff When specified in conjunction with -append, the
window will appear on the same page as the previous
window.</p>

<p>-split n This option allows the user to split a window
onto several pages. This might be necessary for very large
windows that would otherwise cause the printer to overload
and print the page in an obscure manner.</p>

<p>-psfig Suppress translation of the PostScript picture to
the center of the page.</p>

<p>-density dpi Indicates what dot-per-inch density should
be used by the HP printer.</p>

<p>-cutoff level Changes the intensity level where colors
are mapped to either black or white for monochrome output on
a LaserJet printer. The level is expressed as percentage of
full brightness. Fractions are allowed.</p>

<p>-noposition This option causes header, trailer, and
image positioning com- mand generation to be bypassed for
LaserJet, PaintJet and Paint- Jet XL printers.</p>

<p>-gamma correction This changes the intensity of the
colors printed by PaintJet XL printer. The correction is a
floating point value in the range 0.00 to 3.00. Consult the
operators manual to determine the correct value for the
specific printer.</p>

<p>-render algorithm This allows PaintJet XL printer to
render the image with the best quality versus performance
tradeoff. Consult the opera- tors manual to determine which
algorithms are available.</p>

<p>-slide This option allows overhead transparencies to be
printed using the PaintJet and PaintJet XL printers.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The current version of xpr can generally
print out on the LN03 most X windows that are not larger
than two-thirds of the screen. For exam- ple, it will be
able to print out a large Emacs window, but it will usually
fail when trying to print out the entire screen. The LN03
has memory limitations that can cause it to incorrectly
print very large or complex windows. The two most common
errors encountered are band too complex and page memory
exceeded. In the first case, a window may have a particular
six pixel row that contains too many changes (from black to
white to black). This will cause the printer to drop part of
the line and possibly parts of the rest of the page. The
printer will flash the number 1 on its front panel when this
problem occurs. A possible solution to this problem is to
increase the scale of the picture, or to split the picture
onto two or more pages. The second problem, page memory
exceeded, will occur if the picture contains too much black,
or if the picture contains complex half-tones such as the
background color of a display. When this problem occurs the
printer will automatically split the picture into two or
more pages. It may flash the number 5 on its from panel.
There is no easy solution to this problem. It will probably
be necessary to either cut and paste, or to rework the
application to produce a less complex picture.</p>

<p>There are several limitations on the LA100 support: the
picture will always be printed in portrait mode, there is no
scaling, and the aspect ratio will be slightly off.</p>

<p>Support for PostScript output currently cannot handle
the -append, -noff or -split options.</p>

<p>The -compact option is only supported for PostScript
output. It com- presses white space but not black space, so
it is not useful for reverse-video windows.</p>

<p>For color images, should map directly to PostScript
image support.</p>

<p>HP PRINTERS If no -density is specified on the command
line 300 dots per inch will be assumed for ljet and 90 dots
per inch for pjet. Allowable density values for a LaserJet
printer are 300, 150, 100, and 75 dots per inch. Consult the
operator s manual to determine densities supported by other
printers.</p>

<p>If no -scale is specified the image will be expanded to
fit the print- able page area.</p>

<p>The default printable page area is 8x10.5 inches. Other
paper sizes can be accommodated using the -height and -width
options.</p>

<p>Note that a 1024x768 image fits the default printable
area when pro- cessed at 100 dpi with scale=1, the same
image can also be printed using 300 dpi with scale=3 but
will require considerably more data be transferred to the
printer.</p>

<p>xpr may be tailored for use with monochrome PCL printers
other than the LaserJet. To print on a ThinkJet (HP2225A)
xpr could be invoked as:</p>

<p>xpr -density 96 -width 6.667 filename</p>

<p>or for black-and-white output to a PaintJet:</p>

<p>xpr -density 180 filename</p>

<p>The monochrome intensity of a pixel is computed as
0.30*R + 0.59*G + 0.11*B. If a pixels computed intensity is
less than the -cutoff level it will print as white. This
maps light-on-dark display images to black-on-white
hardcopy. The default cutoff intensity is 50% of full
brightness. Example: specifying -cutoff 87.5 moves the
white/black intensity point to 87.5% of full brightness.</p>

<p>A LaserJet printer must be configured with sufficient
memory to handle the image. For a full page at 300 dots per
inch approximately 2MB of printer memory is required.</p>

<p>Color images are produced on the PaintJet at 90 dots per
inch. The PaintJet is limited to sixteen colors from its 330
color palette on each horizontal print line. xpr will issue
a warning message if more than sixteen colors are
encountered on a line. xpr will program the PaintJet for the
first sixteen colors encountered on each line and use the
nearest matching programmed value for other colors present
on the line.</p>

<p>Specifying the -rv, reverse video, option for the
PaintJet will cause black and white to be interchanged on
the output image. No other col- ors are changed.</p>

<p>Multiplane images must be recorded by xwd in ZPixmap
format. Single plane (monochrome) images may be in either
XYPixmap or ZPixmap format.</p>

<p>Some PCL printers do not recognize image positioning
commands. Output for these printers will not be centered on
the page and header and trailer strings may not appear where
expected.</p>

<p>The -gamma and -render options are supported only on the
PaintJet XL printers.</p>

<p>The -slide option is not supported for LaserJet
printers.</p>

<p>The -split option is not supported for HP printers.</p>

<p>The -gray option is not supported for HP or IBM
printers. Copyright 1986, Marvin Solomon and the University
