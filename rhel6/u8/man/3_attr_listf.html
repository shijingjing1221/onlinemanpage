<p>ATTR_LIST(3) XFS Compatibility API ATTR_LIST(3)</p>

<p>NAME attr_list, attr_listf - list the names of the user
attributes of a filesystem object</p>

<p>C SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/attributes.h&gt;</p>

<p>int attr_list (const charpath, charbuffer, const int
buffersize, int flags, attrlist_cursor_tcursor);</p>

<p>int attr_listf (int fd, charbuffer, const int
buffersize, int flags, attrlist_cursor_tcursor);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The attr_list and attr_listf functions
provide a way to list the exist- ing attributes of a
filesystem object.</p>

<p>Path points to a path name for a filesystem object, and
fd refers to the file descriptor associated with a file. The
buffer will be filled with a structure describing at least a
portion of the attributes asso- ciated with the given
filesystem object. Buffer will be overwritten with an
attrlist_t structure containing a list of the attributes
asso- ciated with that filesystem object, up to a maximum of
buffersize bytes. The buffer must be sufficiently large to
hold the appropriate data structures plus at least one
maximally sized attribute name, but cannot be more than
ATTR_MAX_VALUELEN (currently 64KB) bytes in length.</p>

<p>The contents of an attrlist_t structure include the
following members:</p>

<p>__int32_t al_count; /number of entries in attrlist /
__int32_t al_more; /T/F: more attrs (do syscall again) /
__int32_t al_offset[1]; /_ byte offsets of attrs [var-sized]
/</p>

<p>The al_count field shows the number of attributes
represented in this buffer, which is also the number of
elements in the al_offset array. The al_more field will be
non-zero if another attr_list call would result in more
attributes. The al_offset array contains the byte off- set
within the buffer of the structure describing each of the
attributes, an attrlist_ent_t structure. The
ATTR_ENTRY(buffer, index) macro will help with decoding the
list. It takes a pointer to the buffer and an index into the
al_offset array and returns a pointer to the corresponding
attrlist_ent_t structure.</p>

<p>The contents of an attrlist_ent_t structure include the
following mem- bers:</p>

<p>u_int32_t a_valuelen; /number bytes in value of attr /
char a_name[]; /attr name (NULL terminated) /</p>

<p>The a_valuelen field shows the size in bytes of the
value associated with the attribute whose name is stored in
the a_name field. The name is a NULL terminated string.</p>

<p>Note that the value of the attribute cannot be obtained
through this interface, the attr_get call should be used to
get the value. The attr_list interface tells the calling
process how large of a buffer it must have in order to get
the attribute&acute;s value.</p>

<p>The flags argument can contain the following symbols
bitwise OR&acute;ed together:</p>

<p>ATTR_ROOT List the attributes that are in the root
address space, not in the user address space. (limited to
use by super-user only)</p>

<p>ATTR_DONTFOLLOW Do not follow symbolic links when
resolving a path on an attr_list function call. The default
is to follow symbolic links.</p>

<p>The cursor argument is a pointer to an opaque data
structure that the kernel uses to track the calling
process&acute;s position in the attribute list. The only
valid operations on a cursor are to pass it into an
attr_list function call or to zero it out. It should be
zero&acute;ed out before the first attr_list call. Note that
multi-threaded applications may keep more than one cursor in
order to serve multiple contexts, ie: the attr_list call is
&quot;thread-safe&quot;.</p>

<p>attr_list will fail if one or more of the following are
true:</p>

<p>[ENOENT] The named file does not exist.</p>

<p>[EPERM] The effective user ID does not match the owner
of the file and the effective user ID is not super-user.</p>

<p>[ENOTDIR] A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>[EACCES] Search permission is denied on a component of
the path prefix.</p>

<p>[EINVAL] A bit was set in the flag argument that is not
defined for this system call, or the buffer was too small or
too large.</p>

<p>[EFAULT] Either Path or buffer points outside the
allocated address space of the process, or buffer or bufsize
are not 32bit aligned.</p>

<p>[ELOOP] A path name lookup involved too many symbolic
links.</p>

<p>[ENAMETOOLONG] The length of path exceeds {MAXPATHLEN},
or a pathname component is longer than {MAXNAMELEN}.</p>

<p>[ENOATTR] attribute does not exist for this file.</p>

<p>attr_listf will fail if:</p>

<p>[EINVAL] A bit was set in the flag argument that is not
defined for this system call, or fd refers to a socket, not
a file, or the buffer was too small or too large.</p>

<p>[EFAULT] Either Path or buffer points outside the
allocated address space of the process, or buffer or bufsize
are not 32bit aligned.</p>

<p>[EBADF] Fd does not refer to a valid descriptor.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is
returned. Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and errno is
set to indicate the error.</p>
