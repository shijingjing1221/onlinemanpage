<p>NAME read - Read from a channel</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS read ?-nonewline? channelId</p>

<p>read channelId numChars
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In the first form, the read command reads
all of the data from chan- nelId up to the end of the file.
If the -nonewline switch is specified then the last
character of the file is discarded if it is a newline. In
the second form, the extra argument specifies how many
characters to read. Exactly that many characters will be
read and returned, unless there are fewer than numChars left
in the file; in this case all the remaining characters are
returned. If the channel is configured to use a multi-byte
encoding, then the number of characters read may not be the
same as the number of bytes read.</p>

<p>ChannelId must be an identifier for an open channel such
as the Tcl standard input channel (stdin), the return value
from an invocation of open or socket, or the result of a
channel creation command provided by a Tcl extension. The
channel must have been opened for input.</p>

<p>If channelId is in nonblocking mode, the command may not
read as many characters as requested: once all available
input has been read, the command will return the data that
is available rather than blocking for more input. If the
channel is configured to use a multi-byte encoding, then
there may actually be some bytes remaining in the internal
buffers that do not form a complete character. These bytes
will not be returned until a complete character is available
or end-of-file is reached. The -nonewline switch is ignored
if the command returns before reaching the end of the
file.</p>

<p>Read translates end-of-line sequences in the input into
newline charac- ters according to the -translation option
for the channel. See the fconfigure manual entry for a
discussion on ways in which fconfigure will alter input.</p>

<p>USE WITH SERIAL PORTS For most applications a channel
connected to a serial port should be configured to be
nonblocking: fconfigure channelId -blocking 0. Then read
behaves much like described above. Care must be taken when
using read on blocking serial ports:</p>

<p>read channelId numChars In this form read blocks until
numChars have been received from the serial port.</p>

<p>read channelId In this form read blocks until the
reception of the end-of-file character, see fconfigure
-eofchar. If there no end-of-file character has been
configured for the channel, then read will block
forever.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE This example code reads a file all at once, and
splits it into a list, with each line in the file
corresponding to an element in the list: set fl [open
/proc/meminfo] set data [read $fl] close $fl set lines
[split $data 0</p>
