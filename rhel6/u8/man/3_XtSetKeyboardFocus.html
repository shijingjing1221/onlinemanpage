XtSetKeyboardFocus(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtSetKeyboardFocus - focus events on a child
widget</p>

<p>SYNTAX XtSetKeyboardFocus(Widget subtree, Widget
descendant);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS subtree Specifies either the widget in the
subtree structure which is to receive the keyboard event, or
None. Note that it is not an error to specify None when no
input focus was previously set.</p>

<p>descendant Specifies the widget for which the keyboard
focus is to be set.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If a future KeyPress or KeyRelease event
occurs within the specified subtree, XtSetKeyboardFocus
causes XtDispatchEvent to remap and send the event to the
specified descendant widget.</p>

<p>When there is no modal cascade, keyboard events can
occur within a wid- get W in one of three ways:</p>

<p>&middot; W has the X input focus.</p>

<p>&middot; W has the keyboard focus of one of its
ancestors, and the event occurs within the ancestor or one
of the ancestor s descendants.</p>

<p>&middot; No ancestor of W has a descendant within the
keyboard focus, and the pointer is within W.</p>

<p>When there is a modal cascade, a widget W receives
keyboard events if an ancestor of W is in the active subset
of the modal cascade and one or more of the previous
conditions is True.</p>

<p>When subtree or one of its descendants acquires the X
input focus or the pointer moves into the subtree such that
keyboard events would now be delivered to subtree, a FocusIn
event is generated for the descen- dant if FocusNotify
events have been selected by the descendant. Simi- larly,
when W loses the X input focus or the keyboard focus for one
of its ancestors, a FocusOut event is generated for
descendant if FocusNo- tify events have been selected by the
descendant.</p>
