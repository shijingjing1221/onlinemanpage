<p>STRNCMP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRNCMP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strncmp - compare part of two strings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>int strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t
n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strncmp() function shall compare not
more than n bytes (bytes that follow a null byte are not
compared) from the array pointed to by s1 to the array
pointed to by s2.</p>

<p>The sign of a non-zero return value is determined by the
sign of the difference between the values of the first pair
of bytes (both inter- preted as type unsigned char) that
differ in the strings being com- pared.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, strncmp() shall
return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, if
the possibly null-terminated array pointed to by s1 is
greater than, equal to, or less than the possibly
null-terminated array pointed to by s2 respectively.</p>
