<p>NAME sasl_client_start - Begin an authentication
negotiation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sasl/sasl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sasl_client_start(sasl_conn_t * conn, const char *
mechlist, sasl_interact_t ** prompt_need, const char **
clientout, unsigned * clientoutlen, const char ** mech);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sasl_client_start() selects a mechanism for
authentication and starts the authentication session. The
mechlist is the list of mechanisms the client might like to
use. The mechanisms in the list are not necessar- ily
supported by the client or even valid. SASL determines which
of these to use based upon the security preferences
specified earlier. The list of mechanisms is typically a
list of mechanisms the server sup- ports acquired from a
capability request.</p>

<p>If SASL_INTERACT is returned the library needs some
values to be filled in before it can proceed. The
prompt_need structure will be filled in with requests. The
application should fulfill these requests and call
sasl_client_start again with identical parameters (the
prompt_need parameter will be the same pointer as before but
filled in by the application).</p>

<p>mechlist is a list of mechanisms the server has
available. Punctuation is ignored.</p>

<p>prompt_need is filled in with a list of prompts needed
to continue (if necessary).</p>

<p>clientout and clientoutlen is created. It is the initial
client response to send to the server. It is the job of the
client to send it over the network to the server. Any
protocol specific encoding (such as base64 encoding)
necessary needs to be done by the client.</p>

<p>If the protocol lacks client-send-first capability, then
set clientout to NULL.</p>

<p>If there is no initial client-send, then *clientout will
be set to NULL on return.</p>

<p>mech contains the name of the chosen SASL mechanism (on
success)</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE sasl_client_start returns an integer which
corresponds to one of the following codes. SASL_CONTINUE
indicates success and that there are more steps needed in
the authentication. All other return codes indi- cate errors
and should either be handled or the authentication session
should be quit.</p>
