<p>NAME slapo-refint - Referential Integrity overlay to
slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Referential Integrity overlay can be
used with a backend database such as slapd-bdb(5) to
maintain the cohesiveness of a schema which utilizes
reference attributes.</p>

<p>Integrity is maintained by updating database records
which contain the named attributes to match the results of a
modrdn or delete operation. For example, if the integrity
attribute were configured as manager, deletion of the record
&quot;uid=robert,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com&quot; would
trigger a search for all other records which have a manager
attribute containing that DN. Entries matching that search
would have their man- ager attribute removed. Or, renaming
the same record into
&quot;uid=george,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com&quot; would
trigger a search for all other records which have a manager
attribute containing that DN. Entries matching that search
would have their manager attribute deleted and replaced by
the new DN.</p>

<p>rootdn must be set for the database. refint runs as the
rootdn to gain access to make its updates. rootpw is not
needed.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION These slapd.conf options apply to the
Referential Integrity overlay. They should appear after the
overlay directive.</p>

<p>refint_attributes &lt;attribute&gt; [...] Specify one or
more attributes for which integrity will be main- tained as
described above.</p>

<p>refint_nothing &lt;string&gt; Specify an arbitrary value
to be used as a placeholder when the last value would
otherwise be deleted from an attribute. This can be useful
in cases where the schema requires the existence of an
attribute for which referential integrity is enforced. The
attempted deletion of a required attribute will otherwise
result in an Object Class Violation, causing the request to
fail. The string must be a valid DN.</p>

<p>refint_modifiersname &lt;DN&gt; Specify the DN to be
used as the modifiersName of the internal modifications
performed by the overlay. It defaults to &quot;cn=Ref-
erential Integrity Overlay&quot;.</p>

<p>Modifications performed by this overlay are not
propagated during replication. This overlay must be
configured identically on replication consumers in order to
maintain full synchronization with the provider.</p>
