<p>xcb_change_gc(3) XCB Requests xcb_change_gc(3)</p>

<p>NAME xcb_change_gc - change graphics context
components</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</p>

<p>Request function xcb_void_cookie_t
xcb_change_gc(xcb_connection_t *conn, xcb_gcontext_t gc,
uint32_t value_mask, const uint32_t *value_list);</p>

<p>REQUEST ARGUMENTS conn The XCB connection to X11.</p>

<p>gc The graphics context to change.</p>

<p>value_mask One of the following values:</p>

<p>XCB_GC_FUNCTION TODO: Refer to GX</p>

<p>XCB_GC_PLANE_MASK In graphics operations, given a source
and destina- tion pixel, the result is computed bitwise on
cor- responding bits of the pixels; that is, a Boolean
operation is performed in each bit plane. The plane-mask
restricts the operation to a subset of planes, so the result
is:</p>

<p>((src FUNC dst) AND plane-mask) OR (dst AND (NOT
plane-mask))</p>

<p>XCB_GC_FOREGROUND Foreground colorpixel.</p>

<p>XCB_GC_BACKGROUND Background colorpixel.</p>

<p>XCB_GC_LINE_WIDTH The line-width is measured in pixels
and can be greater than or equal to one, a wide line, or the
special value zero, a thin line.</p>

<p>XCB_GC_LINE_STYLE The line-style defines which sections
of a line are drawn: Solid The full path of the line is
drawn. DoubleDash The full path of the line is drawn, but
the even dashes are filled differently than the odd dashes
(see fill- style), with Butt cap-style used where even and
odd dashes meet. OnOffDash Only the even dashes are drawn,
and cap-style ap- plies to all internal ends of the
individual dashes (except NotLast is treated as Butt).</p>

<p>XCB_GC_CAP_STYLE The cap-style defines how the endpoints
of a path are drawn: NotLast The result is equivalent to
Butt, except that for a line-width of zero the fi- nal
endpoint is not drawn. Butt The result is square at the
endpoint (perpendicular to the slope of the line) with no
projection beyond. Round The result is a circular arc with
its diameter equal to the line-width, centered on the
endpoint; it is equivalent to Butt for line-width zero.
Projecting The result is square at the end, but the path
continues beyond the endpoint for a distance equal to half
the line-width; it is equivalent to Butt for line-width
zero.</p>

<p>XCB_GC_JOIN_STYLE The join-style defines how corners are
drawn for wide lines: Miter The outer edges of the two lines
extend to meet at an angle. However, if the angle is less
than 11 degrees, a Bevel join-style is used instead. Round
The result is a circular arc with a diameter equal to the
line-width, centered on the joinpoint. Bevel The result is
Butt endpoint styles, and then the triangular notch is
filled.</p>

<p>XCB_GC_FILL_STYLE The fill-style defines the contents of
the source for line, text, and fill requests. For all text
and fill requests (for example, PolyText8, PolyText16,
PolyFillRectangle, FillPoly, and PolyFillArc) as well as for
line requests with line-style Solid, (for example, PolyLine,
PolySegment, PolyRectangle, PolyArc) and for the even dashes
for line requests with line-style OnOffDash or DoubleDash:
Solid Foreground Tiled Tile Opaque- Stippled A tile with the
same width and height as stipple but with background
everywhere stipple has a zero and with foreground everywhere
stipple has a one Stippled Foreground masked by stipple For
the odd dashes for line requests with line-style DoubleDash:
Solid Background Tiled Same as for even dashes
OpaqueStippled Same as for even dashes Stippled Background
masked by stipple</p>

<p>XCB_GC_FILL_RULE</p>

<p>XCB_GC_TILE The tile/stipple represents an infinite
two-dimen- sional plane with the tile/stipple replicated in
all dimensions. When that plane is superimposed on the
drawable for use in a graphics operation, the upper-left
corner of some instance of the tile/stipple is at the
coordinates within the draw- able specified by the
tile/stipple origin. The tile/stipple and clip origins are
interpreted rela- tive to the origin of whatever destination
drawable is specified in a graphics request. The tile pixmap
must have the same root and depth as the gcontext (or a
Match error results). The stipple pixmap must have depth one
and must have the same root as the gcontext (or a Match
error results). For fill-style Stippled (but not fill-style
Opaque- Stippled), the stipple pattern is tiled in a single
plane and acts as an additional clip mask to be ANDed with
the clip-mask. Any size pixmap can be used for tiling or
stippling, although some sizes may be faster to use than
others.</p>

<p>XCB_GC_STIPPLE The tile/stipple represents an infinite
two-dimen- sional plane with the tile/stipple replicated in
all dimensions. When that plane is superimposed on the
drawable for use in a graphics operation, the upper-left
corner of some instance of the tile/stipple is at the
coordinates within the draw- able specified by the
tile/stipple origin. The tile/stipple and clip origins are
interpreted rela- tive to the origin of whatever destination
drawable is specified in a graphics request. The tile pixmap
must have the same root and depth as the gcontext (or a
Match error results). The stipple pixmap must have depth one
and must have the same root as the gcontext (or a Match
error results). For fill-style Stippled (but not fill-style
Opaque- Stippled), the stipple pattern is tiled in a single
plane and acts as an additional clip mask to be ANDed with
the clip-mask. Any size pixmap can be used for tiling or
stippling, although some sizes may be faster to use than
others.</p>

<p>XCB_GC_TILE_STIPPLE_ORIGIN_X TODO</p>

<p>XCB_GC_TILE_STIPPLE_ORIGIN_Y TODO</p>

<p>XCB_GC_FONT Which font to use for the ImageText8 and
Image- Text16 requests.</p>

<p>XCB_GC_SUBWINDOW_MODE For ClipByChildren, both source
and destination windows are additionally clipped by all
viewable InputOutput children. For IncludeInferiors, neither
source nor destination window is clipped by inferi- ors.
This will result in including subwindow con- tents in the
source and drawing through subwindow boundaries of the
destination. The use of Include- Inferiors with a source or
destination window of one depth with mapped inferiors of
differing depth is not illegal, but the semantics is
undefined by the core protocol.</p>

<p>XCB_GC_GRAPHICS_EXPOSURES Whether ExposureEvents should
be generated (1) or not (0).</p>

<p>The default is 1.</p>

<p>XCB_GC_CLIP_ORIGIN_X TODO</p>

<p>XCB_GC_CLIP_ORIGIN_Y TODO</p>

<p>XCB_GC_CLIP_MASK The clip-mask restricts writes to the
destination drawable. Only pixels where the clip-mask has
bits set to 1 are drawn. Pixels are not drawn outside the
area covered by the clip-mask or where the clip-mask has
bits set to 0. The clip-mask affects all graphics requests,
but it does not clip sources. The clip-mask origin is
interpreted rela- tive to the origin of whatever destination
drawable is specified in a graphics request. If a pixmap is
specified as the clip-mask, it must have depth 1 and have
the same root as the gcontext (or a Match error results). If
clip-mask is None, then pixels are always drawn, regardless
of the clip origin. The clip-mask can also be set with the
SetClipRect- angles request.</p>

<p>XCB_GC_DASH_OFFSET TODO</p>

<p>XCB_GC_DASH_LIST TODO</p>

<p>XCB_GC_ARC_MODE TODO</p>

<p>value_list Values for each of the components specified
in the bitmask value_mask. The order has to correspond to
the order of pos- sible value_mask bits. See the
example.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Changes the components specified by
value_mask for the specified graph- ics context.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if
any) have to be handled in the event loop.</p>

<p>If you want to handle errors directly with
xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_change_gc_checked. See
xcb-requests(3) for details.</p>

the requested resources (no memory?).</p>
