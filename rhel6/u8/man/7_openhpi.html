<p>NAME openhpi - an implementation of the SA Forum s
Hardware Platform Interface</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OpenHPI is an implementation of the SA
Forums Hardware Platform Interface, which provides a
standard C library interface to manage, monitor, and control
hardware (both local and remote).</p>

<p>OpenHPI 2.x implements the HPI B.01.01
specification.</p>

<p>The OpenHPI client library (libopenhpi) provides all the
connection functionality needed by the client application to
connect to the OpenHPI daemon running on the local or remote
server.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES Some of OpenHPI s functioning
can be changed by setting environment variables. This
documents all client environmental settings.</p>

<p>OPENHPI_DAEMON_HOST=URL URL for the host running the
daemon. This can be &quot;localhost&quot; (default) if the
daemon is running on the local host or an ip address.</p>

<p>OPENHPI_DAEMON_PORT=PORT_NUMBER The port number the host
is listening on for clent connections. Default port is
4743.</p>

<p>HARDWARE SUPPORT OpenHPI provides a number of plugins
that talk to different hardware types. The following is a
list of tested plugins in OpenHPI 2.x.</p>

<p>ipmi An IPMI plugin that can talk locally (via smi
interface and OpenIPMI device driver) or remotely (via IPMI
over LAN). It supports IPMI 1.5 for standard rackmount
servers, and some of IPMI 2.0 for support of ATCA
chassis.</p>

<p>IPMI plugin depends on libOpenIPMI version 1.4.x.</p>

<p>ipmidirect An IPMI plugin designed specifically for ATCA
chassis. It implements IPMI commands directly in the
plugin.</p>

<p>snmp_bc An SNMP based plugin that can communicate with
IBM BladeCenter, as well as IBM xSeries servers with RSA 1
adapters.</p>

<p>SNMP_BC plugin depends on net-snmp &gt; 5.0.7.</p>
