<p>Tcl_CreateInterp(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_CreateInterp(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_CreateInterp, Tcl_DeleteInterp,
Tcl_InterpDeleted - create and delete Tcl command
interpreters</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_Interp * Tcl_CreateInterp()</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteInterp(interp)</p>

<p>int Tcl_InterpDeleted(interp)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Token for interpreter
to be destroyed.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_CreateInterp creates a new interpreter
structure and returns a token for it. The token is required
in calls to most other Tcl proce- dures, such as
Tcl_CreateCommand, Tcl_Eval, and Tcl_DeleteInterp. Clients
are only allowed to access a few of the fields of Tcl_Interp
structures; see the Tcl_Interp and Tcl_CreateCommand man
pages for details. The new interpreter is initialized with
the built-in Tcl com- mands and with the variables
documented in tclvars(n). To bind in additional commands,
call Tcl_CreateCommand.</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteInterp marks an interpreter as deleted; the
interpreter will eventually be deleted when all calls to
Tcl_Preserve for it have been matched by calls to
Tcl_Release. At that time, all of the resources associated
with it, including variables, procedures, and application-
specific command bindings, will be deleted. After
Tcl_DeleteInterp returns any attempt to use Tcl_Eval on the
interpreter will fail and return TCL_ERROR. After the call
to Tcl_DeleteInterp it is safe to examine the interpreters
result, query or set the values of variables, define,
undefine or retrieve procedures, and examine the runtime
evalu- ation stack. See below, in the section INTERPRETERS
AND MEMORY MANAGE- MENT for details.</p>

<p>Tcl_InterpDeleted returns nonzero if Tcl_DeleteInterp
was called with interp as its argument; this indicates that
the interpreter will even- tually be deleted, when the last
call to Tcl_Preserve for it is matched by a call to
Tcl_Release. If nonzero is returned, further calls to
Tcl_Eval in this interpreter will return TCL_ERROR.</p>

<p>Tcl_InterpDeleted is useful in deletion callbacks to
distinguish between when only the memory the callback is
responsible for is being deleted and when the whole
interpreter is being deleted. In the former case the
callback may recreate the data being deleted, but this would
lead to an infinite loop if the interpreter were being
deleted.</p>

<p>INTERPRETERS AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT Tcl_DeleteInterp can
be called at any time on an interpreter that may be used by
nested evaluations and C code in various extensions. Tcl
implements a simple mechanism that allows callers to use
interpreters without worrying about the interpreter being
deleted in a nested call, and without requiring special code
to protect the interpreter, in most cases. This mechanism
ensures that nested uses of an interpreter can safely
continue using it even after Tcl_DeleteInterp is called.</p>

<p>The mechanism relies on matching up calls to
Tcl_Preserve with calls to Tcl_Release. If Tcl_DeleteInterp
has been called, only when the last call to Tcl_Preserve is
matched by a call to Tcl_Release, will the interpreter be
freed. See the manual entry for Tcl_Preserve for a
description of these functions.</p>

<p>The rules for when the user of an interpreter must call
Tcl_Preserve and Tcl_Release are simple:</p>

<p>Interpreters Passed As Arguments Functions that are
passed an interpreter as an argument can safely use the
interpreter without any special protection. Thus, when you
write an extension consisting of new Tcl commands, no
special code is needed to protect interpreters received as
argu- ments. This covers the majority of all uses.</p>

<p>Interpreter Creation And Deletion When a new interpreter
is created and used in a call to Tcl_Eval, Tcl_VarEval,
Tcl_GlobalEval, Tcl_SetVar, or Tcl_Get- Var, a pair of calls
to Tcl_Preserve and Tcl_Release should be wrapped around all
uses of the interpreter. Remember that it is unsafe to use
the interpreter once Tcl_Release has been called. To ensure
that the interpreter is properly deleted when it is no
longer needed, call Tcl_InterpDeleted to test if some other
code already called Tcl_DeleteInterp; if not, call
Tcl_DeleteInterp before calling Tcl_Release in your own
code.</p>

<p>Retrieving An Interpreter From A Data Structure When an
interpreter is retrieved from a data structure (e.g. the
client data of a callback) for use in Tcl_Eval, Tcl_VarEval,
Tcl_GlobalEval, Tcl_SetVar, or Tcl_GetVar, a pair of calls
to Tcl_Preserve and Tcl_Release should be wrapped around all
uses of the interpreter; it is unsafe to reuse the
interpreter once Tcl_Release has been called. If an
interpreter is stored inside a callback data structure, an
appropriate deletion cleanup mech- anism should be set up by
the code that creates the data struc- ture so that the
interpreter is removed from the data structure (e.g. by
setting the field to NULL) when the interpreter is deleted.
Otherwise, you may be using an interpreter that has been
freed and whose memory may already have been reused.</p>

<p>All uses of interpreters in Tcl and Tk have already been
protected. Extension writers should ensure that their code
also properly protects any additional interpreters used, as
described above.</p>
