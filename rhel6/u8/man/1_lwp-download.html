<p>NAME lwp-download - Fetch large files from the web</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lwp-download [-a] &lt;url&gt; [&lt;local
path&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The lwp-download program will save the file
at url to a local file.</p>

<p>If local path is not specified, then the current
directory is assumed.</p>

<p>If local path is a directory, then the basename of the
file to save is picked up from the Content-Disposition
header or the URL of the response. If the file already
exists, then lwp-download will prompt before it overwrites
and will fail if its standard input is not a terminal. This
form of invocation will also fail is no acceptable filename
can be derived from the sources mentioned above.</p>

<p>If local path is not a directory, then it is simply used
as the path to save into.</p>

<p>The lwp-download program is implemented using the
libwww-perl library. It is better suited to down load big
files than the lwp-request program because it does not store
the file in memory. Another benefit is that it will keep you
updated about its progress and that you dont have much
options to worry about.</p>

<p>Use the &quot;-a&quot; option to save the file in text
(ascii) mode. Might make a difference on dosish systems.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Fetch the newest and greatest perl version:</p>

<p>$ lwp-download
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/latest.tar.gz Saving to
&rsquo;latest.tar.gz&rsquo;... 11.4 MB received in 8 seconds
(1.43 MB/sec)</p>
