<p>NAME htpurge - remove unused odocuments from the
database (general mainte- nance script)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS htpurge [-][-a][-c configfile][-u][-v]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Htpurge functions to remove specified URLs
from the databases as well as bad URLs, unretrieved URLs,
obsolete documents, etc. It is recom- mended that htpurge be
run after htdig to clean out any documents of this sort.</p>

<p>OPTIONS</p>

<p>- Take URL list from standard input (rather than
specified with -u). Format of input file is one URL per
line. -a Use alternate work files. Tells htpurge to append
.work to database files, causing a second copy of the
database to be built. This allows the original files to be
used by htsearch during the run.</p>

<p>-c configfile Use the specified configfile instead of
the default.</p>

<p>-u URL Add this URL to the list of documents to remove.
Must be speci- fied multiple times if more than one URL are
to be removed. Should nor be used together with -.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode. This increases the verbosity of the
program. Using more than 2 is probably only useful for
debugging pur- poses. The default verbose mode (using only
one -v) gives a nice progress report while digging.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/htdig/htdig.conf The default configuration
file.</p>
