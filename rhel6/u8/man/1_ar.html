<p>NAME ar - create, modify, and extract from archives</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ar [--plugin name] [-X32_64] [-]p[mod [relpos]
[count]] archive [member...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The GNU ar program creates, modifies, and
extracts from archives. An archive is a single file holding
a collection of other files in a structure that makes it
possible to retrieve the original individual files (called
members of the archive).</p>

<p>The original files contents, mode (permissions),
timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive,
and can be restored on extraction.</p>

<p>GNU ar can maintain archives whose members have names of
any length; however, depending on how ar is configured on
your system, a limit on member-name length may be imposed
for compatibility with archive formats maintained with other
tools. If it exists, the limit is often 15 characters
(typical of formats related to a.out) or 16 characters
(typical of formats related to coff).</p>

<p>ar is considered a binary utility because archives of
this sort are most often used as libraries holding commonly
needed subroutines.</p>

<p>ar creates an index to the symbols defined in
relocatable object modules in the archive when you specify
the modifier s. Once created, this index is updated in the
archive whenever ar makes a change to its contents (save for
the q update operation). An archive with such an index
speeds up linking to the library, and allows routines in the
library to call each other without regard to their placement
in the archive.</p>

<p>You may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index
table. If an archive lacks the table, another form of ar
called ranlib can be used to add just the table.</p>

<p>GNU ar can optionally create a thin archive, which
contains a symbol index and references to the original
copies of the member files of the archives. Such an archive
is useful for building libraries for use within a local
build, where the relocatable objects are expected to remain
available, and copying the contents of each object would
only waste time and space. Thin archives are also flattened,
so that adding one or more archives to a thin archive will
add the elements of the nested archive individually. The
paths to the elements of the archive are stored relative to
the archive itself.</p>

<p>GNU ar is designed to be compatible with two different
facilities. You can control its activity using command-line
options, like the different varieties of ar on Unix systems;
or, if you specify the single command- line option -M, you
can control it with a script supplied via standard input,
like the MRI &quot;librarian&quot; program.</p>

<p>OPTIONS GNU ar allows you to mix the operation code p
and modifier flags mod in any order, within the first
command-line argument.</p>

<p>If you wish, you may begin the first command-line
argument with a dash.</p>

<p>The p keyletter specifies what operation to execute; it
may be any of the following, but you must specify only one
of them:</p>

<p>d Delete modules from the archive. Specify the names of
modules to be deleted as member...; the archive is untouched
if you specify no files to delete.</p>

<p>If you specify the v modifier, ar lists each module as
it is deleted.</p>

<p>m Use this operation to move members in an archive.</p>

<p>The ordering of members in an archive can make a
difference in how programs are linked using the library, if
a symbol is defined in more than one member.</p>

<p>If no modifiers are used with &quot;m&quot;, any members
you name in the member arguments are moved to the end of the
archive; you can use the a, b, or i modifiers to move them
to a specified place instead.</p>

<p>p Print the specified members of the archive, to the
standard output file. If the v modifier is specified, show
the member name before copying its contents to standard
output.</p>

<p>If you specify no member arguments, all the files in the
archive are printed.</p>

<p>q Quick append; Historically, add the files member... to
the end of archive, without checking for replacement.</p>

<p>The modifiers a, b, and i do not affect this operation;
new members are always placed at the end of the archive.</p>

<p>The modifier v makes ar list each file as it is
appended.</p>

<p>Since the point of this operation is speed, the archives
symbol table index is not updated, even if it already
existed; you can use ar s or ranlib explicitly to update the
symbol table index.</p>

<p>However, too many different systems assume quick append
rebuilds the index, so GNU ar implements q as a synonym for
r.</p>

<p>r Insert the files member... into archive (with
replacement). This operation differs from q in that any
previously existing members are deleted if their names match
those being added.</p>

<p>If one of the files named in member... does not exist,
ar displays an error message, and leaves undisturbed any
existing members of the archive matching that name.</p>

<p>By default, new members are added at the end of the
file; but you may use one of the modifiers a, b, or i to
request placement relative to some existing member.</p>

<p>The modifier v used with this operation elicits a line
of output for each file inserted, along with one of the
letters a or r to indicate whether the file was appended (no
old member deleted) or replaced.</p>

<p>t Display a table listing the contents of archive, or
those of the files listed in member... that are present in
the archive. Normally only the member name is shown; if you
also want to see the modes (permissions), timestamp, owner,
group, and size, you can request that by also specifying the
v modifier.</p>

<p>If you do not specify a member, all files in the archive
are listed.</p>

<p>If there is more than one file with the same name (say,
fie) in an archive (say b.a), ar t b.a fie lists only the
first instance; to see them all, you must ask for a complete
listing---in our example, ar t b.a.</p>

<p>x Extract members (named member) from the archive. You
can use the v modifier with this operation, to request that
ar list each name as it extracts it.</p>

<p>If you do not specify a member, all files in the archive
are extracted.</p>

<p>Files cannot be extracted from a thin archive.</p>

<p>A number of modifiers (mod) may immediately follow the p
keyletter, to specify variations on an operations
behavior:</p>

<p>a Add new files after an existing member of the archive.
If you use the modifier a, the name of an existing archive
member must be present as the relpos argument, before the
archive specification.</p>

<p>b Add new files before an existing member of the
archive. If you use the modifier b, the name of an existing
archive member must be present as the relpos argument,
before the archive specification. (same as i).</p>

<p>c Create the archive. The specified archive is always
created if it did not exist, when you request an update. But
a warning is issued unless you specify in advance that you
expect to create it, by using this modifier.</p>

<p>D Operate in deterministic mode. When adding files and
the archive index use zero for UIDs, GIDs, timestamps, and
use consistent file modes for all files. When this option is
used, if ar is used with identical options and identical
input files, multiple runs will create identical output
files regardless of the input files owners, groups, file
modes, or modification times.</p>

<p>f Truncate names in the archive. GNU ar will normally
permit file names of any length. This will cause it to
create archives which are not compatible with the native ar
program on some systems. If this is a concern, the f
modifier may be used to truncate file names when putting
them in the archive.</p>

<p>i Insert new files before an existing member of the
archive. If you use the modifier i, the name of an existing
archive member must be present as the relpos argument,
before the archive specification. (same as b).</p>

<p>l This modifier is accepted but not used.</p>

<p>N Uses the count parameter. This is used if there are
multiple entries in the archive with the same name. Extract
or delete instance count of the given name from the
archive.</p>

<p>o Preserve the original dates of members when extracting
them. If you do not specify this modifier, files extracted
from the archive are stamped with the time of
extraction.</p>

<p>P Use the full path name when matching names in the
archive. GNU ar can not create an archive with a full path
name (such archives are not POSIX complaint), but other
archive creators can. This option will cause GNU ar to match
file names using a complete path name, which can be
convenient when extracting a single file from an archive
created by another tool.</p>

<p>s Write an object-file index into the archive, or update
an existing one, even if no other change is made to the
archive. You may use this modifier flag either with any
operation, or alone. Running ar s on an archive is
equivalent to running ranlib on it.</p>

<p>S Do not generate an archive symbol table. This can
speed up building a large library in several steps. The
resulting archive can not be used with the linker. In order
to build a symbol table, you must omit the S modifier on the
last execution of ar, or you must run ranlib on the
archive.</p>

<p>T Make the specified archive a thin archive. If it
already exists and is a regular archive, the existing
members must be present in the same directory as
archive.</p>

<p>u Normally, ar r... inserts all files listed into the
archive. If you would like to insert only those of the files
you list that are newer than existing members of the same
names, use this modifier. The u modifier is allowed only for
the operation r (replace). In particular, the combination qu
is not allowed, since checking the timestamps would lose any
speed advantage from the operation q.</p>

<p>v This modifier requests the verbose version of an
operation. Many operations display additional information,
such as filenames processed, when the modifier v is
appended.</p>

<p>V This modifier shows the version number of ar.</p>

<p>ar ignores an initial option spelt -X32_64, for
compatibility with AIX. The behaviour produced by this
option is the default for GNU ar. ar does not support any of
the other -X options; in particular, it does not support
-X32 which is the default for AIX ar.</p>

<p>The optional command line switch --plugin name causes ar
to load the plugin called name which adds support for more
file formats. This option is only available if the toolchain
has been built with plugin support enabled.</p>

<p>@file Read command-line options from file. The options
read are inserted in place of the original @file option. If
file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will
be treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p>Options in file are separated by whitespace. A
whitespace character may be included in an option by
surrounding the entire option in either single or double
quotes. Any character (including a backslash) may be
included by prefixing the character to be included with a
backslash. The file may itself contain additional @file
options; any such options will be processed recursively.</p>
