<p>NAME ldns-test-edns - test if dns cache supports EDNS
and DNSSEC.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ldns-test-edns [ -i ] { ip }</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ldns-test-edns tests a DNS cache and checks
if it supports EDNS0 and DNSSEC types so that it can be used
as a dnssec-enabled DNS cache. It sends two queries to the
cache, one for the root key and one for a DS record. These
must succeed, the answer must have EDNS, that type and
signatures.</p>

<p>If the IP address is good for DNSSEC, it is printed with
OK. Other- wise short description is given of the failure.
If OK is given, the cache should be good to use as a cache
for a local configured DNSSEC validator.</p>

<p>The tool assumes the root is signed and Sweden is
signed. Also, the queries are sent with the CD flag, the
tool does not check that the results are validated, but that
they can be validated.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -i option enables a mode where the working IP
addresses are printed after another, with no other
explanations, and if none work or no IP addresses are on the
input, off is printed.</p>

<p>ldns-test-edns takes one or more IP addresses, it checks
them in turn. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be given. The exit
value is for the last checked IP address: 0 is OK, 1 is
failure, 2 is some sort of network failure.</p>
