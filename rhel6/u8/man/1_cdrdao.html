<p>DESCRIPTION cdrdao creates audio and data CD-Rs in
disk-at-once (DAO) mode driven by a description file called
toc-file. In DAO mode it is possible to create non standard
track pre-gaps that have other lengths than 2 sec- onds and
contain nonzero audio data. This is for example useful to
divide live recordings into tracks where 2 second gaps would
be kind of irritating.</p>

<p>Instead of a toc-file a cue file (used by a famous
DOS/Windows master- ing tool) may be used. See the CUE FILES
section for more details.</p>

<p>COMMANDS The first argument must be one of the following
commands:</p>

<p>show-toc Print out a summary about what will be written
to the CD-R.</p>

<p>read-toc Analyze each track of the inserted CD and
create a toc-file that can be used to make a more or less
exact copy of the CD. This command does not read out the
audio or data tracks, use read-cd for this purpose.</p>

<p>You can specify a filename for the data file via the
--datafile option.</p>

<p>read-cd Copies all tracks of the inserted CD to an image
file and cre- ates a corresponding toc-file. The name of the
image file defaults to &quot;data.bin&quot; if no --datafile
option is given.</p>

<p>read-cddb Tries to retrieve title and artist data from a
CDDB server for the CD represented by the given toc-file.
The retrieved data is added as CD-TEXT data for language 0
to the toc-file. Existing CD-TEXT data for language 0 will
be overwritten.</p>

<p>show-data Print out all samples that would be written to
the CD-R. Each line contains the sample number (starting at
0) and the decimal sample value for the left and right
channel. Useful to check if the byte order of audio files is
correct.</p>

<p>read-test Check if all data can be read from the audio
files that are defined in the toc-file. This will also check
the communication with the slave process that is responsible
for writing the audio data to the CD-recorder. Mainly used
for testing.</p>

<p>disk-info Shows information about the inserted CD-R. If
the CD-R has an open session it will also print the start of
the last and cur- rent session which is used by mkisofs to
create an image for a second or higher session.</p>

<p>msinfo Shows information required for creating multi
session disks with mkisofs. The output is meant for
processing by scripts.</p>

<p>unlock Tries to unlock the recorder device after a
failed write or sim- ulation run. If you cannot eject the CD
after a cdrdao run try this command.</p>

<p>blank Blanks a CD-RW. The CD-RW is minimally blanked by
default. Use option --blank-mode to select another blanking
mode. Sometimes the blanking speed must be manually reduced
for a successful blanking operation. Use option --speed to
select another blank- ing speed.</p>

<p>simulate Like write but laser stays cold. It is a
shortcut for write --simulate.</p>

<p>write Write the CD-R according to the specifications in
the toc-file.</p>

<p>copy Performs all steps to copy a CD. The device
containing the source CD must be specified with option
--source-device and the recorder device with option
--device. If only a single device is available the option
--source-device must be omitted and cdr- dao will prompt to
insert the CD-R after an image of the source CD was
created.</p>

<p>The image file with name
&quot;cddata&lt;pid&gt;.bin&quot; will be created in the
current working directory if no --datafile option is given.
The created image will be removed after it has been
written.</p>

<p>If option --on-the-fly is given no image file is created
and the data will be directly piped from the reading device
to the CD recorder.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --device [prot:]bus,id,lun Sets the SCSI address
of the CD-recorder in form of a bus/id/lun triple, e.g.
0,2,0 for the logical unit 0 of SCSI device with ID 2 on bus
0. ATAPI devices can be specified by using the pre- fix
ATAPI:, e.g. ATAPI:0,0,0. On some systems a device node may
be specified directly, e.g. /dev/sg0 on Linux systems. Linux
2.6 users may also try the newer ATAPI interface with the
ATA: prefix.</p>

<p>--source-device [prot:]bus,id,lun Like above but used
for the copy command to specify the source device.</p>

<p>--driver driver-id:option-flags Force usage of specified
driver instead of the automatically determined driver.
Available driver IDs: cdd2600, plextor, plextor-scan,
generic-mmc, generic-mmc-raw, ricoh-mp6200, yamaha-cdr10x,
teac-cdr55, sony-cdu920, sony- cdu948, taiyo-yuden, toshiba.
Specifying an illegal driver ID will give a list of
available drivers. Option flags may be used to modify the
behavior of some drivers. See README for details.</p>

<p>--source-driver driver-id:option-flags Like above but
used for the device specified with option
--source-device.</p>

<p>--speed value Set the writing speed to value. Default is
the highest possible speed.</p>

<p>--blank-mode mode Sets the blanking mode. Available
modes are full and minimal. Please consider that the data of
minimally blanked disks may be easily recovered. Use the
full blanking mode for completely erasing all data. The
default blanking mode is minimal.</p>

<p>--datafile file Used for read-toc, read-cd and copy. Set
the default data file placed in the toc-file by read-toc.
Use &quot;-&quot; to indicate STDIN. For commands read-cd
and copy it specifies the name of the cre- ated image
file.</p>

<p>--read-raw Only used for commands read-cd and read-toc.
All data sectors will be written as 2352 byte blocks
including the sector header and L-EC data to the image file.
The track mode will be set to MODE1_RAW or MODE2_RAW in the
created toc-file.</p>

<p>--read-subchan mode Used by commands read-cd, read-toc
and copy. Specifies the type of sub-channel data that is
extracted from the source CD and written to the track image
or copied to the destination CD. Mode may be rw for reading
packed R-W sub-channel data (de- interleaved and error
corrected) and rw_raw for reading raw R-W sub-channel data
(not de-interleaved, not error corrected, L-EC data included
in the track image). If this option is not speci- fied no
sub-channel data will be extracted.</p>

<p>--no-mode2-mixed Only used for commands read-cd and
read-toc. If we have MODE2_FORM1 or MODE2_FORM2, don t
extract it as MODE2_FORM_MIX. toc-file.</p>

<p>--tao-source This option indicates to the commands
read-toc and read-cd that the source CD was written in TAO
mode. It will be assumed that the pre-gap length between all
tracks (except between two audio tracks) is the standard 150
blocks plus the number of link blocks (usually 2). The
number of link blocks can be controlled with option
--tao-source-adjust.</p>

<p>Use this option only if read-toc or read-cd give error
messages in the transition areas between two tracks. If you
use this option with pressed CDs or CDs written in DAO mode
you will get wrong results.</p>

<p>--tao-source-adjust link-blocks Specifies the number of
link blocks for tracks written in TAO mode. This option has
only an effect if option --tao-source is given.</p>

<p>--fast-toc Only used for command read-toc. This option
suppresses the pre- gap length and index mark extraction
which speeds up the read- toc process. Standard 2 second
pre-gaps (but no silence!) will be placed into the toc-file.
The resulting CD will sound like the source CD. Only the CD
player s display will behave slightly different in the
transition area between two tracks.</p>

<p>This option might help, too, if read-toc fails with your
drive otherwise.</p>

<p>--buffers buffer-count Specifies the number of buffers
that are allocated to avoid buffer under runs. The minimal
buffer count is fixed to 10, default is 32 except on FreeBSD
systems, on which default is 20. Each buffer holds 1 second
of audio data so that dividing buffer-count by the writing
speed gives the maximum time for which reading of audio data
may be stalled.</p>

<p>--multi If this option is given the session will not be
closed after the audio data is successfully written. It is
possible to append another session on such disks, e.g. to
create a CD-EXTRA.</p>

<p>--overburn By default cdrdao will not allow to write
more data on a medium than specified by the current medium.
This option allows to ignore this condition.</p>

<p>--eject Eject the CD-R after writing or write
simulation.</p>

<p>--swap Swap the byte order of all samples that are send
to the CD- recorder.</p>

<p>--session session-nr Used for read-toc and read-cd to
specify the session which should be processed on multi
session CDs.</p>

<p>--reload Indicates that the tray may be opened before
writing without prompting the user to reset the disk status
after a simulation run.</p>

<p>--force Forces the execution of an operation that
otherwise would not be performed.</p>

<p>--paranoia-mode mode Sets the correction mode for
digital audio extraction. 0: No checking, data is copied
directly from the drive. 1: Perform overlapped reading to
avoid jitter. 2: Like 1 but with addi- tional checks of the
read audio data. 3: Like 2 but with addi- tional scratch
detection and repair.</p>

<p>The extraction speed reduces from 0 to 3.</p>

<p>Default is the full paranoia mode (3).</p>

<p>--keepimage If a CD is copied with command copy this
option will cause that the created image is not removed
after the copy process has fin- ished.</p>

<p>--on-the-fly Perform CD copy on the fly without creating
an image file.</p>

<p>--with-cddb Enables the automatic fetching of CDDB data
for use as CD-TEXT data for commands copy, read-toc and
read-cd.</p>

<p>--cddb-servers server-list Sets space or , separated
list of CDDB servers used for com- mand read-cddb or for
commands where the --with-cddb option is active. A server
entry may have the following forms:</p>

<p>&lt;server&gt; Connect to &lt;server&gt;, default cddbp
port (888), use cddbp proto- col.</p>

<p>&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt; Connect to &lt;server&gt;,
port &lt;port&gt;, use cddbp protocol.</p>

<p>&lt;server&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt; Connect to
&lt;server&gt;, default http port (80), use http protocol,
url: &lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt; Connect
to &lt;server&gt;, port &lt;port&gt;, use http protocol,
url: &lt;cgi- bin-path&gt;.</p>


<p>&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;:&lt;proxy-server&gt;
Connect to &lt;proxy-server&gt;, default http port (80), use
http pro- tocol, url:
http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;.</p>


<p>&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;:&lt;proxy-server&gt;:&lt;proxy-port&gt;
Connect to &lt;proxy-server&gt;, port &lt;proxy-port&gt;,
use http protocol, url:
http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;.</p>

<p>The &lt;cgi-bin-path&gt; is usually
&quot;/~cddb/cddb.cgi&quot;.</p>

<p>All servers of the server list will be tried in the
given order until a successful connection can be
established. For http proxy servers the first successful
connected http proxy server will be used independent of the
ability to connect to the target http server.</p>

<p>Example: freedb.freedb.org:/~cddb/cddb.cgi</p>

<p>--cddb-timeout timeout Sets the timeout in seconds used
for connections to CDDB servers.</p>

<p>--cddb-directory directory Specifies the local CDDB
database directory where fetched CDDB records will be
stored. If this option is not given a fetched CDDB record
will not be stored locally.</p>

<p>--tmpdir directory Specifies the directory in which to
store temporary data files created from decoding MP3 and Ogg
Vorbis files. By default, &quot;/tmp&quot; is used.</p>

<p>--keep Upon exit from cdrdao, do not delete temporary
WAV files created from MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files.</p>

<p>--save Saves some of the current options to the settings
file &quot;$HOME/.cdrdao&quot; and exit. See section
&acute;SETTINGS&acute; for more details.</p>

<p>-n Suppresses the 10 second pause before writing or
simulating.</p>

<p>-v verbose-level Sets verbose level. Levels &gt; 2 are
debug levels which produce a lot of output.</p>

<p>TOC FILES The toc-file describes what data is written to
the CD-R and allows con- trol over track/index positions,
pre-gaps and sub-channel information. It is a simple text
file, use your favorite text editor to create it.</p>

<p>A toc-file contains an optional header and a sequence of
track specifications. Comments starting with // reaching
until end of line can be placed anywhere.</p>

<p>Header CATALOG &quot;ddddddddddddd&quot; Specifies the
optional catalog number of the CD. The string must contain
exactly 13 digits.</p>

<p>The following flags specify the type of session that
will be created. It is used to create the correct CD-TOC
format and to check the consis- tency of the track modes for
the desired session type. If multiple flags are given the
last one will take effect.</p>

<p>CD_DA The disc contains only audio tracks.</p>

<p>CD_ROM The disc contains just mode 1 tracks or mode 1
and audio tracks (mixed mode CD).</p>

<p>CD_ROM_XA The disc contains mode 2 form 1 or mode 2 form
2 tracks. Audio tracks are allowed, too. This type must be
used if multi session disks are created (option
--multi).</p>

<p>CD_TEXT { ... } Defines global CD-TEXT data like the
album title and the used languages. See the CD-TEXT section
below for the syntax of the CD-TEXT block contents.</p>

<p>Track Specification TRACK &lt;track-mode&gt;
[&lt;sub-channel-mode&gt;] Starts a new track, the track
number is incremented by 1. The length of a track must be at
least 4 seconds. The block length of the input data depends
on the &lt;track-mode&gt;: AUDIO: 2352 bytes (588 samples),
MODE1: 2048 bytes, MODE1_RAW: 2352 bytes, MODE2: 2336 bytes,
MODE2_FORM1: 2048 bytes, MODE2_FORM2: 2324 bytes,
MODE2_FORM_MIX: 2336 bytes including the sub-header,
MODE2_RAW: 2352 bytes. The &lt;sub-channel-mode&gt; is
optional. If given it specifies the type of sub-channel data
for each sector. RW: packed R-W sub-channel data (96 bytes,
L-EC data will be gener- ated if required), RW_RAW: raw R-W
sub-channel data (interleaved and L-EC data already
calculated, 96 bytes). The block length is increased by the
sub-channel data length if a &lt;sub-channel-mode&gt; is
specified. If the input data length is not a multiple of the
block length it will be padded with zeros.</p>

<p>The following flags may follow the track start
statement. They are used to set sub-channel information for
the current track. Each flag is optional. If not given the
following defaults are used: copy not per- mitted, no pre
emphasis, two channel audio, no ISRC code.</p>

<p>[ NO ] COPY Sets or clears the copy permitted flag.</p>

<p>[ NO ] PRE_EMPHASIS Sets or clears the pre emphasis flag
(only for audio tracks).</p>

<p>TWO_CHANNEL_AUDIO Indicates that track contains two
channel audio data (only for audio tracks).</p>

<p>FOUR_CHANNEL_AUDIO Indicates that track contains four
channel audio data (only for audio tracks).</p>

<p>ISRC &quot;CCOOOYYSSSSS&quot; Sets ISRC code of track
(only for audio tracks). C: country code (upper case letters
or digits) O: owner code (upper case letters or digits) Y:
year (digits) S: serial number (digits)</p>

<p>An optional CD-TEXT block that defines the CD-TEXT data
for this track may follow. See the CD-TEXT section below for
the syntax of the CD-TEXT block contents.</p>

<p>CD_TEXT { ... }</p>

<p>At least one of the following statements must appear to
specify the data for the current track. Lengths and start
positions may be expressed in samples (1/44100 seconds) for
audio tracks or in bytes for data tracks. It is also
possible to give the length in blocks with the MSF format
MM:SS:FF specifying minutes, seconds and frames (0 &lt;= FF
&lt; 75) . A frame equals one block.</p>

<p>If more than one statement is used the track will be
composed by con- catenating the data in the specified
order.</p>

<p>SILENCE &lt;length&gt; Adds zero audio data of specified
length to the current audio track. Useful to create silent
pre-gaps.</p>

<p>ZERO &lt;length&gt; Adds zero data to data tracks. Must
be used to define pre- or post-gaps between tracks of
different mode.</p>

<p>[ FILE | AUDIOFILE ] &quot;&lt;filename&gt;&quot;
&lt;start&gt; [ &lt;length&gt; ] Adds the audio data of
specified file to the current audio track. It is possible to
select a portion of an audio file with &lt;start&gt; and
&lt;length&gt; which allows non destructive cutting. The
first sample of an audio file is addressed with
&lt;start&gt; = 0. If &lt;length&gt; is omitted or set to 0
all audio data from &lt;start&gt; until the end of file is
used.</p>

<p>Audio files may have raw or WAVE format with 16 bits per
sample, 44.1 kHz sampling rate, stereo. Raw files must have
the layout MSBLeft LSBLeft MSBRight LSBRight ... (big endian
byte order). WAVE files are expected to have little endian
byte order. The option --swap reverses the expected byte
order for all raw and WAVE files. Only filenames with a
&quot;.wav&quot; ending are treated as WAVE files, all other
names are assumed to be raw audio files. Use tools like
sox(1) to convert other file formats to supported
formats.</p>

<p>Specifying a &quot;-&quot; as filename causes data to be
read from STDIN. Currently only raw files are supported from
STDIN.</p>

<p>If you are unsure about the byte order of your audio
files try the command show-data. If the byte order is
correct you will see a sequence of increasing or decreasing
numbers for both channels. Otherwise numbers are jumping
between very high and low values - high volume static.</p>

<p>DATAFILE &quot;&lt;filename&gt;&quot; [ &lt;length&gt; ]
Adds data from given file to the current data track. If
&lt;length&gt; is omitted the actual file length will be
used.</p>

<p>FIFO &quot;&lt;fifo path&gt;&quot; &lt;length&gt; Adds
data from specified FIFO path to the current audio or data
track. &lt;length&gt; must specify the amount of data that
will be read from the FIFO. The value is always in terms of
bytes (scalar value) or in terms of the block length (MSF
value).</p>

<p>START [ MM:SS:FF ] Defines the length of the pre-gap
(position where index switches from 0 to 1). If the MSF
value is omitted the current track length is used. If the
current track length is not a multiple of the block length
the pre-gap length will be rounded up to next block
boundary.</p>

<p>If no START statement is given the track will not have a
pre- gap.</p>

<p>PREGAP MM:SS:FF This is an alternate way to specify a
pre-gap with zero audio data. It may appear before the first
SILENCE, ZERO or FILE statement. Either PREGAP or START can
be used within a track specification. It is equivalent to
the sequence SILENCE MM:SS:FF START for audio tracks or ZERO
MM:SS:FF START for data tracks.</p>

<p>Nothing prevents mixing DATAFILE/ZERO and AUDIOFILE/
SILENCE statements within the same track. The results,
however, are undefined.</p>

<p>The end of a track specification may contain zero or
more index incre- ment statements:</p>

<p>INDEX MM:SS:FF Increments the index number at given
position within the track. The first statement will
increment from 1 to 2. The position is relative to the real
track start, not counting an existing pre- gap.</p>

<p>CD-TEXT Blocks A CD-TEXT block may be placed in the
global section to define data valid for the whole CD and in
each track specification of a toc-file. The global section
must define a language map that is used to map a
language-number to country codes. Up to 8 different
languages can be defined:</p>

<p>LANGUAGE_MAP { 0 : c1 1 : c2 ... 7 : c7 } The country
code may be an integer value in the range 0..255 or one of
the following countries (the corresponding integer value is
placed in braces behind the token): EN(9, English) It is
just necessary to define a mapping for the used
languages.</p>

<p>If no mapping exists for a language-number the data for
this language will be ignored.</p>

<p>For each language a language block must exist that
defines the actual data for a certain language.</p>

<p>LANGUAGE language-number { cd-text-item cd-text-data
cd-text-item cd- text-data ... } Defines the CD-TEXT items
for given language-number which must be defined in the
language map.</p>

<p>The cd-text-data may be either a string enclosed by
&quot; or binary data like { 0, 10, 255, ... } where each
integer number must be in the range 0..255. The cd-text-item
may be one of the following:</p>

<p>TITLE String data: Title of CD or track.</p>

<p>PERFORMER String data.</p>

<p>SONGWRITER String data.</p>

<p>COMPOSER String data.</p>

<p>ARRANGER String data.</p>

<p>MESSAGE String data. Message to the user.</p>

<p>DISC_ID String data: Should only appear in the global
CD-TEXT block. The format is usually: XY12345</p>

<p>GENRE Mixture of binary data (genre code) and string
data. Should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block. Useful
entries will be cre- ated by gcdmaster.</p>

<p>TOC_INFO1 Binary data: Optional table of contents 1.
Should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block.</p>

<p>TOC_INFO2 Binary data: Optional table of contents 2.
Should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block.</p>

<p>UPC_EAN String data: This item should only appear in the
global CD-TEXT block. Was always an empty string on the
CD-TEXT CDs I had access to.</p>

<p>ISRC String data: ISRC code of track. The format is
usually: CC-OOO- YY-SSSSS</p>

<p>SIZE_INFO Binary data: Contains summary about all
CD-TEXT data and should only appear in the global CD-TEXT
block. The data will be auto- matically (re)created when the
CD-TEXT data is written.</p>

<p>If one of the CD-TEXT items TITLE, PERFORMER,
SONGWRITER, COM- POSER, ARRANGER, ISRC is defined for at
least on track or in the global section it must be defined
for all tracks and in the global section. If a DISC_ID item
is defined in the global sec- tion, an ISRC entry must be
defined for each track.</p>

<p>Examples Simple track without pre-gap with all audio
data from WAVE file &quot;data.wav&quot;: CD_DA TRACK AUDIO

&quot;data_2.wav&quot; 0</p>

<p>TRACK AUDIO FILE &quot;data_3.wav&quot; 0</p>

<p>CUE FILES Cue files may be used wherever a toc-file is
expected. The correspond- ing bin file is not taken from the
FILE statement of a cue file but constructed from the cue
file name by replacing &quot;.cue&quot; by &quot;.bin&quot;.
The cue file must have exactly one FILE statement.</p>

<p>Currently, following track modes are supported:
MODE1/2048, MODE1/2352, MODE2/2336, MODE2/2352. The CATALOG,
ISRC and POSTGAP statements are parsed but not evaluated,
yet.</p>

<p>SETTINGS Some of the command line options can be stored
as settings at following locations. The files will be read
on startup of cdrdao in that order:</p>

<p>1. /etc/cdrdao.conf</p>

<p>2. /etc/defaults/cdrdao</p>

<p>3. /etc/default/cdrdao</p>

<p>4. $HOME/.cdrdao</p>

<p>Command line options will overwrite the loaded settings.
The settings file contains name - value pairs separated by a
colon. String values must be enclosed by &quot;. The file is
automatically written if the command line option --save is
used but it is also possible to modify it manu- ally.
Following values are defined:</p>

<p>write_device Device used for operations simulate, write,
copy, blank, disk- info and unlock. Corresponding option:
--device</p>

<p>write_driver Driver (including driver options) that is
