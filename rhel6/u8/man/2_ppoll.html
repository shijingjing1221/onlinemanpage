<p>POLL(2) Linux Programmer s Manual POLL(2)</p>

<p>NAME poll, ppoll - wait for some event on a file
descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;poll.h&gt;</p>

<p>int poll(struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds, int
timeout);</p>

<p>#define _GNU_SOURCE #include &lt;poll.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ppoll(struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds, const struct
timespec *timeout, const sigset_t *sigmask);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION poll() performs a similar task to select(2):
it waits for one of a set of file descriptors to become
ready to perform I/O.</p>

<p>The set of file descriptors to be monitored is specified
in the fds argument, which is an array of nfds structures of
the following form:</p>

<p>struct pollfd { int fd; /* file descriptor */ short
events; /* requested events */ short revents; /* returned
events */ };</p>

<p>The field fd contains a file descriptor for an open
file.</p>

<p>The field events is an input parameter, a bit mask
specifying the events the application is interested in.</p>

<p>The field revents is an output parameter, filled by the
kernel with the events that actually occurred. The bits
returned in revents can include any of those specified in
events, or one of the values POLLERR, POLLHUP, or POLLNVAL.
(These three bits are meaningless in the events field, and
will be set in the revents field whenever the corresponding
condition is true.)</p>

<p>If none of the events requested (and no error) has
occurred for any of the file descriptors, then poll() blocks
until one of the events occurs.</p>

<p>The timeout argument specifies an upper limit on the
time for which poll() will block, in milliseconds.
Specifying a negative value in timeout means an infinite
timeout.</p>

<p>The bits that may be set/returned in events and revents
are defined in &lt;poll.h&gt;:</p>

<p>POLLIN There is data to read.</p>

<p>POLLPRI There is urgent data to read (e.g., out-of-band
data on TCP socket; pseudo-terminal master in packet mode
has seen state change in slave).</p>

<p>POLLOUT Writing now will not block.</p>

<p>POLLRDHUP (since Linux 2.6.17) Stream socket peer closed
connection, or shut down writ- ing half of connection. The
_GNU_SOURCE feature test macro must be defined in order to
obtain this definition.</p>

<p>POLLERR Error condition (output only).</p>

<p>POLLHUP Hang up (output only).</p>

<p>POLLNVAL Invalid request: fd not open (output only).</p>

<p>When compiling with _XOPEN_SOURCE defined, one also has
the following, which convey no further information beyond
the bits listed above:</p>

<p>POLLRDNORM Equivalent to POLLIN.</p>

<p>POLLRDBAND Priority band data can be read (generally
unused on Linux).</p>

<p>POLLWRNORM Equivalent to POLLOUT.</p>

<p>POLLWRBAND Priority data may be written.</p>

<p>Linux also knows about, but does not use POLLMSG.</p>

<p>ppoll() The relationship between poll() and ppoll() is
analogous to the rela- tionship between select(2) and
pselect(2): like pselect(2), ppoll() allows an application
to safely wait until either a file descriptor becomes ready
or until a signal is caught.</p>

<p>Other than the difference in the timeout argument, the
following ppoll() call:</p>

<p>ready = ppoll(&amp;fds, nfds, timeout,
&amp;sigmask);</p>

<p>is equivalent to atomically executing the following
calls:</p>

<p>sigset_t origmask;</p>

<p>sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;sigmask, &amp;origmask);
ready = poll(&amp;fds, nfds, timeout);
sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;origmask, NULL);</p>

<p>See the description of pselect(2) for an explanation of
why ppoll() is necessary.</p>

<p>If the sigmask argument is specified as NULL, then no
signal mask manipulation is performed (and thus ppoll()
differs from poll() only in the precision of the timeout
argument).</p>

<p>The timeout argument specifies an upper limit on the
amount of time that ppoll() will block. This argument is a
pointer to a structure of the following form:</p>

<p>struct timespec { long tv_sec; /* seconds */ long
tv_nsec; /* nanoseconds */ };</p>

<p>If timeout is specified as NULL, then ppoll() can block
indefinitely.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, a positive number is returned;
this is the number of struc- tures which have non-zero
revents fields (in other words, those descriptors with
events or errors reported). A value of 0 indicates that the
call timed out and no file descriptors were ready. On error,
-1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT The array given as argument was not
contained in the calling programs address space.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal occurred before any requested event; see
signal(7).</p>

<p>EINVAL The nfds value exceeds the RLIMIT_NOFILE
value.</p>

<p>ENOMEM There was no space to allocate file descriptor
tables.</p>

<p>VERSIONS The poll() system call was introduced in Linux
2.1.23. The poll() library call was introduced in libc
5.4.28 (and provides emulation using select(2) if your
kernel does not have a poll() system call).</p>

<p>The ppoll() system call was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16. The ppoll() library call was added in glibc 2.4.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO poll() conforms to POSIX.1-2001. ppoll()
is Linux-specific.</p>

<p>NOTES Some implementations define the non-standard
constant INFTIM with the value -1 for use as a timeout. This
constant is not provided in glibc.</p>

<p>Linux Notes The Linux ppoll() system call modifies its
timeout argument. However, the glibc wrapper function hides
this behavior by using a local vari- able for the timeout
argument that is passed to the system call. Thus, the glibc
ppoll() function does not modify its timeout argument.</p>

<p>BUGS See the discussion of spurious readiness
notifications under the BUGS section of select(2).</p>
