<p>NAME Tk_GetSelection - retrieve the contents of a
selection</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tk_GetSelection(interp, tkwin, selection, target,
proc, clientData)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter to use for
reporting errors.</p>

<p>Tk_Window tkwin (in) Window on whose behalf to retrieve
the selection (deter- mines display from which to
retrieve).</p>

<p>Atom selection (in) The name of the selection to be
retrieved.</p>

<p>Atom target (in) Form in which to retrieve selec-
tion.</p>

<p>Tk_GetSelProc *proc (in) Procedure to invoke to process
pieces of the selection as they are retrieved.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary one-word value to
pass to proc.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_GetSelection retrieves the selection
specified by the atom selection in the format specified by
target. The selection may actually be retrieved in several
pieces; as each piece is retrieved, proc is called to
process the piece. Proc should have arguments and result
that match the type Tk_GetSelProc: typedef int
Tk_GetSelProc( ClientData clientData, Tcl_Interp *interp,
char *portion); The clientData and interp parameters to proc
will be copies of the cor- responding arguments to
Tk_GetSelection. Portion will be a pointer to a string
containing part or all of the selection. For large selec-
tions, proc will be called several times with successive
portions of the selection. The X Inter-Client Communication
Conventions Manual allows a selection to be returned in
formats other than strings, e.g. as an array of atoms or
integers. If this happens, Tk converts the selection back
into a string before calling proc. If a selection is
returned as an array of atoms, Tk converts it to a string
containing the atom names separated by white space. For any
other format besides string, Tk converts a selection to a
string containing hexadecimal val- ues separated by white
space.</p>

<p>Tk_GetSelection returns to its caller when the selection
has been com- pletely retrieved and processed by proc, or
when a fatal error has occurred (e.g. the selection owner
did not respond promptly). Tk_GetS- election normally
returns TCL_OK; if an error occurs, it returns TCL_ERROR and
leaves an error message in interp-&gt;result. Proc should
also return either TCL_OK or TCL_ERROR. If proc encounters
an error in dealing with the selection, it should leave an
error message in interp-&gt;result and return TCL_ERROR;
this will abort the selection retrieval.</p>
