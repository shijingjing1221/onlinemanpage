<p>yum-ovl(1) User Manual yum-ovl(1)</p>

<p>NAME yum-ovl - Performs an initial copy-up of yum(8)
package database.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d debug-level If debug level is 2 and more,
print out the number of files copied up from the lower
layer</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Opening a file on OverlayFS in read-only
mode causes the file from lower layer to be opened, then
later on, if the same file is opened in write mode, a
copy-up into the upper layer takes place, resulting into a
new file being opened. Since yum(8) needs to open the RPMdb
first read-only, and then also with write access, we need to
copy-up the files beforehand to make sure that the access is
consistent.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib/yum-plugins/ovl.py Plugin itself</p>

<p>/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/ovl.conf Configuration file
allowing to enable/disable the plugin</p>
