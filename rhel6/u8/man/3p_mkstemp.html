<p>MKSTEMP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MKSTEMP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mkstemp - make a unique filename</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mkstemp(char *template);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mkstemp() function shall replace the
contents of the string pointed to by template by a unique
filename, and return a file descriptor for the file open for
reading and writing. The function thus prevents any possible
race condition between testing whether the file exists and
opening it for use. The string in template should look like
a filename with six trailingXs; mkstemp() replaces each X
with a character from the portable filename character set.
The characters are chosen such that the resulting name does
not duplicate the name of an existing file at the time of a
call to mkstemp().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, mkstemp() shall
return an open file descriptor. Otherwise, -1 shall be
returned if no suitable file could be created.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Generating a Filename The following example
creates a file with a 10-character name beginning with the
characters &quot;file&quot; and opens the file for reading
and writing. The value returned as the value of fd is a file
descriptor that identi- fies the file.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; ... char template[] =
&quot;/tmp/fileXXXXXX&quot;; int fd;</p>

<p>fd = mkstemp(template);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE It is possible to run out of
letters.</p>

<p>The mkstemp() function need not check to determine
whether the filename part of template exceeds the maximum
allowable filename length.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
