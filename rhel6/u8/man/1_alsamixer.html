<p>NAME alsamixer - soundcard mixer for ALSA soundcard
driver, with ncurses interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS alsamixer [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION alsamixer is an ncurses mixer program for
use with the ALSA soundcard drivers. It supports multiple
soundcards with multiple devices.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, --help Help: show available flags.</p>

<p>-c, --card &lt;card number or identification&gt; Select
the soundcard to use, if you have more than one. Cards are
numbered from 0 (the default).</p>

<p>-D, --device &lt;device identification&gt; Select the
mixer device to control.</p>

<p>-V, --view &lt;mode&gt; Select the starting view mode,
either playback, capture or all.</p>

<p>-g, --no-color Toggle the using of colors.</p>

<p>MIXER VIEWS The top-left corner of alsamixer is the are
to show some basic informa- tion: the card name, the mixer
chip name, the current view mode and the currently selected
mixer item. When the mixer item is switched off, [Off] is
displayed in its name.</p>

<p>Volume bars are located below the basic information
area. You can scroll left/right when all controls cant be
put in a single screen. The name of each control is shown in
the bottom below the volume bars. The currently selected
item is drawn in red and/of emphasized.</p>

<p>Each mixer control with volume capability shows a box
and the current volume filled in that box. The volume
percentages are displayed below the volume bar for left and
right channels. For a mono control, only one value is shown
there.</p>

<p>When a mixer control is turned off, M (mute) appears
below the volume bar. When its turned on, O in green appears
instead. You can toggle the switch via m key.</p>

<p>When a mixer control has capture capability, the capture
flag appears below the volume bar, too. When the capture is
turned off, ------- is shown. CAPTURE in red appears when
the capture switch is turned on. In addition, L and R
letters appear in left and right side to indicate that left
and the right channels are turned on.</p>

<p>Some controls have the enumeration list, and dont show
boxes but only texts which indicate the currently active
item. You can change the item via up/down keys.</p>

<p>VIEW MODES alsamixer has three view modes: playback,
capture and all. In the playback view, only the controls
related with playback are shown. Sim- ilarly, only the
controls for capture (recording) are shown in the cap- ture
view. The all view mode shows all controls. The current view
mode is displayed in the top-left position together with the
mixer name, etc.</p>

<p>The default view mode is the playback view. You can
change it via -V option.</p>

<p>Each view mode can be switched via keyboard commands,
too. See the next section.</p>

<p>KEYBOARD COMMANDS alsamixer recognizes the following
keyboard commands to control the soundcard. Commands shown
here in upper case can also be given in lower case. To be
reminded of these keystrokes, hit the h key.</p>

<p>General Controls The Left and right arrow keys are used
to select the channel (or device, depending on your
preferred terminology). You can also use n
(&quot;next&quot;) and p (&quot;previous&quot;).</p>

<p>The Up and Down Arrows control the volume for the
currently selected device. You can also use + or - for the
same purpose. Both the left and right signals are affected.
For independent left and right control, see below.</p>

<p>The B or = key adjusts the balance of volumes on left
and right chan- nels.</p>

<p>M toggles muting for the current channel (both left and
right). If the hardware supports it, you can mute left and
right independently by using , (or &lt;) and . (or &gt;)
respectively.</p>

<p>SPACE enables recording for the current channel. If any
other channels have recording enabled, they will have their
recording function dis- abled first. This only works for
valid input channels, of course.</p>

<p>L re-draws the screen.</p>

<p>View Mode Controls Function keys are used to change view
modes. You can switch to the help mode and the proc info
mode via F1 and F2 keys, respectively. On terminals that can
t use function keys like gnome-terminal, ? and / keys can be
used alternatively for help and proc modes.</p>

<p>F3, F4 and F5 keys are used to switch to playback,
capture and all view mode, respectively. TAB key toggles the
current view mode circularly.</p>

<p>Quick Volume Changes PageUp increases volume by 5.</p>

<p>PageDown decreases volume by 5.</p>

<p>End sets volume to 0.</p>

<p>You can also control left &amp; right levels for the
current channel inde- pendently, as follows:</p>

<p>[Q | W | E ] -- turn UP [ left | both | right ]</p>

<p>[Z | X | C ] -- turn DOWN [ left | both | right ]</p>

<p>If the currently selected mixer channel is not a stereo
channel, then all UP keys will work like W, and all DOWN
keys will work like X.</p>

<p>The number keys from 0 to 9 are to change the absolute
volume quickly. They correspond to 0 to 90% volume.</p>

<p>Selecting the Sound Card You can select another sound
card by pressing the F6 or S keys. This will show a list of
available sound cards to choose from, and an entry to enter
the mixer device name by hand.</p>

<p>Exiting Quit the program with ALT Q, or by hitting ESC.
Please note that you might need to hit ESC twice on some
terminals since it s regarded as a prefix key.</p>

<p>VOLUME MAPPING In alsamixer, the volume is mapped to a
value that is more natural for a human ear. The mapping is
designed so that the position in the interval is
proportional to the volume as a human ear would perceive it,
i.e. the position is the cubic root of the linear sample
multipli- cation factor. For controls with a small range (24
dB or less), the mapping is linear in the dB values so that
each step has the same size visually.</p>

<p>Only for controls without dB information, a linear
mapping of the hard- ware volume register values is used
(this is the same algorithm as used in the old
alsamixer).</p>

<p>BUGS Some terminal emulators (e.g. nxterm) may not work
quite right with ncurses, but thats their own damn fault.
Plain old xterm seems to be fine.</p>
