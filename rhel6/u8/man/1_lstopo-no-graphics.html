<p>LSTOPO(1) hwloc LSTOPO(1)</p>

<p>NAME lstopo, lstopo-no-graphics - Show the topology of
the system (note that hwloc-bind(1) provides a detailed
explanation of the hwloc system; it should be read before
reading this man page).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lstopo [ options ]... [ filename ]</p>

<p>lstopo-no-graphics [ options ]... [ filename ]</p>

<p>OPTIONS --of &lt;format&gt;, --output-format
&lt;format&gt; Enforce the output in the given format. See
the OUTPUT FORMATS section below.</p>

<p>-i &lt;file&gt;, --input &lt;file&gt; Read topology from
XML file &lt;file&gt; (instead of discovering the topology
on the local machine). If &lt;file&gt; is &quot;-&quot;, the
standard input is used. XML support must have been compiled
in to hwloc for this option to be usable.</p>

<p>-i &lt;directory&gt;, --input &lt;directory&gt; Read
topology from the chroot specified by &lt;directory&gt;
(instead of discovering the topology on the local machine).
This option is generally only available on Linux. The chroot
was usually created by gathering another machine topology
with hwloc-gather- topology.</p>

<p>-i &lt;specification&gt;, --input &lt;specification&gt;
Simulate a fake hierarchy (instead of discovering the
topology on the local machine). If &lt;specification&gt; is
&quot;node:2 pu:3&quot;, the topology will contain two NUMA
nodes with 3 processing units in each of them. The
&lt;specification&gt; string must end with a number of
PUs.</p>

<p>--if &lt;format&gt;, --input-format &lt;format&gt;
Enforce the input in the given format, among xml, fsroot and
synthetic.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Include additional detail.</p>

<p>-s --silent Reduce the amount of details to show.</p>

<p>-l --logical Display hwloc logical indexes instead of
physical/OS indexes (default for console output). These
indexes are prefixed with &quot;L#&quot;. The physical
indexes of some objects (PU and Node by default, all objects
if verbose) will appear as object attribute
&quot;P#...&quot;.</p>

<p>-p --physical Display OS/physical indexes instead of
hwloc logical indexes (default for graphical output). These
indexes are prefixed with &quot;P#&quot; instead of
&quot;L#&quot; in the console output.</p>

<p>-c --cpuset Display the cpuset of each object.</p>

<p>-C --cpuset-only Only display the cpuset of each object;
do not display anything else about the object.</p>

<p>--taskset Show CPU set strings in the format recognized
by the taskset command-line program instead of
hwloc-specific CPU set string format. This option should be
combined with --cpuset or --cpuset-only, otherwise it will
imply --cpuset.</p>

<p>--only &lt;type&gt; Only show objects of the given type
in the textual output.</p>

<p>--ignore &lt;type&gt; Ignore all objects of type
&lt;type&gt; in the topology.</p>

<p>--no-caches Do not show caches.</p>

<p>--no-useless-caches Do not show caches which do not have
a hierarchical impact.</p>

<p>--no-icaches Do not show Instruction caches, only Data
and Unified caches are displayed.</p>

<p>--whole-system Do not consider administration
limitations.</p>

<p>--merge Do not show levels that do not have a
hierarchical impact.</p>

<p>--restrict &lt;cpuset&gt; Restrict the topology to the
given cpuset.</p>

<p>--restrict binding Restrict the topology to the current
process binding. This option requires the use of the actual
current machine topology (or any other topology with
--thissystem or with HWLOC_THISSYS- TEM set to 1 in the
environment).</p>

<p>--no-io Do not show any I/O device or bridge. By
default, common devices (GPUs, NICs, block devices, ...) and
interesting bridges are shown.</p>

<p>--no-bridges Do not show any I/O bridge except
hostbridges. By default, com- mon devices (GPUs, NICs, block
devices, ...) and interesting bridges are shown.</p>

<p>--whole-io Show all I/O devices and bridges. By default,
only common devices (GPUs, NICs, block devices, ...) and
interesting bridges are shown.</p>

<p>--thissystem Assume that the selected backend provides
the topology for the system on which we are running. This is
useful when using --restrict binding and loading a custom
topology such as an XML file.</p>

<p>--pid &lt;pid&gt; Detect topology as seen by process
&lt;pid&gt;, i.e. as if process &lt;pid&gt; did the
discovery itself. Note that this can for instance change the
set of allowed processors. Also show this process current
CPU binding in the graphical output (in Green, see the
COLORS section below). If 0 is given as pid, the current
bind- ing for the lstopo process will be shown.</p>

<p>--ps --top Show existing processes as misc objects in
the output. To avoid uselessly cluttering the output, only
processes that are restricted to some part of the machine
are shown. On Linux, kernel threads are not shown. If many
processes appear, the output may become hard to read anyway,
making the hwloc-ps pro- gram more practical.</p>

<p>--fontsize &lt;size&gt; Set size of text font.</p>

<p>--gridsize &lt;size&gt; Set size of margin between
elements.</p>

<p>--horiz, --horiz=&lt;type1,...&gt; Horizontal graphical
layout instead of nearly 4/3 ratio. If a comma-separated
list of types is given, the layout only applies to the
corresponding containers.</p>

<p>--vert, --vert=&lt;type1,...&gt; Vertical graphical
layout instead of nearly 4/3 ratio. If a comma-separated
list of types is given, the layout only applies to the
corresponding containers.</p>

<p>--no-legend Remove the text legend at the bottom.</p>

<p>--version Report version and exit.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lstopo and lstopo-no-graphics are capable of
displaying a topological map of the system in a variety of
different output formats. The only difference between lstopo
and lstopo-no-graphics is that graphical out- puts are only
supported by lstopo, to reduce dependencies on external
libraries.</p>

<p>If no filename is specified and the DISPLAY environment
variable is set, lstopo displays the map in a graphical
window. If no filename is specified and the DISPLAY
environment variable is not set, a text sum- mary is
displayed.</p>

<p>The filename specified directly implies the output
format that will be used; see the OUTPUT FORMATS section,
below. Output formats that sup- port color will indicate
specific characteristics about individual CPUs by their
color; see the COLORS section, below.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FORMATS The filename on the command line usually
determines the format of the output. There are a few
filenames that indicate specific output for- mats and
devices (e.g., a filename of &quot;-&quot; will output a
text summary to stdout), but most filenames indicate the
desired output format by their suffix (e.g.,
&quot;topo.png&quot; will output a PNG-format file).</p>

<p>The format of the output may also be changed with
&quot;--of&quot;. For instance, &quot;--of pdf&quot; will
generate a PDF-format file on the standard output, while
&quot;--of fig toto&quot; will output a Xfig-format file
named &quot;toto&quot;.</p>

<p>The list of currently supported formats is given below.
Any of them may be used with &quot;--of&quot; or as a
filename suffix.</p>

<p>default Send the output to a window or to the console
depending on the environment.</p>

<p>console Send a text summary to stdout. No color
annotation for binding, unallowed or offline processors is
shown in this mode; see the COLORS section, below.</p>

<p>txt Output an ASCII art representation of the map. If
outputting to stdout and if colors are supported on the
terminal, the output will be colorized.</p>

<p>fig Output a representation of the map that can be
loaded in Xfig.</p>

<p>pdf If lstopo was compiled with the proper support,
lstopo outputs a PDF representation of the map.</p>

<p>ps If lstopo was compiled with the proper support,
lstopo outputs a Postscript representation of the map.</p>

<p>png If lstopo was compiled with the proper support,
lstopo outputs a PNG representation of the map.</p>

<p>svg If lstopo was compiled with the proper support,
lstopo outputs an SVG representation of the map.</p>

<p>synthetic If the topology is symmetric, lstopo outputs a
synthetic description string. This output may be reused as
an input syn- thetic topology description later.</p>

<p>xml If lstopo was compiled with the proper support,
lstopo outputs an XML representation of the map. It may be
reused later, even on another machine, with lstopo --input,
the HWLOC_XMLFILE envi- ronment variable, or the
hwloc_topology_set_xml() function.</p>

<p>The following special names may be used:</p>

<p>- Send a text summary to stdout.</p>

<p>/dev/stdout Send a text summary to stdout. It is
effectively the same as specifying &quot;-&quot;.</p>

<p>-.&lt;format&gt; If the entire filename is
&quot;-.&lt;format&gt;&quot;, lstopo behaves as if
&quot;--of &lt;format&gt; -&quot; was given, which means a
file of the given format is sent to the standard output.</p>

<p>See the output of &quot;lstopo --help&quot; for a
specific list of what graphical output formats are supported
in your hwloc installation.</p>

<p>COLORS Individual CPUs are colored in the semi-graphical
and graphical output formats to indicate different
characteristics:</p>

<p>Green The topology is reported as seen by a specific
process (see --pid), and the given CPU is in this process
CPU binding mask.</p>

<p>White The CPU is in the allowed set (see below). If the
topology is reported as seen by a specific process (see
--pid), the given CPU is also not in this process CPU
binding mask.</p>

<p>Red The CPU is not in the allowed set (see below).</p>

<p>Black The CPU is offline (not all OSs support displaying
offline CPUs).</p>

<p>The &quot;allowed set&quot; is the set of CPUs to which
the current process is allowed to bind. The allowed set is
usually either inherited from the parent process or set by
administrative qpolicies on the system. Linux cpusets are
one example of limiting the allowed set for a process and
its children to be less than the full set of CPUs on the
system.</p>

<p>Different processes may therefore have different CPUs in
the allowed set. Hence, invoking lstopo in different
contexts and/or as different users may display different
colors for the same individual CPUs (e.g., running lstopo in
one context may show a specific CPU as red, but run- ning
lstopo in a different context may show the same CPU as
white).</p>

<p>Some lstopo output modes, e.g. the console mode (default
non-graphical output), do not support colors at all. The
above characteristics are not shown in this case.</p>

<p>LAYOUT In its graphical output, lstopo uses simple
rectangular heuristics to try to achieve a 4/3 ratio between
width and height. However, in the particular case of NUMA
nodes, the layout is always a flat rectangle, to avoid
letting the user believe any particular NUMA topology
(lstopo is not able to render that yet).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To display the machine topology in textual
mode:</p>

<p>lstopo-no-graphics</p>

<p>To display the machine topology in pseudo-graphical
mode:</p>

<p>lstopo-no-graphics -.txt</p>

<p>To display in graphical mode (assuming that the DISPLAY
environment variable is set to a relevant value):</p>

<p>lstopo</p>

<p>To export the topology to a PNG file:</p>

<p>lstopo file.png</p>

<p>To export an XML file on a machine and later display the
corresponding graphical output on another machine:</p>

<p>machine1$ lstopo file.xml &lt;transfer file.xml from
machine1 to machine2&gt; machine2$ lstopo --input
file.xml</p>

<p>To save the current machine topology to XML and later
reload it faster while still considering it as the current
machine:</p>

<p>$ lstopo file.xml &lt;...&gt; $ lstopo --input file.xml
--thissystem</p>

<p>To restrict an XML topology to only physical processors
0, 1, 4 and 5:</p>

<p>lstopo --input file.xml --restrict 0x33 newfile.xml</p>

<p>To restrict an XML topology to only numa node whose
logical index is 1:</p>

<p>lstopo --input file.xml --restrict $(hwloc-calc --input
file.xml node:1) newfile.xml</p>

<p>To display a summary of the topology:</p>

<p>lstopo -s</p>

<p>To get more details about the topology:</p>

<p>lstopo -v</p>

<p>To only show cores:</p>

<p>lstopo --only core</p>

<p>To show cpusets:</p>

<p>lstopo --cpuset</p>

<p>To only show the cpusets of sockets:</p>

<p>lstopo --only socket --cpuset-only</p>

<p>Simulate a fake hierarchy; this example shows with 2
NUMA nodes of 2 processor units:</p>

<p>lstopo --input &quot;n:2 2&quot;</p>

<p>To count the number of logical processors in the
system</p>

<p>lstopo --only pu | wc -l</p>
