<p>NAME XmClipboardRegisterFormat A clipboard function that
registers a new format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardRegisterFormat (display, format_name,
format_length) Display * display; char * format_name; int
format_length; (void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardRegisterFormat registers a new
format. Each format stored on the clipboard should have a
length associated with it; this length must be known to the
clipboard routines. Formats are known as targets in the
Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM). All
of the for- mats specified by version 1.1 of the ICCCM
conventions are preregis- tered. Any other format that the
application wants to use must either be 8-bit data or be
registered via this routine. Failure to register the length
of the data results in incompatible applications across
platforms having different byte-swapping orders.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>format_name Specifies the string name for the new format
(target).</p>

<p>format_length Specifies the format length in bits (8,
16, or 32).</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardBadFormat The format_name must not be
NULL, and the format_length must be 8, 16, or 32.</p>

<p>XmClipboardSuccess The function was successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>

<p>XmClipboardFail The function failed because the
specified format was already registered with a different
length from that specified now. If a specified format was
already registered with the same length as that specified
now, XmClipboardSuccess is returned.</p>
