<p>XkbFreeDeviceInfo(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbFreeDeviceInfo(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbFreeDeviceInfo - Free an XkbDeviceInfoRec
structure</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void XkbFreeDeviceInfo (XkbDeviceInfoPtr
device_info, unsigned int which, Bool free_all);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - device_info pointer to XkbDeviceInfoRec in
which to free items</p>

<p>- which mask of components of device_info to free</p>

<p>- free_all True =&gt; free everything, including
device_info</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If free_all is True, the XkbFreeDeviceInfo
frees all components of device_info and the XkbDeviceInfoRec
structure pointed to by device_info itself. If free_all is
False, the value of which determines which subcomponents are
freed. which is an inclusive OR of one or more of the values
from Table 1. If which contains XkbXI_ButtonActionsMask, all
button actions associated with device_info are freed,
device_info-&gt;btn_acts is set to NULL, and
device_info-&gt;num_btns is set to zero. If which contains
all bits in XkbXI_IndicatorsMask, all XkbDe- viceLedInfoRec
structures associated with device_info are freed,
device_info-&gt;leds is set to NULL, and
device_info-&gt;sz_leds and device_info-&gt;num_leds are set
to zero. If which contains XkbXI_Indica- torMapsMask, all
indicator maps associated with device_info are cleared, but
the number of LEDs and the leds structures themselves is
preserved. If which contains XkbXI_IndicatorNamesMask, all
indicator names associated with device_info are cleared, but
the number of LEDs and the leds structures themselves is
preserved. If which contains XkbXI_IndicatorStateMask, the
indicator state associated with the device_info leds are set
to zeros but the number of LEDs and the leds structures
themselves is preserved.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES Information about X Input Extension devices
is transferred between a client program and the Xkb
extension in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure:</p>

<p>typedef struct { char * name; / name for device */ Atom
type; / name for class of devices */ unsigned short
device_spec; / device of interest */ Bool has_own_state; /
True=&gt;this device has its own state */ unsigned short
supported; / bits indicating supported capabilities */
unsigned short unsupported; / bits indicating unsupported
capabilities */ unsigned short num_btns; / number of entries
in btn_acts */ XkbAction * btn_acts; / button actions */
unsigned short sz_leds; / total number of entries in LEDs
vector */ unsigned short num_leds; / number of valid entries
in LEDs vector */ unsigned short dflt_kbd_fb; / input
extension ID of default (core kbd) indicator */ unsigned
short dflt_led_fb; / input extension ID of default indicator
feedback */ XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr leds; / LED descriptions */
} XkbDeviceInfoRec, *XkbDeviceInfoPtr;</p>

<p>typedef struct { unsigned short led_class; / class for
this LED device*/ unsigned short led_id; / ID for this LED

LEDs physically present */ unsigned int maps_present; / bits
for which LEDs have maps in maps */ unsigned int
