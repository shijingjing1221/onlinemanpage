<p>JOIN(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual JOIN(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME join - relational database operator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS join [-a file_number | -v file_number][-e
string][-o list][-t char] [-1 field][-2 field] file1
file2</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The join utility shall perform an equality
join on the files file1 and file2. The joined files shall be
written to the standard output.</p>

<p>The join field is a field in each file on which the
files are compared. The join utility shall write one line in
the output for each pair of lines in file1 and file2 that
have identical join fields. The output line by default shall
consist of the join field, then the remaining fields from
file1, then the remaining fields from file2. This format can
be changed by using the -o option (see below). The -a option
can be used to add unmatched lines to the output. The -v
option can be used to output only unmatched lines.</p>

<p>The files file1 and file2 shall be ordered in the
collating sequence of sort -b on the fields on which they
shall be joined, by default the first in each line. All
selected output shall be written in the same collating
sequence.</p>

<p>The default input field separators shall be
&lt;blank&gt;s. In this case, multiple separators shall
count as one field separator, and leading separators shall
be ignored. The default output field separator shall be a
&lt;space&gt;.</p>

<p>The field separator and collating sequence can be
changed by using the -t option (see below).</p>

<p>If the same key appears more than once in either file,
all combinations of the set of remaining fields in file1 and
the set of remaining fields in file2 are output in the order
of the lines encountered.</p>

<p>If the input files are not in the appropriate collating
sequence, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The join utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-a file_number</p>

<p>Produce a line for each unpairable line in file
file_number, where file_number is 1 or 2, in addition to the
default output. If both -a1 and -a2 are specified, all
unpairable lines shall be output.</p>

<p>-e string Replace empty output fields in the list
selected by -o with the string string.</p>

<p>-o list Construct the output line to comprise the fields
specified in list, each element of which shall have one of
the following two forms:</p>

<p>1. file_number.field, where file_number is a file number
and field is a decimal integer field number</p>

<p>2. 0 (zero), representing the join field</p>

<p>The elements of list shall be either comma-separated or
&lt;blank&gt;-sepa- rated, as specified in Guideline 8 of
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines. The fields specified by
list shall be written for all selected output lines. Fields
selected by list that do not appear in the input shall be
treated as empty output fields. (See the -e option.) Only
specifically requested fields shall be written. The
application shall ensure that list is a single command line
argument.</p>

<p>-t char Use character char as a separator, for both
input and output. Every appearance of char in a line shall
be significant. When this option is specified, the collating
sequence shall be the same as sort without the -b
option.</p>

<p>-v file_number</p>

<p>Instead of the default output, produce a line only for
each unpairable line in file_number, where file_number is 1
or 2. If both -v1 and -v2 are specified, all unpairable
lines shall be output.</p>

<p>-1 field Join on the fieldth field of file 1. Fields are
decimal integers starting with 1.</p>

<p>-2 field Join on the fieldth field of file 2. Fields are
decimal integers starting with 1.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>file1, file2 A pathname of a file to be joined. If
either of the file1 or file2 operands is, the standard input
shall be used in its place.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if the file1
or file2 operand is -. See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be text files.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of join:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale of the collating sequence join
expects to have been used when the input files were
sorted.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The join utility output shall be a concatenation
of selected character fields. When the -o option is not
specified, the output shall be:</p>

<p>&quot;%s%s%n&quot;, &lt;join field&gt;, &lt;other file1
fields&gt;, &lt;other file2 fields&gt;</p>

<p>If the join field is not the first field in a file, the
&lt;other file fields&gt; for that file shall be:</p>

<p>&lt;fields preceding join field&gt;, &lt;fields
following join field&gt;</p>

<p>When the -o option is specified, the output format shall
be:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;concatenation of fields&gt;</p>

<p>where the concatenation of fields is described by the -o
option, above.</p>

<p>For either format, each field (except the last) shall be
written with its trailing separator character. If the
separator is the default ( &lt;blank&gt;s), a single
&lt;space&gt; shall be written after each field (except the
last).</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All input files were output successfully.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Pathnames consisting of numeric digits
or of the form string.string should not be specified
directly following the -o list.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The -o 0 field essentially selects the union of
the join fields. For example, given file phone:</p>

<p>!Name Phone Number Don +1 123-456-7890 Hal +1
234-567-8901 Yasushi +2 345-678-9012</p>

<p>and file fax:</p>

<p>!Name Fax Number Don +1 123-456-7899 Keith +1
456-789-0122 Yasushi +2 345-678-9011</p>

<p>(where the large expanses of white space are meant to
each represent a single &lt;tab&gt;), the command:</p>

<p>join -t &quot;&lt;tab&gt;&quot; -a 1 -a 2 -e(unknown) -o
0,1.2,2.2 phone fax</p>

<p>would produce:</p>

<p>!Name Phone Number Fax Number Don +1 123-456-7890 +1
123-456-7899 Hal +1 234-567-8901 (unknown) Keith (unknown)
+1 456-789-0122 Yasushi +2 345-678-9012 +2 345-678-9011</p>

<p>Multiple instances of the same key will produce
combinatorial results. The following:</p>

<p>fa: a x a y a z fb: a p</p>

<p>will produce:</p>

<p>a x p a y p a z p</p>

<p>And the following:</p>

<p>fa: a b c a d e fb: a w x a y z a o p</p>

<p>will produce:</p>

<p>a b c w x a b c y z a b c o p a d e w x a d e y z a d e
o p</p>

<p>RATIONALE The -e option is only effective when used with
-o because, unless spe- cific fields are identified using
-o, join is not aware of what fields might be empty. The
exception to this is the join field, but identify- ing an
empty join field with the -e string is not historical
practice and some scripts might break if this were
changed.</p>

<p>The 0 field in the -o list was adopted from the Tenth
Edition version of join to satisfy international objections
that the join in the base documents does not support the
&quot;full join&quot; or &quot;outer join&quot; described in
relational database literature. Although it has been
possible to include a join field in the output (by default,
or by field number using -o), the join field could not be
included for an unpaired line selected by -a. The -o 0 field
essentially selects the union of the join fields.</p>

<p>This sort of outer join was not possible with the join
commands in the base documents. The -o 0 field was chosen
because it is an upwards-com- patible change for
applications. An alternative was considered: have the join
field represent the union of the fields in the files (where
they are identical for matched lines, and one or both are
null for unmatched lines). This was not adopted because it
would break some his- torical applications.</p>

<p>The ability to specify file2 as - is not historical
practice; it was added for completeness.</p>

<p>The -v option is not historical practice, but was
considered necessary because it permitted the writing of
only those lines that do not match on the join field, as
opposed to the -a option, which prints both lines that do
and do not match. This additional facility is parallel with
the -v option of grep.</p>

<p>Some historical implementations have been encountered
where a blank line in one of the input files was considered
to be the end of the file; the description in this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not cite this as an allowable
case.</p>
