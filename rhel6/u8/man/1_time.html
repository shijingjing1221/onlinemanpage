<p>TIME(1) Linux User s Manual TIME(1)</p>

<p>NAME time - time a simple command or give resource
usage</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS time [options] command [arguments...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The time command runs the specified program
command with the given arguments. When command finishes,
time writes a message to standard error giving timing
statistics about this program run. These statis- tics
consist of (i) the elapsed real time between invocation and
termi- nation, (ii) the user CPU time (the sum of the
tms_utime and tms_cutime values in a struct tms as returned
by times(2)), and (iii) the system CPU time (the sum of the
tms_stime and tms_cstime values in a struct tms as returned
by times(2)).</p>

<p>Note: some shells (e.g., bash(1)) have a built-in time
command that provides less functionality than the command
described here. To access the real command, you may need to
specify its pathname (something like /usr/bin/time).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p When in the POSIX locale, use the precise
traditional format</p>

<p>&quot;real %f0ser %f0ys %f0</p>

<p>(with numbers in seconds) where the number of decimals
in the output for %f is unspecified but is sufficient to
express the clock tick accuracy, and at least one.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS If command was invoked, the exit status is
that of command. Otherwise it is 127 if command could not be
found, 126 if it could be found but could not be invoked,
and some other non-zero value (1-125) if some- thing else
went wrong.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The variables LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE,
LC_MESSAGES, LC_NUMERIC, NLSPATH, and PATH are used. The
last one to search for command. The remaining ones for the
text and formatting of the output.</p>

<p>GNU VERSION Below a description of the GNU 1.7 version
of time. Disregarding the name of the utility, GNU makes it
output lots of useful information, not only about time used,
but also on other resources like memory, I/O and IPC calls
(where available). The output is formatted using a for- mat
string that can be specified using the -f option or the TIME
envi- ronment variable.</p>

<p>The default format string is:</p>

<p>%Uuser %Ssystem %Eelapsed %PCPU (%Xtext+%Ddata %Mmax)k
%Iinputs+%Ooutputs (%Fmajor+%Rminor)pagefaults %Wswaps</p>

<p>When the -p option is given the (portable) output
format</p>

<p>real %e user %U sys %S</p>

<p>is used.</p>

<p>The format string The format is interpreted in the usual
printf-like way. Ordinary char- acters are directly copied,
tab, newline and backslash are escaped using , and \, a
percent sign is represented by %%, and otherwise % indicates
a conversion. The program time will always add a trailing
newline itself. The conversions follow. All of those used by
tcsh(1) are supported.</p>

<p>Time</p>

<p>%E Elapsed real time (in [hours:]minutes:seconds).</p>

<p>%e (Not in tcsh.) Elapsed real time (in seconds).</p>

<p>%S Total number of CPU-seconds that the process spent in
kernel mode.</p>

<p>%U Total number of CPU-seconds that the process spent in
user mode.</p>

<p>%P Percentage of the CPU that this job got, computed as
(%U + %S) / %E.</p>

<p>Memory</p>

<p>%M Maximum resident set size of the process during its
lifetime, in Kbytes.</p>

<p>%t (Not in tcsh.) Average resident set size of the
process, in Kbytes.</p>

<p>%K Average total (data+stack+text) memory use of the
process, in Kbytes.</p>

<p>%D Average size of the processs unshared data area, in
Kbytes.</p>

<p>%p (Not in tcsh.) Average size of the processs unshared
stack space, in Kbytes.</p>

<p>%X Average size of the processs shared text space, in
Kbytes.</p>

<p>%Z (Not in tcsh.) Systems page size, in bytes. This is a
per-sys- tem constant, but varies between systems.</p>

<p>%F Number of major page faults that occurred while the
process was running. These are faults where the page has to
be read in from disk.</p>

<p>%R Number of minor, or recoverable, page faults. These
are faults for pages that are not valid but which have not
yet been claimed by other virtual pages. Thus the data in
the page is still valid but the system tables must be
updated.</p>

<p>%W Number of times the process was swapped out of main
memory.</p>

<p>%c Number of times the process was context-switched
involuntarily (because the time slice expired).</p>

<p>%w Number of waits: times that the program was
context-switched voluntarily, for instance while waiting for
an I/O operation to complete.</p>

<p>I/O</p>

<p>%I Number of file system inputs by the process.</p>

<p>%O Number of file system outputs by the process.</p>

<p>%r Number of socket messages received by the
process.</p>

<p>%s Number of socket messages sent by the process.</p>

<p>%k Number of signals delivered to the process.</p>

<p>%C (Not in tcsh.) Name and command-line arguments of the
command being timed.</p>

<p>%x (Not in tcsh.) Exit status of the command.</p>

<p>GNU Options -f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT Specify output
format, possibly overriding the format specified in the
environment variable TIME.</p>

<p>-p, --portability Use the portable output format.</p>

<p>-o FILE, --output=FILE Do not send the results to
stderr, but overwrite the specified file.</p>

<p>-a, --append (Used together with -o.) Do not overwrite
but append.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Give very verbose output about all the
program knows about.</p>

<p>GNU Standard Options --help Print a usage message on
standard output and exit successfully.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print version information on standard
output, then exit success- fully.</p>

<p>-- Terminate option list.</p>

<p>BUGS Not all resources are measured by all versions of
Unix, so some of the values might be reported as zero. The
present selection was mostly inspired by the data provided
by 4.2 or 4.3BSD.</p>

<p>GNU time version 1.7 is not yet localized. Thus, it does
not implement the POSIX requirements.</p>

<p>The environment variable TIME was badly chosen. It is
not unusual for systems like autoconf(1) or make(1) to use
environment variables with the name of a utility to override
the utility to be used. Uses like MORE or TIME for options
to programs (instead of program pathnames) tend to lead to
difficulties.</p>

<p>It seems unfortunate that -o overwrites instead of
appends. (That is, the -a option should be the default.)</p>

<p>Mail suggestions and bug reports for GNU time to
bug-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu Please include the version of
time, which you can get by running time --version and the
operating system and C compiler you used.</p>
