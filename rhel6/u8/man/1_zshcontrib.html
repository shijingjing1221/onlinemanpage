<p>ZSHCONTRIB(1) ZSHCONTRIB(1)</p>

<p>NAME zshcontrib - user contributions to zsh</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Zsh source distribution includes a
number of items contributed by the user community. These are
not inherently a part of the shell, and some may not be
available in every zsh installation. The most signifi- cant
of these are documented here. For documentation on other
con- tributed items such as shell functions, look for
comments in the func- tion source files.</p>

<p>UTILITIES Accessing On-Line Help The key sequence ESC h
is normally bound by ZLE to execute the run-help widget (see
zshzle(1)). This invokes the run-help command with the
command word from the current input line as its argument. By
default, run-help is an alias for the man command, so this
often fails when the command word is a shell builtin or a
user-defined function. By redefining the run-help alias, one
can improve the on-line help pro- vided by the shell.</p>

<p>The helpfiles utility, found in the Util directory of
the distribution, is a Perl program that can be used to
process the zsh manual to produce a separate help file for
each shell builtin and for many other shell features as
well. The autoloadable run-help function, found in Func-
tions/Misc, searches for these helpfiles and performs
several other tests to produce the most complete help
possible for the command.</p>

<p>There may already be a directory of help files on your
system; look in /usr/share/zsh or /usr/local/share/zsh and
subdirectories below those, or ask your system
administrator.</p>

<p>To create your own help files with helpfiles, choose or
create a direc- tory where the individual command help files
will reside. For example, you might choose ~/zsh_help. If
you unpacked the zsh distribution in your home directory,
you would use the commands:</p>

<p>mkdir ~/zsh_help cd ~/zsh_help man zshall | colcrt - |
perl ~/zsh-4.3.11/Util/helpfiles</p>

<p>Next, to use the run-help function, you need to add
lines something like the following to your .zshrc or
equivalent startup file:</p>

<p>unalias run-help autoload run-help
HELPDIR=~/zsh_help</p>

<p>The HELPDIR parameter tells run-help where to look for
the help files. If your system already has a help file
directory installed, set HELPDIR to the path of that
directory instead.</p>

<p>Note that in order for autoload run-help to work, the
run-help file must be in one of the directories named in
your fpath array (see zsh- param(1)). This should already be
the case if you have a standard zsh installation; if it is
not, copy Functions/Misc/run-help to an appro- priate
directory.</p>

<p>Recompiling Functions If you frequently edit your zsh
functions, or periodically update your zsh installation to
track the latest developments, you may find that function
digests compiled with the zcompile builtin are frequently
out of date with respect to the function source files. This
is not usually a problem, because zsh always looks for the
newest file when loading a function, but it may cause slower
shell startup and function loading. Also, if a digest file
is explicitly used as an element of fpath, zsh wont check
whether any of its source files has changed.</p>

<p>The zrecompile autoloadable function, found in
Functions/Misc, can be used to keep function digests up to
date.</p>

<p>zrecompile [ -qt ] [ name ... ] zrecompile [ -qt ] -p
args [ -- args ... ] This tries to find *.zwc files and
automatically re-compile them if at least one of the
original files is newer than the compiled file. This works
only if the names stored in the compiled files are full
paths or are relative to the directory that contains the
.zwc file.</p>

<p>In the first form, each name is the name of a compiled
file or a directory containing *.zwc files that should be
checked. If no arguments are given, the directories and
*.zwc files in fpath are used.</p>

<p>When -t is given, no compilation is performed, but a
return sta- tus of zero (true) is set if there are files
that need to be re-compiled and non-zero (false) otherwise.
The -q option qui- ets the chatty output that describes what
zrecompile is doing.</p>

<p>Without the -t option, the return status is zero if all
files that needed re-compilation could be compiled and
non-zero if compilation for at least one of the files
failed.</p>

<p>If the -p option is given, the args are interpreted as
one or more sets of arguments for zcompile, separated by --.
For example:</p>

<p>zrecompile -p -R ~/.zshrc -- -M ~/.zcompdump --
~/zsh/comp.zwc ~/zsh/Completion/*/_*</p>

<p>This compiles ~/.zshrc into ~/.zshrc.zwc if that doesnt
exist or if it is older than ~/.zshrc. The compiled file
will be marked for reading instead of mapping. The same is
done for ~/.zcompdump and ~/.zcompdump.zwc, but this
compiled file is marked for mapping. The last line
re-creates the file ~/zsh/comp.zwc if any of the files
matching the given pattern is newer than it.</p>

<p>Without the -p option, zrecompile does not create
function digests that do not already exist, nor does it add
new functions to the digest.</p>

<p>The following shell loop is an example of a method for
creating func- tion digests for all functions in your fpath,
assuming that you have write permission to the
directories:</p>

<p>for ((i=1; i &lt;= $#fpath; ++i)); do dir=$fpath[i]
zwc=${dir:t}.zwc if [[ $dir == (.|..) || $dir == (.|..)/*
]]; then continue fi files=($dir/*(N-.)) if [[ -w $dir:h
&amp;&amp; -n $files ]]; then files=(${${(M)files%/*/*}#/})
if ( cd $dir:h &amp;&amp; zrecompile -p -U -z $zwc $files );
then fpath[i]=$fpath[i].zwc fi fi done</p>

<p>The -U and -z options are appropriate for functions in
the default zsh installation fpath; you may need to use
different options for your per- sonal function
directories.</p>

<p>Once the digests have been created and your fpath
modified to refer to them, you can keep them up to date by
running zrecompile with no argu- ments.</p>

<p>Keyboard Definition The large number of possible
combinations of keyboards, workstations, terminals,
emulators, and window systems makes it impossible for zsh to
have built-in key bindings for every situation. The zkbd
utility, found in Functions/Misc, can help you quickly
create key bindings for your configuration.</p>

<p>Run zkbd either as an autoloaded function, or as a shell
script:</p>

<p>zsh -f ~/zsh-4.3.11/Functions/Misc/zkbd</p>

<p>When you run zkbd, it first asks you to enter your
terminal type; if the default it offers is correct, just
press return. It then asks you to press a number of
different keys to determine characteristics of your keyboard
and terminal; zkbd warns you if it finds anything out of the
ordinary, such as a Delete key that sends neither ^H nor
^?.</p>

<p>The keystrokes read by zkbd are recorded as a definition
for an asso- ciative array named key, written to a file in
the subdirectory .zkbd within either your HOME or ZDOTDIR
directory. The name of the file is composed from the TERM,
VENDOR and OSTYPE parameters, joined by hyphens.</p>

<p>You may read this file into your .zshrc or another
startup file with the source or . commands, then reference
the key parameter in bind- key commands, like this:</p>

<p>source ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zkbd/$TERM-$VENDOR-$OSTYPE [[
-n ${key[Left]} ]] &amp;&amp; bindkey
&quot;${key[Left]}&quot; backward-char [[ -n ${key[Right]}
]] &amp;&amp; bindkey &quot;${key[Right]}&quot; forward-char
# etc.</p>

<p>Note that in order for autoload zkbd to work, the zkdb
file must be in one of the directories named in your fpath
array (see zshparam(1)). This should already be the case if
you have a standard zsh installa- tion; if it is not, copy
Functions/Misc/zkbd to an appropriate direc- tory.</p>

<p>Dumping Shell State Occasionally you may encounter what
appears to be a bug in the shell, particularly if you are
using a beta version of zsh or a development release.
Usually it is sufficient to send a description of the
problem to one of the zsh mailing lists (see zsh(1)), but
sometimes one of the zsh developers will need to recreate
your environment in order to track the problem down.</p>

<p>The script named reporter, found in the Util directory
of the distribu- tion, is provided for this purpose. (It is
also possible to autoload reporter, but reporter is not
installed in fpath by default.) This script outputs a
detailed dump of the shell state, in the form of another
script that can be read with zsh -f to recreate that
state.</p>

<p>To use reporter, read the script into your shell with
the . command and redirect the output into a file:</p>

<p>. ~/zsh-4.3.11/Util/reporter &gt; zsh.report</p>

<p>You should check the zsh.report file for any sensitive
information such as passwords and delete them by hand before
sending the script to the developers. Also, as the output
can be voluminous, its best to wait for the developers to
ask for this information before sending it.</p>

<p>You can also use reporter to dump only a subset of the
shell state. This is sometimes useful for creating startup
files for the first time. Most of the output from reporter
is far more detailed than usually is necessary for a startup
file, but the aliases, options, and zstyles states may be
useful because they include only changes from the defaults.
The bindings state may be useful if you have created any of
your own keymaps, because reporter arranges to dump the
keymap creation commands as well as the bindings for every
keymap.</p>

<p>As is usual with automated tools, if you create a
startup file with reporter, you should edit the results to
remove unnecessary commands. Note that if youre using the
new completion system, you should not dump the functions
state to your startup files with reporter; use the compdump
function instead (see zshcompsys(1)).</p>

<p>reporter [ state ... ] Print to standard output the
indicated subset of the current shell state. The state
arguments may be one or more of:</p>

<p>all Output everything listed below. aliases Output alias
definitions. bindings Output ZLE key maps and bindings.
completion Output old-style compctl commands. New completion
is covered by functions and zstyles. functions Output
autoloads and function definitions. limits Output limit
commands. options Output setopt commands. styles Same as
zstyles. variables Output shell parameter assignments, plus
export commands for any environment variables. zstyles
Output zstyle commands.</p>

<p>If the state is omitted, all is assumed.</p>

<p>With the exception of all, every state can be
abbreviated by any pre- fix, even a single letter; thus a is
the same as aliases, z is the same as zstyles, etc.</p>

<p>Manipulating Hook Functions add-zsh-hook [-dD] hook
function Several functions are special to the shell, as
described in the section SPECIAL FUNCTIONS, see zshmisc(1),
in that they are automatic called at a specific point during
shell execution. Each has an associated array consisting of
names of functions to be called at the same point; these are
so-called hook func- tions . The shell function add-zsh-hook
provides a simple way of adding or removing functions from
the array.</p>

<p>hook is one of chpwd, periodic, precmd or preexec, the
special functions in question.</p>

<p>functions is name of an ordinary shell function. If no
options are given this will be added to the array of
functions to be executed in the given context.</p>

<p>If the option -d is given, the function is removed from
the array of functions to be executed.</p>

<p>If the option -D is given, the function is treated as a
pattern and any matching names of functions are removed from
the array of functions to be executed.</p>

<p>REMEMBERING RECENT DIRECTORIES The function cdr allows
you to change the working directory to a previ- ous working
directory from a list maintained automatically. It is sim-
ilar in concept to the directory stack controlled by the
pushd, popd and dirs builtins, but is more configurable, and
as it stores all entries in files it is maintained across
sessions and (by default) between terminal emulators in the
current session. (The pushd direc- tory stack is not
actually modified or used by cdr unless you configure it to
do so as described in the configuration section below.)</p>

<p>Installation The system works by means of a hook
function that is called every time the directory changes. To
install the system, autoload the required functions and use
the add-zsh-hook function described above:</p>

<p>autoload -Uz chpwd_recent_dirs cdr add-zsh-hook
add-zsh-hook chpwd chpwd_recent_dirs</p>

<p>Now every time you change directly interactively, no
matter which com- mand you use, the directory to which you
change will be remembered in most-recent-first order.</p>

<p>Use All direct user interaction is via the cdr
function.</p>

<p>The argument to cdr is a number N corresponding to the
Nth most recently changed-to directory. 1 is the immediately
preceeding direc- tory; the current directory is remembered
but is not offered as a des- tination. Note that if you have
multiple windows open 1 may refer to a directory changed to
in another window; you can avoid this by having per-terminal
files for storing directory as described for the
recent-dirs-file style below.</p>

<p>If you set the recent-dirs-default style described below
cdr will behave the same as cd if given a non-numeric
argument, or more than one argument. The recent directory
list is updated just the same however you change
directory.</p>

<p>If the argument is omitted, 1 is assumed. This is
similar to pushds behaviour of swapping the two most recent
directories on the stack.</p>

<p>Completion for the argument to cdr is available if
compinit has been run; menu selection is recommended,
using:</p>

<p>zstyle:completion:*:*:cdr:*:*menu selection</p>

<p>to allow you to cycle through recent directories; the
order is pre- served, so the first choice is the most recent
directory before the current one. The verbose style is also
recommended to ensure the directory is shown; this style is
on by default so no action is required unless you have
changed it.</p>

<p>Options The behaviour of cdr may be modified by the
following options.</p>

<p>-l lists the numbers and the corresponding directories
in abbrevi- ated form (i.e. with ~ substitution reapplied),
one per line. The directories here are not quoted (this
would only be an issue if a directory name contained a
newline). This is used by the completion system.</p>

<p>-r sets the variable reply to the current set of
directories. Nothing is printed and the directory is not
changed.</p>

<p>-e allows you to edit the list of directories, one per
line. The list can be edited to any extent you like; no
sanity checking is performed. Completion is available. No
quoting is necessary (except for newlines, where I have in
any case no sympathy); directories are in unabbreviated from
and contain an absolute path, i.e. they start with /.
Usually the first entry should be left as the current
directory.</p>

<p>Configuration Configuration is by means of the styles
mechanism that should be famil- iar from completion; if not,
see the description of the zstyle command in see
zshmodules(1). The context for setting styles should be
:chpwd:*in case the meaning of the context is extended in
future, for example:</p>

<p>zstyle:chpwd:*recent-dirs-max 0</p>

<p>sets the value of the recent-dirs-max style to 0. In
practice the style name is specific enough that a context of
* should be fine.</p>

<p>An exception is recent-dirs-insert, which is used
exclusively by the completion system and so has the usual
completion system context :completion:*if nothing more
specific is needed), though again * should be fine in
practice.</p>

<p>recent-dirs-default If true, and the command is
expecting a recent directory index, and either there is more
than one argument or the argument is not an integer, then
fall through to &quot;cd&quot;. This allows the lazy to use
only one command for directory changing. Completion
recognises this, too; see recent-dirs-insert for how to
control completion when this option is in use.</p>

<p>recent-dirs-file The file where the list of directories
is saved. The default is
${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.chpwd-recent-dirs, i.e. this is in your
home directory unless you have set the variable ZDOTDIR to
point somewhere else. Directory names are saved in $
...quoted form, so each line in the file can be supplied
directly to the shell as an argument.</p>

<p>The value of this style may be an array. In this case,
the first file in the list will always be used for saving
directories while any other files are left untouched. When
reading the recent directory list, if there are fewer than
the maximum number of entries in the first file, the
contents of later files in the array will be appended with
duplicates removed from the list shown. The contents of the
two files are not sorted together, i.e. all the entries in
the first file are shown first. The special value + can
appear in the list to indicate the default file should be
read at that point. This allows effects like the
following:</p>

<p>zstyle :chpwd:* recent-dirs-file
~/.chpwd-recent-dirs-${TTY##*/} +</p>

<p>Recent directories are read from a file numbered
according to the terminal. If there are insufficient entries
the list is supplemented from the default file.</p>

<p>It is possible to use zstyle -e to make the directory
config- urable at run time:</p>

<p>zstyle -e :chpwd:* recent-dirs-file
pick-recent-dirs-file pick-recent-dirs-file() { if [[ $PWD =
~/text/writing(|/*) ]]; then
reply=(~/.chpwd-recent-dirs-writing) else reply=(+) fi }</p>

<p>In this example, if the current directory is
~/text/writing or a directory under it, then use a special
file for saving recent directories, else use the
default.</p>

<p>recent-dirs-insert Used by completion. If
recent-dirs-default is true, then set- ting this to true
causes the actual directory, rather than its index, to be
inserted on the command line; this has the same effect as
using the corresponding index, but makes the history clearer
and the line easier to edit. With this setting, if part of
an argument was already typed, normal directory completion
rather than recent directory completion is done; this is
because recent directory completion is expected to be done
by cycling through entries menu fashion.</p>

<p>If the value of the style is always, then only recent
directo- ries will be completed; in that case, use the cd
command when you want to complete other directories.</p>

<p>If the value is fallback, recent directories will be
tried first, then normal directory completion is performed
if recent directory completion failed to find a match.</p>

<p>Finally, if the value is both then both sets of
completions are presented; the usual tag mechanism can be
used to distinguish results, with recent directories tagged
as recent-dirs. Note that the recent directories inserted
are abbreviated with direc- tory names where
appropriate.</p>

<p>recent-dirs-max The maximum number of directories to
save to the file. If this is zero or negative there is no
maximum. The default is 20. Note this includes the current
directory, which isnt offered, so the highest number of
directories you will be offered is one less than the
maximum.</p>

<p>recent-dirs-prune This style is an array determining
what directories should (or should not) be added to the
recent list. Elements of the array can include:</p>

<p>parent Prune parents (more accurately, ancestors) from
the recent list. If present, changing directly down by any
number of directories causes the current directory to be
overwritten. For example, changing from ~pws to
~pws/some/other/dir causes ~pws not to be left on the recent
directory stack. This only applies to direct changes to
descendant directories; earlier directories on the list are
not pruned. For example, changing from ~pws/yet/another to
~pws/some/other/dir does not cause ~pws to be pruned.</p>

<p>pattern:pattern Gives a zsh pattern for directories that
should not be added to the recent list (if not already
there). This element can be repeated to add different
patterns. For example,pattern:/tmp(|/*)stops /tmp or its
descen- dants from being added. The EXTENDED_GLOB option is
always turned on for these patterns.</p>

<p>recent-dirs-pushd If set to true, cdr will use pushd
instead of cd to change the directory, so the directory is
saved on the directory stack. As the directory stack is
completely separate from the list of files saved by the
mechanism used in this file there is no obvi- ous reason to
do this.</p>

<p>Use with dynamic directory naming It is possible to
refer to recent directories using the dynamic direc- tory
name syntax that appeared in zsh version 4.3.7. If you
create and autoload a function zsh_directory_name containing
the following code, ~[1] will refer to the most recent
directory other than $PWD, and so on. This also includes
completion.</p>

<p>if [[ $1 = n ]]; then if [[ $2 = &lt;-&gt; ]]; then #
Recent directory typeset -ga reply autoload -Uz cdr cdr -r
if [[ -n ${reply[$2]} ]]; then reply=(${reply[$2]}) return 0
else reply=() return 1 fi fi elif [[ $1 = c ]]; then if [[
$PREFIX = &lt;-&gt; || -z $PREFIX ]]; then typeset -a keys
values values=(${${(f)&quot;$(cdr -l)&quot;}/ ##/:})
keys=(${values%%:*}) _describe -t dir-index recent directory
index values keys -V unsorted -] return fi fi return 1</p>

<p>Details of directory handling This section is for the
curious or confused; most users will not need to know this
information.</p>

<p>Recent directories are saved to a file immediately and
hence are pre- served across sessions. Note currently no
file locking is applied: the list is updated immediately on
interactive commands and nowhere else (unlike history), and
it is assumed you are only going to change direc- tory in
one window at once. This is not safe on shared accounts, but
in any case the system has limited utility when someone else
is chang- ing to a different set of directories behind your
back.</p>

<p>To make this a little safer, only directory changes
instituted from the command line, either directly or
indirectly through shell function calls (but not through
subshells, evals, traps, completion functions and the like)
are saved. Shell functions should use cd -q or pushd -q to
avoid side effects if the change to the directory is to be
invisible at the command line. See the contents of the
function chpwd_recent_dirs for more details.</p>

<p>GATHERING INFORMATION FROM VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS In a
lot of cases, it is nice to automatically retrieve
information from version control systems (VCSs), such as
subversion, CVS or git, to be able to provide it to the
user; possibly in the user s prompt. So that you can
instantly tell which branch you are currently on, for
example.</p>

<p>In order to do that, you may use the vcs_info
function.</p>

<p>The following VCSs are supported, showing the
abbreviated name by which they are referred to within the
system: Bazaar (bzr) http://bazaar-vcs.org/ Codeville (cdv)
http://codeville.org/ Concurrent Versioning System (cvs)
http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/ Darcs (darcs) http://darcs.net/
Git (git) http://git-scm.com/ GNU arch (tla)
http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/ Mercurial (hg)
http://mercurial.selenic.com/ Monotone (mtn)
http://monotone.ca/ Perforce (p4) http://www.perforce.com/
Subversion (svn) http://subversion.tigris.org/ SVK (svk)
http://svk.bestpractical.com/</p>

<p>There is also support for the patch management system
quilt (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt). See Quilt
Support below for details.</p>

<p>To load vcs_info:</p>

<p>autoload -Uz vcs_info</p>

<p>It can be used in any existing prompt, because it does
not require any $psvar entries to be left available.</p>

<p>Quickstart To get this feature working quickly
(including colors), you can do the following (assuming, you
loaded vcs_info properly - see above):</p>

<p>zstyle :vcs_info:* actionformats
%F{5}(%f%s%F{5})%F{3}-%F{5}[%F{2}%b%F{3}|%F{1}%a%F{5}]%f
zstyle :vcs_info:* formats
%F{5}(%f%s%F{5})%F{3}-%F{5}[%F{2}%b%F{5}]%f zstyle
:vcs_info:(sv[nk]|bzr):* branchformat %b%F{1}:%F{3}%r precmd
() { vcs_info } PS1= %F{5}[%F{2}%n%F{5}] %F{3}%3~
${vcs_info_msg_0_}%f%#</p>

<p>Obviously, the last two lines are there for
demonstration. You need to call vcs_info from your precmd
function. Once that is done you need a single quoted
${vcs_info_msg_0_}_in your prompt.</p>

<p>To be able to use ${vcs_info_msg_0_}_ directly in your
prompt like this, you will need to have the PROMPT_SUBST
option enabled.</p>

<p>Now call the vcs_info_printsys utility from the command
line:</p>

<p>% vcs_info_printsys ## list of supported version control
backends: ## disabled systems are prefixed by a hash sign
(#) bzr cdv cvs darcs git hg mtn p4 svk svn tla ## flavours
(cannot be used in the enable or disable styles; they ## are
enabled and disabled with their master [git-svn -&gt; git])
## they *can* be used in contexts: :vcs_info:git-svn:.
git-p4 git-svn hg-git hg-hgsubversion hg-hgsvn</p>

<p>You may not want all of these because there is no point
in running the code to detect systems you do not use. So
there is a way to disable some backends altogether:</p>

<p>zstyle:vcs_info:*disable bzr cdv darcs mtn svk tla</p>

<p>You may also pick a few from that list and enable only
those:</p>

<p>zstyle:vcs_info:*enable git cvs svn</p>

<p>If you rerun vcs_info_printsys after one of these
commands, you will see the backends listed in the disable
style (or backends not in the enable style - if you used
that) marked as disabled by a hash sign. That means the
detection of these systems is skipped completely. No wasted
time there.</p>

<p>Configuration The vcs_info feature can be configured via
zstyle.</p>

<p>First, the context in which we are working:
:vcs_info:&lt;vcs-string&gt;:&lt;user-context&gt;:&lt;repo-root-name&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;vcs-string&gt; is one of: git, git-svn, git-p4, hg,
hg-git, hg-hgsubversion, hg-hgsvn, darcs, bzr, cdv, mtn,
svn, cvs, svk, tla or p4. When hooks are active the hooks
name is added after a +. (See Hooks in vcs_info below.)</p>

<p>&lt;user-context&gt; is a freely configurable string,
assignable by the user as the first argument to vcs_info
(see its description below).</p>

<p>&lt;repo-root-name&gt; is the name of a repository in
which you want a style to match. So, if you want a setting
specific to /usr/src/zsh, with that being a CVS checkout,
you can set &lt;repo-root-name&gt; to zsh to make it so.</p>

<p>There are three special values for &lt;vcs-string&gt;:
The first is named -init-, that is in effect as long as
there was no decision what VCS backend to use. The second is
-preinit-; it is used before vcs_info is run, when
initializing the data exporting variables. The third special
value is formats and is used by the vcs_info_lastmsg for
looking up its styles.</p>

<p>The initial value of &lt;repo-root-name&gt; is -all- and
it is replaced with the actual name, as soon as it is known.
Only use this part of the con- text for defining the
formats, actionformats or branchformat styles, as it is
guaranteed that &lt;repo-root-name&gt; is set up correctly
for these only. For all other styles, just use*instead.</p>

<p>There are two pre-defined values for
&lt;user-context&gt;: default the one used if none is
specified command used by vcs_info_lastmsg to lookup its
styles</p>

<p>You can of course use:vcs_info:*to match all VCSs in all
user-con- texts at once.</p>

<p>This is a description of all styles that are looked
up.</p>

<p>formats A list of formats, used when actionformats is
not used (which is most of the time).</p>

<p>actionformats A list of formats, used if there is a
special action going on in your current repository; like an
interactive rebase or a merge conflict.</p>

<p>branchformat Some backends replace %b in the formats and
actionformats styles above, not only by a branch name but
also by a revision number. This style lets you modify how
that string should look.</p>

<p>nvcsformats These &quot;formats&quot; are exported when
we didnt detect a version control system for the current
directory. This is useful if you want vcs_info to completely
take over the generation of your prompt. You would do
something like PS1= ${vcs_info_msg_0_}to accomplish
that.</p>

<p>hgrevformat hg uses both a hash and a revision number to
reference a spe- cific changeset in a repository. With this
style you can format the revision string (see branchformat)
to include either or both. Its only useful when get-revision
is true.</p>

<p>max-exports Defines the maximum number of
vcs_info_msg_*_ variables vcs_info will export.</p>

<p>enable A list of backends you want to use. Checked in
the -init- con- text. If this list contains an item called
NONE no backend is used at all and vcs_info will do nothing.
If this list contains ALL vcs_info will use all known
backends. Only with ALL in enable will the disable style
have any effect. ALL and NONE are case insensitive.</p>

<p>disable A list of VCSs you dont want vcs_info to test
for repositories (checked in the -init- context, too). Only
used if enable con- tains ALL.</p>

<p>disable-patterns A list of patterns that are checked
against $PWD. If a pattern matches, vcs_info will be
disabled. This style is checked in the
:vcs_info:-init-:*:-all- context.</p>

<p>Say, ~/.zsh is a directory under version control, in
which you do not want vcs_info to be active, do: zstyle
:vcs_info:* disable-patterns &quot;$HOME/.zsh(|/*)&quot;</p>

<p>use-quilt If enabled, the quilt support code is active
in addon mode. See Quilt Support for details.</p>

<p>quilt-standalone If enabled, standalone mode detection
is attempted if no VCS is active in a given directory. See
Quilt Support for details.</p>

<p>quilt-patch-dir Overwrite the value of the
$QUILT_PATCHES environment variable. See Quilt Support for
details.</p>

<p>quiltcommand When quilt itself is called in quilt
support the value of this style is used as the command
name.</p>

<p>check-for-changes If enabled, this style causes the %c
and %u format escapes to show when the working directory has
uncommitted changes. The strings displayed by these escapes
can be controlled via the stagedstr and unstagedstr styles.
The only backends that cur- rently support this option are
git and hg (hg only supports unstaged).</p>

<p>Note, the actions taken if this style is enabled are
potentially expensive (read: they may be slow, depending on
how big the cur- rent repository is). Therefore, it is
disabled by default.</p>

<p>stagedstr This string will be used in the %c escape if
there are staged changes in the repository.</p>

<p>unstagedstr This string will be used in the %u escape if
there are unstaged changes in the repository.</p>

<p>command This style causes vcs_info to use the supplied
string as the command to use as the VCS s binary. Note, that
setting this in :vcs_info:* is not a good idea.</p>

<p>If the value of this style is empty (which is the
default), the used binary name is the name of the backend in
use (e.g. svn is used in an svn repository).</p>

<p>The repo-root-name part in the context is always the
default -all- when this style is looked up.</p>

<p>For example, this style can be used to use binaries from
non-default installation directories. Assume, git is
installed in /usr/bin but your sysadmin installed a newer
version in /usr/bin/local. Instead of changing the order of
your $PATH parameter, you can do this: zstyle
:vcs_info:git:*:-all- command /usr/local/bin/git</p>

<p>use-server This is used by the Perforce backend (p4) to
decide if it should contact the Perforce server to find out
if a directory is man- aged by Perforce. This is the only
reliable way of doing this, but runs the risk of a delay if
the server name cannot be found. If the server (more
specifically, the host:port pair describing the server)
cannot be contacted, its name is put into the asso- ciative
array vcs_info_p4_dead_servers and is not contacted again
during the session until it is removed by hand. If you do
not set this style, the p4 backend is only usable if you
have set the environment variable P4CONFIG to a file name
and have corresponding files in the root directories of each
Perforce client. See comments in the function
VCS_INFO_detect_p4 for more detail.</p>

<p>use-simple If there are two different ways of gathering
information, you can select the simpler one by setting this
style to true; the default is to use the not-that-simple
code, which is potentially a lot slower but might be more
accurate in all possible cases. This style is used by the
bzr and hg backends. In the case of hg it will invoke the
external hexdump program to parse the binary dirstate cache
file; this method will not return the local revi- sion
number.</p>

<p>get-revision If set to true, vcs_info goes the extra
mile to figure out the revision of a repositorys work tree
(currently for the git and hg backends, where this kind of
information is not always vital). For git, the hash value of
the currently checked out commit is available via the %i
expansion. With hg, the local revision number and the
corresponding global hash are available via %i.</p>

<p>get-mq If set to true, the hg backend will look for a
Mercurial Queue (mq) patch directory. Information will be
available via the %m replacement.</p>

<p>get-bookmarks If set to true, the hg backend will try to
get a list of current bookmarks. They will be available via
the %m replacement.</p>

<p>use-prompt-escapes Determines if we assume that the
assembled string from vcs_info includes prompt escapes.
(Used by vcs_info_lastmsg.)</p>

<p>debug Enable debugging output to track possible
problems. Currently this style is only used by vcs_infos
hooks system.</p>

<p>hooks A list style that defines hook-function names. See
Hooks in vcs_info below for details.</p>

<p>The default values for these styles in all contexts
are:</p>

<p>formats &quot; (%s)-[%b]%u%c-&quot; actionformats &quot;
(%s)-[%b|%a]%u%c-&quot; branchformat &quot;%b:%r&quot; (for
bzr, svn, svk and hg) nvcsformats &quot;&quot; hgrevformat
&quot;%r:%h&quot; max-exports 2 enable ALL disable (empty
list) disable-patterns (empty list) check-for-changes false
stagedstr (string: &quot;S&quot;) unstagedstr (string:
&quot;U&quot;) command (empty string) use-server false
use-simple false get-revision false get-mq true
get-bookmarks false use-prompt-escapes true debug false
hooks (empty list) use-quilt false quilt-standalone false
quilt-patch-dir empty - use $QUILT_PATCHES quiltcommand
quilt</p>

<p>In normal formats and actionformats the following
replacements are done:</p>

<p>%s The VCS in use (git, hg, svn, etc.). %b Information
about the current branch. %a An identifier that describes
the action. Only makes sense in actionformats. %i The
current revision number or identifier. For hg the hgrevfor-
mat style may be used to customize the output. %c The string
from the stagedstr style if there are staged changes in the
repository. %u The string from the unstagedstr style if
there are unstaged changes in the repository. %R The base
directory of the repository. %r The repository name. If %R
is /foo/bar/repoXY, %r is repoXY. %S A subdirectory within a
repository. If $PWD is /foo/bar/repoXY/beer/tasty, %S is
beer/tasty. %m A &quot;misc&quot; replacement. It is at the
discretion of the backend to decide what this replacement
expands to. It is currently used by the hg and git backends
to display patch information from the mq and stgit
extensions.</p>

<p>In branchformat these replacements are done:</p>

<p>%b The branch name. %r The current revision number or
the hgrevformat style for hg.</p>

<p>In hgrevformat these replacements are done:</p>

<p>%r The current local revision number. %h The current
40-character changeset ID hash identifier.</p>

<p>In patch-format and nopatch-format these replacements
are done:</p>

<p>%p The name of the top-most applied patch. %u The number
of unapplied patches. %n The number of applied patches. %c
The number of unapplied patches. %g The names of active mq
guards (hg backend). %G The number of active mq guards (hg
backend).</p>

<p>Not all VCS backends have to support all replacements.
For nvcsformats no replacements are performed at all, it is
just a string.</p>

<p>Oddities If you want to use the %b (bold off) prompt
expansion in formats, which expands %b itself, use %%b. That
will cause the vcs_info expansion to replace %%b with %b, so
that zsh s prompt expansion mechanism can han- dle it.
Similarly, to hand down %b from branchformat, use %%%%b.
Sorry for this inconvenience, but it cannot be easily
avoided. Luckily we do not clash with a lot of prompt
expansions and this only needs to be done for those.</p>

<p>Quilt Support Quilt is not a version control system,
therefore this is not imple- mented as a backend. It can
help keeping track of a series of patches. People use it to
keep a set of changes they want to use on top of soft- ware
packages (which is tightly integrated into the package build
pro- cess - the Debian project does this for a large number
of packages). Quilt can also help individual developers keep
track of their own patches on top of real version control
systems.</p>

<p>The vcs_info integration tries to support both ways of
using quilt by having two slightly different modes of
operation: addon mode and standalone mode).</p>

<p>For addon mode to become active vcs_info must have
already detected a real version control system controlling
the directory. If that is the case, a directory that holds
quilts patches needs to be found. That directory is
configurable via the _QUILT_PATCHES_ environment variable.
If that variable exists its value is used, otherwise the
value patches is assumed. The value from $QUILT_PATCHES can
be overwritten using thequilt-patchesstyle. (Note: you can
use vcs_info to keep the value of $QUILT_PATCHES correct all
the time via the post-quilt hook).</p>

<p>When the directory in question is found, quilt is
assumed to be active. To gather more information, vcs_info
looks for a directory called .pc; Quilt uses that directory
to track its current state. If this directory does not exist
we know that quilt has not done anything to the working
directory (read: no patches have been applied yet).</p>

<p>If patches are applied, vcs_info will try to find out
which. If you want to know which patches of a series are not
yet applied, you need to activate the get-unapplied style in
the appropriate context.</p>

<p>vcs_info allows for very detailed control over how the
gathered infor- mation is presented (see the below sections,
Styles and Hooks in vcs_info), all of which are documented
below. Note there are a number of other patch tracking
systems that work on top of a certain version control system
(like stgit for git, or mq for hg); the configuration for
systems like that are generally configured the same way as
the quilt support.</p>

<p>If the quilt support is working in addon mode, the
produced string is available as a simple format replacement
(%Q to be precise), which can be used in formats and
actionformats; see below for details).</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the support code is working in
standalone mode, vcs_info will pretend as if quilt were an
actual version control system. That means that the version
control system identifier (which otherwise would be
something like svn or cvs) will be set to -quilt- . This has
implications on the used style context where this identifier
is the second element. vcs_info will have filled in a proper
value for the &quot;repositorys&quot; root directory and the
string containing the information about quilts state will be
available as the misc replacement (and %Q for compatibility
with addon mode.</p>

<p>What is left to discuss is how standalone mode is
detected. The detection itself is a series of searches for
directories. You can have this detection enabled all the
time in every directory that is not oth- erwise under
version control. If you know there is only a limited set of
trees where you would like vcs_info to try and look for
Quilt in standalone mode to minimise the amount of searching
on every call to vcs_info, there are a number of ways to do
that:</p>

<p>Essentially, standalone mode detection is controlled by
a style called quilt-standalone. It is a string style and
its value can have different effects. The simplest values
are: always to run detection every time vcs_info is run, and
never to turn the detection off entirely.</p>

<p>If the value of quilt-standalone is something else, it
is interpreted differently. If the value is the name of a
scalar variable the value of that variable is checked and
that value is used in the same always/never way as described
above.</p>

<p>If the value of quilt-standalone is an array, the
elements of that array are used as directory names under
which you want the detection to be active.</p>

<p>If quilt-standalone is an associative array, the keys
are taken as directory names under which you want the
detection to be active, but only if the corresponding value
is the string true.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, if the value of quilt-standalone is
the name of a function, the function is called without
arguments and the return value decides whether detection
should be active. A 0 return value is true; a non-zero
return value is interpreted as false.</p>

<p>Note, if there is both a function and a variable by the
name of quilt-standalone, the function will take
precedence.</p>

<p>Function Descriptions (Public API) vcs_info
[user-context] The main function, that runs all backends and
assembles all data into ${vcs_info_msg_*_}. This is the
function you want to call from precmd if you want to include
up-to-date information in your prompt (see Variable
description below). If an argument is given, that string
will be used instead of default in the user-context field of
the style context.</p>

<p>vcs_info_lastmsg Outputs the last ${vcs_info_msg_*_}
value. Takes into account the value of the
use-prompt-escapes style in _ :vcs_info:for-
mats:command:-all-. It also only prints max-exports
values.</p>

<p>vcs_info_printsys [user-context] Prints a list of all
supported version control systems. Useful to find out
possible contexts (and which of them are enabled) or values
for the disable style.</p>

<p>vcs_info_setsys Initializes vcs_infos internal list of
available backends. With this function, you can add support
for new VCSs without restart- ing the shell.</p>

<p>All functions named VCS_INFO_* are for internal use
only.</p>

<p>Variable Description ${vcs_info_msg_N_} (Note the
trailing underscore) Where N is an integer, e.g.,
vcs_info_msg_0_. These variables are the storage for the
informational message the last vcs_info call has assembled.
These are strongly connected to the formats, actionformats
and nvcsformats styles described above. Those styles are
lists. The first member of that list gets expanded into
${vcs_info_msg_0_}, the second into ${vcs_info_msg_1_} and
the Nth into ${vcs_info_msg_N-1_}. These parameters are
exported into the environment. (See the max-exports style
above.)</p>

<p>All variables named VCS_INFO_* are for internal use
only.</p>

<p>Hooks in vcs_info Hooks are places in vcs_info where you
can run your own code. That code can communicate with the
code that called it and through that, change the systems
behaviour.</p>

<p>For configuration, hooks change the style context:
:vcs_info:&lt;vcs-string&gt;+&lt;hook-name&gt;:&lt;user-context&gt;:&lt;repo-root-name&gt;</p>

<p>To register functions to a hook, you need to list them
in the hooks style in the appropriate context.</p>

<p>Example: zstyle:vcs_info:*+foo:*hooks bar baz</p>

<p>This registers functions to the hook foo for all
backends. In order to avoid namespace problems, all
registered function names are prepended by a +vi-, so the
actual functions called for the foo hook are +vi-bar and
+vi-baz.</p>

<p>If something seems weird, you can enable the debug
boolean style in the proper context and the hook-calling
code will print what it tried to execute and whether the
function in question existed.</p>

<p>When you register more than one function to a hook, all
functions are executed one after another until one function
returns non-zero or until all functions have been
called.</p>

<p>You may pass data between functions via an associative
array, user_data. For example:</p>

<p>+vi-git-myfirsthook(){ user_data[myval]=$myval }
+vi-git-mysecondhook(){ # do something with
${user_data[myval]} }</p>

<p>There are a number of variables that are special in hook
contexts:</p>

<p>ret The return value that the hooks system will return
to the caller. The default is an integer zero . If and how a
changed ret value changes the execution of the caller
depends on the specific hook. See the hook documentation
below for details.</p>

<p>hook_com An associated array which is used for
bidirectional communica- tion from the caller to hook
functions. The used keys depend on the specific hook.</p>

<p>context The active context of the hook. Functions that
wish to change this variable should make it local scope
first.</p>

<p>vcs The current VCS after it was detected. The same
values as in the enable/disable style are used. Available in
all hooks except start-up.</p>

<p>Finally, the full list of currently available hooks:</p>

<p>start-up Called after starting vcs_info but before the
VCS in this direc- tory is determined. It can be used to
deactivate vcs_info tem- porarily if necessary. When ret is
set to 1, vcs_info aborts and does nothing; when set to 2,
vcs_info sets up everything as if no version control were
active and exits.</p>

<p>pre-get-data Same as start-up but after the VCS was
detected.</p>

<p>gen-hg-bookmark-string Called in the Mercurial backend
when a bookmark string is gener- ated; the get-revision and
get-bookmarks styles must be true.</p>

<p>This hook gets the names of the Mercurial bookmarks that
vcs_info collected from hg.</p>

<p>When setting ret to non-zero, the string in
${hook_com[hg-book- mark-string]} will be used in the %m
escape in formats and actionformats and will be availabe in
the global backend_misc array as
${backend_misc[bookmarks]}.</p>

<p>gen-applied-string Called in the git (with stgit), and
hg (with mq) backends and in quilt support when the
applied-string is generated; the use-quilt zstyle must be
true for quilt (the mq and stgit back- ends are active by
default).</p>

<p>This hook gets the names of all applied patches which
vcs_info collected so far in the opposite order, which means
that the first argument is the top-most patch and so
forth.</p>

<p>When setting ret to non-zero, the string in
${hook_com[applied-string]} will be used in the %m escape in
formats and actionformats; it will be available in the
global backend_misc array as $backend_misc[patches]}; and it
will be available as %p in the patch-format and
nopatch-format styles.</p>

<p>gen-unapplied-string Called in the git (with stgit), and
hg (with mq) backend and in quilt support when the
unapplied-string is generated; the get-unapplied style must
be true.</p>

<p>This hook gets the names of all unapplied patches which
vcs_info collected so far in the opposite order, which mean
that the first argument is the patch next-in-line to be
applied and so forth.</p>

<p>When setting ret to non-zero, the string in
${hook_com[unap- plied-string]} will be available as %u in
the patch-format and nopatch-format styles.</p>

<p>gen-mqguards-string Called in the hg backend when
guards-string is generated; the get-mq style must be true
(default).</p>

<p>This hook gets the names of any active mq guards.</p>

<p>When setting ret to non-zero, the string in
${hook_com[guards-string]} will be used in the %g escape in
the patch-format and nopatch-format styles.</p>

<p>post-quilt Called after the quilt support is done. The
following informa- tion is passed as arguments to the hook:
1. the quilt-support mode (addon or standalone); 2. the
directory that contains the patch series; 3. the directory
that holds quilts status information (the .pc directory) or
the string &quot;-nopc-&quot; if that directory wasnt
found.</p>

<p>The hook_com parameter is not used.</p>

<p>set-branch-format Called before branchformat is set. The
only argument to the hook is the format that is configured
at this point.</p>

<p>The hook_com keys considered are branch and revision.
They are set to the values figured out so far by vcs_info
and any change will be used directly when the actual
replacement is done.</p>

<p>If ret is set to to non-zero, the string in
${hook_com[branch-replace]} will be used unchanged as the %b
replacement in the variables set by vcs_info.</p>

<p>set-hgrev-format Called before a hgrevformat is set. The
only argument to the hook is the format that is configured
at this point.</p>

<p>The hook_com keys considered are hash and localrev. They
are set to the values figured out so far by vcs_info and any
change will be used directly when the actual replacement is
done.</p>

<p>If ret is set to to non-zero, the string in
${hook_com[rev-replace]} will be used unchanged as the %i
replacement in the variables set by vcs_info.</p>

<p>set-message Called each time before a vcs_info_msg_N_
message is set. It takes two arguments; the first being the
N in the message variable name, the second is the currently
configured formats or actionformats.</p>

<p>There are a number of hook_com keys, that are used here:
action, branch, base, base-name, subdir, staged , unstaged ,
revision, misc, vcs and one miscN entry for each
backend-specific data field (N starting at zero). They are
set to the values figured out so far by vcs_info and any
change will be used directly when the actual replacement is
done.</p>

<p>Since this hook is triggered multiple times (once for
each con- figured formats or actionformats), each of the
hook_com keys mentioned above (except for the miscN entries)
has an _orig counterpart, so even if you changed a value to
your liking you can still get the original value in the next
run. Changing the _orig values is probably not a good
idea.</p>

<p>If ret is set to to non-zero, the string in
${hook_com[message]} will be used unchanged as the message
by vcs_info.</p>

<p>If all of this sounds rather confusing, take a look at
the Examples section below and also in the
Misc/vcs_info-examples file in the Zsh source. They contain
some explanatory code.</p>

<p>Examples Dont use vcs_info at all (even though its in
your prompt): zstyle:vcs_info:*enable NONE</p>

<p>Disable the backends for bzr and svk:
zstyle:vcs_info:*disable bzr svk</p>

<p>Disable everything but bzr and svk:
zstyle:vcs_info:*enable bzr svk</p>

<p>Provide a special formats for git:
zstyle:vcs_info:git:*formats GIT, BABY! [%b] zstyle
:vcs_info:git:* actionformats GIT ACTION! [%b|%a]</p>

<p>All %x expansion in all sorts of formats
(&quot;formats&quot;, &quot;actionformats&quot;,
branchformat, you name it) are done using the zformat
builtin from the zsh/zutil module. That means you can do
everything with these %x items what zformat supports. In
particular, if you want something that is really long to
have a fixed width, like a hash in a mercurial branchformat,
you can do this: %12.12i. Thatll shrink the 40 character
hash to its 12 leading characters. The form is actually
%min.maxx. More is possible. See the section The zsh/zutil
Module in zshmod- ules(1) for details.</p>

<p>Use the quicker bzr backend
zstyle:vcs_info:bzr:*use-simple true</p>

<p>If you do use use-simple, please report if it does
the-right-thing[tm].</p>

<p>Display the revision number in yellow for bzr and svn:
zstyle :vcs_info:(svn|bzr):* branchformat %b%{
${fg[yellow]%}:%r</p>

<p>If you want colors, make sure you enclose the color
codes in %{...%} if you want to use the string provided by
vcs_info in prompts.</p>

<p>Here is how to print the VCS information as a command
(not in a prompt): alias vcsivcs_info command;
vcs_info_lastmsg</p>

<p>This way, you can even define different formats for
output via vcs_info_lastmsg in the :vcs_info:*:command:*
namespace.</p>

<p>Now as promised, some code that uses hooks: say, you d
like to replace the string svn by subversion in vcs_infos %s
formats replacement.</p>

<p>First, we will tell vcs_info to call a function when
populating the message variables with the gathered
information: zstyle:vcs_info:*+set-message:*hooks
svn2subversion</p>

<p>Nothing happens. Which is reasonable, since we didn t
define the actual function yet. To see what the hooks
subsystem is trying to do, enable the debug style:
zstyle:vcs_info:*+*:*debug true</p>

<p>That should give you an idea what is going on.
Specifically, the func- tion that we are looking for is
+vi-svn2subversion. Note, the +vi- prefix. So, everything is
in order, just as documented. When you are done checking out
the debugging output, disable it again:
zstyle:vcs_info:*+*:*debug false</p>

<p>Now, lets define the function:</p>

<p>function +vi-svn2subversion() { [[ ${hook_com[vcs_orig]}
== svn ]] &amp;&amp; hook_com[vcs]=subversion }</p>

<p>Simple enough. And it could have even been simpler, if
only we had reg- istered our function in a less generic
context. If we do it only in the svn backends context, we
don t need to test which the active backend is: zstyle
:vcs_info:svn+set-message:* hooks svn2subversion</p>

<p>function +vi-svn2subversion() { hook_com[vcs]=subversion
}</p>

<p>And finally a little more elaborate example, that uses a
hook to create a customised bookmark string for the hg
backend.</p>

<p>Again, we start off by registering a function: zstyle
:vcs_info:hg+gen-hg-bookmark-string:*hooks hgbookmarks</p>

<p>And then we define the +vi-hgbookmarks function:</p>

<p>function +vi-hgbookmarks() { # The default is to connect
all bookmark names by # commas. This mixes things up a
little. # Imagine, thers one type of bookmarks that is #
special to you. Say, because is *your* work. # Those
bookmarks look always like this: &quot;sh/*&quot; # (because
your initials are sh, for example). # This makes the
bookmarks string use only those # bookmarks. If thers more
than one, it # concatenates them using commas. local s i #
The bookmarks returned byhgare available in # the functions
positional parameters. (( $# == 0 )) &amp;&amp; return 0 for
i in &quot;$@&quot;; do if [[ $i == sh/* ]]; then [[ -n $s
]] &amp;&amp; s=$s, s=${s}$i fi done # Now, the
communication with the code that calls # the hook functions
is done via the hook_com[] # hash. The key, at which the
gen-hg-bookmark-string # hook looks at ishg-bookmark-strin.
So: hook_com[hg-bookmark-string]=$s # And to signal, that we
want to use the sting we # just generated, set the special
variableretto # something other than the default zero: ret=1
return 0 }</p>

<p>Some longer examples and code snippets which might be
useful are avail- able in the examples file located at
Misc/vcs_info-examples in the Zsh source directory.</p>

<p>This concludes our guided tour through zshs
vcs_info.</p>

<p>PROMPT THEMES Installation You should make sure all the
functions from the Functions/Prompts directory of the source
distribution are available; they all begin with the string
prompt_ except for the special function promptinit. You also
need the colors function from Functions/Misc. All of these
functions may already have been installed on your system; if
not, you will need to find them and copy them. The directory
should appear as one of the elements of the fpath array
(this should already be the case if they were installed),
and at least the function promptinit should be autoloaded;
it will autoload the rest. Finally, to initialize the use of
the system you need to call the promptinit function. The
following code in your .zshrc will arrange for this; assume
the functions are stored in the directory ~/myfns:</p>

<p>fpath=(~/myfns $fpath) autoload -U promptinit
promptinit</p>

<p>Theme Selection Use the prompt command to select your
preferred theme. This command may be added to your .zshrc
following the call to promptinit in order to start zsh with
a theme already selected.</p>

<p>prompt [ -c | -l ] prompt [ -p | -h ] [ theme ... ]
prompt [ -s ] theme [ arg ... ] Set or examine the prompt
theme. With no options and a theme argument, the theme with
that name is set as the current theme. The available themes
are determined at run time; use the -l option to see a list.
The special theme random selects at random one of the
available themes and sets your prompt to that.</p>

<p>In some cases the theme may be modified by one or more
argu- ments, which should be given after the theme name. See
the help for each theme for descriptions of these
arguments.</p>

<p>Options are:</p>

<p>-c Show the currently selected theme and its parameters,
if any. -l List all available prompt themes. -p Preview the
theme named by theme, or all themes if no theme is given. -h
Show help for the theme named by theme, or for the prompt
function if no theme is given. -s Set theme as the current
theme and save state.</p>

<p>prompt_theme_setup Each available theme has a setup
function which is called by the prompt function to install
that theme. This function may define other functions as
necessary to maintain the prompt, including functions used
to preview the prompt or provide help for its use. You
should not normally call a themes setup function
directly.</p>

<p>ZLE FUNCTIONS Widgets These functions all implement
user-defined ZLE widgets (see zshzle(1)) which can be bound
to keystrokes in interactive shells. To use them, your
.zshrc should contain lines of the form</p>

<p>autoload function zle -N function</p>

<p>followed by an appropriate bindkey command to associate
the function with a key sequence. Suggested bindings are
described below.</p>

<p>bash-style word functions If you are looking for
functions to implement moving over and editing words in the
manner of bash, where only alphanumeric characters are
considered word characters, you can use the func- tions
described in the next section. The following is suffi-
cient:</p>

<p>autoload -U select-word-style select-word-style bash</p>

<p>forward-word-match, backward-word-match kill-word-match,
backward-kill-word-match transpose-words-match,
capitalize-word-match up-case-word-match,
down-case-word-match select-word-style, match-word-context,
match-words-by-style The eight -match functions are drop-in
replacements for the builtin widgets without the suffix. By
default they behave in a similar way. However, by the use of
styles and the function select-word-style, the way words are
matched can be altered.</p>

<p>The simplest way of configuring the functions is to use
select-word-style, which can either be called as a normal
func- tion with the appropriate argument, or invoked as a
user-defined widget that will prompt for the first character
of the word style to be used. The first time it is invoked,
the eight -match functions will automatically replace the
builtin ver- sions, so they do not need to be loaded
explicitly.</p>

<p>The word styles available are as follows. Only the first
char- acter is examined.</p>

<p>bash Word characters are alphanumeric characters
only.</p>

<p>normal As in normal shell operation: word characters are
alphanumeric characters plus any characters present in the
string given by the parameter $WORDCHARS.</p>

<p>shell Words are complete shell command arguments,
possibly including complete quoted strings, or any tokens
special to the shell.</p>

<p>whitespace Words are any set of characters delimited by
whitespace.</p>

<p>default Restore the default settings; this is usually
the same as normal.</p>

<p>All but default can be input as an upper case character,
which has the same effect but with subword matching turned
on. In this case, words with upper case characters are
treated spe- cially: each separate run of upper case
characters, or an upper case character followed by any
number of other characters, is considered a word. The style
subword-range can supply an alter- native character range to
the default [:upper:]; the value of the style is treated as
the contents of a [...] pattern (note that the outer
brackets should not be supplied, only those sur- rounding
named ranges).</p>

<p>More control can be obtained using the zstyle command,
as described in zshmodules(1). Each style is looked up in
the con- text :zle:widget where widget is the name of the
user-defined widget, not the name of the function
implementing it, so in the case of the definitions supplied
by select-word-style the appro- priate contexts are
:zle:forward-word, and so on. The function select-word-style
itself always defines styles for the context :zle:* which
can be overridden by more specific (longer) pat- terns as
well as explicit contexts.</p>

<p>The style word-style specifies the rules to use. This
may have the following values.</p>

<p>normal Use the standard shell rules, i.e. alphanumerics
and $WORDCHARS, unless overridden by the styles word-chars
or word-class.</p>

<p>specified Similar to normal, but only the specified
characters, and not also alphanumerics, are considered word
characters.</p>

<p>unspecified The negation of specified. The given
characters are those which will not be considered part of a
word.</p>

<p>shell Words are obtained by using the syntactic rules
for gen- erating shell command arguments. In addition,
special tokens which are never command arguments such as ()
are also treated as words.</p>

<p>whitespace Words are whitespace-delimited strings of
characters.</p>

<p>The first three of those rules usually use $WORDCHARS,
but the value in the parameter can be overridden by the
style word-chars, which works in exactly the same way as
$WORDCHARS. In addition, the style word-class uses character
class syntax to group characters and takes precedence over
word-chars if both are set. The word-class style does not
include the surrounding brackets of the character class; for
example, -:[:alnum:] is a valid word-class to include all
alphanumerics plus the charac- ters - and :. Be careful
including ], ^ and - as these are special inside character
classes.</p>

<p>word-style may also have -subword appended to its value
to turn on subword matching, as described above.</p>

<p>The style skip-chars is mostly useful for
transpose-words and similar functions. If set, it gives a
count of characters starting at the cursor position which
will not be considered part of the word and are treated as
space, regardless of what they actually are. For example,
if</p>

<p>zstyle:zle:transpose-wordsskip-chars 1</p>

<p>has been set, and transpose-words-match is called with
the cur- sor on the X of fooXbar, where X can be any
character, then the resulting expression is barXfoo.</p>

<p>Finer grained control can be obtained by setting the
style word-context to an array of pairs of entries. Each
pair of entries consists of a pattern and a subcontext. The
shell argu- ment the cursor is on is matched against each
pattern in turn until one matches; if it does, the context
is extended by a colon and the corresponding subcontext.
Note that the test is made against the original word on the
line, with no stripping of quotes. Special handling is done
between words: the current context is examined and if it
contains the string back, the word before the cursor is
considered, else the word after cursor is considered. Some
examples are given below.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of use of the styles, actually
taken from the simplified interface in
select-word-style:</p>

<p>zstyle:zle:*word-style standard
zstyle:zle:*word-chars</p>

<p>Implements bash-style word handling for all widgets,
i.e. only alphanumerics are word characters; equivalent to
setting the parameter WORDCHARS empty for the given
context.</p>

<p>style:zle:*kill*word-style space</p>

<p>Uses space-delimited words for widgets with the word
kill in the name. Neither of the styles word-chars nor
word-class is used in this case.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of use of the word-context style
to extend the context.</p>

<p>zstyle :zle:* word-context &quot;*/*&quot; file
&quot;[[:space:]]&quot; whitespace zstyle
:zle:transpose-words:whitespace word-style shell zstyle
:zle:transpose-words:filename word-style normal zstyle
:zle:transpose-words:filename word-chars</p>

<p>This provides two different ways of using
transpose-words depending on whether the cursor is on
whitespace between words or on a filename, here any word
containing a /. On whitespace, complete arguments as defined
by standard shell rules will be transposed. In a filename,
only alphanumerics will be trans- posed. Elsewhere, words
will be transposed using the default style for
:zle:transpose-words.</p>

<p>The word matching and all the handling of zstyle
settings is actually implemented by the function
match-words-by-style. This can be used to create new
user-defined widgets. The calling function should set the
local parameter curcontext to :zle:wid- get, create the
local parameter matched_words and call match-words-by-style
with no arguments. On return, matched_words will be set to
an array with the elements: (1) the start of the line (2)
the word before the cursor (3) any non-word characters
between that word and the cursor (4) any non-word character
at the cursor position plus any remaining non-word
characters before the next word, including all charac- ters
specified by the skip-chars style, (5) the word at or fol-
lowing the cursor (6) any non-word characters following that
word (7) the remainder of the line. Any of the elements may
be an empty string; the calling function should test for
this to decide whether it can perform its function.</p>

<p>It is possible to pass options with arguments to
match-words-by-style to override the use of styles. The
options are: -w word-style -s skip-chars -c word-class -C
word-chars -r subword-range</p>

<p>For example, match-words-by-style -w shell -c 0 may be
used to extract the command argument around the cursor.</p>

<p>The word-context style is implemented by the function
match-word-context. This should not usually need to be
called directly.</p>

<p>delete-whole-word-match This is another function which
works like the -match functions described immediately above,
i.e. using styles to decide the word boundaries. However, it
is not a replacement for any existing function.</p>

<p>The basic behaviour is to delete the word around the
cursor. There is no numeric prefix handling; only the single
word around the cursor is considered. If the widget contains
the string kill, the removed text will be placed in the
cutbuffer for future yanking. This can be obtained by
defining kill-whole-word-match as follows:</p>

<p>zle -N kill-whole-word-match delete-whole-word-match</p>

<p>and then binding the widget kill-whole-word-match.</p>

<p>copy-earlier-word This widget works like a combination
of insert-last-word and copy-prev-shell-word. Repeated
invocations of the widget retrieve earlier words on the
relevant history line. With a numeric argument N, insert the
Nth word from the history line; N may be negative to count
from the end of the line.</p>

<p>If insert-last-word has been used to retrieve the last
word on a previous history line, repeated invocations will
replace that word with earlier words from the same line.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the widget applies to words on the line
currently being edited. The widget style can be set to the
name of another widget that should be called to retrieve
words. This widget must accept the same three arguments as
insert-last-word.</p>

<p>cycle-completion-positions After inserting an
unambiguous string into the command line, the new function
based completion system may know about multiple places in
this string where characters are missing or differ from at
least one of the possible matches. It will then place the
cursor on the position it considers to be the most interest-
ing one, i.e. the one where one can disambiguate between as
many matches as possible with as little typing as
possible.</p>

<p>This widget allows the cursor to be easily moved to the
other interesting spots. It can be invoked repeatedly to
cycle between all positions reported by the completion
system.</p>

<p>edit-command-line Edit the command line using your
visual editor, as in ksh.</p>

<p>bindkey -M vicmd v edit-command-line</p>

<p>history-search-end This function implements the widgets
history-begin- ning-search-backward-end and
history-beginning-search-for- ward-end. These commands work
by first calling the correspond- ing builtin widget (see
History Control in zshzle(1)) and then moving the cursor to
the end of the line. The original cursor position is
remembered and restored before calling the builtin widget a
second time, so that the same search is repeated to look
farther through the history.</p>

<p>Although you autoload only one function, the commands to
use it are slightly different because it implements two
widgets.</p>

<p>zle -N history-beginning-search-backward-end
history-search-end zle -N
history-beginning-search-forward-end history-search-end
bindkey e^P history-beginning-search-backward-end bindkey
e^N history-beginning-search-forward-end</p>

<p>history-beginning-search-menu This function implements
yet another form of history searching. The text before the
cursor is used to select lines from the his- tory, as for
history-beginning-search-backward except that all matches
are shown in a numbered menu. Typing the appropriate digits
inserts the full history line. Note that leading zeroes must
be typed (they are only shown when necessary for removing
ambiguity). The entire history is searched; there is no dis-
tinction between forwards and backwards.</p>

<p>With a prefix argument, the search is not anchored to
the start of the line; the string typed by the use may
appear anywhere in the line in the history.</p>

<p>If the widget name contains -end the cursor is moved to
the end of the line inserted. If the widget name contains
-space any space in the text typed is treated as a wildcard
and can match anything (hence a leading space is equivalent
to giving a prefix argument). Both forms can be combined,
for example:</p>

<p>zle -N history-beginning-search-menu-space-end
history-beginning-search-menu</p>

<p>history-pattern-search The function
history-pattern-search implements widgets which prompt for a
pattern with which to search the history backwards or
forwards. The pattern is in the usual zsh format, however
the first character may be ^ to anchor the search to the
start of the line, and the last character may be $ to anchor
the search to the end of the line. If the search was not
anchored to the end of the line the cursor is positioned
just after the pattern found.</p>

<p>The commands to create bindable widgets are similar to
those in the example immediately above:</p>

<p>autoload -U history-pattern-search zle -N
history-pattern-search-backward history-pattern-search zle
-N history-pattern-search-forward history-pattern-search</p>

<p>up-line-or-beginning-search,
down-line-or-beginning-search These widgets are similar to
the builtin functions up-line-or-search and
down-line-or-search: if in a multiline buffer they move up
or down within the buffer, otherwise they search for a
history line matching the start of the current line. In this
case, however, they search for a line which matches the
current line up to the current cursor position, in the
manner of history-beginning-search-backward and -forward,
rather than the first word on the line.</p>

<p>incarg Typing the keystrokes for this widget with the
cursor placed on or to the left of an integer causes that
integer to be incre- mented by one. With a numeric prefix
argument, the number is incremented by the amount of the
argument (decremented if the prefix argument is negative).
The shell parameter incarg may be set to change the default
increment to something other than one.</p>

<p>bindkey^X+incarg</p>

<p>incremental-complete-word This allows incremental
completion of a word. After starting this command, a list of
completion choices can be shown after every character you
type, which you can delete with ^H or DEL. Pressing return
accepts the completion so far and returns you to normal
editing (that is, the command line is not immediately
executed). You can hit TAB to do normal completion, ^G to
abort back to the state when you started, and ^D to list the
matches.</p>

<p>This works only with the new function based completion
system.</p>

<p>bindkey^Xiincremental-complete-word</p>

<p>insert-composed-char This function allows you to compose
characters that dont appear on the keyboard to be inserted
into the command line. The com- mand is followed by two keys
corresponding to ASCII characters (there is no prompt). For
accented characters, the two keys are a base character
followed by a code for the accent, while for other special
characters the two characters together form a mnemonic for
the character to be inserted. The two-character codes are a
subset of those given by RFC 1345 (see for example
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1345.html).</p>

<p>The function may optionally be followed by up to two
characters which replace one or both of the characters read
from the key- board; if both characters are supplied, no
input is read. For example, insert-composed-char a: can be
used within a widget to insert an a with umlaut into the
command line. This has the advantages over use of a literal
character that it is more portable.</p>

<p>For best results zsh should have been built with support
for multibyte characters (configured with
--enable-multibyte); however, the function works for the
limited range of characters available in single-byte
character sets such as ISO-8859-1.</p>

<p>The character is converted into the local representation
and inserted into the command line at the cursor position.
(The conversion is done within the shell, using whatever
facilities the C library provides.) With a numeric argument,
the character and its code are previewed in the status
line</p>

<p>The function may be run outside zle in which case it
prints the character (together with a newline) to standard
output. Input is still read from keystrokes.</p>

<p>See insert-unicode-char for an alternative way of
inserting Uni- code characters using their hexadecimal
character number.</p>

<p>The set of accented characters is reasonably complete up
to Uni- code character U+0180, the set of special characters
less so. However, it it is very sporadic from that point.
Adding new characters is easy, however; see the function
define-com- posed-chars. Please send any additions to
zsh-workers@zsh.org.</p>

<p>The codes for the second character when used to accent
the first are as follows. Note that not every character can
take every accent. ! Grave. Acute. &gt; Circumflex. ? Tilde.
(This is not ~ as RFC 1345 does not assume that character is
present on the keyboard.) - Macron. (A horizontal bar over
the base character.) ( Breve. (A shallow dish shape over the
base character.) . Dot above the base character, or in the
case of i no dot, or in the case of L and l a centered dot.
: Diaeresis (Umlaut). c Cedilla. _ Underline, however there
are currently no underlined characters. / Stroke through the
base character. &quot; Double acute (only supported on a few
letters). ; Ogonek. (A little forward facing hook at the
bottom right of the character.) &lt; Caron. (A little v over
the letter.) 0 Circle over the base character. 2 Hook over
the base character. 9 Horn over the base character.</p>

<p>The most common characters from the Arabic, Cyrillic,
Greek and Hebrew alphabets are available; consult RFC 1345
for the appro- priate sequences. In addition, a set of two
letter codes not in RFC 1345 are available for the
double-width characters corre- sponding to ASCII characters
from ! to ~ (0x21 to 0x7e) by pre- ceding the character with
^, for example ^A for a double-width A.</p>

<p>The following other two-character sequences are
understood.</p>

<p>ASCII characters These are already present on most
keyboards: &lt;( Left square bracket // Backslash (solidus)
)&gt; Right square bracket (! Left brace (curly bracket) !!
Vertical bar (pipe symbol) !) Right brace (curly bracket) ?
Tilde</p>

<p>Special letters Characters found in various variants of

<p>Currency symbols Ct Cent Pd Pound sterling (also lira
and others) Cu Currency Ye Yen Eu Euro (N.B. not in RFC

than their grammatical use. (For example, a
&quot;right&quot; low double quote is used to open quo-

<p>insert-files This function allows you type a file
pattern, and see the results of the expansion at each step.
When you hit return, all expansions are inserted into the
command line.</p>

<p>bindkey^Xfinsert-files</p>

<p>narrow-to-region [ -p pre ] [ -P post ] [ -S statepm |
-R statepm ] [ -n ] [ start end ])
narrow-to-region-invisible Narrow the editable portion of
the buffer to the region between the cursor and the mark,
which may be in either order. The region may not be
empty.</p>

<p>narrow-to-region may be used as a widget or called as a
function from a user-defined widget; by default, the text
outside the editable area remains visible. A recursive-edit
is performed and the original widening status is then
restored. Various options and arguments are available when
it is called as a func- tion.</p>

<p>The options -p pretext and -P posttext may be used to
replace the text before and after the display for the
duration of the function; either or both may be an empty
string.</p>

<p>If the option -n is also given, pretext or posttext will
only be inserted if there is text before or after the region
respec- tively which will be made invisible.</p>

<p>Two numeric arguments may be given which will be used
instead of the cursor and mark positions.</p>

<p>The option -S statepm is used to narrow according to the
other options while saving the original state in the
parameter with name statepm, while the option -R statepm is
used to restore the state from the parameter; note in both
cases the name of the parameter is required. In the second
case, other options and arguments are irrelevant. When this
method is used, no recur- sive-edit is performed; the
calling widget should call this function with the option -S,
perform its own editing on the com- mand line or pass
control to the user via zle recursive-edit, then call this
function with the option -R. The argument statepm must be a
suitable name for an ordinary parameter, except that
parameters beginning with the prefix _ntr_ are reserved for
use within narrow-to-region. Typically the parame- ter will
be local to the calling function.</p>

<p>narrow-to-region-invisible is a simple widget which
calls nar- row-to-region with arguments which replace any
text outside the region with ....</p>

<p>The display is restored (and the widget returns) upon
any zle command which would usually cause the line to be
accepted or aborted. Hence an additional such command is
required to accept or abort the current line.</p>

<p>The return status of both widgets is zero if the line
was accepted, else non-zero.</p>

<p>Here is a trivial example of a widget using this
feature. local state narrow-to-region -p Editing restricted
region -P-S state zle recursive-edit narrow-to-region -R
state</p>

<p>insert-unicode-char When first executed, the user inputs
a set of hexadecimal dig- its. This is terminated with
another call to insert-uni- code-char. The digits are then
turned into the corresponding Unicode character. For
example, if the widget is bound to ^XU, the character
sequence ^XU 4 c ^XU inserts L (Unicode U+004c).</p>

<p>See insert-composed-char for a way of inserting
characters using a two-character mnemonic.</p>

<p>predict-on This set of functions implements predictive
typing using history search. After predict-on, typing
characters causes the editor to look backward in the history
for the first line beginning with what you have typed so
far. After predict-off, editing returns to normal for the
line found. In fact, you often dont even need to use
predict-off, because if the line doesnt match something in
the history, adding a key performs standard comple- tion,
and then inserts itself if no completions were found.
However, editing in the middle of a line is liable to
confuse prediction; see the toggle style below.</p>

<p>With the function based completion system (which is
needed for this), you should be able to type TAB at almost
any point to advance the cursor to the next interesting
character posi- tion (usually the end of the current word,
but sometimes some- where in the middle of the word). And of
course as soon as the entire line is what you want, you can
accept with return, with- out needing to move the cursor to
the end first.</p>

<p>The first time predict-on is used, it creates several
additional widget functions:</p>

<p>delete-backward-and-predict Replaces the
backward-delete-char widget. You do not need to bind this
yourself. insert-and-predict Implements predictive typing by
replacing the self-insert widget. You do not need to bind
this yourself. predict-off Turns off predictive typing.</p>

<p>Although you autoload only the predict-on function, it
is neces- sary to create a keybinding for predict-off as
well.</p>

<p>zle -N predict-on zle -N predict-off
bindkey^X^Zpredict-on bindkey^Zpredict-off</p>

<p>read-from-minibuffer This is most useful when called as
a function from inside a wid- get, but will work correctly
as a widget in its own right. It prompts for a value below
the current command line; a value may be input using all of
the standard zle operations (and not merely the restricted
set available when executing, for example,
execute-named-cmd). The value is then returned to the
calling function in the parameter $REPLY and the editing
buffer restored to its previous state. If the read was
aborted by a keyboard break (typically ^G), the function
returns status 1 and $REPLY is not set.</p>

<p>If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken
as a prompt, otherwise ? is used. If two arguments are
supplied, they are the prompt and the initial value of
$LBUFFER, and if a third argument is given it is the initial
value of $RBUFFER. This provides a default value and
starting cursor placement. Upon return the entire buffer is
the value of $REPLY.</p>

<p>One option is available: -k num specifies that num
characters are to be read instead of a whole line. The line
editor is not invoked recursively in this case, so depending
on the terminal settings the input may not be visible, and
only the input keys are placed in $REPLY, not the entire
buffer. Note that unlike the read builtin num must be given;
there is no default.</p>

<p>The name is a slight misnomer, as in fact the shells own
minibuffer is not used. Hence it is still possible to call
exe- cuted-named-cmd and similar functions while reading a
value.</p>

<p>replace-string, replace-pattern replace-string-again,
replace-pattern-again The function replace-string implements
three widgets. If defined under the same name as the
function, it prompts for two strings; the first (source)
string will be replaced by the sec- ond everywhere it occurs
in the line editing buffer.</p>

<p>If the widget name contains the word pattern, for
example by defining the widget using the command zle -N
replace-pattern replace-string , then the matching is
performed using zsh pat- terns. All zsh extended globbing
patterns can be used in the source string; note that unlike
filename generation the pattern does not need to match an
entire word, nor do glob qualifiers have any effect. In
addition, the replacement string can con- tain parameter or
command substitutions. Furthermore, a &amp; in the
replacement string will be replaced with the matched source
string, and a backquoted digitN will be replaced by the Nth
parenthesised expression matched. The for{N} may be used to
protect the digit from following digits.</p>

<p>If the widget instead contains the word regex (or
regexp), then the matching is performed using regular
expressions, respecting the setting of the option
RE_MATCH_PCRE (see the description of the function
regexp-replace below). The special replacement facilities
described above for pattern matching are available.</p>

<p>By default the previous source or replacement string
will not be offered for editing. However, this feature can
be activated by setting the style edit-previous in the
context :zle:widget (for example, :zle:replace-string) to
true. In addition, a positive numeric argument forces the
previous values to be offered, a negative or zero argument
forces them not to be.</p>

<p>The function replace-string-again can be used to repeat
the pre- vious replacement; no prompting is done. As with
replace-string, if the name of the widget contains the word
pattern or regex, pattern or regular expression matching is
performed, else a literal string replacement. Note that the
previous source and replacement text are the same whether
pat- tern, regular expression or string matching is
used.</p>

<p>For example, starting from the line:</p>

<p>print This line contains fan and fond</p>

<p>and invoking replace-pattern with the source string
f(?)n and the replacement string 1r produces the not very
useful line:</p>

<p>print This line contains car and cord</p>

<p>The range of the replacement string can be limited by
using the narrow-to-region-invisible widget. One limitation
of the cur- rent version is that undo will cycle through
changes to the replacement and source strings before undoing
the replacement itself.</p>

<p>smart-insert-last-word This function may replace the
insert-last-word widget, like so:</p>

<p>zle -N insert-last-word smart-insert-last-word</p>

<p>With a numeric prefix, or when passed command line
arguments in a call from another widget, it behaves like
insert-last-word, except that words in comments are ignored
when INTERACTIVE_COM- MENTS is set.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the rightmost interesting word from the
previous command is found and inserted. The default
definition of interesting is that the word contains at least
one alpha- betic character, slash, or backslash. This
definition may be overridden by use of the match style. The
context used to look up the style is the widget name, so
usually the context is :insert-last-word. However, you can
bind this function to dif- ferent widgets to use different
patterns:</p>

<p>zle -N insert-last-assignment smart-insert-last-word
zstyle :insert-last-assignment match
[[:alpha:]][][[:alnum:]]#=*
bindkee=insert-last-assignment</p>

<p>If no interesting word is found and the auto-previous
style is set to a true value, the search continues upward
through the history. When auto-previous is unset or false
(the default), the widget must be invoked repeatedly in
order to search earlier history lines.</p>

<p>transpose-lines Only useful with a multi-line editing
buffer; the lines here are lines within the current
on-screen buffer, not history lines. The effect is similar
to the function of the same name in Emacs.</p>

<p>Transpose the current line with the previous line and
move the cursor to the start of the next line. Repeating
this (which can be done by providing a positive numeric
prefix argument) has the effect of moving the line above the
cursor down by a number of lines.</p>

<p>With a negative numeric prefix argument, requires two
lines above the cursor. These two lines are transposed and
the cursor moved to the start of the previous line. Using a
numeric prefix less than -1 has the effect of moving the
line above the cursor up by minus that number of lines.</p>

<p>which-command This function is a drop-in replacement for
the builtin widget which-command. It has enhanced behaviour,
in that it correctly detects whether or not the command word
needs to be expanded as an alias; if so, it continues
tracing the command word from the expanded alias until it
reaches the command that will be exe- cuted.</p>

<p>The style whence is available in the context
:zle:$WIDGET; this may be set to an array to give the
command and options that will be used to investigate the
command word found. The default is whence -c.</p>

<p>Utility Functions These functions are useful in
constructing widgets. They should be loaded with autoload -U
function and called as indicated from user-defined
widgets.</p>

<p>split-shell-arguments This function splits the line
currently being edited into shell arguments and whitespace.
The result is stored in the array reply. The array contains
all the parts of the line in order, starting with any
whitespace before the first argument, and fin- ishing with
any whitespace after the last argument. Hence (so long as
the option KSH_ARRAYS is not set) whitespace is given by odd
indices in the array and arguments by even indices. Note
that no stripping of quotes is done; joining together all
the elements of reply in order is guaranteed to produce the
original line.</p>

<p>The parameter REPLY is set to the index of the word in
reply which contains the character after the cursor, where
the first element has index 1. The parameter REPLY2 is set
to the index of the character under the cursor in that word,
where the first character has index 1.</p>

<p>Hence reply, REPLY and REPLY2 should all be made local
to the enclosing function.</p>

<p>See the function modify-current-argument, described
below, for an example of how to call this function.</p>

<p>modify-current-argument expr-using-$ARG This function
provides a simple method of allowing user-defined widgets to
modify the command line argument under the cursor (or
immediately to the left of the cursor if the cursor is
between arguments). The argument should be an expression
which when evaluated operates on the shell parameter ARG,
which will have been set to the command line argument under
the cursor. The expression should be suitably quoted to
prevent it being evalu- ated too early.</p>

<p>For example, a user-defined widget containing the
following code converts the characters in the argument under
the cursor into all upper case:</p>

<p>modify-current-argument${(U)ARG}</p>

<p>The following strips any quoting from the current word
(whether backslashes or one of the styles of quotes), and
replaces it with single quoting throughout:</p>

<p>modify-current-argument${(qq)${(Q)ARG}}</p>

<p>Styles The behavior of several of the above widgets can
be controlled by the use of the zstyle mechanism. In
particular, widgets that interact with the completion system
pass along their context to any completions that they
invoke.</p>

<p>break-keys This style is used by the
incremental-complete-word widget. Its value should be a
pattern, and all keys matching this pattern will cause the
widget to stop incremental completion without the key having
any further effect. Like all styles used directly by
incremental-complete-word, this style is looked up using the
context :incremental.</p>

<p>completer The incremental-complete-word and
insert-and-predict widgets set up their top-level context
name before calling completion. This allows one to define
different sets of completer functions for normal completion
and for these widgets. For example, to use completion,
approximation and correction for normal completion,
completion and correction for incremental completion and
only completion for prediction one could use:</p>

<p>zstyle :completion:* completer _complete _correct
_approximate zstyle :completion:incremental:* completer
_complete _correct zstyle :completion:predict:* completer
_complete</p>

<p>It is a good idea to restrict the completers used in
prediction, because they may be automatically invoked as you
type. The _list and _menu completers should never be used
with prediction. The _approximate, _correct, _expand, and
_match completers may be used, but be aware that they may
change characters anywhere in the word behind the cursor, so
you need to watch carefully that the result is what you
intended.</p>

<p>cursor The insert-and-predict widget uses this style, in
the context :predict, to decide where to place the cursor
after completion has been tried. Values are:</p>

<p>complete The cursor is left where it was when completion
finished, but only if it is after a character equal to the
one just inserted by the user. If it is after another
character, this value is the same as key.</p>

<p>key The cursor is left after the nth occurrence of the
char- acter just inserted, where n is the number of times
that character appeared in the word before completion was
attempted. In short, this has the effect of leaving the
cursor after the character just typed even if the comple-
tion code found out that no other characters need to be
inserted at that position.</p>

<p>Any other value for this style unconditionally leaves
the cursor at the position where the completion code left
it.</p>

<p>list When using the incremental-complete-word widget,
this style says if the matches should be listed on every key
press (if they fit on the screen). Use the context prefix
:completion:incremen- tal.</p>

<p>The insert-and-predict widget uses this style to decide
if the completion should be shown even if there is only one
possible completion. This is done if the value of this style
is the string always. In this case the context is :predict
(not :completion:predict).</p>

<p>match This style is used by smart-insert-last-word to
provide a pat- tern (using full EXTENDED_GLOB syntax) that
matches an interest- ing word. The context is the name of
the widget to which smart-insert-last-word is bound (see
above). The default behav- ior of smart-insert-last-word is
equivalent to:</p>

<p>zstyle :insert-last-word match*[[:alpha:]]*</p>

<p>However, you might want to include words that contain
spaces:</p>

<p>zstyle :insert-last-word match
*[[:alpha:][:space:]]*</p>

<p>Or include numbers as long as the word is at least two
charac- ters long:</p>

<p>zstyle :insert-last-word match
*([[:digit:]]?|[[:alpha:]])*</p>

<p>The above example causes redirections like
&quot;2&gt;&quot; to be included.</p>

<p>prompt The incremental-complete-word widget shows the
value of this style in the status line during incremental
completion. The string value may contain any of the
following substrings in the manner of the PS1 and other
prompt parameters:</p>

<p>%c Replaced by the name of the completer function that
gen- erated the matches (without the leading
underscore).</p>

<p>%l When the list style is set, replaced by ... if the
list of matches is too long to fit on the screen and with an
empty string otherwise. If the list style is false or not
set, %l is always removed.</p>

<p>%n Replaced by the number of matches generated.</p>

<p>%s Replaced by -no match-, -no prefix-, or an empty
string if there is no completion matching the word on the
line, if the matches have no common prefix different from
the word on the line, or if there is such a common pre- fix,
respectively.</p>

<p>%u Replaced by the unambiguous part of all matches, if
there is any, and if it is different from the word on the
line.</p>

<p>Like break-keys , this uses the :incremental
context.</p>

<p>stop-keys This style is used by the
incremental-complete-word widget. Its value is treated
similarly to the one for the break-keys style (and uses the
same context: :incremental ). However, in this case all keys
matching the pattern given as its value will stop
incremental completion and will then execute their usual
func- tion.</p>

<p>toggle This boolean style is used by predict-on and its
related widgets in the context :predict. If set to one of
the standard true values, predictive typing is automatically
toggled off in situa- tions where it is unlikely to be
useful, such as when editing a multi-line buffer or after
moving into the middle of a line and then deleting a
character. The default is to leave prediction turned on
until an explicit call to predict-off.</p>

<p>verbose This boolean style is used by predict-on and its
related widgets in the context :predict. If set to one of
the standard true values, these widgets display a message
below the prompt when the predictive state is toggled. This
is most useful in combi- nation with the toggle style. The
default does not display these messages.</p>

<p>widget This style is similar to the command style: For
widget functions that use zle to call other widgets, this
style can sometimes be used to override the widget which is
called. The context for this style is the name of the
calling widget (not the name of the calling function,
because one function may be bound to mul- tiple widget
names).</p>

<p>zstyle :copy-earlier-word widget
smart-insert-last-word</p>

<p>Check the documentation for the calling widget or
function to determine whether the widget style is used.</p>

<p>EXCEPTION HANDLING Two functions are provided to enable
zsh to provide exception handling in a form that should be
familiar from other languages.</p>

<p>throw exception The function throw throws the named
exception. The name is an arbitrary string and is only used
by the throw and catch func- tions. An exception is for the
most part treated the same as a shell error, i.e. an
unhandled exception will cause the shell to abort all
processing in a function or script and to return to the top
level in an interactive shell.</p>

<p>catch exception-pattern The function catch returns
status zero if an exception was thrown and the pattern
exception-pattern matches its name. Oth- erwise it returns
status 1. exception-pattern is a standard shell pattern,
respecting the current setting of the EXTENDED_GLOB option.
An alias catch is also defined to prevent the argument to
the function from matching filenames, so pat- terns may be
used unquoted. Note that as exceptions are not fundamentally
different from other shell errors it is possible to catch
shell errors by using an empty string as the exception name.
The shell variable CAUGHT is set by catch to the name of the
exception caught. It is possible to rethrow an exception by
calling the throw function again once an exception has been
caught.</p>

<p>The functions are designed to be used together with the
always con- struct described in zshmisc(1). This is
important as only this con- struct provides the required
support for exceptions. A typical example is as follows.</p>

<p>{ # &quot;try&quot; block # ... nested code here calls
&quot;throw MyExcept&quot; } always { # &quot;always&quot;
block if catch MyExcept; then print &quot;Caught exception
MyExcept&quot; elif catc; then print &quot;Caught a shell
error. Propagating...&quot; throw fi # Other exceptions are
not handled but may be caught further # up the call stack.
}</p>

<p>If all exceptions should be caught, the following idiom
might be preferable.</p>

<p>{ # ... nested code here throws an exception } always {
if catch *; then case $CAUGHT in (MyExcept) print
&quot;Caught my own exception&quot; ;; (*) print
&quot;Caught some other exception&quot; ;; esac fi }</p>

<p>In common with exception handling in other languages,
the exception may be thrown by code deeply nested inside the
try block. However, note that it must be thrown inside the
current shell, not in a subshell forked for a pipeline,
parenthesised current-shell construct, or some form of
command or process substitution.</p>

<p>The system internally uses the shell variable EXCEPTION
to record the name of the exception between throwing and
catching. One drawback of this scheme is that if the
exception is not handled the variable EXCEP- TION remains
set and may be incorrectly recognised as the name of an
exception if a shell error subsequently occurs. Adding unset
EXCEPTION at the start of the outermost layer of any code
that uses exception handling will eliminate this
problem.</p>

<p>MIME FUNCTIONS Three functions are available to provide
handling of files recognised by extension, for example to
dispatch a file text.ps when executed as a command to an
appropriate viewer.</p>

<p>zsh-mime-setup [ -fv ] [ -l [ suffix ... ] ]
zsh-mime-handler [-l] command arguments ... These two
functions use the files ~/.mime.types and /etc/mime.types,
which associate types and extensions, as well as ~/.mailcap
and /etc/mailcap files, which associate types and the
programs that handle them. These are provided on many sys-
tems with the Multimedia Internet Mail Extensions.</p>

<p>To enable the system, the function zsh-mime-setup should
be autoloaded and run. This allows files with extensions to
be treated as executable; such files be completed by the
function completion system. The function zsh-mime-handler
should not need to be called by the user.</p>

<p>The system works by setting up suffix aliases with alias
-s. Suffix aliases already installed by the user will not be
over- written.</p>

<p>For suffixes defined in lower case, upper case variants
will also automatically be handled (e.g. PDF is
automatically handled if handling for the suffix pdf is
defined), but not vice versa.</p>

<p>Repeated calls to zsh-mime-setup do not override the
existing mapping between suffixes and executable files
unless the option -f is given. Note, however, that this does
not override exist- ing suffix aliases assigned to handlers
other than zsh-mime-han- dler.</p>

<p>Calling zsh-mime-setup with the option -l lists the
existing mappings without altering them. Suffixes to list
(which may contain pattern characters that should be quoted
from immediate interpretation on the command line) may be
given as additional arguments, otherwise all suffixes are
listed.</p>

<p>Calling zsh-mime-setup with the option -v causes verbose
output to be shown during the setup operation.</p>

<p>The system respects the mailcap flags needsterminal and
copi- ousoutput, see mailcap(4).</p>

<p>The functions use the following styles, which are
defined with the zstyle builtin command (see zshmodules(1)).
They should be defined before zsh-mime-setup is run. The
contexts used all start with :mime:, with additional
components in some cases. It is recommended that a trailing
* (suitably quoted) be appended to style patterns in case
the system is extended in future. Some examples are given
below. current-shell If this boolean style is true, the
mailcap handler for the context in question is run using the
eval builtin instead of by starting a new sh process. This
is more efficient, but may not work in the occasional cases
where the mailcap handler uses strict POSIX syntax.</p>

<p>execute-as-is This style gives a list of patterns to be
matched against files passed for execution with a handler
program. If the file matches the pattern, the entire command
line is executed in its current form, with no handler. This
is useful for files which might have suffixes but nonethe-
less be executable in their own right. If the style is not
set, the pattern *(*) *(/) is used; hence executable files
are executed directly and not passed to a handler, and the
option AUTO_CD may be used to change to directo- ries that
happen to have MIME suffixes.</p>

<p>file-path Used if the style find-file-in-path is true
for the same context. Set to an array of directories that
are used for searching for the file to be handled; the
default is the command path given by the special parameter
path. The shell option PATH_DIRS is respected; if that is
set, the appropriate path will be searched even if the name
of the file to be handled as it appears on the command line
contains a / . The full context is :mime:.suffix:, as
described for the style handler.</p>

<p>find-file-in-path If set, allows files whose names do
not contain absolute paths to be searched for in the command
path or the path specified by the file-path style. If the
file is not found in the path, it is looked for locally
(whether or not the current directory is in the path); if it
is not found locally, the handler will abort unless the han-
dle-nonexistent style is set. Files found in the path are
tested as described for the style execute-as-is. The full
context is :mime:.suffix:, as described for the style
handler.</p>

<p>flags Defines flags to go with a handler; the context is
as for the handler style, and the format is as for the flags
in mailcap.</p>

<p>handle-nonexistent By default, arguments that dont
correspond to files are not passed to the MIME handler in
order to prevent it from intercepting commands found in the
path that happen to have suffixes. This style may be set to
an array of extended glob patterns for arguments that will
be passed to the handler even if they don t exist. If it is
not explicitly set it defaults to [[:alpha:]]#:/* which
allows URLs to be passed to the MIME handler even though
they don t exist in that format in the file system. The full
context is :mime:.suffix:, as described for the style
handler.</p>

<p>handler Specifies a handler for a suffix; the suffix is
given by the context as :mime:.suffix:, and the format of
the han- dler is exactly that in mailcap. Note in particular
the . and trailing colon to distinguish this use of the
context. This overrides any handler specified by the mailcap
files. If the handler requires a terminal, the flags style
should be set to include the word needstermi- nal, or if the
output is to be displayed through a pager (but not if the
handler is itself a pager), it should include
copiousoutput.</p>

<p>mailcap A list of files in the format of ~/.mailcap and
/etc/mailcap to be read during setup, replacing the default
list which consists of those two files. The con- text is
:mime:. A + in the list will be replaced by the default
files.</p>

<p>mailcap-priorities This style is used to resolve
multiple mailcap entries for the same MIME type. It consists
of an array of the following elements, in descending order
of priority; later entries will be used if earlier entries
are unable to resolve the entries being compared. If none of
the tests resolve the entries, the first entry encountered
is retained.</p>

<p>files The order of files (entries in the mailcap style)
read. Earlier files are preferred. (Note this does not
resolve entries in the same file.)</p>

<p>priority The priority flag from the mailcap entry. The
priority is an integer from 0 to 9 with the default value
being 5.</p>

<p>flags The test given by the mailcap-prio-flags option is
used to resolve entries.</p>

<p>place Later entries are preferred; as the entries are
strictly ordered, this test always succeeds.</p>

<p>Note that as this style is handled during
initialisation, the context is always :mime:, with no
discrimination by suffix.</p>

<p>mailcap-prio-flags This style is used when the keyword
flags is encountered in the list of tests specified by the
mailcap-priorities style. It should be set to a list of
patterns, each of which is tested against the flags
specified in the mail- cap entry (in other words, the sets
of assignments found with some entries in the mailcap file).
Earlier patterns in the list are preferred to later ones,
and matched pat- terns are preferred to unmatched ones.</p>

<p>mime-types A list of files in the format of
~/.mime.types and /etc/mime.types to be read during setup,
replacing the default list which consists of those two
files. The con- text is :mime:. A + in the list will be
replaced by the default files.</p>

<p>never-background If this boolean style is set, the
handler for the given context is always run in the
foreground, even if the flags provided in the mailcap entry
suggest it need not be (for example, it doesn t require a
terminal).</p>

<p>pager If set, will be used instead of $PAGER or more to
handle suffixes where the copiousoutput flag is set. The
con- text is as for handler, i.e. :mime:.suffix: for
handling a file with the given suffix.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>zstyle :mime:* mailcap ~/.mailcap /usr/local/etc/mailcap
zstyle:mime:.txt:handler less %s zstyle:mime:.txt:flags
needsterminal</p>

<p>When zsh-mime-setup is subsequently run, it will look
for mail- cap entries in the two files given. Files of
suffix .txt will be handled by running less file.txt. The
flag needsterminal is set to show that this program must run
attached to a termi- nal.</p>

<p>As there are several steps to dispatching a command, the
follow- ing should be checked if attempting to execute a
file by exten- sion .ext does not have the expected
effect.</p>

<p>The command alias -s ext should show
ps=zsh-mime-handler. If it shows something else, another
suffix alias was already installed and was not overwritten.
If it shows nothing, no han- dler was installed: this is
most likely because no handler was found in the .mime.types
and mailcap combination for .ext files. In that case,
appropriate handling should be added to ~/.mime.types and
mailcap.</p>

<p>If the extension is handled by zsh-mime-handler but the
file is not opened correctly, either the handler defined for
the type is incorrect, or the flags associated with it are
in appropriate. Running zsh-mime-setup -l will show the
handler and, if there are any, the flags. A %s in the
handler is replaced by the file (suitably quoted if
necessary). Check that the handler program listed lists and
can be run in the way shown. Also check that the flags
needsterminal or copiousoutput are set if the handler needs
to be run under a terminal; the second flag is used if the
output should be sent to a pager. An example of a suitable
mailcap entry for such a program is:</p>

<p>text/html; /usr/bin/lynx%; needsterminal</p>

<p>Running zsh-mime-handler -l command line prints the
command line that would be executed, simplified to remove
the effect of any flags, and quoted so that the output can
be run as a com- plete zsh command line. This is used by the
completion system to decide how to complete after a file
handled by zsh-mime-setup.</p>

<p>pick-web-browser This function is separate from the two
MIME functions described above and can be assigned directly
to a suffix:</p>

<p>autoload -U pick-web-browser alias -s
html=pick-web-browser</p>

<p>It is provided as an intelligent front end to dispatch a
web browser. It may be run as either a function or a shell
script. The status 255 is returned if no browser could be
started.</p>

<p>Various styles are available to customize the choice of
browsers:</p>

<p>browser-style The value of the style is an array giving
preferences in decreasing order for the type of browser to
use. The values of elements may be</p>

<p>running Use a GUI browser that is already running when
an X Window display is available. The browsers listed in the
x-browsers style are tried in order until one is found; if
it is, the file will be displayed in that browser, so the
user may need to check whether it has appeared. If no
running browser is found, one is not started. Browsers other
than Firefox, Opera and Konqueror are assumed to understand
the Mozilla syntax for opening a URL remotely.</p>

<p>x Start a new GUI browser when an X Window display is
available. Search for the availability of one of the
browsers listed in the x-browsers style and start the first
one that is found. No check is made for an already running
browser.</p>

<p>tty Start a terminal-based browser. Search for the
availability of one of the browsers listed in the
tty-browsers style and start the first one that is
found.</p>

<p>If the style is not set the default running x tty is
used.</p>

<p>x-browsers An array in decreasing order of preference of
browsers to use when running under the X Window System. The
array consists of the command name under which to start the
browser. They are looked up in the context :mime: (which may
be extended in future, so appending * is recom- mended). For
example,</p>

<p>zstyle :mime:* x-browsers opera konqueror firefox</p>

<p>specifies that pick-web-browser should first look for a
running instance of Opera, Konqueror or Firefox, in that
order, and if it fails to find any should attempt to start
Opera. The default is firefox mozilla netscape opera
konqueror.</p>

<p>tty-browsers An array similar to x-browsers, except that
it gives browsers to use use when no X Window display is
avail- able. The default is elinks links lynx.</p>

<p>command If it is set this style is used to pick the
command used to open a page for a browser. The context is
:mime:browser:new:$browser: to start a new browser or
:mime:browser:running:$browser: to open a URL in a browser
already running on the current X display, where $browser is
the value matched in the x-browsers or tty-browsers style.
The escape sequence %b in the style s value will be replaced
by the browser, while %u will be replaced by the URL. If the
style is not set, the default for all new instances is
equivalent to %b %u and the defaults for using running
browsers are equiva- lent to the values kfmclient openURL %u
for Konqueror, firefox -new-tab %u for Firefox, opera
-newpage %u for Opera, and %b -remote
&quot;openUrl(%u)&quot; for all others.</p>

<p>MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS zcalc [ expression ... ] A
reasonably powerful calculator based on zshs arithmetic
eval- uation facility. The syntax is similar to that of
formulae in most programming languages; see the section
Arithmetic Evalua- tion in zshmisc(1) for details. The
mathematical library zsh/mathfunc will be loaded if it is
available; see the section The zsh/mathfunc Module in
zshmodules(1). The mathematical functions correspond to the
raw system libraries, so trigonomet- ric functions are
evaluated using radians, and so on.</p>

<p>Each line typed is evaluated as an expression. The
prompt shows a number, which corresponds to a positional
parameter where the result of that calculation is stored.
For example, the result of the calculation on the line
preceded by 4&gt; is available as $4. The last value
calculated is available as ans. Full com- mand line editing,
including the history of previous calcula- tions, is
available; the history is saved in the file
~/.zcalc_history. To exit, enter a blank line or type :q on
its own ( q is allowed for historical compatibility).</p>

<p>If arguments are given to zcalc on start up, they are
used to prime the first few positional parameters. A visual
indication of this is given when the calculator starts.</p>

<p>The constants PI (3.14159...) and E (2.71828...) are
provided. Parameter assignment is possible, but note that
all parameters will be put into the global namespace.</p>

<p>The output base can be initialised by passing the option
-#base , for example zcalc -#16 (the # may have to be
quoted, depending on the globbing options set).</p>

<p>The prompt is configurable via the parameter
ZCALCPROMPT, which undergoes standard prompt expansion. The
index of the current entry is stored locally in the first
element of the array psvar, which can be referred to in
ZCALCPROMPT as %1v. The default prompt is %1v&gt; .</p>

<p>A few special commands are available; these are
introduced by a colon. For backward compatibility, the colon
may be omitted for certain commands. Completion is available
if compinit has been run.</p>

<p>The output precision may be specified within zcalc by
special commands familiar from many calculators. :norm The
default output format. It corresponds to the printf %g
specification. Typically this shows six decimal dig-
its.</p>

<p>:sci digits Scientific notation, corresponding to the
printf %g out- put format with the precision given by
digits. This pro- duces either fixed point or exponential
notation depend- ing on the value output.</p>

<p>:fix digits Fixed point notation, corresponding to the
printf %f out- put format with the precision given by
digits.</p>

<p>:eng digits Exponential notation, corresponding to the
printf %E out- put format with the precision given by
digits.</p>

<p>:raw Raw output: this is the default form of the output
from a math evaluation. This may show more precision than
the number actually possesses.</p>

<p>Other special commands: :!line... Execute line... as a
normal shell command line. Note that it is executed in the
context of the function, i.e. with local variables. Space is
optional after :!.</p>

<p>:local arg ... Declare variables local to the function.
Note that cer- tain variables are used by the function for
its own pur- poses. Other variables may be used, too, but
they will be taken from or put into the global scope.</p>

<p>:function name [ body ] Define a mathematical function
or (with no body) delete it. The function is defined using
zmathfuncdef, see below.</p>

<p>Note that zcalc takes care of all quoting. Hence for
example:</p>

<p>function cube $1 * $1 * $1</p>

<p>defines a function to cube the sole argument.</p>

<p>[#base] This is not a special command, rather part of
normal arithmetic syntax; however, when this form appears on
a line by itself the default output radix is set to base.
Use, for example, [#16] to display hexadecimal output
preceded by an indication of the base, or [##16] just to
display the raw number in the given base. Bases them- selves
are always specified in decimal. [#] restores the normal
output format. Note that setting an output base suppresses
floating point output; use [#] to return to normal
operation.</p>

<p>See the comments in the function for a few extra
tips.</p>

<p>zmathfuncdef [ mathfunc [ body ] ] A convenient front
end to functions -M.</p>

<p>With two arguments, define a mathematical function named
math- func which can be used in any form of arithmetic
evaluation. body is a mathematical expression to implement
the function. It may contain references to position
parameters $1, $2, ... to refer to mandatory parameters and
${1:-defvalue} ... to refer to optional parameters. Note
that the forms must be strictly adhered to for the function
to calculate the correct number of arguments. The
implementation is held in a shell function named
zsh_math_func_mathfunc; usually the user will not need to
refer to the shell function directly. Any existing function
of the same name is silently replaced.</p>

<p>With one argument, remove the mathematical function
mathfunc as well as the shell function implementation.</p>

<p>With no arguments, list all mathfunc functions in a form
suit- able for restoring the definition. The functions have
not nec- essarily been defined by zmathfuncdef.</p>

<p>USER CONFIGURATION FUNCTIONS The zsh/newuser module
comes with a function to aid in configuring shell options
for new users. If the module is installed, this function can
also be run by hand. It is available even if the modules
default behaviour, namely running the function for a new
user logging in with- out startup files, is inhibited.</p>

<p>zsh-newuser-install [ -f ] The function presents the
user with various options for cus- tomizing their
initialization scripts. Currently only ~/.zshrc is handled.
$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc is used instead if the parameter ZDOTDIR is
set; this provides a way for the user to configure a file
without altering an existing .zshrc.</p>

<p>By default the function exits immediately if it finds
any of the files .zshenv, .zprofile, .zshrc, or .zlogin in
the appropriate directory. The option -f is required in
order to force the function to continue. Note this may
happen even if .zshrc itself does not exist.</p>

<p>As currently configured, the function will exit
immediately if the user has root privileges; this behaviour
cannot be overrid- den.</p>

<p>Once activated, the function s behaviour is supposed to
be self-explanatory. Menus are present allowing the user to
alter the value of options and parameters. Suggestions for
improve- ments are always welcome.</p>

<p>When the script exits, the user is given the opportunity
to save the new file or not; changes are not irreversible
until this point. However, the script is careful to restrict
changes to the file only to a group marked by the lines #
Lines configured by zsh-newuser-install and # End of lines
configured by zsh-newuser-install . In addition, the old
version of .zshrc is saved to a file with the suffix .zni
appended.</p>

<p>If the function edits an existing .zshrc, it is up to
the user to ensure that the changes made will take effect.
For example, if control usually returns early from the
existing .zshrc the lines will not be executed; or a later
initialization file may override options or parameters, and
so on. The function itself does not attempt to detect any
such conflicts.</p>

<p>OTHER FUNCTIONS There are a large number of helpful
functions in the Functions/Misc directory of the zsh
distribution. Most are very simple and do not require
documentation here, but a few are worthy of special
mention.</p>

<p>Descriptions colors This function initializes several
associative arrays to map color names to (and from) the ANSI
standard eight-color terminal codes. These are used by the
prompt theme system (see above). You seldom should need to
run colors more than once.</p>

<p>The eight base colors are: black, red, green, yellow,
blue, magenta, cyan, and white. Each of these has codes for
fore- ground and background. In addition there are eight
intensity attributes: bold, faint, standout, underline,
blink, reverse, and conceal. Finally, there are six codes
used to negate attributes: none (reset all attributes to the
defaults), normal (neither bold nor faint), no-standout,
no-underline, no-blink, and no-reverse.</p>

<p>Some terminals do not support all combinations of colors
and intensities.</p>

<p>The associative arrays are:</p>

<p>color colour Map all the color names to their integer
codes, and inte- ger codes to the color names. The eight
base names map to the foreground color codes, as do names
prefixed with fg- , such as fg-red. Names prefixed with bg-,
such as bg-blue, refer to the background codes. The reverse
mapping from code to color yields base name for fore- ground
codes and the bg- form for backgrounds.</p>

<p>Although it is a misnomer to call them colors, these
arrays also map the other fourteen attributes from names to
codes and codes to names.</p>

<p>fg fg_bold fg_no_bold Map the eight basic color names to
ANSI terminal escape sequences that set the corresponding
foreground text properties. The fg sequences change the
color without changing the eight intensity attributes.</p>

<p>bg bg_bold bg_no_bold Map the eight basic color names to
ANSI terminal escape sequences that set the corresponding
background proper- ties. The bg sequences change the color
without changing the eight intensity attributes.</p>

<p>In addition, the scalar parameters reset_color and
bold_color are set to the ANSI terminal escapes that turn
off all attributes and turn on bold intensity,
respectively.</p>

<p>fned name Same as zed -f. This function does not appear
in the zsh dis- tribution, but can be created by linking zed
to the name fned in some directory in your fpath.</p>

<p>is-at-least needed [ present ] Perform a
greater-than-or-equal-to comparison of two strings having
the format of a zsh version number; that is, a string of
numbers and text with segments separated by dots or dashes.
If the present string is not provided, $ZSH_VERSION is used.
Seg- ments are paired left-to-right in the two strings with
leading non-number parts ignored. If one string has fewer
segments than the other, the missing segments are considered
zero.</p>

<p>This is useful in startup files to set options and other
state that are not available in all versions of zsh.</p>

<p>is-at-least 3.1.6-15 &amp;&amp; setopt NO_GLOBAL_RCS
is-at-least 3.1.0 &amp;&amp; setopt HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS
is-at-least 2.6-17 || print &quot;You can t use is-at-least
here.&quot;</p>

<p>nslookup [ arg ... ] This wrapper function for the
nslookup command requires the zsh/zpty module (see
zshmodules(1)). It behaves exactly like the standard
nslookup except that it provides customizable prompts
(including a right-side prompt) and completion of nslookup
commands, host names, etc. (if you use the func- tion-based
completion system). Completion styles may be set with the
context prefix :completion:nslookup.</p>

<p>See also the pager, prompt and rprompt styles below.</p>

<p>regexp-replace var regexp replace Use regular
expressions to perform a global search and replace operation
on a variable. If the option RE_MATCH_PCRE is not set, POSIX
extended regular expressions are used, else Perl-com-
patible regular expressions (this requires the shell to be
linked against the pcre library).</p>

<p>var is the name of the variable containing the string to
be matched. The variable will be modified directly by the
func- tion. The variables MATCH, MBEGIN, MEND, match,
mbegin, mend should be avoided as these are used by the
regular expression code.</p>

<p>regexp is the regular expression to match against the
string.</p>

<p>replace is the replacement text. This can contain
parameter, command and arithmetic expressions which will be
replaced: in particular, a reference to $MATCH will be
replaced by the text matched by the pattern.</p>

<p>The return status is 0 if at least one match was
performed, else 1.</p>

<p>run-help cmd This function is designed to be invoked by
the run-help ZLE wid- get, in place of the default alias.
See Accessing On-Line Help above for setup instructions.</p>

<p>In the discussion which follows, if cmd is a file system
path, it is first reduced to its rightmost component (the
file name).</p>

<p>Help is first sought by looking for a file named cmd in
the directory named by the HELPDIR parameter. If no file is
found, an assistant function, alias, or command named
run-help-cmd is sought. If found, the assistant is executed
with the rest of the current command line (everything after
the command name cmd) as its arguments. When neither file
nor assistant is found, the external command man cmd_is
run.</p>

<p>An example assistant for the &quot;ssh&quot;
command:</p>

<p>run-help-ssh() { emulate -LR zsh local -a args # Delete
the &quot;-l username&quot; option zparseopts -D -E -a args
l: # Delete other options, leaving: host command
args=(${@:#-*}) if [[ ${#args} -lt 2 ]]; then man ssh else
run-help $args[2] fi }</p>

<p>Several of these assistants are provided in the
Functions/Misc directory. These must be autoloaded, or
placed as executable scripts in your search path, in order
to be found and used by run-help.</p>

<p>run-help-git run-help-svk run-help-svn Assistant
functions for the git, svk, and svn commands.</p>

<p>tetris Zsh was once accused of not being as complete as
Emacs, because it lacked a Tetris game. This function was
written to refute this vicious slander.</p>

<p>This function must be used as a ZLE widget:</p>

<p>autoload -U tetris zle -N tetris bindkey keys tetris</p>

<p>To start a game, execute the widget by typing the keys.
What- ever command line you were editing disappears
temporarily, and your keymap is also temporarily replaced by
the Tetris control keys. The previous editor state is
restored when you quit the game (by pressing q) or when you
lose.</p>

<p>If you quit in the middle of a game, the next invocation
of the tetris widget will continue where you left off. If
you lost, it will start a new game.</p>

<p>zargs [ option ... -- ] [ input ... ] [ -- command [ arg
... ] ] This function works like GNU xargs, except that
instead of read- ing lines of arguments from the standard
input, it takes them from the command line. This is useful
because zsh, especially with recursive glob operators, often
can construct a command line for a shell function that is
longer than can be accepted by an external command.</p>

<p>The option list represents options of the zargs command
itself, which are the same as those of xargs. The input list
is the collection of strings (often file names) that become
the argu- ments of the command, analogous to the standard
input of xargs. Finally, the arg list consists of those
arguments (usually options) that are passed to the command
each time it runs. The arg list precedes the elements from
the input list in each run. If no command is provided, then
no arg list may be provided, and in that event the default
command is print with arguments -r --.</p>

<p>For example, to get a long ls listing of all plain files
in the current directory or its subdirectories:</p>

<p>autoload -U zargs zargs -- **/*(.) -- ls -l</p>

<p>Note that -- is used both to mark the end of the option
list and to mark the end of the input list, so it must
appear twice whenever the input list may be empty. If there
is guaranteed to be at least one input and the first input
does not begin with a -, then the first -- may be
omitted.</p>

<p>In the event that the string -- is or may be an input,
the -e option may be used to change the end-of-inputs
marker. Note that this does not change the end-of-options
marker. For exam- ple, to use .. as the marker:</p>

<p>zargs -e.. -- **/*(.) .. ls -l</p>

<p>This is a good choice in that example because no plain
file can be named .., but the best end-marker depends on the
circum- stances.</p>

<p>For details of the other zargs options, see xargs(1) or
run zargs with the --help option.</p>

<p>zed [ -f ] name zed -b This function uses the ZLE editor
to edit a file or function.</p>

<p>Only one name argument is allowed. If the -f option is
given, the name is taken to be that of a function; if the
function is marked for autoloading, zed searches for it in
the fpath and loads it. Note that functions edited this way
are installed into the current shell, but not written back
to the autoload file.</p>

<p>Without -f, name is the path name of the file to edit,
which need not exist; it is created on write, if
necessary.</p>

<p>While editing, the function sets the main keymap to zed
and the vi command keymap to zed-vicmd. These will be copied
from the existing main and vicmd keymaps if they do not
exist the first time zed is run. They can be used to provide
special key bind- ings used only in zed.</p>

<p>If it creates the keymap, zed rebinds the return key to
insert a line break and ^X^W to accept the edit in the zed
keymap, and binds ZZ to accept the edit in the zed-vicmd
keymap.</p>

<p>The bindings alone can be installed by running zed -b.
This is suitable for putting into a startup file. Note that,
if rerun, this will overwrite the existing zed and zed-vicmd
keymaps.</p>

<p>Completion is available, and styles may be set with the
context prefix :completion:zed.</p>

<p>A zle widget zed-set-file-name is available. This can be
called by name from within zed using ex zed-set-file-name
(note, however, that because of zeds rebindings you will
have to type ^j at the end instead of the return key), or
can be bound to a key in either of the zed or zed-vicmd
keymaps after zed -b has been run. When the widget is
called, it prompts for a new name for the file being edited.
When zed exits the file will be written under that name and
the original file will be left alone. The widget has no
effect with zed -f.</p>

<p>While zed-set-file-name is running, zed uses the keymap
zed-nor- mal-keymap, which is linked from the main keymap in
effect at the time zed initialised its bindings. (This is to
make the return key operate normally.) The result is that if
the main keymap has been changed, the widget wont notice.
This is not a concern for most users.</p>

<p>zcp [ -finqQvwW ] srcpat dest zln [ -finqQsvwW ] srcpat
dest Same as zmv -C and zmv -L, respectively. These
functions do not appear in the zsh distribution, but can be
created by linking zmv to the names zcp and zln in some
directory in your fpath.</p>

<p>zkbd See Keyboard Definition above.</p>

<p>zmv [ -finqQsvwW ] [ -C | -L | -M | -p program ] [ -o
optstring ] src- pat dest Move (usually, rename) files
matching the pattern srcpat to cor- responding files having
names of the form given by dest, where srcpat contains
parentheses surrounding patterns which will be replaced in
turn by $1, $2, ... in dest. For example,</p>

<p>zmv(*).li$1.txt</p>

<p>renames foo.lis to foo.txt , my.old.stuff.lis to
my.old.stuff.txt, and so on.</p>

<p>The pattern is always treated as an EXTENDED_GLOB
pattern. Any file whose name is not changed by the
substitution is simply ignored. Any error (a substitution
resulted in an empty string, two substitutions gave the same
result, the destination was an existing regular file and -f
was not given) causes the entire function to abort without
doing anything.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>-f Force overwriting of destination files. Not currently
passed down to the mv/cp/ln command due to vagaries of
implementations (but you can use -o-f to do that). -i
Interactive: show each line to be executed and ask the user
whether to execute it. Y or y will execute it, anything else
will skip it. Note that you just need to type one character.
-n No execution: print what would happen, but dont do it. -q
Turn bare glob qualifiers off: now assumed by default, so
this has no effect. -Q Force bare glob qualifiers on. Don t
turn this on unless you are actually using glob qualifiers
in a pattern. -s Symbolic, passed down to ln; only works
with -L. -v Verbose: print each command as its being
executed. -w Pick out wildcard parts of the pattern, as
described above, and implicitly add parentheses for
referring to them. -W Just like -w, with the addition of
turning wildcards in the replacement pattern into sequential
${1} .. ${N} ref- erences. -C -L -M Force cp, ln or mv,
respectively, regardless of the name of the function. -p
program Call program instead of cp, ln or mv. Whatever it
does, it should at least understand the form program -- old-
name newname where oldname and newname are filenames
generated by zmv. -o optstring The optstring is split into
words and passed down verba- tim to the cp, ln or mv command
called to perform the work. It should probably begin with a
-.</p>

<p>Further examples:</p>

<p>zmv -v(* *${1// /_}</p>

<p>For any file in the current directory with at least one
space in the name, replace every space by an underscore and
display the commands executed.</p>

<p>For more complete examples and other implementation
details, see the zmv source file, usually located in one of
the directories named in your fpath, or in
Functions/Misc/zmv in the zsh distri- bution.</p>

<p>zrecompile See Recompiling Functions above.</p>

<p>zstyle+ context style value [ + subcontext style value
... ] This makes defining styles a bit simpler by using a
single + as a special token that allows you to append a
context name to the previously used context name. Like
this:</p>

<p>zstyle+ :foo:bar style1 value1 + :baz style2 value2
+:frob style3 value3</p>

<p>This defines style1 with value1 for the context :foo:bar
as usual, but it also defines style2 with value2 for the
con- text :foo:bar:baz and style3 with value3 for
:foo:bar:frob. Any subcontext may be the empty string to
re-use the first con- text unchanged.</p>

<p>Styles insert-tab The zed function sets this style in
context :completion:zed:* to turn off completion when TAB is
typed at the beginning of a line. You may override this by
setting your own value for this context and style.</p>

<p>pager The nslookup function looks up this style in the
context :nslookup to determine the program used to display
output that does not fit on a single screen.</p>

<p>prompt rprompt The nslookup function looks up this style
in the context :nslookup to set the prompt and the
right-side prompt, respec- tively. The usual expansions for
the PS1 and RPS1 parameters may be used (see EXPANSION OF
PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1)).</p>
