<p>XkbAllocGeomKeys(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbAllocGeomKeys(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbAllocGeomKeys - Allocate space for an arbitrary
number of keys to a row</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Status XkbAllocGeomKeys (XkbRowPtr row, int
num_needed);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - row row to which keys should be
allocated</p>

<p>- num_needed number of new keys required</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkb provides a number of functions to
allocate and free subcomponents of a keyboard geometry. Use
these functions to create or modify key- board geometries.
Note that these functions merely allocate space for the new
element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values
explic- itly in your code. These allocation functions
increase sz_* but never touch num_* (unless there is an
allocation failure, in which case they reset both sz_* and
num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they
succeed, BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or
Bad- Value if a parameter is not as expected.</p>

<p>XkbAllocGeomKeys allocates num_needed keys and adds them
to the row. No initialization of the keys is done.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAlloc Unable to allocate storage</p>

<p>BadValue An argument is out of range</p>
