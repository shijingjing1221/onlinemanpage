<p>NAME stringprep_utf8_nfkc_normalize - API function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stringprep.h&gt;</p>

<p>char * stringprep_utf8_nfkc_normalize(const char * str,
ssize_t len);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS const char * str a UTF-8 encoded string.</p>

<p>ssize_t len length of str, in bytes, or -1 if str is
nul-terminated.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Converts a string into canonical form,
standardizing such issues as whether a character with an
accent is represented as a base character and combining
accent or as a single precomposed character.</p>

<p>The normalization mode is NFKC (ALL COMPOSE). It
standardizes differ- ences that do not affect the text
content, such as the above-mentioned accent representation.
It standardizes the &quot;compatibility&quot; characters in
Unicode, such as SUPERSCRIPT THREE to the standard forms (in
this case DIGIT THREE). Formatting information may be lost
but for most text operations such characters should be
considered the same. It returns a result with composed forms
rather than a maximally decomposed form.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE a newly allocated string, that is the NFKC
normalized form of str.</p>
