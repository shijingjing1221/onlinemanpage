<p>NAME cachemgr.cgi - squid HTTP proxy manager
interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS http://your.server/cgi-bin/cachemgr.cgi</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The cache manager (cachemgr.cgi) is a CGI
utility for displaying statistics about the Squid HTTP proxy
process as it runs. The cache manager is a convenient way to
manage the cache and view statistics without logging into
the server.</p>

<p>FILES ./cachemgr.conf /etc/etc/squid/cachemgr.conf The
access configuration file defining which Squid servers may
be managed via this cachemgr.cgi program. Each line
specifies a server:port followed by an optional
description</p>

<p>The server name may contain shell wildcard characters
such as *, [] etc. A quick selection dropdown menu is
automatically con- structed from the simple server
names.</p>

<p>Specifying :port is optional. If not specified then the
default proxy port is assumed. :* or :any matches any port
on the target server.</p>

<p>SECURITY cachemgr.cgi calls the requested server on the
requested port using HTTP and returns a formatted version of
the response. To avoid abuse it is recommended to configure
your web server to restrict access to the cachemgr.cgi
program.</p>

<p>Configuration examples for many common web servers can
be found in the Squid FAQ.</p>
