<p>NAME mt - control magnetic tape drive operation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mt [-h] [-f device] operation [count]
[arguments...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents the tape control
program mt. mt performs the given operation, which must be
one of the tape operations listed below, on a tape drive.
The commands can also be listed by running the program with
the -h option. The version of mt is printed with the -v or
--version option. The path of the tape device on which to
operate can be given with the -f or -t option. If neither of
those options is given, and the environment variable TAPE is
set, it is used. Other- wise, a default device defined in
the file /usr/include/sys/mtio.h is used.</p>

<p>Some operations optionally take an argument or repeat
count, which can be given after the operation name and
defaults to 1. The postfix k , M , or G can be used to give
counts in units of 1024, 1024 * 1024, or 1024 * 1024 * 1024,
respectively.</p>

<p>The available operations are listed below. Unique
abbreviations are accepted. Not all operations are available
on all systems, or work on all types of tape drives.</p>

<p>fsf Forward space count files. The tape is positioned on
the first block of the next file.</p>

<p>fsfm Forward space past count file marks, then backward
space one file record. This leaves the tape positioned on
the last block of the file that is count-1 files past the
current file.</p>

<p>bsf Backward space count files. The tape is positioned
on the last block of the previous file.</p>

<p>bsfm Backward space past count file marks, then forward
space one file record. This leaves the tape positioned on
the first block of the file that is count-1 files before the
current file.</p>

<p>asf The tape is positioned at the beginning of the count
file. Posi- tioning is done by first rewinding the tape and
then spacing forward over count filemarks.</p>

<p>fsr Forward space count records.</p>

<p>bsr Backward space count records.</p>

<p>fss (SCSI tapes) Forward space count setmarks.</p>

<p>bss (SCSI tapes) Backward space count setmarks.</p>

<p>eod, seod Space to end of valid data. Used on streamer
tape drives to append data to the logical end of tape.</p>

<p>rewind Rewind the tape.</p>

<p>offline, rewoffl, eject Rewind the tape and, if
applicable, unload the tape.</p>

<p>retension Rewind the tape, then wind it to the end of
the reel, then rewind it again.</p>

<p>weof, eof Write count EOF marks at current position.</p>

<p>wset (SCSI tapes) Write count setmarks at current
position (only SCSI tape).</p>

<p>erase Erase the tape.</p>

<p>status Print status information about the tape unit. (If
the density code is &quot;no translation&quot; in the status
output, this does not affect working of the tape drive.)</p>

<p>seek (SCSI tapes) Seek to the count block on the tape.
This opera- tion is available on some Tandberg and Wangtek
streamers and some SCSI-2 tape drives. The block address
should be obtained from a tell call earlier.</p>

<p>tell (SCSI tapes) Tell the current block on tape. This
operation is available on some Tandberg and Wangtek
streamers and some SCSI-2 tape drives.</p>

<p>setpartition (SCSI tapes) Switch to the partition
determined by count. The default data partition of the tape
is numbered zero. Switching partition is available only if
enabled for the device, the device supports multiple
partitions, and the tape is formatted with multiple
partitions.</p>

<p>partseek (SCSI tapes) The tape position is set to block
count in the par- tition given by the argument after count.
The default partition is zero.</p>

<p>mkpartition (SCSI tapes) Format the tape with one (count
is zero) or two partitions (count gives the size of the
second partition in megabytes). The tape drive must be able
to format partitioned tapes with initiator-specified
partition size and partition sup- port must be enabled for
the drive.</p>

<p>load (SCSI tapes) Send the load command to the tape
drive. The drives usually load the tape when a new cartridge
is inserted. The argument count can usually be omitted. Some
HP changers load tape n if the count 10000 + n is given (a
special funtion in the Linux st driver).</p>

<p>lock (SCSI tapes) Lock the tape drive door.</p>

<p>unlock (SCSI tapes) Unlock the tape drive door.</p>

<p>setblk (SCSI tapes) Set the block size of the drive to
count bytes per record.</p>

<p>setdensity (SCSI tapes) Set the tape density code to
count. The proper codes to use with each drive should be
looked up from the drive documentation.</p>

<p>densities (SCSI tapes) Write explanation of some common
density codes to standard output.</p>

<p>drvbuffer (SCSI tapes) Set the tape drive buffer code to
number. The proper value for unbuffered operation is zero
and &quot;normal&quot; buffered operation one. The meanings
of other values can be found in the drive documentation or,
in the case of a SCSI-2 drive, from the SCSI-2 standard.</p>

<p>compression (SCSI tapes) The compression within the
drive can be switched on or off using the MTCOMPRESSION
ioctl. Note that this method is not supported by all drives
implementing compression. For instance, the Exabyte 8 mm
drives use density codes to select compression.</p>

<p>stoptions (SCSI tapes) Set the driver options bits for
the device to the defined values. Allowed only for the
superuser. The bits can be set either by ORing the option
bits from the file /usr/include/linux/mtio.h to count, or by
using the following keywords (as many keywords can be used
on the same line as nec- essary, unambiguous abbreviations
allowed):</p>

<p>buffer-writes buffered writes enabled</p>

<p>async-writes asynchronous writes enabled</p>

<p>read-ahead read-ahead for fixed block size</p>

<p>debug debugging (if compiled into driver)</p>

<p>two-fms write two filemarks when file closed</p>

<p>fast-eod space directly to eod (and lose file
number)</p>

<p>no-wait don t wait until rewind, etc. complete</p>

<p>auto-lock automatically lock/unlock drive door</p>

<p>def-writes the block size and density are for writes</p>

<p>can-bsr drive can space backwards as well</p>

<p>no-blklimits drive doesn t support read block limits</p>

<p>can-partitions drive can handle partitioned tapes</p>

<p>scsi2logical seek and tell use SCSI-2 logical block
addresses instead of device dependent addresses</p>

<p>sili Set the SILI bit is when reading in variable block
mode. This may speed up reading blocks shorter than the read
byte count. Set this option only if you know that the drive
supports SILI and the HBA reliably returns transfer residual
byte counts. Requires kernel version &gt;= 2.6.26.</p>

<p>sysv enable the System V semantics</p>

<p>stsetoptions (SCSI tapes) Set selected driver options
bits. The methods to specify the bits to set are given above
in the description of stoptions. Allowed only for the
superuser.</p>

<p>stclearoptions (SCSI tapes) Clear selected driver option
bits. The methods to specify the bits to clear are given
above in description of stoptions. Allowed only for the
superuser.</p>

<p>stshowoptions (SCSI tapes) Print the currently enabled
options for the device. Requires kernel version &gt;= 2.6.26
and sysfs must be mounted at /sys.</p>

<p>stwrthreshold (SCSI tapes) The write threshold for the
tape device is set to count kilobytes. The value must be
smaller than or equal to the driver buffer size. Allowed
only for the superuser.</p>

<p>defblksize (SCSI tapes) Set the default block size of
the device to count bytes. The value -1 disables the default
block size. The block size set by setblk overrides the
default until a new tape is inserted. Allowed only for the
superuser.</p>

<p>defdensity (SCSI tapes) Set the default density code.
The value -1 disables the default density. The density set
by setdensity overrides the default until a new tape is
inserted. Allowed only for the supe- ruser.</p>

<p>defdrvbuffer (SCSI tapes) Set the default drive buffer
code. The value -1 disables the default drive buffer code.
The drive buffer code set by drvbuffer overrides the default
until a new tape is inserted. Allowed only for the
superuser.</p>

<p>defcompression (SCSI tapes) Set the default compression
state. The value -1 disables the default compression. The
compression state set by compression overrides the default
until a new tape is inserted. Allowed only for the
superuser.</p>

<p>sttimeout sets the normal timeout for the device. The
value is given in seconds. Allowed only for the
superuser.</p>

<p>stlongtimeout sets the long timeout for the device. The
value is given in sec- onds. Allowed only for the
superuser.</p>

<p>stsetcln set the cleaning request interpretation
parameters.</p>

<p>mt exits with a status of 0 if the operation succeeded,
1 if the opera- tion or device name given was invalid, or 2
if the operation failed.</p>
