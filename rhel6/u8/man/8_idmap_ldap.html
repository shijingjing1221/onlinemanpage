<p>NAME idmap_ldap - Samba&rsquo;s idmap_ldap Backend for
Winbind</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The idmap_ldap plugin provides a means for
Winbind to store and retrieve SID/uid/gid mapping tables in
an LDAP directory service.</p>

<p>In contrast to read only backends like idmap_rid, it is
an allocating backend: This means that it needs to allocate
new user and group IDs in order to create new mappings.</p>

<p>IDMAP OPTIONS ldap_base_dn = DN Defines the directory
base suffix to use for SID/uid/gid mapping entries. If not
defined, idmap_ldap will default to using the &quot;ldap
idmap suffix&quot; option from smb.conf.</p>

<p>ldap_user_dn = DN Defines the user DN to be used for
authentication. The secret for authenticating this user
should be stored with net idmap secret (see net(8)). If
absent, the ldap credentials from the ldap passdb
configuration are used, and if these are also absent, an
anonymous bind will be performed as last fallback.</p>

<p>ldap_url = ldap://server/ Specifies the LDAP server to
use for SID/uid/gid map entries. If not defined, idmap_ldap
will assume that ldap://localhost/ should be used.</p>

<p>range = low - high Defines the available matching uid
and gid range for which the backend is authoritative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following example shows how an ldap
directory is used as the default idmap backend. It also
configures the idmap range and base directory suffix. The
secret for the ldap_user_dn has to be set with &quot;net
idmap secret &rsquo;*&rsquo; password&quot;.</p>

<p>[global] idmap config * : backend = ldap idmap config *
: range = 1000000-1999999 idmap config * : ldap_url =
ldap://localhost/ idmap config * : ldap_base_dn =
ou=idmap,dc=example,dc=com idmap config * : ldap_user_dn =
cn=idmap_admin,dc=example,dc=com</p>

<p>This example shows how ldap can be used as a readonly
backend while tdb is the default backend used to store the
mappings. It adds an explicit configuration for some domain
DOM1, that uses the ldap idmap backend. Note that a range
disjoint from the default range is used.</p>

<p>[global] # &quot;backend = tdb&quot; is redundant here
since it is the default idmap config * : backend = tdb idmap
config * : range = 1000000-1999999</p>

<p>idmap config DOM1 : backend = ldap idmap config DOM1 :
range = 2000000-2999999 idmap config DOM1 : read only = yes
idmap config DOM1 : ldap_url = ldap://server/ idmap config
DOM1 : ldap_base_dn = ou=idmap,dc=dom1,dc=example,dc=com
idmap config DOM1 : ldap_user_dn =
cn=idmap_admin,dc=dom1,dc=example,dc=com</p>

<p>NOTE In order to use authentication against ldap servers
you may need to provide a DN and a password. To avoid
exposing the password in plain text in the configuration
file we store it into a security store. The &quot;net idmap
&quot; command is used to store a secret for the DN
specified in a specific idmap domain.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
