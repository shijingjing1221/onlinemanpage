<p>sane-gt68xx(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-gt68xx(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-gt68xx - SANE backend for GT-68XX based USB
flatbed scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-gt68xx library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
USB flatbed scanners based on the Grandtech GT-6801 and
GT-6816 chips. A list of supported scanners can be found on
the gt68xx backend homepage:
http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/.</p>

<p>This is BETA software. Especially if you test new or
untested scanners, keep your hand at the scanners plug and
unplug it, if the head bumps at the end of the scan
area.</p>

<p>If you own a scanner other than the ones listed on the
gt68xx homepage that works with this backend, please let me
know this by sending the scanner s exact model name and the
USB vendor and device ids (e.g. from sane-find-scanner or
syslog) to me. Even if the scanner s name is only slightly
different from the models already listed as supported,
please let me know.</p>

<p>If you own a scanner that isn t detected by the gt68xx
backend but has a GT-6801 or GT-6816 chipset, you can try to
add it to the backend. Have a look at the following web
page:
http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/adding.html</p>

<p>LIBUSB ISSUES Please use libusb-0.1.8 or later. Without
libusb or with older libusb versions all kinds of trouble
can be expected. The scanner should be found by
sane-find-scanner without further actions. For setting
permis- sions and general USB information looks at
sane-usb(5).</p>

<p>FIRMWARE FILE You need a firmware file for your scanner.
Thats a small file contain- ing software that will be
uploaded to the scanner s memory. Its usu- ally named *.usb,
e.g. PS1fw.usb. It comes on the installation CD that was
provided by the manufacturer, but it may be packaged
together with the installation program in an .exe file. For
Mustek scanners, the file can be downloaded from the gt68xx
backend homepage. For other scanners, check the CD for .usb
files. If you only find *.cab files, try cabextract to
unpack. If everything else fails, you must install the
Windows driver and get the firmware from there (usually in
the win- dows/system or system32 directories). Put that
firmware file into /usr/share/sane/gt68xx/. Make sure that
its readable by everyone.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the gt68xx.conf file is a
list of usb lines containing vendor and product ids that
correspond to USB scanners. The file can also contain option
lines. Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#)
are ignored. The scanners are autodetected by usb vendor_id
product_id statements which are already included into
gt68xx.conf. &quot;vendor_id&quot; and
&quot;product_id&quot; are hexadecimal numbers that identify
the scanner.</p>

<p>The override, firmware, vendor, model, and afe options
must be placed after the usb line they refer to.</p>

<p>Option override is used to override the default model
parameters. Thats necessary for some scanners that use the
same vendor/product ids but are different. For these
scanners there are already commented out override lines in
the configuration file. override mustek-scanex-
press-1200-ub-plus is necessary for the Mustek Scanexpress
1200 UB Plus, the Medion/Lifetec/Tevion LT 9452, and the
Trust Compact Scan USB 19200. override artec-ultima-2000 is
used for the Artec Ultima 2000, the Boeder SmartScan Slim
Edition, the Medion/ Lifetec/ Tevion/ Cytron MD/LT 9385, the
Medion/ Lifetec/ Tevion MD 9458, and the Trust Flat Scan USB
19200. override mustek-bearpaw-2400-cu is necessary for the
Mustek BearPaw 2400 CU and the Fujitsu 1200CUS. The override
option must be the first one after the usb line.</p>

<p>Option firmware selects the name and path of the
firmware file. Its only necessary if the default (or
override) doesnt work. The default firmware directory is
/usr/share/sane/gt68xx/. You may need to create this
directory. If you want to place the firmware files at a
different path, use a firmware line.</p>

<p>The vendor and model options are not absolutely
necessary but for con- venience. Quite a lot of scanners
from different manufacturers share the same vendor/product
ids so you can set the &quot;correct&quot; name here.</p>

<p>The afe option allows to set custom offset and gain
values for the Ana- log FrontEnd of the scanner. This option
can be either used to select the AFE values if automatic
coarse calibration is disabled, or to make automatic coarse
calibration faster. For the latter usage, enable debug level
3 (see below), scan an image and look for debug line string
with &quot;afe&quot;. Copy this line to gt68xx.conf. The
option has six parameters: red offset, red gain, green
offset, green gain, blue offset, and blue gain.</p>

<p>A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>

<p>usb 0x05d8 0x4002 override
&quot;mustek-scanexpress-1200-ub-plus&quot; firmware
&quot;/opt/gt68xx/SBfw.usb&quot; vendor &quot;Trust&quot;
model &quot;Compact Scan USB 19200&quot; afe 0x20 0x02 0x22
0x03 0x1f 0x04</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/gt68xx.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-gt68xx.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-gt68xx.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_GT68XX If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. Higher debug levels increase
the verbosity of the output. If the debug level is set to 1
or higher, some debug options become available that are
normally hidden. Handle them with care.</p>

<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_GT68XX=4</p>

<p>AUTHOR Henning Meier-Geinitz
&lt;henning@meier-geinitz.de&gt; The original gt68xx driver
was written by Sergey Vlasov, Andreas Nowack, and David
Stevenson. Thanks for sending patches and answering
questions to them and all the other contributors.</p>

<p>BUGS The first few lines of the image are garbage for
the 2400 TA Plus.</p>

<p>Interpolation should be used instead of just copying
data, when the X- and Y-resolution differ.</p>

<p>Support for buttons is missing.</p>

<p>More detailed bug information is available at the gt68xx
backend home- page
http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/. Please
contact us if you find a bug or missing feature:
&lt;sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org&gt;. Please send a
debug log if your scanner isnt detected correctly (see
SANE_DEBUG_GT68XX above).</p>
