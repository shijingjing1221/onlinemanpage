<p>NAME cimconfig - get, set, unset, or list CIM Server
configuration proper- ties</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cimconfig -g name [ -c ] [ -d ] [ -p ]</p>

<p>cimconfig -s name=value [ -c ] [ -p ]</p>

<p>cimconfig -u name [ -c ] [ -p ]</p>

<p>cimconfig --H name</p>

<p>cimconfig --version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The cimconfig command manages CIM Server
configuration properties. The operations are executed on the
local host by submitting requests to the CIM Server. An
operation on a current configuration property takes effect
immediately, and an operation on a planned configuration
prop- erty takes effect the next time the CIM Server is
started with cim- server (8) . Modifications to a
configuration property via cimconfig remain in effect until
changed via another cimconfig command. Configu- ration
properties may also be modified temporarily via the
cimserver (8) command, in which case, the modification of
the configuration prop- erty remains in effect for that
execution of the cimserver (8) command only. A default value
is associated with each configuration property. Each
configuration property is initially assigned its default
value, until modified by a cimconfig command or cimserver
(8) command. Dynamic configuration properties are those
whose current values may be set while the CIM server is
running.</p>

<p>The following configuration properties are
available:</p>

<p>authorizedUserGroups</p>

<p>Description: If set, the value is interpreted as a list
of comma-separated user groups whose members may issue CIM
requests. A user who is not a member of any of these groups
is restricted from issuing CIM requests, with the exception
of privileged users (superuser). If unset, any user may
issue CIM requests. Note: This configuration property
operates in conjunc- tion with other CIM request
authorization conditions rather than overriding them.
Default Value: (None) Dynamic: No</p>

<p>enableAssociationTraversal</p>

<p>Description: If True, the CIM Server will support the
four asso- ciation traversal operators: Associators,
AssociatorNames, Ref- erences, and ReferenceNames. Default
Value: True Dynamic: No</p>

<p>enableAuditLog</p>

<p>Description: If True, audit log entries for certain
types of CIM Server activities will be written to the system
log. Examples of audited activities include a CIM Server
configuration change, a Provider registration change, an
authentication attempt and a modification to the CIM Schema
or a CIM Instance. An audit log entry describes the who,
what, and when associated with an audited activity. Default
Value: False Dynamic: Yes</p>

<p>enableIndicationService</p>

<p>Description: If True, the CIM Server will support CIM
Indica- tions. Default Value: True Dynamic: No</p>

<p>enableHttpConnection</p>

<p>Description: If True, allows connections to the CIM
Server using the HTTP protocol Default Value: False Dynamic:
No</p>

<p>enableHttpsConnection</p>

<p>Description: If True, allows connections to the CIM
Server using the HTTPS protocol (HTTP using Secure Socket
Layer encryption) Default Value: True Dynamic: No</p>

<p>enableNamespaceAuthorization</p>

<p>Description: If True, the CIM Server restricts access to
names- paces based on configured user authorizations [user
authoriza- tions may be configured using cimauth (8) ]
Default Value: False Dynamic: No</p>

<p>enableRemotePrivilegedUserAccess</p>

<p>Description: If True, the CIM Server allows access by a
privi- leged user from a remote system Default Value: True
Dynamic: No</p>

<p>enableSubscriptionsForNonprivilegedUsers</p>

<p>Description: If True, nonprivileged user of the system
will be allowed to create Indication Subscription, otherwise
privileged access is required. Default Value: False Dynamic:
No</p>

<p>forceProviderProcesses</p>

<p>Description: If true, the CIM Server runs Providers in
separate processes rather than loading and calling Provider
libraries directly within the CIM Server process. Default
Value: True Dynamic: No</p>

<p>hostname</p>

<p>Description: Can be used to override the local system
supplied hostname without domain the CIM Server is using to
build objects.
Ifnotset,queryingthisconfigurationoptionwillreport-
thesystem supplied hostname and behavior is not changed.
Set- tingthisvaluetoavalidhostnameonCIMServerstartuporas
planned value will force the server to assume the configured
name as the local hosts name. Setting this allows the
administrator to set the name that operations such as
associator, reference etc. return with object paths.
Incommonsetupsitisnotrecommendedtoex- plicitlysetthisvalue.
Default Value: (blank) Dynamic: No</p>

<p>fullyQualifiedHostName</p>

<p>Description: Can be used to override the local system
supplied fully qualified hostname (with domain) the CIM
Server is using to build objects.
Ifnotset,queryingthisconfigurationoptionwill-
reportthesystem supplied fully qualified hostname and
behavior is not changed.
SettingthisvaluetoavalidhostnameonCIMServer-
startuporasplanned value will force the server to assume the
configured name as the local hosts name with domain. Setting
this allows the administrator to set the name that
indication operations and the CIM_ObjectManager assume for
SystemName returned as instance and key properties.
Incommonsetupsitis- notrecommendedtoexplicitlysetthisvalue.
Default Value: (blank) Dynamic: No</p>

<p>idleConnectionTimeout</p>

<p>Description: If set to a positive integer, this value
specifies a minimum timeout value for idle client
connections. If set to zero, idle client connections do not
time out. A client con- nection is considered idle when it
is not in the process of sending a request and the CIM
Server is not processing a request from that connection. An
idle connection timeout allows recla- mation of the system
resources allocated for idle CIM Server connections. Note
that the CIM Server may allow an idle connec- tion to
persist longer than the configured timeout value based on
server activity. Someclientapplicationsmaynotbehavecorrect-
lyifaconnectiontimeout is introduced. Client compatibility
should be considered when configuring an idle connection
timeout value.
Theidleconnectiontimeiscomputedusingthesystemclock.Thus,
resetting the system clock may cause unexpected timeout
behav- ior. Default Value: 0 Dynamic: No</p>

<p>listenAddress</p>

<p>Description: Network interfaces, if specified,
cimserver(8) should listen to for connection requests. It
accepts a coma seperated list(without space) of network
interfaces. Both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses is accepted.
Default value of &quot;All&quot; make cim- server to listen
to all the available network interfaces. For instance
listenAddress=All or listenAddress=121.12.33.112 or
listenAddress=121.33.21.26,127.0.0.1,fe80::fe62:9346%eth0
Default Value: All Dynamic: No</p>

<p>maxFailedProviderModuleRestarts</p>

<p>Description: If set to a positive integer, this value
specifies the number of times the failed provider module
with indications enabled are restarted automatically before
being moved to Degraded state. If set to zero, failed
provider module is not restarted with indications enabled
automatically and will be moved to Degraded state
immediately. This option controls the automatic re-enabling
of the failed provider module with indica- tions enabled. If
the provider module with indications enabled fails very
frequently, it affects the CIMServer normal opera- tions
because CIMServer would be busy with reloading the provider
module every time it fails. This option would be help- ful
if the long running indication provider crashes and the man-
agement application want to receive the indications from the
provider while provider fix is being delivered. In case of
provider module grouping, if one of the indication provider
crashes, it affects all indication providers in the provider
modules of the group. Note that this is the facility
provided by the CIMServer for temporary recovery of the
provider and the ultimate goal SHALL be fixing the faulty
provider. Default Value: 3 Dynamic: Yes</p>

<p>maxIndicationDeliveryRetryAttempts</p>

<p>Description:If set to a positive integer, this value
defines the number of times that the indication service will
try to deliver an indication to a particular listener
destination. This does not effect the original delivery
attempt, thus if set to 0, cim- server will only try to
deliver the indication once. This value is used to set the
CIM_IndicationService.DeliveryRetryAttempts property. See
CIM_IndicationService.DeliveryRetryAttempts prop- erty for
more details. Default Value: 3 Dynamic: No</p>

<p>minIndicationDeliveryRetryInterval</p>

<p>Description:If set to a positive integer, this value
defines the minimal time interval in seconds for the
indication service to wait before retrying to deliver an
indication to a listener des- tination that previously
failed. Cimserver may take longer due to QoS or other
processing. This value is used to initialize the property
CIM_IndicationService.DeliveryRetryInterval. See
CIM_IndicationService.DeliveryRetryInterval property for
more details. Default Value: 30 Dynamic: No</p>

<p>shutdownTimeout</p>

<p>Description: When a cimserver -s shutdown command is
issued, specifies the maximum time in seconds for the CIM
Server to com- plete outstanding CIM operation requests
before shutting down; if the specified timeout period
expires, the CIM Server will shut down, even if there are
still CIM operations in progress. Minimum value is 2
seconds. Default Value: 30 Dynamic: Yes</p>

<p>socketWriteTimeout</p>

<p>Description: Specifies the number of seconds the CIM
Server will wait for a client connection to be ready to
receive data. If the CIM Server is unable to write to a
connection in this time, the connection is closed.
Aclientconnectioncanbecomeunabletore-
ceivedataiftheclientfails to read the data that has already
been sent. This timeout allows the CIM Server to reclaim
resources that are allocated to a malfunctioning client.
OnemightconsiderincreasingthistimeoutvalueiftheCIMServer
prema- turely closes connections with well-behaved clients.
Default Value: 20 Dynamic: Yes</p>

<p>sslClientVerificationMode</p>

<p>Description: Defines the desired level of support for
certifi- cate-based authentication. It can be set to
required, optional or disabled. If set to required, the CIM
Server will require all clients connecting over HTTPS to
authenticate using a cer- tificate. If the client
certificate is not sent or not trusted the connection will
be rejected. If set to optional, the CIM Server will allow,
but not require, HTTPS clients to authenti- cate using a
certificate. If the client does not send a certifi- cate,
the CIM Server will attempt to authenticate the client using
HTTP basic authentication. If set to disabled, the CIM
Server will not allow HTTPS clients to authenticate using a
cer- tificate. Basic authentication will be used to
authenticate all HTTPS clients. This property is only used
if enableHttpsConnec- tion is true. Default Value: disabled
Dynamic: No</p>

<p>sslCipherSuite</p>

<p>Description: String containing OpenSSL cipher
specifications to configure the cipher suite the client is
permitted to negotiate with the server during the SSL
handshake phase. The value should be mentioned between
single quotes since it can contain special characters like
.+, !, -. Default Value: DEFAULT (The default cipher list of
OpenSSL) Dynamic: No</p>

<p>sslBackwardCompatibility</p>

<p>Description:This setting specifies whether the ssl
supports SSLv3. Ideally for security Compilance purposes it
is by default set to false. Default Value: false Dynamic:
No</p>

<p>If both the enableHttpsConnection and
enableHttpConnection properties are set to False , neither
HTTP nor HTTPS connections will be allowed. On some
platforms, the OpenPegasus CIM Server has been enhanced to
include support for a local (single system), non-standard
protocol. This allows the OpenPegasus CIM Server to continue
to receive and pro- cess requests from local OpenPegasus CIM
Clients even if both HTTP ports are disabled. If a local
protocol is not supported, the CIM Server will be shut down
and disabled from automatically being re-started.</p>

<p>The current and planned values of the configuration
properties are stored in the files
/var/opt/tog-pegasus/cimserver_current.conf and
/var/opt/tog-pegasus/cimserver_planned.conf , respectively.
The con- figuration properties may only be modified via the
cimconfig and cim- server (8) commands; the files must not
be edited directly.</p>

<p>Options The cimconfig command recognizes the following
options:</p>

<p>-g configuration_property Gets the specified value
(current, planned and/or default) of the specified
configuration property. By default, gets the current
value.</p>

<p>-s configuration_property = value Sets the specified
value (current and/or planned) of the specified
configuration property to R value . By default, sets the
current value.</p>

<p>-u configuration_property Unsets the specified value
(current and/or planned) of the specified configuration
property, and resets it to its default value. By default,
unsets the current value and resets it to its default
value.</p>

<p>-l Lists all the specified (current or planned) con-
figuration property name and value pairs in the CIM Server.
By default, lists only the names of all the current
configuration properties.</p>

<p>-c Specifies that the operation (get, set, unset, or
list) be performed on the current configuration properties.
For set or unset operations, returns an error when the CIM
Server is not running or the specified property is not a
dynamic property.</p>

<p>-p Specifies that the operation (get, set, unset, or
list) be performed on the planned configuration properties.
For set and unset operations, oper- ates on the value of the
specified property in the planned configuration file if the
CIM Server is not running.</p>

<p>-d Specifies that the get operation be performed on the
default configuration properties. Returns an error when the
CIM Server is not running.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display the command usage message.</p>

<p>-H name Display detailed help information on the
configu- raton property defined by the name parameter.</p>
