<p>SENDMAIL(8) SENDMAIL(8)</p>

<p>NAME sendmail - an electronic mail transport agent</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sendmail [flags] [address ...] newaliases mailq
[-v] hoststat purgestat smtpd</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sendmail sends a message to one or more
recipients, routing the message over whatever networks are
necessary. Sendmail does internetwork for- warding as
necessary to deliver the message to the correct place.</p>

<p>Sendmail is not intended as a user interface routine;
other programs provide user-friendly front ends; sendmail is
used only to deliver pre- formatted messages.</p>

<p>With no flags, sendmail reads its standard input up to
an end-of-file or a line consisting only of a single dot and
sends a copy of the mes- sage found there to all of the
addresses listed. It determines the network(s) to use based
on the syntax and contents of the addresses.</p>

<p>Local addresses are looked up in a file and aliased
appropriately. Aliasing can be prevented by preceding the
address with a backslash. Beginning with 8.10, the sender is
included in any alias expansions, e.g., if john sends to
group, and group includes john in the expansion, then the
letter will also be delivered to john.</p>

<p>Parameters -Ac Use submit.cf even if the operation mode
does not indicate an initial mail submission.</p>

<p>-Am Use sendmail.cf even if the operation mode indicates
an initial mail submission.</p>

<p>-Btype Set the body type to type. Current legal values
are 7BIT or 8BITMIME.</p>

<p>-ba Go into ARPANET mode. All input lines must end with
a CR-LF, and all messages will be generated with a CR-LF at
the end. Also, the From: and Sender: fields are examined for
the name of the sender.</p>

<p>-bd Run as a daemon. Sendmail will fork and run in
background lis- tening on socket 25 for incoming SMTP
connections. This is nor- mally run from /etc/rc.</p>

<p>-bD Same as -bd except runs in foreground.</p>

<p>-bh Print the persistent host status database.</p>

<p>-bH Purge expired entries from the persistent host
status database.</p>

<p>-bi Initialize the alias database.</p>

<p>-bm Deliver mail in the usual way (default).</p>

<p>-bp Print a listing of the queue(s).</p>

<p>-bP Print number of entries in the queue(s); only
available with shared memory support.</p>

<p>-bs Use the SMTP protocol as described in RFC821 on
standard input and output. This flag implies all the
operations of the -ba flag that are compatible with
SMTP.</p>

<p>-bt Run in address test mode. This mode reads addresses
and shows the steps in parsing; it is used for debugging
configuration tables.</p>

<p>-bv Verify names only - do not try to collect or deliver
a message. Verify mode is normally used for validating users
or mailing lists.</p>

<p>-Cfile Use alternate configuration file. Sendmail gives
up any enhanced (set-user-ID or set-group-ID) privileges if
an alter- nate configuration file is specified.</p>

<p>-D logfile Send debugging output to the indicated log
file instead of std- out.</p>

<p>-dcategory.level... Set the debugging flag for category
to level. Category is either an integer or a name specifying
the topic, and level an integer specifying the level of
debugging output desired. Higher levels generally mean more
output. More than one flag can be specified by separating
them with commas. A list of numeric debugging categories can
be found in the TRACEFLAGS file in the sendmail source
distribution. The option -d0.1 prints the version of
sendmail and the options it was compiled with. Most other
categories are only useful with, and documented in,
sendmails source code.</p>

<p>-Ffullname Set the full name of the sender.</p>

<p>-fname Sets the name of the from person (i.e., the
envelope sender of the mail). This address may also be used
in the From: header if that header is missing during initial
submission. The enve- lope sender address is used as the
recipient for delivery status notifications and may also
appear in a Return-Path: header. -f should only be used by
trusted users (normally root, daemon, and network) or if the
person you are trying to become is the same as the person
you are. Otherwise, an X-Authentication- Warning header will
be added to the message.</p>

<p>-G Relay (gateway) submission of a message, e.g., when
rmail calls sendmail .</p>

<p>-hN Set the hop count to N. The hop count is incremented
every time the mail is processed. When it reaches a limit,
the mail is returned with an error message, the victim of an
aliasing loop. If not specified, Received: lines in the
message are counted.</p>

<p>-i Ignore dots alone on lines by themselves in incoming
messages. This should be set if you are reading data from a
file.</p>

<p>-L tag Set the identifier used in syslog messages to the
supplied tag.</p>

<p>-N dsn Set delivery status notification conditions to
dsn, which can be never for no notifications or a comma
separated list of the values failure to be notified if
delivery failed, delay to be notified if delivery is
delayed, and success to be notified when the message is
successfully delivered.</p>

<p>-n Dont do aliasing.</p>

<p>-O option=value Set option option to the specified
value. This form uses long names. See below for more
details.</p>

<p>-ox value Set option x to the specified value. This form
uses single character names only. The short names are not
described in this manual page; see the Sendmail Installation
and Operation Guide for details.</p>

<p>-pprotocol Set the name of the protocol used to receive
the message. This can be a simple protocol name such as UUCP
or a protocol and hostname, such as UUCP:ucbvax.</p>

<p>-q[time] Process saved messages in the queue at given
intervals. If time is omitted, process the queue once. Time
is given as a tagged number, with s being seconds, m being
minutes (default), h being hours, d being days, and w being
weeks. For example, -q1h30m or -q90m would both set the
timeout to one hour thirty minutes. By default, sendmail
will run in the back- ground. This option can be used safely
with -bd.</p>

<p>-qp[time] Similar to -qtime, except that instead of
periodically forking a child to process the queue, sendmail
forks a single persistent child for each queue that
alternates between processing the queue and sleeping. The
sleep time is given as the argument; it defaults to 1
second. The process will always sleep at least 5 seconds if
the queue was empty in the previous queue run.</p>

<p>-qf Process saved messages in the queue once and do not
fork(), but run in the foreground.</p>

<p>-qGname Process jobs in queue group called name
only.</p>

<p>-q[!]Isubstr Limit processed jobs to those containing
substr as a substring of the queue id or not when ! is
specified.</p>

<p>-q[!]Qsubstr Limit processed jobs to quarantined jobs
containing substr as a substring of the quarantine reason or
not when ! is specified.</p>

<p>-q[!]Rsubstr Limit processed jobs to those containing
substr as a substring of one of the recipients or not when !
is specified.</p>

<p>-q[!]Ssubstr Limit processed jobs to those containing
substr as a substring of the sender or not when ! is
specified.</p>

<p>-Q[reason] Quarantine a normal queue items with the
given reason or unquar- antine quarantined queue items if no
reason is given. This should only be used with some sort of
item matching using as described above.</p>

<p>-R return Set the amount of the message to be returned
if the message bounces. The return parameter can be full to
return the entire message or hdrs to return only the
headers. In the latter case also local bounces return only
the headers.</p>

<p>-rname An alternate and obsolete form of the -f
flag.</p>

<p>-t Read message for recipients. To:, Cc:, and Bcc: lines
will be scanned for recipient addresses. The Bcc: line will
be deleted before transmission.</p>

<p>-V envid Set the original envelope id. This is
propagated across SMTP to servers that support DSNs and is
returned in DSN-compliant error messages.</p>

<p>-v Go into verbose mode. Alias expansions will be
announced, etc.</p>

<p>-X logfile Log all traffic in and out of mailers in the
indicated log file. This should only be used as a last
resort for debugging mailer bugs. It will log a lot of data
very quickly.</p>

<p>-- Stop processing command flags and use the rest of the
arguments as addresses.</p>

<p>Options There are also a number of processing options
that may be set. Nor- mally these will only be used by a
system administrator. Options may be set either on the
command line using the -o flag (for short names), the -O
flag (for long names), or in the configuration file. This is
a partial list limited to those options that are likely to
be useful on the command line and only shows the long names;
for a complete list (and details), consult the Sendmail
Installation and Operation Guide. The options are:</p>

<p>AliasFile=file Use alternate alias file.</p>

<p>HoldExpensive On mailers that are considered expensive
to connect to, don t initiate immediate connection. This
requires queueing.</p>

<p>CheckpointInterval=N Checkpoint the queue file after
every N successful deliveries (default 10). This avoids
excessive duplicate deliveries when sending to long mailing
lists interrupted by system crashes.</p>

<p>DeliveryMode=x Set the delivery mode to x. Delivery
modes are i for interac- tive (synchronous) delivery, b for
background (asynchronous) delivery, q for queue only - i.e.,
actual delivery is done the next time the queue is run, and
d for deferred - the same as q except that database lookups
for maps which have set the -D option (default for the host
map) are avoided.</p>

<p>ErrorMode=x Set error processing to mode x. Valid modes
are m to mail back the error message, w to write back the
error message (or mail it back if the sender is not logged
in), p to print the errors on the terminal (default), q to
throw away error messages (only exit status is returned),
and e to do special processing for the BerkNet. If the text
of the message is not mailed back by modes m or w and if the
sender is local to this machine, a copy of the message is
appended to the file dead.letter in the senders home
directory.</p>

<p>SaveFromLine Save UNIX-style From lines at the front of
messages.</p>

<p>MaxHopCount=N The maximum number of times a message is
allowed to hop before we decide it is in a loop.</p>

<p>IgnoreDots Do not take dots on a line by themselves as a
message termina- tor.</p>

<p>SendMimeErrors Send error messages in MIME format. If
not set, the DSN (Deliv- ery Status Notification) SMTP
extension is disabled.</p>

<p>ConnectionCacheTimeout=timeout Set connection cache
timeout.</p>

<p>ConnectionCacheSize=N Set connection cache size.</p>

<p>LogLevel=n The log level.</p>

<p>MeToo=False Don t send to me (the sender) if I am in an
alias expansion.</p>

<p>CheckAliases Validate the right hand side of aliases
during a newaliases(1) command.</p>

<p>OldStyleHeaders If set, this message may have old style
headers. If not set, this message is guaranteed to have new
style headers (i.e., com- mas instead of spaces between
addresses). If set, an adaptive algorithm is used that will
correctly determine the header for- mat in most cases.</p>

<p>QueueDirectory=queuedir Select the directory in which to
queue messages.</p>

<p>StatusFile=file Save statistics in the named file.</p>

<p>Timeout.queuereturn=time Set the timeout on undelivered
messages in the queue to the specified time. After delivery
has failed (e.g., because of a host being down) for this
amount of time, failed messages will be returned to the
sender. The default is five days.</p>

<p>UserDatabaseSpec=userdatabase If set, a user database is
consulted to get forwarding informa- tion. You can consider
this an adjunct to the aliasing mecha- nism, except that the
database is intended to be distributed; aliases are local to
a particular host. This may not be avail- able if your
sendmail does not have the USERDB option compiled in.</p>

<p>ForkEachJob Fork each job during queue runs. May be
convenient on memory- poor machines.</p>

<p>SevenBitInput Strip incoming messages to seven bits.</p>

<p>EightBitMode=mode Set the handling of eight bit input to
seven bit destinations to mode: m (mimefy) will convert to
seven-bit MIME format, p (pass) will pass it as eight bits
(but violates protocols), and s (strict) will bounce the
message.</p>

<p>MinQueueAge=timeout Sets how long a job must ferment in
the queue between attempts to send it.</p>

<p>DefaultCharSet=charset Sets the default character set
used to label 8-bit data that is not otherwise labelled.</p>

<p>DialDelay=sleeptime If opening a connection fails, sleep
for sleeptime seconds and try again. Useful on
dial-on-demand sites.</p>

<p>NoRecipientAction=action Set the behaviour when there
are no recipient headers (To:, Cc: or Bcc:) in the message
to action: none leaves the message unchanged, add-to adds a
To: header with the envelope recipi- ents, add-apparently-to
adds an Apparently-To: header with the envelope recipients,
add-bcc adds an empty Bcc: header, and add- to-undisclosed
adds a header reading To: undisclosed-recipi- ents:;.</p>

<p>MaxDaemonChildren=N Sets the maximum number of children
that an incoming SMTP daemon will allow to spawn at any time
to N.</p>

<p>ConnectionRateThrottle=N Sets the maximum number of
connections per second to the SMTP port to N.</p>

<p>In aliases, the first character of a name may be a
vertical bar to cause interpretation of the rest of the name
as a command to pipe the mail to. It may be necessary to
quote the name to keep sendmail from suppressing the blanks
from between arguments. For example, a common alias is:</p>

<p>msgs: &quot;|/usr/bin/msgs -s&quot;</p>

<p>Aliases may also have the syntax :include:filename to
ask sendmail to read the named file for a list of
recipients. For example, an alias such as:</p>

<p>poets:
&quot;:include:/usr/local/lib/poets.list&quot;</p>

<p>would read /usr/local/lib/poets.list for the list of
addresses making up the group.</p>

<p>Sendmail returns an exit status describing what it did.
The codes are defined in &lt;sysexits.h&gt;:</p>

<p>EX_OK Successful completion on all addresses.</p>

<p>EX_NOUSER User name not recognized.</p>

<p>EX_UNAVAILABLE Catchall meaning necessary resources were
not available.</p>

<p>EX_SYNTAX Syntax error in address.</p>

<p>EX_SOFTWARE Internal software error, including bad
arguments.</p>

<p>EX_OSERR Temporary operating system error, such as
cannot fork.</p>

<p>EX_NOHOST Host name not recognized.</p>

<p>EX_TEMPFAIL Message could not be sent immediately, but
was queued.</p>

<p>If invoked as newaliases, sendmail will rebuild the
alias database. If invoked as mailq, sendmail will print the
contents of the mail queue. If invoked as hoststat, sendmail
will print the persistent host status database. If invoked
as purgestat, sendmail will purge expired entries from the
persistent host status database. If invoked as smtpd, send-
mail will act as a daemon, as if the -bd option were
specified.</p>

<p>NOTES sendmail often gets blamed for many problems that
are actually the result of other problems, such as overly
permissive modes on directo- ries. For this reason, sendmail
checks the modes on system directories and files to
determine if they can be trusted. Although these checks can
be turned off and your system security reduced by setting
the Dont- BlameSendmail option, the permission problems
should be fixed. For more information, see:</p>
