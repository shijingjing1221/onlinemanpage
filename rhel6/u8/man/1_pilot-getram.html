<p>pilot-getram(1) PILOT-LINK pilot-getram(1)</p>

<p>NAME pilot-getram - Retrieves the RAM image from your
Palm device for use in debugging.</p>

<p>SECTION pilot-link: Tools</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pilot-getram [-p|--port &lt;port&gt;]
[--version] [-q|--quiet] [-?|--help] [--usage] [-t|--token
token] [-s|--sysinfo] [--ram] [--rom] [filename]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pilot-getram is used to fetch the current
RAM image from your Palm handheld for use in debugging.</p>

<p>pilot-getromtoken, pilot-getrom and pilot-getram are
inter-related. All relevant code is implemented in
pilot-getrom, and you can do pilot-getromtoken --ram
filename to get the RAM dump if you like.</p>

<p>Note, because pilot-getrom uses the low-level RPC
protocol to fetch the ROM image, and the new OS5 devices do
not use this protocol, you cur- rently cannot fetch an OS5
ROM image using this utility. This will be updated in a
future release to handle fetching OS5 ROM images, using the
debugger protocol.</p>

<p>Write the RAM image to the file named by
&lt;filename&gt;. If this is omit- ted, the filename will be
written out as the RAM version name as fol- lows:
pilot-$VERSION.ram , where an OS 3.5 image would be written
as the filename of pilot-3.5.0.ram.</p>

<p>Conduit Options -p, --port &lt;port&gt;</p>

<p>Use device file &lt;port&gt; to communicate with the
Palm handheld. If this is not specified, pilot-getram will
