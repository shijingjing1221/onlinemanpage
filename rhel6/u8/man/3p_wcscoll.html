<p>WCSCOLL(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCSCOLL(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcscoll - wide-character string comparison using
collating information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>int wcscoll(const wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcscoll() function shall compare the
wide-character string pointed to by ws1 to the
wide-character string pointed to by ws2, both inter- preted
as appropriate to the LC_COLLATE category of the current
locale.</p>

<p>The wcscoll() function shall not change the setting of
errno if suc- cessful.</p>

<p>An application wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to 0 before calling wcscoll(). If errno is
non-zero on return, an error has occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, wcscoll() shall
return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
according to whether the wide-character string pointed to by
ws1 is greater than, equal to, or less than the
wide-character string pointed to by ws2, when both are
interpreted as appropriate to the current locale. On error,
wcscoll() shall set errno, but no return value is reserved
to indicate an error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The wcscoll() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The ws1 or ws2 arguments contain wide-character
codes outside the domain of the collating sequence.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The wcsxfrm() and wcscmp() functions
should be used for sorting large lists.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
