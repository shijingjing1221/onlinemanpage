<p>NAME yp.conf - NIS binding configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file /etc/yp.conf is read from ypbind(8)
at startup or when receiving signal SIGHUP. The entries are
used for the initial binding. Valid entries are</p>

<p>domain nisdomain server hostname Use server hostname for
the domain nisdomain. You could have more then one entry of
this type for a single domain.</p>

<p>domain nisdomain broadcast Use broadcast on the local
net for domain nisdomain.</p>

<p>domain nisdomain slp Query the local running SLP server
for hosts running ypserv and distributing nisdomain. This
option is only available, if ypbind was compiled with SLP
support.</p>

<p>ypserver hostname Use server hostname for the local
domain.</p>

<p>broadcast If no other server is given or all of them are
not reachable, try a broadcast call for the default domain
to find a server.</p>

<p>If for a specific domain the broadcast option and fixed
server are given, ypbind-mt tries at first the given servers
before falling back to broadcasting for a running
server.</p>
