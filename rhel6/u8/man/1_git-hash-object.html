<p>GIT-HASH-OBJECT(1) Git Manual GIT-HASH-OBJECT(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-hash-object - Compute object ID and optionally
creates a blob from a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git hash-object [-t &lt;type&gt;] [-w]
[--path=&lt;file&gt;|--no-filters] [--stdin] [--]
&lt;file&gt;... git hash-object [-t &lt;type&gt;] [-w]
--stdin-paths [--no-filters] &lt; &lt;list-of-paths&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Computes the object ID value for an object
with specified type with the contents of the named file
(which can be outside of the work tree), and optionally
writes the resulting object into the object database.
Reports its object ID to its standard output. This is used
by git cvsimport to update the index without modifying files
in the work tree. When &lt;type&gt; is not specified, it
defaults to &quot;blob&quot;.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -t &lt;type&gt; Specify the type (default:
&quot;blob&quot;).</p>

<p>-w Actually write the object into the object
database.</p>

<p>--stdin Read the object from standard input instead of
from a file.</p>

<p>--stdin-paths Read file names from stdin instead of from
the command-line.</p>

<p>--path Hash object as it were located at the given path.
The location of file does not directly influence on the hash
value, but path is used to determine what git filters should
be applied to the object before it can be placed to the
object database, and, as result of applying filters, the
actual blob put into the object database may differ from the
given file. This option is mainly useful for hashing
temporary files located outside of the working directory or
files read from stdin.</p>

<p>--no-filters Hash the contents as is, ignoring any input
filter that would have been chosen by the attributes
mechanism, including crlf conversion. If the file is read
from standard input then this is always implied, unless the
--path option is given.</p>
