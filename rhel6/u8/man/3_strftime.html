<p>NAME strftime - format date and time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t strftime(char *s, size_t max, const char *format,
const struct tm *tm);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strftime() function formats the
broken-down time tm according to the format specification
format and places the result in the character array s of
size max.</p>

<p>Ordinary characters placed in the format string are
copied to s without conversion. Conversion specifications
are introduced by a &rsquo;%&rsquo; charac- ter, and
terminated by a conversion specifier character, and are
replaced in s as follows:</p>

<p>%a The abbreviated weekday name according to the current
locale.</p>

<p>%A The full weekday name according to the current
locale.</p>

<p>%b The abbreviated month name according to the current
locale.</p>

<p>%B The full month name according to the current
locale.</p>

<p>%c The preferred date and time representation for the
current locale.</p>

<p>%C The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer.
(SU)</p>

<p>%d The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to
31).</p>

<p>%D Equivalent to %m/%d/%y. (Yecch for Americans only.
Americans should note that in other countries %d/%m/%y is
rather common. This means that in international context this
format is ambigu- ous and should not be used.) (SU)</p>

<p>%e Like %d, the day of the month as a decimal number,
but a leading zero is replaced by a space. (SU)</p>

<p>%E Modifier: use alternative format, see below. (SU)</p>

<p>%F Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d (the ISO 8601 date format).
(C99)</p>

<p>%G The ISO 8601 week-based year (see NOTES) with century
as a deci- mal number. The 4-digit year corresponding to the
ISO week num- ber (see %V). This has the same format and
value as %Y, except that if the ISO week number belongs to
the previous or next year, that year is used instead.
(TZ)</p>

<p>%g Like %G, but without century, that is, with a 2-digit
year (00-99). (TZ)</p>

<p>%h Equivalent to %b. (SU)</p>

<p>%H The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock
(range 00 to 23).</p>

<p>%I The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock
(range 01 to 12).</p>

<p>%j The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to
366).</p>

<p>%k The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0
to 23); single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also
%H.) (TZ)</p>

<p>%l The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1
to 12); single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also
%I.) (TZ)</p>

<p>%m The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).</p>

<p>%M The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).</p>

<p>%n A newline character. (SU)</p>

<p>%O Modifier: use alternative format, see below. (SU)</p>

<p>%p Either &quot;AM&quot; or &quot;PM&quot; according to
the given time value, or the corresponding strings for the
current locale. Noon is treated as &quot;PM&quot; and
midnight as &quot;AM&quot;.</p>

<p>%P Like %p but in lowercase: &quot;am&quot; or
&quot;pm&quot; or a corresponding string for the current
locale. (GNU)</p>

<p>%r The time in a.m. or p.m. notation. In the POSIX
locale this is equivalent to %I:%M:%S %p. (SU)</p>

<p>%R The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M). (SU) For a
version includ- ing the seconds, see %T below.</p>

<p>%s The number of seconds since the Epoch, that is, since
1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. (TZ)</p>

<p>%S The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60). (The
range is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)</p>

<p>%t A tab character. (SU)</p>

<p>%T The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M:%S). (SU)</p>

<p>%u The day of the week as a decimal, range 1 to 7,
Monday being 1. See also %w. (SU)</p>

<p>%U The week number of the current year as a decimal
number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Sunday as
the first day of week 01. See also %V and %W.</p>

<p>%V The ISO 8601 week number (see NOTES) of the current
year as a decimal number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is
the first week that has at least 4 days in the new year. See
also %U and %W. (SU)</p>

<p>%w The day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6,
Sunday being 0. See also %u.</p>

<p>%W The week number of the current year as a decimal
number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Monday as
the first day of week 01.</p>

<p>%x The preferred date representation for the current
locale without the time.</p>

<p>%X The preferred time representation for the current
locale without the date.</p>

<p>%y The year as a decimal number without a century (range
00 to 99).</p>

<p>%Y The year as a decimal number including the
century.</p>

<p>%z The time-zone as hour offset from GMT. Required to
emit RFC 822-conformant dates (using &quot;%a, %d %b %Y
%H:%M:%S %z&quot;). (GNU)</p>

<p>%Z The timezone or name or abbreviation.</p>

<p>%+ The date and time in date(1) format. (TZ) (Not
supported in glibc2.)</p>

<p>%% A literal &rsquo;%&rsquo; character.</p>

<p>Some conversion specifications can be modified by
preceding the conver- sion specifier character by the E or O
modifier to indicate that an alternative format should be
used. If the alternative format or speci- fication does not
exist for the current locale, the behavior will be as if the
unmodified conversion specification were used. (SU) The
Single Unix Specification mentions %Ec, %EC, %Ex, %EX, %Ey,
%EY, %Od, %Oe, %OH, %OI, %Om, %OM, %OS, %Ou, %OU, %OV, %Ow,
%OW, %Oy, where the effect of the O modifier is to use
alternative numeric symbols (say, roman numerals), and that
of the E modifier is to use a locale-dependent alternative
representation.</p>

<p>The broken-down time structure tm is defined in
&lt;time.h&gt;. See also ctime(3).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The strftime() function returns the number
of characters placed in the array s, not including the
terminating null byte, provided the string, including the
terminating null byte, fits. Otherwise, it returns 0, and
the contents of the array is undefined. (This behavior
applies since at least libc 4.4.4; very old versions of
libc, such as libc 4.4.1, would return max if the array was
too small.)</p>

<p>Note that the return value 0 does not necessarily
indicate an error; for example, in many locales %p yields an
empty string.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variables TZ and LC_TIME are
used.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, C89, C99. There are strict
inclusions between the set of conver- sions given in ANSI C
(unmarked), those given in the Single Unix Speci- fication
(marked SU), those given in Olson s timezone package (marked
TZ), and those given in glibc (marked GNU), except that %+
is not sup- ported in glibc2. On the other hand glibc2 has
several more exten- sions. POSIX.1 only refers to ANSI C;
POSIX.2 describes under date(1) several extensions that
could apply to strftime() as well. The %F con- version is in
C99 and POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>In SUSv2, the %S specifier allowed a range of 00 to 61,
to allow for the theoretical possibility of a minute that
included a double leap second (there never has been such a
minute).</p>

<p>NOTES ISO 8601 Week Dates %G, %g, and %V yield values
calculated from the week-based year defined by the ISO 8601
standard. In this system, weeks start on a Monday, and are
numbered from 01, for the first week, up to 52 or 53, for
the last week. Week 1 is the first week where four or more
days fall within the new year (or, synonymously, week 01 is:
the first week of the year that contains a Thursday; or, the
week that has 4 January in it). When three of fewer days of
the first calendar week of the new year fall within that
year, then the ISO 8601 week-based system counts those days
as part of week 53 of the preceding year. For example, 1
January 2010 is a Friday, meaning that just three days of
that calendar week fall in 2010. Thus, the ISO 8601
week-based system considers these days to be part of week 53
(%V) of the year 2009 (%G) ; week 01 of ISO 8601 year 2010
starts on Thursday, 4 January 2010.</p>

<p>Glibc Notes Glibc provides some extensions for
conversion specifications. (These extensions are not
specified in POSIX.1-2001, but a few other systems provide
similar features.) Between the &rsquo;%&rsquo; character and
the conver- sion specifier character, an optional flag and
field width may be spec- ified. (These precede the E or O
modifiers, if present.)</p>

<p>The following flag characters are permitted:</p>

<p>_ (underscore) Pad a numeric result string with
spaces.</p>

<p>- (dash) Do not pad a numeric result string.</p>

<p>0 Pad a numeric result string with zeros even if the
conversion specifier character uses space-padding by
default.</p>

<p>^ Convert alphabetic characters in result string to
upper case.</p>

<p># Swap the case of the result string. (This flag only
works with certain conversion specifier characters, and of
these, it is only really useful with %Z.)</p>

<p>An optional decimal width specifier may follow the
(possibly absent) flag. If the natural size of the field is
smaller than this width, then the result string is padded
(on the left) to the specified width.</p>

<p>BUGS Some buggy versions of gcc(1) complain about the
use of %c: warning: %c_yields only last 2 digits of year in
some locales. Of course pro- grammers are encouraged to use
%c, it gives the preferred date and time representation. One
meets all kinds of strange obfuscations to circum- vent this
gcc(1) problem. A relatively clean one is to add an interme-
diate function</p>

<p>size_t my_strftime(char *s, size_t max, const char *fmt,
const struct tm *tm) { return strftime(s, max, fmt, tm);
}</p>

<p>Nowadays, gcc(1) provides the -Wno-format-y2k option to
prevent the warning, so that the above workaround is no
longer required.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The program below can be used to experiment with
strftime().</p>

<p>Some examples of the result string produced by the glibc
implementation of strftime() are as follows:</p>

<p>$ ./a.out &rsquo;%m&rsquo; Result string is
&quot;11&quot; $ ./a.out &rsquo;%5m&rsquo; Result string is
&quot;00011&quot; $ ./a.out &rsquo;%_5m&rsquo; Result string
is &quot; 11&quot;</p>

<p>Program source</p>

<p>#include &lt;time.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { char outstr[200];
time_t t; struct tm *tmp;</p>

<p>t = time(NULL); tmp = localtime(&amp;t); if (tmp ==
NULL) { perror(&quot;localtime&quot;); exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}</p>

<p>if (strftime(outstr, sizeof(outstr), argv[1], tmp) == 0)
{ fprintf(stderr, &quot;strftime returned 0&quot;);
exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>printf(&quot;Result string is exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); } /*
main */</p>
