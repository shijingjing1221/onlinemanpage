<p>Tk_CreateGenericHandler(3) Tk Library Procedures
Tk_CreateGenericHandler(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_CreateGenericHandler, Tk_DeleteGenericHandler -
associate procedure callback with all X events</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_CreateGenericHandler(proc, clientData)</p>

<p>Tk_DeleteGenericHandler(proc, clientData)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_GenericProc *proc (in) Procedure to invoke
whenever any X event occurs on any dis- play.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary one-word value to
pass to proc.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_CreateGenericHandler arranges for proc to
be invoked in the future whenever any X event occurs. This
mechanism is not intended for dis- patching X events on
windows managed by Tk (you should use Tk_Cre-
ateEventHandler for this purpose). Tk_CreateGenericHandler
is intended for other purposes, such as tracing X events,
monitoring events on win- dows not owned by Tk, accessing
X-related libraries that were not orig- inally designed for
use with Tk, and so on.</p>

<p>The callback to proc will be made by Tk_HandleEvent;
this mechanism only works in programs that dispatch events
through Tk_HandleEvent (or through other Tk procedures that
call Tk_HandleEvent, such as Tk_DoOneEvent or
Tk_MainLoop).</p>

<p>Proc should have arguments and result that match the
type Tk_Gener- icProc: typedef int Tk_GenericProc(
ClientData clientData, XEvent *eventPtr); The clientData
parameter to proc is a copy of the clientData argument given
to Tk_CreateGenericHandler when the callback was created.
Typi- cally, clientData points to a data structure
containing application- specific information about how to
handle events. EventPtr is a pointer to the X event.</p>

<p>Whenever an X event is processed by Tk_HandleEvent, proc
is called. The return value from proc is normally 0. A
non-zero return value indicates that the event is not to be
handled further; that is, proc has done all processing that
is to be allowed for the event.</p>

<p>If there are multiple generic event handlers, each one
is called for each event, in the order in which they were
established.</p>

<p>Tk_DeleteGenericHandler may be called to delete a
previously-created generic event handler: it deletes each
handler it finds that matches the proc and clientData
arguments. If no such handler exists, then
Tk_DeleteGenericHandler returns without doing anything.
Although Tk supports it, its probably a bad idea to have
more than one callback with the same proc and clientData
arguments.</p>

<p>Establishing a generic event handler does nothing to
ensure that the process will actually receive the X events
that the handler wants to process. For example, it is the
callers responsibility to invoke XSe- lectInput to select
the desired events, if that is necessary.</p>
