<p>GROUPMOD(8) System Management Commands GROUPMOD(8)</p>

<p>NAME groupmod - modify a group definition on the
system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groupmod [options] GROUP</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The groupmod command modifies the definition
of the specified GROUP by modifying the appropriate entry in
the group database.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options which apply to the groupmod command
are:</p>

<p>-g, --gid GID The group ID of the given GROUP will be
changed to GID.</p>

<p>The value of GID must be a non-negative decimal integer.
This value must be unique, unless the -o option is used.</p>

<p>Users who use the group as primary group will be updated
to keep the group as their primary group.</p>

<p>Any files that have the old group ID and must continue
to belong to GROUP, must have their group ID changed
manually.</p>

<p>No checks will be performed with regard to the GID_MIN,
GID_MAX, SYS_GID_MIN, or SYS_GID_MAX from
/etc/login.defs.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display help message and exit.</p>

<p>-n, --new-name NEW_GROUP The name of the group will be
changed from GROUP to NEW_GROUP name.</p>

<p>-o, --non-unique When used with the -g option, allow to
change the group GID to a non-unique value.</p>

<p>-p, --password PASSWORD The encrypted password, as
returned by crypt(3).</p>

<p>Note: This option is not recommended because the
password (or encrypted password) will be visible by users
listing the processes.</p>

<p>You should make sure the password respects the
system&acute;s password policy.</p>

<p>-R, --root CHROOT_DIR Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR
directory and use the configuration files from the
CHROOT_DIR directory.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The following configuration variables in
/etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:</p>

<p>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP (number) Maximum members per group
entry. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line)
is started in /etc/group (with the same name, same password,
and same GID).</p>

<p>The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits
in the number of members in a group.</p>

<p>This feature (split group) permits to limit the length
of lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024
characters.</p>

<p>If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.</p>

<p>Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools
(even in the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this
variable unless you really need it.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/gshadow Secure group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/login.defs Shadow password suite configuration.</p>

<p>/etc/passwd User account information.</p>

<p>EXIT VALUES The groupmod command exits with the
following values:</p>

<p>0 success</p>

<p>2 invalid command syntax</p>

<p>3 invalid argument to option</p>

<p>4 specified group doesn&acute;t exist</p>

<p>6 specified group doesn&acute;t exist</p>

<p>9 group name already in use</p>

<p>10 can&acute;t update group file</p>
