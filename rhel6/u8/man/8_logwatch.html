<p>NAME logwatch - system log analyzer and reporter</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS logwatch [--detail level ] [--logfile
log-file-group ] [--service ser- vice-name ] [--print]
[--mailto address ] [--archives] [--range range ] [--debug
level ] [--save file-name ] [--logdir directory ]
[--hostname hostname ] [--splithosts] [--multiemail]
[--output output-type ] [--numeric] [--no-oldfiles-log]
[--version] [--help|--usage]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Logwatch is a customizable, pluggable
log-monitoring system. It will go through your logs for a
given period of time and make a report in the areas that you
wish with the detail that you wish. Logwatch is being used
for Linux and many types of UNIX.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --detail level This is the detail level of the
report. level can be a positive integer, or high, med, low,
which correspond to the integers 10, 5, and 0,
repectively.</p>

<p>--logfile log-file-group This will force Logwatch to
process only the set of logfiles defined by log-file-group
(i.e. messages, xferlog, ...). Log- watch will therefore
process all services that use those log- files. This option
can be specified more than once to specify multiple
logfile-groups.</p>

<p>--service service-name This will force Logwatch to
process only the service specified in service-name (i.e.
login, pam, identd, ...). Logwatch will therefore also
process any log-file-groups necessary to process these
services. This option can be specified more than once to
specify multiple services to process. A useful service-name
is All which will process all services (and logfile-groups)
for which you have filters installed.</p>

<p>--print Print the results to stdout (i.e. the
screen).</p>

<p>--mailto address Mail the results to the email address
or user specified in address. This option overrides the
--print option.</p>

<p>--range range You can specify a date-range to process.
Common ranges are Yes- terday, Today, All, and Help.
Additional options are listed when invoked with the Help
parameter.</p>

<p>--archives Each log-file-group has basic logfiles (i.e.
/var/log/messages) as well as archives (i.e.
/var/log/messages.? or /var/log/mes- sages.?.gz). When used
with &quot;--range all&quot;, this option will make Logwatch
search through the archives in addition to the regular
logfiles. For other values of --range, Logwatch will search
the appropriate archived logs.</p>

<p>--debug level For debugging purposes. level can range
from 0 to 100. This will really clutter up your output. You
probably dont want to use this.</p>

<p>--save file-name Save the output to file-name instead of
displaying or mailing it.</p>

<p>--logdir directory Look in directory for log
subdirectories or log files instead of the default
directory.</p>

<p>--hostname hostname Use hostname for the reports instead
of this system s hostname. In addition, if HostLimit is set
in the logwatch.conf configura- tion file (see MORE
INFORMATION, below), then only logs from this hostname will
be processed (where appropriate).</p>

<p>--numeric Inhibits additional name lookups, displaying
IP addresses numer- ically.</p>

<p>--no-oldfiles-log Suppress the logwatch log, which
informs about the old files in logwatch tmpdir.</p>

<p>--help Displays usage information.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/logwatch/ This directory contains all
the perl executables and configura- tion files shipped with
the logwatch distribution.</p>

<p>/etc/logwatch This directory contains local
configuration files that override the default configuration.
See MORE INFORMATION below for more information.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES logwatch --service ftpd-xferlog --range all
--detail high --print --archives This will print out all FTP
transfers that are stored in all current and archived
xferlogs. logwatch --service pam_pwdb --range yesterday
--detail high --print This will print out login information
for the previous day...</p>

<p>MORE INFORMATION The directory /usr/share/doc/logwatch-*
contains several files with additional documentation:
HOWTO-Customize-LogWatch Documents the directory structure
of Logwatch configuration and executable files, and
describes how to customize Logwatch by overriding these
default files. License Describes the License under which
Logwatch is distributed. Additional clauses may be specified
in individual files. README Describes how to install, where
to find it, mailing lists, and other useful information.</p>
