<p>NANOSLEEP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
NANOSLEEP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME nanosleep - high resolution sleep (REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int nanosleep(const struct timespec *rqtp, struct
timespec *rmtp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The nanosleep() function shall cause the
current thread to be suspended from execution until either
the time interval specified by the rqtp argument has elapsed
or a signal is delivered to the calling thread, and its
action is to invoke a signal-catching function or to
terminate the process. The suspension time may be longer
than requested because the argument value is rounded up to
an integer multiple of the sleep resolution or because of
the scheduling of other activity by the sys- tem. But,
except for the case of being interrupted by a signal, the
suspension time shall not be less than the time specified by
rqtp, as measured by the system clock CLOCK_REALTIME.</p>

<p>The use of the nanosleep() function has no effect on the
action or blockage of any signal.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the nanosleep() function returns because
the requested time has elapsed, its return value shall be
zero.</p>

<p>If the nanosleep() function returns because it has been
interrupted by a signal, it shall return a value of -1 and
set errno to indicate the interruption. If the rmtp argument
is non-NULL, the timespec structure referenced by it is
updated to contain the amount of time remaining in the
interval (the requested time minus the time actually slept).
If the rmtp argument is NULL, the remaining time is not
returned.</p>

<p>If nanosleep() fails, it shall return a value of -1 and
set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The nanosleep() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINTR The nanosleep() function was interrupted by a
signal.</p>

<p>EINVAL The rqtp argument specified a nanosecond value
less than zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE It is common to suspend execution of a process
for an interval in order to poll the status of a
non-interrupting function. A large number of actual needs
can be met with a simple extension to sleep() that pro-
vides finer resolution.</p>

<p>In the POSIX.1-1990 standard and SVR4, it is possible to
implement such a routine, but the frequency of wakeup is
limited by the resolution of the alarm() and sleep()
functions. In 4.3 BSD, it is possible to write such a
routine using no static storage and reserving no system
facili- ties. Although it is possible to write a function
with similar func- tionality to sleep() using the remainder
of the timer_*() functions, such a function requires the use
of signals and the reservation of some signal number. This
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires that nanosleep() be
non-intrusive of the signals function.</p>

<p>The nanosleep() function shall return a value of 0 on
success and -1 on failure or if interrupted. This latter
case is different from sleep(). This was done because the
remaining time is returned via an argument structure
pointer, rmtp, instead of as the return value.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
