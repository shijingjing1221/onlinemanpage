<p>NAME slapacl - Check access to a list of attributes.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/sbin/slapacl -b DN [-d debug-level] [-D
authcDN | -U authcID] [-f slapd.conf] [-F confdir] [-o
option[=value]] [-u] [-v] [-X authzID | -o authzDN=DN]
[attr[/access][:value]] [...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION slapacl is used to check the behavior of
slapd(8) by verifying access to directory data according to
the access control list directives defined in its
configuration. It opens the slapd.conf(5) configuration file
or the slapd-config(5) backend, reads in the
access/olcAccess directives, and then parses the attr list
given on the command-line; if none is given, access to the
entry pseudo-attribute is tested.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b DN specify the DN which access is requested
to; the corresponding entry is fetched from the database,
and thus it must exist. The DN is also used to determine
what rules apply; thus, it must be in the naming context of
a configured database. See also -u.</p>

<p>-d debug-level enable debugging messages as defined by
the specified debug- level; see slapd(8) for details.</p>

<p>-D authcDN specify a DN to be used as identity through
the test session when selecting appropriate &lt;by&gt;
clauses in access lists.</p>

<p>-f slapd.conf specify an alternative slapd.conf(5)
file.</p>

<p>-F confdir specify a config directory. If both -f and -F
are specified, the config file will be read and converted to
config directory format and written to the specified
directory. If neither option is specified, an attempt to
read the default config directory will be made before trying
to use the default config file. If a valid config directory
exists then the default config file is ignored.</p>

<p>-o option[=value] Specify an option with a(n optional)
value. Possible generic options/values are:</p>

<p>syslog=&lt;subsystems&gt; (see -s in slapd(8))
syslog-level=&lt;level&gt; (see -S in slapd(8))
syslog-user=&lt;user&gt; (see -l in slapd(8))</p>

<p>Possible options/values specific to slapacl are:</p>

<p>authzDN domain peername sasl_ssf sockname sockurl ssf
tls_ssf transport_ssf</p>

<p>See the related fields in slapd.access(5) for
details.</p>

<p>-u do not fetch the entry from the database. In this
case, if the entry does not exist, a fake entry with the DN
given with the -b option is used, with no attributes. As a
consequence, those rules that depend on the contents of the
target object will not behave as with the real object. The
DN given with the -b option is still used to select what
rules apply; thus, it must be in the naming context of a
configured database. See also -b.</p>

<p>-U authcID specify an ID to be mapped to a DN as by
means of authz-regexp or authz-rewrite rules (see
slapd.conf(5) for details); mutually exclusive with -D.</p>

<p>-v enable verbose mode.</p>

<p>-X authzID specify an authorization ID to be mapped to a
DN as by means of authz-regexp or authz-rewrite rules (see
slapd.conf(5) for details); mutually exclusive with -o
authzDN=DN.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The command</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/slapacl -f /etc/openldap/slapd.conf -v -U
bjorn -b &quot;o=University of Michigan,c=US&quot;
&quot;o/read:University of Michigan&quot;</p>

<p>tests whether the user bjorn can access the attribute o
of the entry o=University of Michigan,c=US at read
level.</p>
