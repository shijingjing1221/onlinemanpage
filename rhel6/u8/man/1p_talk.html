<p>TALK(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TALK(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME talk - talk to another user</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS talk address [terminal]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The talk utility is a two-way,
screen-oriented communication program.</p>

<p>When first invoked, talk shall send a message similar
to:</p>

<p>Message from &lt;unspecified string&gt; talk: connection
requested by your_addresstalk: respond with: talk
your_address</p>

<p>to the specified address. At this point, the recipient
of the message can reply by typing:</p>

<p>talk your_address</p>

<p>Once communication is established, the two parties can
type simultane- ously, with their output displayed in
separate regions of the screen. Characters shall be
processed as follows:</p>

<p>* Typing the alert character shall alert the recipient s
terminal.</p>

<p>* Typing &lt;control&gt;-L shall cause the senders
screen regions to be refreshed.</p>

<p>* Typing the erase and kill characters shall affect the
senders ter- minal in the manner described by the termios
interface in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 11, General Ter- minal Interface.</p>

<p>* Typing the interrupt or end-of-file characters shall
terminate the local talk utility. Once the talk session has
been terminated on one side, the other side of the talk
session shall be notified that the talk session has been
terminated and shall be able to do nothing except exit.</p>

<p>* Typing characters from LC_CTYPE classifications print
or space shall cause those characters to be sent to the
recipient s terminal.</p>

<p>* When and only when the stty iexten local mode is
enabled, the exis- tence and processing of additional
special control characters and multi-byte or single-byte
functions shall be implementation-defined.</p>

<p>* Typing other non-printable characters shall cause
implementation- defined sequences of printable characters to
be sent to the recipients terminal.</p>

<p>Permission to be a recipient of a talk message can be
denied or granted by use of the mesg utility. However, a
users privilege may further constrain the domain of
accessibility of other users terminals. The talk utility
shall fail when the user lacks the appropriate privileges to
perform the requested action.</p>

<p>Certain block-mode terminals do not have all the
capabilities necessary to support the simultaneous exchange
of messages required for talk. When this type of exchange
cannot be supported on such terminals, the implementation
may support an exchange with reduced levels of simulta-
neous interaction or it may report an error describing the
terminal- related deficiency.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>address The recipient of the talk session. One form of
address is the &lt;user name&gt;, as returned by the who
utility. Other address for- mats and how they are handled
are unspecified.</p>

<p>terminal If the recipient is logged in more than once,
the terminal argu- ment can be used to indicate the
appropriate terminal name. If terminal is not specified, the
talk message shall be displayed on one or more accessible
terminals in use by the recipient. The format of terminal
shall be the same as that returned by the who utility.</p>

<p>STDIN Characters read from standard input shall be
copied to the recipients terminal in an unspecified manner.
If standard input is not a terminal, talk shall write a
diagnostic message and exit with a non-zero status.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of talk:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files). If the recipients locale does not use an
LC_CTYPE equivalent to the senders, the results are
undefined.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>TERM Determine the name of the invokers terminal type.
If this vari- able is unset or null, an unspecified default
terminal type shall be used.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS When the talk utility receives a
SIGINT signal, the utility shall ter- minate and exit with a
zero status. It shall take the standard action for all other
signals.</p>

<p>STDOUT If standard output is a terminal, characters
copied from the recipi- ents standard input may be written
to standard output. Standard out- put also may be used for
diagnostic messages. If standard output is not a terminal,
talk shall exit with a non-zero status.</p>

<p>STDERR None.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred or talk was invoked on a
terminal incapable of supporting it.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Because the handling of non-printable,
non- &lt;space&gt;s is tied to the stty description of
iexten, implementation extensions within the termi- nal
driver can be accessed. For example, some implementations
provide line editing functions with certain control
character sequences.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The write utility was included in this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 since it can be implemented on all
terminal types. The talk utility, which cannot be
implemented on certain terminals, was considered to be a
&quot;better&quot; communications interface. Both of these
programs are in widespread use on historical
implementations. Therefore, both utili- ties have been
specified.</p>

<p>All references to networking abilities (talking to a
user on another system) were removed as being outside the
scope of this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>Historical BSD and System V versions of talk terminate
both of the con- versations when either user breaks out of
the session. This can lead to adverse consequences if a user
unwittingly continues to enter text that is interpreted by
the shell when the other terminates the session. Therefore,
the version of talk specified by this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 requires both users to terminate their end of
the session explicitly.</p>

<p>Only messages sent to the terminal of the invoking user
can be interna- tionalized in any way:</p>

<p>* The original &quot;Message from &lt;unspecified
string&gt; ...&quot; message sent to the terminal of the
recipient cannot be internationalized because the
environment of the recipient is as yet inaccessible to the
talk utility. The environment of the invoking party is
irrelevant.</p>

<p>* Subsequent communication between the two parties
cannot be interna- tionalized because the two parties may
specify different languages in their environment (and
non-portable characters cannot be mapped from one language
to another).</p>

<p>* Neither party can be required to communicate in a
language other than C and/or the one specified by their
environment because unavailable terminal hardware support
(for example, fonts) may be required.</p>

<p>The text in the STDOUT section reflects the usage of the
verb &quot;display&quot; in this section; some talk
implementations actually use standard output to write to the
terminal, but this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not
require that to be the case.</p>

<p>The format of the terminal name is unspecified, but the
descriptions of ps, talk, who, and write require that they
all use or accept the same format.</p>

<p>The handling of non-printable characters is partially
implementation- defined because the details of mapping them
to printable sequences is not needed by the user. Historical
implementations, for security rea- sons, disallow the
transmission of non-printable characters that may send
commands to the other terminal.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
