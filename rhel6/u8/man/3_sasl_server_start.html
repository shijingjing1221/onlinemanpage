<p>NAME sasl_server_start - Begin an authentication
negotiation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sasl/sasl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sasl_server_start(sasl_conn_t * conn, const char *
mech, const char * clientin, unsigned * clientinlen, const
char ** serverout, unsigned * serveroutlen);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sasl_server_start() begins the
authentication with the mechanism speci- fied with mech.
This fails if the mechanism is not supported. SASL_OK is
returned if the authentication is complete and the user is
authenti- cated. SASL_CONTINUE is returned if one or more
steps are still required in the authentication. All other
return values indicate fail- ure.</p>

<p>conn is the SASL context for this connection</p>

<p>mech is the mechanism name that the client requested</p>

<p>clientin is the client initial response, NULL if the
protocol lacks support for client-send-first or if the other
end did not have an ini- tial send. Note that no initial
client send is distinct from an ini- tial send of a null
string, and the protocol MUST account for this dif-
ference.</p>

<p>clientinlen is the length of initial response</p>

<p>serverout is created by the plugin library. It is the
initial server response to send to the client. This is
allocated/freed by the library and it is the job of the
client to send it over the network to the server. Also
protocol specific encoding (such as base64 encoding) must
needs to be done by the server.</p>

<p>serveroutlen is set to the length of initial server
challenge</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE sasl_server_start returns an integer which
corresponds to one of the SASL errorcodes. SASL_OK indicates
that authentication is completed successfully. SASL_CONTINUE
indicates success and that there are more steps needed in
the authentication. All other return codes indicate errors
and should either be handled or the authentication session
should be quit.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO RFC 2222</p>
