<p>sane-test(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-test(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-test - SANE backend for testing frontends</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-test library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) back- end that allows testing the
SANE installation and SANE frontends. It provides access to
a (nearly) unlimited number of virtual devices. There is no
support for real scanners or cameras. However, the backend
simulates scanning and setting options.</p>

<p>The idea is not only to find bugs in frontends but also
to show all capabilities of SANE. Therefore sane-test
implements functions and options that are not (or seldom)
found in other backends.</p>

<p>The backend is commented out in /etc/sane.d/dll.conf, so
either the comment character must be removed or the backend
must be called explic- itly. E.g. scanimage -d test or
xscanimage test.</p>

<p>SCAN MODE OPTIONS Option mode selects the scan mode
(Gray or Color).</p>

<p>Option depth determines the number of bits per sample
(1. 8, or 16). Keep in mind, that this value refers to the
sample, not the pixel. So depth=16 results in 48 bits per
pixel in color mode. The most usual combinations are
mode=Gray, depth=1 for lineart, mode=Gray, depth=8 for gray
and mode=Color, depth=8 for color mode. The combination of
color and 1-bit mode is quite obscure (8 colors) but allowed
in the SANE standard. However, the meaning of bits is not
defined. Currently 1 = high intensity and 0 = low intensity
is used.</p>

<p>Setting option hand-scanner results in the test-backend
behaving like a hand-scanner. Hand-scanners do not know the
image height a priori. Instead, they return a height of -1.
Setting this option allows to test whether a frontend can
handle this correctly. This option also enables a fixed
width of 11 cm.</p>

<p>Setting option three-pass simulates a three-pass
scanner. Older color scanners needed to scan the image once
per color (reg/green/blue) to get the full image. Therefore,
in this mode three single frames are transmitted in color
mode.</p>

<p>Option three-pass-order provides support for changing
the order of the three frames (see option three-pass above).
A frontend should support all orders.</p>

<p>Option resolution sets the resolution of the image in
dots per inch.</p>

<p>Option source can be used to simulate an Automatic
Document Feeder (ADF). After 10 scans, the ADF will be
&quot;empty&quot;.</p>

<p>SPECIAL OPTIONS Option test-picture allows to set the
image thats returned to the frontend. While &quot;Solid
white&quot; and &quot;Solid black&quot; are quite obvious,
the other options need some more explanation. Color patterns
are used to determine if all modes and their colors are
represented correctly by the frontend. The grid should look
like the same in every mode and resolution. A table of all
the test pictures can be found at:
http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/test-backend/test-pictures.html.</p>

<p>If option invert-endianess is set, the upper and lower
bytes of image data in 16 bit modes are exchanged. This
option can be used to test the 16 bit modes of frontends,
e.g. if the frontend uses the correct endianess.</p>

<p>If option read-limit is set, the maximum amount of data
transferred with each call to sane_read() is limited.</p>

<p>Option read-limit-size sets the limit for option
read-limit. A low limit slows down scanning. It can be used
to detect errors in frontend that occur because of wrong
assumptions on the size of the buffer or timing
problems.</p>

<p>Option read-delay enables delaying data to the
frontend.</p>

<p>Option read-delay-duration selects the number of
microseconds the back- ends waits after each transfer of a
buffer. This option is useful to find timing-related bugs,
especially if used over the network.</p>

<p>If option read-return-value is different from
&quot;Default&quot;, the selected status will be returned by
every call to sane_read(). This is useful to test the
frontends handling of the SANE statii.</p>

<p>If option ppl-loss is different from 0, it determines
the number of pixels that are &quot;lost&quot; at the end of
each line. That means, lines are padded with unused
data.</p>

<p>Option fuzzy-parameters selects that fuzzy (inexact)
parameters are returned as long as the scan hasnt been
started. This option can be used to test if the frontend
uses the parameters it got before the start of the scan
(which it shouldnt).</p>

<p>Option non-blocking determines if non-blocking IO for
sane_read() should be used if supported by the frontend.</p>

<p>If option select-fd is set, the backend offers a select
filedescriptor for detecting if sane_read() will return
data.</p>

<p>If option enable-test-options is set, a fairly big list
of options for testing the various SANE option types is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option print-options can be used to print a list of all
options to standard error.</p>

<p>GEOMETRY OPTIONS Option tl-x determines the top-left x
position of the scan area.</p>

<p>Option tl-y determines the top-left y position of the
scan area.</p>

<p>Option br-x determines the bottom-right x position of
the scan area.</p>

<p>Option br-y determines the bottom-right y position of
the scan area.</p>

<p>BOOL TEST OPTIONS There are 6 bool test options in
total. Each option is numbered. (3/6) means: this is option
3 of 6. The numbering scheme is intended for easier
detection of options not displayed by the frontend (because
of missing support or bugs).</p>

<p>Option bool-soft-select-soft-detect (1/6) is a bool test
option that has soft select and soft detect (and advanced)
capabilities. Thats just a normal bool option.</p>

<p>Option bool-hard-select-soft-detect (2/6) is a bool test
option that has hard select and soft detect (and advanced)
capabilities. That means the option cant be set by the
frontend but by the user (e.g. by pressing a button at the
device).</p>

<p>Option bool-hard-select (3/6) is a bool test option that
has hard select (and advanced) capabilities. That means the
option cant be set by the frontend but by the user (e.g. by
pressing a button at the device) and cant be read by the
frontend.</p>

<p>Option bool-soft-detect (4/6) is a bool test option that
has soft detect (and advanced) capabilities. That means the
option is read- only.</p>

<p>Option bool-soft-select-soft-detect-emulated (5/6) is a
Bool test option that has soft select, soft detect, and
emulated (and advanced) capabilities.</p>

<p>Option bool-soft-select-soft-detect-auto (6/6) is a Bool
test option that has soft select, soft detect, and automatic
(and advanced) capa- bilities. This option can be
automatically set by the backend.</p>

<p>INT TEST OPTIONS There are 6 int test options in
total.</p>

<p>Option int (1/6) is an int test option with no unit and
no constraint set.</p>

<p>Option int-constraint-range (2/6) is an int test option
with unit pixel and constraint range set. Minimum is 4,
maximum 192, and quant is 2.</p>

<p>Option int-constraint-word-list (3/6) is an int test
option with unit bits and constraint word list set.</p>

<p>Option int-constraint-array (4/6) is an int test option
with unit mm and using an array without constraints.</p>

<p>Option int-constraint-array-constraint-range (5/6) is an
int test option with unit mm and using an array with a range
constraint. Mini- mum is 4, maximum 192, and quant is 2.</p>

<p>Option int-constraint-array-constraint-word-list (6/6)
is an int test option with unit percent and using an array a
word list constraint.</p>

<p>FIXED TEST OPTIONS There are 3 fixed test options in
total.</p>

<p>Option fixed (1/3) is a fixed test option with no unit
and no con- straint set.</p>

<p>Option fixed-constraint-range (2/3) is a fixed test
option with unit microsecond and constraint range set.
Minimum is -42.17, maximum 32767.9999, and quant is 2.0.</p>

<p>Option fixed-constraint-word-list (3/3) is a Fixed test
option with no unit and constraint word list set.</p>

<p>STRING TEST OPTIONS There are 3 string test options in
total.</p>

<p>Option string (1/3) is a string test option without
constraint.</p>

<p>Option string-constraint-string-list (2/3) is a string
test option with string list constraint.</p>

<p>Option string-constraint-long-string-list (3/3) is a
string test option with string list constraint. Contains
some more entries...</p>

<p>BUTTON TEST OPTION Option button (1/1) is a Button test
option. Prints some text...</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/test.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below). The
initial values of most of the basic SANE options can be
configured in this file. A template contain- ing all the
default values is provided together with this back- end. One
of the more interesting values may be num- ber_of_devices.
It can be used to check the frontends ability to show a long
list of devices. The config values concerning resolution and
geometry can be useful to test the handling of big file
sizes.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-test.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-test.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_TEST If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. Higher debug levels increase
the verbosity of the output.</p>

<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_TEST=4</p>
