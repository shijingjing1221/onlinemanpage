<p>NAME weave - translate WEB to TeX</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS weave [ -x ] webfile[.web] [ changefile[.ch]
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>The weave program is used to create a TeX file for
viewing a Web pro- gram. It takes appropriate care of
typographic details like page lay- out and the use of
indentation, italics, boldface, etc., and it sup- plies
extensive cross-index information that it gathers
automatically. The command line arguments are the same as
for tangle except for the option: -x says to omit the index,
module name list, and table of con- tents pages. (A
CONTENTS.tex file will still be written when the TeX file is
processed, however, unless some macros in webmac.tex are
rede- fined.)</p>

<p>The output TeX file name is formed by adding .tex to the
root of the Web file name.</p>

<p>There are several macros that probably should be
redefined by the pro- grammer at the beginning of the Web
file. It is a good idea to set itle to the name of the
program. And, to cause output of only changed modules, one
can say ybe=iffalse (usually as the first change in the
change file).</p>

used by weave output.</p>
