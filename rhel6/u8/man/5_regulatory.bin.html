<p>NAME regulatory.bin - The Linux wireless regulatory
database</p>

<p>Description regulatory.bin is the file used by the Linux
wireless subsystem to keep its regulatory database
information. It is read by crda upon the Linux kernels
request for regulatory information for a specific ISO / IEC
3166 alpha2 country code. The regulatory database is kept in
a small binary format for size and code efficiency. The
regulatory.bin file can be parsed and read in human format
by using the regdbdump command. The regulatory.bin file
should be updated upon regulatory changes or cor-
rections.</p>

<p>Upkeeping The regulatory database is maintained by the
community as such you are encouraged to send any corrections
or updates to the linux-wireless mailing list:
linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org</p>
