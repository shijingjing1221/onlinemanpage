<p>NAME iprofd - Modem-register daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS iprofd registerfile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION iprofd is used to make the modem-register
settings of the isdn-ttys AT- emulator permanent and restore
them during boot-time. It is usually started from within a
rc-script and puts itself into background. If registerfile
already exists at startup, all modem-registers are restored
from its contents. After that, iprofd waits for getting a
signal from the isdn-subsystem. Every time, a AT&amp;W0
command is given at an isdn-tty the isdn-subsystem sends a
SIGIO and iprofd reads the current settings of the
modem-registers and stores them into register- file.</p>
