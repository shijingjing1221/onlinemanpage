<p>XkbAddGeomRow(3) XKB FUNCTIONS XkbAddGeomRow(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbAddGeomRow - Add a row to a section</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS XkbRowPtr XkbAddGeomRow (XkbSectionPtr section,
int sz_keys);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - section section to be updated</p>

<p>- sz_keys number of keys to be reserved</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkb provides functions to add a single new
element to the top-level keyboard geometry. In each case the
num_ * fields of the corresponding structure is incremented
by 1. These functions do not change sz_* unless there is no
more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the
values of the element s structure from the arguments. For
other functions, you must explicitly write code to fill the
structures ele- ments.</p>

<p>The top-level geometry description includes a list of
geometry proper- ties. A geometry property associates an
arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary name. Programs
that display images of keyboards can use geometry properties
as hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other
geometry structures refer to geometry properties.</p>

<p>One of the components of a keyboard geometry section is
one or more rows of keys. XkbAddGeomRow adds one row to the
specified section. The newly created row contains space for
the number of keys specified in sz_keys. They are allocated
and zeroed, but otherwise uninitial- ized. XkbAddGeomRow
returns NULL if any of the parameters is empty or if it was
not able to allocate space for the row. To allocate space
for an arbitrary number of rows to a section, use the
XkbAllocGeomRows function.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES typedef struct _XkbRow { short top; short
left; unsigned short num_keys; unsigned short sz_keys; int
vertical; XkbKeyPtr keys; XkbBoundsRec bounds; } XkbRowRec,
*XkbRowPtr;</p>
