<p>NAME sasl_decode - Decode data received</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sasl/sasl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sasl_decode(sasl_conn_t *conn, const char * input,
unsigned inputlen, const char ** output, unsigned *
outputlen);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sasl_decode decodes data received. After
successful authentication this function should be called on
all data received. It decodes the data from encrypted or
signed form to plain data. If there was no security layer
negotiated the output is identical to the input.</p>

<p>output contains the decoded data and is allocated/freed
by the library.</p>

<p>One should not to give sasl_decode more data than the
negotiated maxbufsize (see sasl_getprop).</p>

<p>Note that sasl_decode can succeed and outputlen can be
zero. If this is the case simply wait for more data and call
sasl_decode again.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns SASL_OK on success. See
sasl_errors(3) for meanings of other return codes.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO RFC 2222</p>
