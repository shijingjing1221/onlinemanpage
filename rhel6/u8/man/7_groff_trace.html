<p>GROFF_TRACE(7) GROFF_TRACE(7)</p>

<p>NAME groff_trace - groff macro package trace.tmac</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groff -m trace [options...] [files...]</p>

<p>Elements in brackets denote optional arguments, and the
ellipsis means that there can be any number of arguments of
this kind.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The trace macro package of groff(1) can be a
valuable tool for debug- ging documents written in the roff
formatting language. A call stack trace is protocolled on
standard error, that means, a diagnostic mes- sage is
emitted on entering and exiting of a macro call. This
greatly eases to track down an error in some macro.</p>

<p>This tracing process is activated by specifying the
groff or troff com- mand line option -m trace. This works
also with the groffer(1) viewer program. A finer control can
be obtained by including the macro file within the document
by the groff macro call .mso trace.tmac. Only macros that
are defined after this line are traced.</p>

<p>If some other macro package should be traced as well it
must be speci- fied after -m trace on the command line.</p>

<p>The macro file trace.tmac is unusual because it does not
contain any macros to be called by a user. Instead, the
existing macro definition and appending facilities are
modified such that they display diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES In the following examples, a roff fragment is
fed into groff via stan- dard input. As we are only
interested in the diagnostic messages (standard error) on
the terminal, the normal formatted output (standard output)
is redirected into the nirvana device /dev/null. The
resulting diagnostic messages are displayed directly below
the corresponding example.</p>

<p>Command line option sh# echo . &gt; .de test_macro &gt;
.. &gt; .test_macro &gt; .test_macro some dummy arguments
&gt; | groff -m trace &gt;/dev/null</p>

<p>*** de trace enter: test_macro *** trace exit:
test_macro *** de trace enter: test_macro &quot;some&quot;
&quot;dummy&quot; &quot;arguments&quot; *** trace exit:
test_macro &quot;some&quot; &quot;dummy&quot;
&quot;arguments&quot;</p>

<p>The entry and the exit of each macro call is displayed
on the terminal (standard output) together with the
arguments (if any).</p>

<p>Nested macro calls sh# echo . &gt; .de child &gt; ..
&gt; .de parent &gt; .child &gt; .. &gt; .parent &gt; |
groff -m trace &gt;/dev/null</p>

<p>*** de trace enter: parent *** de trace enter: child ***
trace exit: child *** trace exit: parent</p>

<p>This shows that macro calls can be nested. This powerful
feature can help to tack down quite complex call stacks.</p>

<p>Activating with .mso sh# echo . &gt; .de before &gt; ..
&gt; .mso trace.tmac &gt; .de after &gt; .. &gt; .before
&gt; .after &gt; .before &gt; | groff &gt;/dev/null</p>

<p>*** de trace enter: after *** trace exit: after</p>

<p>Here, the tracing is activated within the document, not
by a command line option. As tracing was not active when
macro before was defined, no call of this macro is
protocolled; on the other hand, the macro af- ter is fully
protocolled.</p>

<p>FILES The trace macros are kept in the file trace.tmac
located in the tmac directory; see groff_tmac(5) for
details.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT $GROFF_TMAC_PATH A colon-separated list of
additional tmac directories in which to search for macro
files; see groff_tmac(5) for details.</p>
