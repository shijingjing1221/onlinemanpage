<p>SEM_UNLINK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SEM_UNLINK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sem_unlink - remove a named semaphore
(REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;semaphore.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sem_unlink(const char *name);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sem_unlink() function shall remove the
semaphore named by the string name. If the semaphore named
by name is currently referenced by other processes, then
sem_unlink() shall have no effect on the state of the
semaphore. If one or more processes have the semaphore open
when sem_unlink() is called, destruction of the semaphore is
postponed until all references to the semaphore have been
destroyed by calls to sem_close(), _exit(), or exec. Calls
to sem_open() to recreate or reconnect to the semaphore
refer to a new semaphore after sem_unlink() is called. The
sem_unlink() call shall not block until all references have
been destroyed; it shall return immediately.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
sem_unlink() function shall return a value of 0. Otherwise,
the semaphore shall not be changed and the func- tion shall
return a value of -1 and set errno to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sem_unlink() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Permission is denied to unlink the named
semaphore.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the name argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT The named semaphore does not exist.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The sem_unlink() function is part of
the Semaphores option and need not be available on all
implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
