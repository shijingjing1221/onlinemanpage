<p>NAME float.h - floating types</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;float.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The characteristics of floating types are
defined in terms of a model that describes a representation
of floating-point numbers and values that provide
information about an implementation s floating-point
arithmetic.</p>

<p>The following parameters are used to define the model
for each float- ing-point type:</p>

<p>s Sign (&plusmn;1).</p>

<p>b Base or radix of exponent representation (an integer
&gt;1).</p>

<p>e Exponent (an integer between a minimum e_min and a
maximum e_max).</p>

<p>p Precision (the number of base-b digits in the
significand).</p>

<p>f_k Non-negative integers less than b (the significand
digits).</p>

<p>A floating-point number x is defined by the following
model:</p>

<p>In addition to normalized floating-point numbers
(f_1&gt;0 if x!=0), floating types may be able to contain
other kinds of floating-point numbers, such as subnormal
floating-point numbers ( x!=0, e= e_min, f_1=0) and
unnormalized floating-point numbers ( x!=0, e&gt; e_min,
f_1=0), and values that are not floating-point numbers, such
as infini- ties and NaNs. A NaN is an encoding signifying
Not-a-Number. A quiet NaN propagates through almost every
arithmetic operation without rais- ing a floating-point
exception; a signaling NaN generally raises a floating-point
exception when occurring as an arithmetic operand.</p>

<p>The accuracy of the floating-point operations (,, , / )
and of the library functions in &lt;math.h&gt; and
&lt;complex.h&gt; that return floating-point results is
implementation-defined. The implementation may state that
the accuracy is unknown.</p>

<p>All integer values in the &lt;float.h&gt; header, except
FLT_ROUNDS, shall be constant expressions suitable for use
in #if preprocessing directives; all floating values shall
be constant expressions. All except DECI- MAL_DIG,
FLT_EVAL_METHOD, FLT_RADIX, and FLT_ROUNDS have separate
names for all three floating-point types. The floating-point
model represen- tation is provided for all values except
FLT_EVAL_METHOD and FLT_ROUNDS.</p>

<p>The rounding mode for floating-point addition is
characterized by the implementation-defined value of
FLT_ROUNDS:</p>

<p>-1 Indeterminable.</p>

<p>0 Toward zero.</p>

<p>1 To nearest.</p>

<p>2 Toward positive infinity.</p>

<p>3 Toward negative infinity.</p>

<p>All other values for FLT_ROUNDS characterize
implementation-defined rounding behavior.</p>

<p>The values of operations with floating operands and
values subject to the usual arithmetic conversions and of
floating constants are evalu- ated to a format whose range
and precision may be greater than required by the type. The
use of evaluation formats is characterized by the
implementation-defined value of FLT_EVAL_METHOD:</p>

<p>-1 Indeterminable.</p>

<p>0 Evaluate all operations and constants just to the
range and pre- cision of the type.</p>

<p>1 Evaluate operations and constants of type float and
double to the range and precision of the double type;
evaluate long double operations and constants to the range
and precision of the long double type.</p>

<p>2 Evaluate all operations and constants to the range and
precision of the long double type.</p>

<p>All other negative values for FLT_EVAL_METHOD
characterize implementa- tion-defined behavior.</p>

<p>The values given in the following list shall be defined
as constant expressions with implementation-defined values
that are greater or equal in magnitude (absolute value) to
those shown, with the same sign.</p>
