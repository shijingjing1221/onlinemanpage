<p>ACL_COPY_EXT(3) BSD Library Functions Manual
ACL_COPY_EXT(3)</p>

<p>NAME acl_copy_ext - copy an ACL from internal to
external representation</p>

<p>LIBRARY Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl,
-lacl).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/acl.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t acl_copy_ext(void *buf_p, acl_t acl, ssize_t
size);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The acl_copy_ext() function copies the ACL
pointed to by acl from system- managed space to the user
managed space pointed to by buf_p. The size parameter
represents the size in bytes of the buffer pointed to by
buf_p. The format of the ACL placed in the buffer pointed to
by buf_p is a con- tiguous, persistent data item, the format
of which is unspecified. It is the responsibility of the
invoker to allocate an area large enough to hold the copied
ACL. The size of the exportable, contiguous, persistent form
of the ACL may be obtained by invoking the acl_size()
function.</p>

<p>Any ACL entry descriptors that refer to an entry in the
ACL referenced by acl continue to refer to those entries.
Any existing ACL pointers that refer to the ACL referenced
by acl continue to refer to the ACL.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon success, this function returns the
number of bytes placed in the buffer pointed to by buf_p. On
error, a value of (ssize_t)-1 is returned and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS If any of the following conditions occur, the
acl_copy_ext() function returns a value of (ssize_t)-1 and
sets errno to the corresponding value:</p>

<p>[EINVAL] The size parameter is zero or negative.</p>

<p>The argument acl is not a valid pointer to an ACL.</p>

<p>The ACL referenced by acl contains one or more improp-
erly formed ACL entries, or for some other reason can- not
be translated into the external form of an ACL.</p>

<p>[ERANGE] The size parameter is greater than zero but
smaller than the length of the contiguous, persistent form
of the ACL.</p>

abandoned)</p>
