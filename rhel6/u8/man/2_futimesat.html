<p>FUTIMESAT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual FUTIMESAT(2)</p>

<p>NAME futimesat - change timestamps of a file relative to
a directory file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _ATFILE_SOURCE #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
/* Definition of AT_* constants */</p>

<p>int futimesat(int dirfd, const char *pathname, const
struct timeval times[2]);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This system call is obsolete. Use
utimensat(2) instead.</p>

<p>The futimesat() system call operates in exactly the same
way as utimes(2), except for the differences described in
this manual page.</p>

<p>If the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it
is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the
file descriptor dirfd (rather than relative to the current
working directory of the calling process, as is done by
utimes(2) for a relative pathname).</p>

<p>If pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value
AT_FDCWD, then pathname is interpreted relative to the
current working directory of the calling process (like
utimes(2)).</p>

<p>If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, futimesat() returns a 0. On
error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The same errors that occur for utimes(2) can also
occur for futime- sat(). The following additional errors can
occur for futimesat():</p>

<p>EBADF dirfd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR pathname is relative and dirfd is a file
descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.</p>

<p>VERSIONS futimesat() was added to Linux in kernel
2.6.16.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is non-standard. It was
implemented from a specifica- tion that was proposed for
POSIX.1, but that specification was replaced by the one for
utimensat(2).</p>

<p>A similar system call exists on Solaris.</p>

<p>NOTES Glibc Notes If pathname is NULL, then the glibc
futimesat() wrapper function updates the times for the file
referred to by dirfd.</p>
