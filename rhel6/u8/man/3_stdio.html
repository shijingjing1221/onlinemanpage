<p>NAME stdio - standard input/output library functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>FILE *stdin; FILE *stdout; FILE *stderr;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The standard I/O library provides a simple
and efficient buffered stream I/O interface. Input and
output is mapped into logical data streams and the physical
I/O characteristics are concealed. The func- tions and
macros are listed below; more information is available from
the individual man pages.</p>

<p>A stream is associated with an external file (which may
be a physical device) by opening a file, which may involve
creating a new file. Cre- ating an existing file causes its
former contents to be discarded. If a file can support
positioning requests (such as a disk file, as opposed to a
terminal) then a file position indicator associated with the
stream is positioned at the start of the file (byte zero),
unless the file is opened with append mode. If append mode
is used, it is unspecified whether the position indicator
will be placed at the start or the end of the file. The
position indicator is maintained by subse- quent reads,
writes and positioning requests. All input occurs as if the
characters were read by successive calls to the fgetc(3)
function; all output takes place as if all characters were
written by successive calls to the fputc(3) function.</p>

<p>A file is disassociated from a stream by closing the
file. Output streams are flushed (any unwritten buffer
contents are transferred to the host environment) before the
stream is disassociated from the file. The value of a
pointer to a FILE object is indeterminate after a file is
closed (garbage).</p>

<p>A file may be subsequently reopened, by the same or
another program execution, and its contents reclaimed or
modified (if it can be reposi- tioned at the start). If the
main function returns to its original caller, or the exit(3)
function is called, all open files are closed (hence all
output streams are flushed) before program termination.
Other methods of program termination, such as abort(3) do
not bother about closing files properly.</p>

<p>At program startup, three text streams are predefined
and need not be opened explicitly standard input (for
reading conventional input), standard output (for writing
conventional input), and standard error (for writing
diagnostic output). These streams are abbreviated
stdin,stdout and stderr. When opened, the standard error
stream is not fully buffered; the standard input and output
streams are fully buffered if and only if the streams do not
to refer to an interactive device.</p>

<p>Output streams that refer to terminal devices are always
line buffered by default; pending output to such streams is
written automatically whenever an input stream that refers
to a terminal device is read. In cases where a large amount
of computation is done after printing part of a line on an
output terminal, it is necessary to fflush(3) the stan- dard
output before going off and computing so that the output
will appear.</p>

<p>The stdio library is a part of the library libc and
routines are auto- matically loaded as needed by the
compilers cc(1) and pc(1). The SYN- OPSIS sections of the
following manual pages indicate which include files are to
be used, what the compiler declaration for the function
looks like and which external variables are of interest.</p>

<p>The following are defined as macros; these names may not
be re-used without first removing their current definitions
with #undef: BUFSIZ, EOF, FILENAME_MAX, FOPEN_MAX,
L_cuserid, L_ctermid, L_tmpnam, NULL, SEEK_END, SEEK_SET,
SEEK_CUR, TMP_MAX, clearerr, feof, ferror, fileno, getc,
getchar, putc, putchar, stderr, stdin, stdout. Function
versions of the macro functions feof, ferror, clearerr,
fileno, getc, getchar, putc, and putchar exist and will be
used if the macros definitions are explicitly removed.</p>
