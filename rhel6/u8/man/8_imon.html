<p>NAME imon - watch ISDN activities</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS imon [ -q] [-p phonebook]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION imon is a ncurses based utility for watching
ISDN activity.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -q If this option is given, the facility of
terminatig the program by pressing Q is disabled and the
signals SIGHUP and SIGINT are caught. This option is
intended for starting imon from within an rc script with
redirecting input/output to some otherwise unused virtual
console at boot time.</p>

<p>-p phonebook is used to supply imon with a phonebook
file. The format of a phonebook file is very simple: Every
line has two elements sepa- rated by a TAB. The first
element is a phone number which can contain wildcards. The
second element is a descriptive string. For each active
connection, this string is shown instead the phone number.
Pressing S toggles between display of strings and phone
numbers. Pressing R rereads the phonebook file in case of
changes during program execution.</p>
