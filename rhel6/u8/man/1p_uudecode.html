<p>UUDECODE(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UUDECODE(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME uudecode - decode a binary file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS uudecode [-o outfile][file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The uudecode utility shall read a file, or
standard input if no file is specified, that includes data
created by the uuencode utility. The uudecode utility shall
scan the input file, searching for data compati- ble with
one of the formats specified in uuencode, and attempt to
cre- ate or overwrite the file described by the data (or
overridden by the -o option). The pathname shall be
contained in the data or specified by the -o option. The
file access permission bits and contents for the file to be
produced shall be contained in that data. The mode bits of
the created file (other than standard output) shall be set
from the file access permission bits contained in the data;
that is, other attributes of the mode, including the file
mode creation mask (see umask()), shall not affect the file
being produced.</p>

<p>If the pathname of the file to be produced exists, and
the user does not have write permission on that file,
uudecode shall terminate with an error. If the pathname of
the file to be produced exists, and the user has write
permission on that file, the existing file shall be
overwritten.</p>

<p>If the input data was produced by uuencode on a system
with a different number of bits per byte than on the target
system, the results of uude- code are unspecified.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The uudecode utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported by the
implementation:</p>

<p>-o outfile A pathname of a file that shall be used
instead of any pathname contained in the input data.
Specifying an outfile option-argu- ment of /dev/stdout shall
indicate standard output.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file The pathname of a file containing the output of
uuencode.</p>

<p>STDIN See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be files containing
the output of uuencode.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of uude- code:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If the file data header encoded by uuencode is -
or /dev/stdout, or the -o /dev/stdout option overrides the
file data, the standard output shall be in the same format
as the file originally encoded by uuencode. Otherwise, the
standard output shall not be used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES The output file shall be in the same format
as the file originally encoded by uuencode.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The user who is invoking uudecode must
have write permission on any file being created.</p>

<p>The output of uuencode is essentially an encoded bit
stream that is not cognizant of byte boundaries. It is
possible that a 9-bit byte target machine can process input
from an 8-bit source, if it is aware of the requirement, but
the reverse is unlikely to be satisfying. Of course, the
only data that is meaningful for such a transfer between
architec- tures is generally character data.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Input files are not necessarily text files, as
stated by an early pro- posal. Although the uuencode output
is a text file, that output could have been wrapped within
another file or mail message that is not a text file.</p>

<p>The -o option is not historical practice, but was added
at the request of WG15 so that the user could override the
target pathname without having to edit the input data
itself.</p>

<p>In early drafts, the [ -o outfile] option-argument
allowed the use of - to mean standard output. The symbol -
has only been used previously in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 as a
standard input indicator. The developers of the standard did
not wish to overload the meaning of - in this manner. The
/dev/stdout concept exists on most modern systems. The
/dev/stdout syntax does not refer to a new special file. It
is just a magic cookie to specify standard output.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
