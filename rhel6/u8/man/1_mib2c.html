<p>MIB2C(1) Net-SNMP MIB2C(1)</p>

<p>NAME mib2c -- generate template code for extending the
agent</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mib2c [-h] -c CONFIGFILE [-I PATH] [-f OUTNAME]
[-i][q][-S VAR=VAL] MIBNODE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mib2c tool is designed to take a portion
of the MIB tree (as defined by a MIB file) and generate the
template C code necessary to implement the relevant
management objects within it.</p>

<p>In order to implement a new MIB module, three files are
necessary:</p>

<p>- MIB definition file - C header file - C implementation
file.</p>

<p>The mib2c tool uses the MIB definition file to produce
the two C code files. Thus, mib2c generates a template that
you can edit to add logic necessary to obtain information
from the operating system or applica- tion to complete the
module.</p>

<p>MIBNODE is the top level mib node you want to generate
code for. You must give mib2c a mib node (e.g. ifTable) on
the command line, not a mib file. This is the single most
common mistake.</p>

<p>The mib2c tool accepts both SMIv1 and SMIv2 MIBs.</p>

<p>mib2c needs to be able to find and load a MIB file in
order to generate C code for the MIB. To enable mib2c to
find the MIB file, set the MIBS environment variable to
include the MIB file you are using. An example of setting
this environment variable is:</p>

<p>MIBS=+NET-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>MIBS=ALL</p>

<p>The first example ensures that mib2c finds the
NET-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB mib, in addition to the default MIB
modules. The default list of MIB modules is set when the
suite is first configured and built and basi- cally
corresponds to the list of modules that the agent supports.
The second example ensures that mib2c finds all MIBs in the
search location for MIB files. The default search location
for MIB files is /usr/share/snmp/mibs. This search location
can be modified by the MIB- DIRS environment variable.</p>

<p>Both the MIB files to be loaded and the MIB file search
location can also be configured in the snmp.conf file.
Please see snmp.conf(5) for more information.</p>

<p>The generated *.c and *.h files will be created in the
current working directory.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Display a help message.</p>

<p>-c CONFIGFILE Use CONFIGFILE when generating code. These
files will be searched for first in the current directory
and then in the /usr/share directory (which is where the
default mib2c configu- ration files can be found). Running
mib2c without the -c CON- FIGFILE option will display a
description of the valid values for CONFIGFILE, that is, the
available config files, including new ones that you might
author.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>% mib2c ifTable</p>

<p>will display a description of the currently available
values for CONFIGFILE.</p>

<p>The following values are supported for CONFIGFILE:</p>

<p>mib2c.mfd.conf mib2c.scalar.conf mib2c.int_watch.conf
mib2c.iterate.conf mib2c.create-dataset.conf
mib2c.array-user.conf mib2c.column_defines.conf
mib2c.column_enums.conf</p>

<p>GENERATING CODE FOR SCALAR OBJECTS:</p>

<p>If youre writing code for some scalars, run:</p>

<p>mib2c -c mib2c.scalar.conf MIBNODE</p>

<p>If you want to magically &quot;tie&quot; integer
variables to integer scalars, use:</p>

<p>mib2c -c mib2c.int_watch.conf MIBNODE</p>

<p>GENERATING CODE FOR TABLES:</p>

<p>The recommended configuration file for tables is the
MIBs for Dummies, or MFD, configuration file. It hides as
much of the SNMP details as possible, generating small, easy
to understand functions. It is also the most flexible and
well documented configuration file. See the
agent/mibgroup/if- mib/ifTable/ifTable*.c files for an
example:</p>

<p>mib2c -c mib2c.mfd.conf MIBNODE</p>

<p>If your table data is kept somewhere else (e.g. its in
the ker- nel and not in the memory of the agent itself) and
you need to &quot;iterate&quot; over it to find the right
data for the SNMP row being accessed. See the
agent/mibgroup/mibII/vacm_context.c file for an example:</p>

<p>mib2c -c mib2c.iterate.conf MIBNODE</p>

<p>If your table data is kept in the agent (i.e. its not
located in an external source) and is purely data driven
(i.e. you do not need to perform any work when a set
occurs). See the agent/mibgroup/examples/data_set.c file for
an example of such a table:</p>

<p>mib2c -c mib2c.create-dataset.conf MIBNODE</p>

<p>If your table data is kept in the agent (i.e. its not
located in an external source), and you can keep your data
sorted by the table index but you do need to perform work
when a set occurs:</p>

<p>mib2c -c mib2c.array-user.conf MIBNODE</p>

<p>GENERATING HEADER FILE DEFINITIONS</p>

<p>To generate just a header with a define for each column
number in your table:</p>

<p>mib2c -c mib2c.column_defines.conf MIBNODE</p>

<p>To generate just a header with a define for each enum
for any column containing enums:</p>

<p>mib2c -c mib2c.column_enums.conf MIBNODE</p>

<p>GENERATING CODE FOR THE 4.X LINE OF CODE (THE OLDER
API)</p>

<p>mib2c -c mib2c.old-api.conf MIBNODE</p>

<p>-IPATH Search for configuration files in PATH. Multiple
paths can be specified using multiple -I switches or by
using one with a comma separated list of paths in it.</p>

<p>-f OUTNAME Places the output code into OUTNAME.c and
OUTNAME.h. Normally, mib2c will place the output code into
files which correspond to the table names it is generating
code for, which is probably what you want anyway.</p>

<p>-i Do not run indent on the resulting code.</p>

<p>-q Run in &quot;quiet&quot; mode, which minimizes the
status messages mib2c generates.</p>

<p>-SVAR=VAL Preset a variable VAR, in the mib2c.*.conf
file, to the value VAL. None of the existing mib2c
configuration files (mib2c.*.conf) currently makes use of
this feature, however, so this option should be considered
available only for future use.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following generates C template code for the
header and implementa- tion files to implement
UCD-DEMO-MIB::ucdDemoPublic.</p>

<p>% mib2c -c mib2c.scalar.conf ucdDemoPublic writing to
ucdDemoPublic.h writing to ucdDemoPublic.c running indent on
ucdDemoPublic.h running indent on ucdDemoPublic.c</p>

<p>The resulting ucdDemoPublic.c and ucdDemoPublic.h files
are generated the current working directory.</p>

<p>The following generates C template code for the header
and implementa- tion files for the module to implement
TCP-MIB::tcpConnTable.</p>

<p>% mib2c -c mib2c.iterate.conf tcpConnTable writing to
tcpConnTable.h writing to tcpConnTable.c running indent on
tcpConnTable.h running indent on tcpConnTable.c</p>

<p>The resulting tcpConnTable.c and tcpConnTable.h files
are generated in the current working directory.</p>
