<p>NAME cups-lpd - receive print jobs and report printer
status to lpd clients</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cups-lpd [ -h hostname[:port] ] [ -n ] [ -o
option=value ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cups-lpd is the CUPS Line Printer Daemon
(&quot;LPD&quot;) mini-server that sup- ports legacy client
systems that use the LPD protocol. cups-lpd does not act as
a standalone network daemon but instead operates using the
Internet &quot;super-server&quot; inetd(8) or xinetd(8). If
you are using inetd, add the following line to the
inetd.conf file to enable the cups-lpd mini-server:</p>

<p>printer stream tcp nowait lp
/usr/lib/cups/daemon/cups-lpd cups-lpd -o
document-format=application/octet-stream</p>

<p>Note: If you are using Solaris 10 or higher, you must
run the inetd- conv(1m) program to register the changes to
the inetd.conf file.</p>

<p>If you are using the newer xinetd(8) daemon, create a
file named /etc/xinetd.d/cups containing the following
lines:</p>

<p>service printer { socket_type = stream protocol = tcp
wait = no user = lp group = sys passenv = server =
/usr/lib/cups/daemon/cups-lpd server_args = -o
document-format=application/octet-stream }</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h hostname[:port] Sets the CUPS server (and
port) to use.</p>

<p>-n Disables reverse address lookups; normally cups-lpd
will try to discover the hostname of the client via a
reverse DNS lookup.</p>

<p>-o name=value Inserts options for all print queues. Most
often this is used to disable the &quot;l&quot; filter so
that remote print jobs are filtered as needed for printing;
the examples in the previous section set the
&quot;document-format&quot; option to
&quot;application/octet-stream&quot; which forces
autodetection of the print file format.</p>

<p>PERFORMANCE cups-lpd performs well with small numbers of
clients and printers. How- ever, since a new process is
created for each connection and since each process must
query the printing system before each job submission, it
does not scale to larger configurations. We highly recommend
that large configurations use the native IPP support
provided by CUPS instead.</p>

<p>SECURITY cups-lpd currently does not perform any access
control based on the settings in cupsd.conf(5) or in the
hosts.allow(5) or hosts.deny(5) files used by TCP wrappers.
Therefore, running cups-lpd on your server will allow any
computer on your network (and perhaps the entire Inter- net)
to print to your server.</p>

<p>While xinetd has built-in access control support, you
should use the TCP wrappers package with inetd to limit
access to only those computers that should be able to print
through your server.</p>

<p>cups-lpd is not enabled by the standard CUPS
distribution. Please con- sult with your operating system
vendor to determine whether it is enabled on your
system.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY cups-lpd does not enforce the restricted
source port number specified in RFC 1179, as using
restricted ports does not prevent users from sub- mitting
print jobs. While this behavior is different than standard
Berkeley LPD implementations, it should not affect normal
client opera- tions.</p>

<p>The output of the status requests follows RFC 2569,
Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols. Since many LPD
implementations stray from this defi- nition, remote status
reporting to LPD clients may be unreliable.</p>
