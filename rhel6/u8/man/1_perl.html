<p>By default, the manpages listed above are installed in
the /usr/share/man/ directory.</p>

<p>Extensive additional documentation for Perl modules is
available. The default configuration for perl will place
this additional documentation in the /usr/share/perl5
directory (or else in the man subdirectory of the Perl
library directory). Some of this additional documentation is
distributed standard with Perl, but you ll also find
documentation for third-party modules there.</p>

<p>You should be able to view Perls documentation with your
man(1) program by including the proper directories in the
appropriate start-up files, or in the MANPATH environment
variable. To find out where the configuration has installed
the manpages, type:</p>

<p>perl -V:man.dir</p>

<p>If the directories have a common stem, such as
/usr/share/man/man1 and /usr/share/man/man3, you need only
to add that stem (/usr/share/man) to your man(1)
configuration files or your MANPATH environment variable. If
they do not share a stem, youll have to add both stems.</p>

<p>If that doesnt work for some reason, you can still use
the supplied perldoc script to view module information. You
might also look into getting a replacement man program.</p>

<p>If something strange has gone wrong with your program
and youre not sure where you should look for help, try the
-w switch first. It will often point out exactly where the
trouble is.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Perl is a language optimized for scanning
arbitrary text files, extracting information from those text
files, and printing reports based on that information. Its
also a good language for many system management tasks. The
language is intended to be practical (easy to use,
efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant,
minimal).</p>

<p>Perl combines (in the authors opinion, anyway) some of
the best features of C, sed, awk, and sh, so people familiar
with those languages should have little difficulty with it.
(Language historians will also note some vestiges of csh,
Pascal, and even BASIC-PLUS.) Expression syntax corresponds
closely to C expression syntax. Unlike most Unix utilities,
Perl does not arbitrarily limit the size of your data--if
you ve got the memory, Perl can slurp in your whole file as
a single string. Recursion is of unlimited depth. And the
tables used by hashes (sometimes called &quot;associative
arrays&quot;) grow as necessary to prevent degraded
performance. Perl can use sophisticated pattern matching
techniques to scan large amounts of data quickly. Although
optimized for scanning text, Perl can also deal with binary
data, and can make dbm files look like hashes. Setuid Perl
scripts are safer than C programs through a dataflow tracing
mechanism that prevents many stupid security holes.</p>

<p>If you have a problem that would ordinarily use sed or
awk or sh, but it exceeds their capabilities or must run a
little faster, and you don t want to write the silly thing
in C, then Perl may be for you. There are also translators
to turn your sed and awk scripts into Perl scripts.</p>

<p>But wait, theres more...</p>

<p>Begun in 1993 (see perlhist), Perl version 5 is nearly a
complete rewrite that provides the following additional
benefits:</p>

<p>&middot; modularity and reusability using innumerable
modules</p>

<p>Described in perlmod, perlmodlib, and
perlmodinstall.</p>

<p>&middot; embeddable and extensible</p>

<p>Described in perlembed, perlxstut, perlxs, perlcall,
perlguts, and xsubpp.</p>

<p>&middot; roll-your-own magic variables (including
multiple simultaneous DBM implementations)</p>

<p>Described in perltie and AnyDBM_File.</p>

<p>&middot; subroutines can now be overridden, autoloaded,
and prototyped</p>

<p>Described in perlsub.</p>

<p>&middot; arbitrarily nested data structures and
anonymous functions</p>

<p>Described in perlreftut, perlref, perldsc, and
perllol.</p>

<p>&middot; object-oriented programming</p>

<p>Described in perlobj, perlboot, perltoot, perltooc, and
perlbot.</p>

<p>&middot; support for light-weight processes
(threads)</p>

<p>Described in perlthrtut and threads.</p>

<p>&middot; support for Unicode, internationalization, and
localization</p>

<p>Described in perluniintro, perllocale and
Locale::Maketext.</p>

<p>&middot; lexical scoping</p>

<p>Described in perlsub.</p>

<p>&middot; regular expression enhancements</p>

<p>Described in perlre, with additional examples in
perlop.</p>

<p>&middot; enhanced debugger and interactive Perl
environment, with integrated editor support</p>

<p>Described in perldebtut, perldebug and perldebguts.</p>

<p>&middot; POSIX 1003.1 compliant library</p>

<p>Described in POSIX.</p>

<p>Okay, thats definitely enough hype.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY Perl is available for most operating
systems, including virtually all Unix-like platforms. See

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The &quot;use warnings&quot; pragma (and the
-w switch) produces some lovely diagnostics.</p>

<p>See perldiag for explanations of all Perls diagnostics.
The &quot;use diagnostics&quot; pragma automatically turns
Perl s normally terse warnings and errors into these longer
forms.</p>

<p>Compilation errors will tell you the line number of the
error, with an indication of the next token or token type
that was to be examined. (In a script passed to Perl via -e
switches, each -e is counted as one line.)</p>

<p>Setuid scripts have additional constraints that can
produce error messages such as &quot;Insecure
dependency&quot;. See perlsec.</p>

<p>Did we mention that you should definitely consider using
the -w switch?</p>

<p>BUGS The -w switch is not mandatory.</p>

<p>Perl is at the mercy of your machine s definitions of
various operations such as type casting, atof(), and
floating-point output with sprintf().</p>

<p>If your stdio requires a seek or eof between reads and
writes on a particular stream, so does Perl. (This doesnt
apply to sysread() and syswrite().)</p>

<p>While none of the built-in data types have any arbitrary
size limits (apart from memory size), there are still a few
arbitrary limits: a given variable name may not be longer
than 251 characters. Line numbers displayed by diagnostics
are internally stored as short integers, so they are limited
to a maximum of 65535 (higher numbers usually being affected
by wraparound).</p>

<p>You may mail your bug reports (be sure to include full
configuration information as output by the myconfig program
in the perl source tree, or by &quot;perl -V&quot;) to
perlbug@perl.org . If youve succeeded in compiling perl, the
perlbug script in the utils/ subdirectory can be used to
help mail in a bug report.</p>

<p>Perl actually stands for Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish
Lister, but dont tell anyone I said that.</p>

<p>NOTES The Perl motto is &quot;Theres more than one way
to do it.&quot; Divining how many more is left as an
exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>The three principal virtues of a programmer are
Laziness, Impatience, and Hubris. See the Camel Book for
why.</p>
