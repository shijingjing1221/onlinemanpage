<p>NAME audispd.conf - the audit event dispatcher
configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION audispd.conf is the file that controls the
configuration of the audit event dispatcher. Each line
should contain one configuration keyword, an equal sign, and
then followed by appropriate configuration informa- tion.
All option names and values are case insensitive. The
keywords recognized are listed and described below. Each
line should be limited to 160 characters or the line will be
skipped. You may add comments to the file by starting the
line with a # character.</p>

<p>q_depth This is a numeric value that tells how big to
make the internal queue of the audit event dispatcher. A
bigger queue lets it han- dle a flood of events better, but
could hold events that are not processed when the daemon is
terminated. If you get messages in syslog about events
getting dropped, increase this value. The default value is
80.</p>

<p>overflow_action This option determines how the daemon
should react to overflow- ing its internal queue. When this
happens, it means that more events are being received than
it can get rid of. This error means that it is going to lose
the current event its trying to dispatch. It has the
following choices: ignore, syslog, suspend, single, and
halt. If set to ignore, the audisp daemon does nothing.
syslog means that it will issue a warning to syslog. suspend
will cause the audisp daemon to stop processing events. The
daemon will still be alive. The single option will cause the
audisp daemon to put the computer system in single user
mode. halt option will cause the audisp daemon to shutdown
the com- puter system.</p>

<p>priority_boost This is a non-negative number that tells
the audit event dis- patcher how much of a priority boost it
should take. This boost is in addition to the boost provided
from the audit daemon. The default is 4. No change is 0.</p>

<p>max_restarts This is a non-negative number that tells
the audit event dis- patcher how many times it can try to
restart a crashed plugin. The default is 10.</p>

<p>name_format This option controls how computer node names
are inserted into the audit event stream. It has the
following choices: none, hostname, fqd, numeric, and user.
None means that no computer name is inserted into the audit
event. hostname is the name returned by the gethostname
syscall. The fqd means that it takes the hostname and
resolves it with dns for a fully qualified domain name of
that machine. Numeric is similar to fqd except it resolves
the IP address of the machine. User is an admin defined
string from the name option. The default value is none.</p>

<p>name This is the admin defined string that identifies
the machine if user is given as the name_format option.</p>
