<p>NAME cmakeprops - Reference of CMake properties.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES CMake Properties - Properties supported by
CMake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for the properties supported
by CMake. Prop- erties can have different scopes. They can
either be assigned to a source file, a directory, a target
or globally to CMake. By modifying the values of properties
the behaviour of the build system can be cus- tomized.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES OF GLOBAL SCOPE
ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS Allow duplicate custom
targets to be created.</p>

<p>Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a
project have globally unique logical names (see policy
CMP0002). This is necessary to generate meaningful project
file names in Xcode and VS IDE generators. It also allows
the target names to be refer- enced unambiguously.</p>

<p>Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate
custom target names. For projects that care only about
Makefile gener- ators and do not wish to support Xcode or VS
IDE generators, one may set this property to true to allow
duplicate custom targets. The property allows multiple
add_custom_target command calls in different directories to
specify the same target name. However, setting this property
will cause non-Makefile generators to pro- duce an error and
refuse to generate the project.</p>

<p>AUTOMOC_TARGETS_FOLDER Name of FOLDER for *_automoc
targets that are added automati- cally by CMake for targets
for which AUTOMOC is enabled.</p>

<p>If not set, CMake uses the FOLDER property of the parent
target as a default value for this property. See also the
documentation for the FOLDER target property and the AUTOMOC
target property.</p>

<p>DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS Specify which configurations are
for debugging.</p>

<p>The value must be a semi-colon separated list of
configuration names. Currently this property is used only by
the tar- get_link_libraries command (see its documentation
for details). Additional uses may be defined in the
future.</p>

<p>This property must be set at the top level of the
project and before the first target_link_libraries command
invocation. If any entry in the list does not match a valid
configuration for the project the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>DISABLED_FEATURES List of features which are disabled
during the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of features which are disabled during the CMake
run. By default it contains the names of all packages which
were not found. This is determined using the
&lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables. Packages which are searched
QUIET are not listed. A project can add its own features to
this list. This property is used by the macros in
FeatureSummary.cmake.</p>

<p>ENABLED_FEATURES List of features which are enabled
during the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.
By default it contains the names of all packages which were
found. This is determined using the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND
variables. Packages which are searched QUIET are not listed.
A project can add its own features to this list. This
property is used by the macros in FeatureSummary.cmake.</p>

<p>ENABLED_LANGUAGES Read-only property that contains the
list of currently enabled languages</p>

<p>Set to list of currently enabled languages.</p>

<p>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS Whether FIND_LIBRARY should
automatically search lib64 directo- ries.</p>

<p>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is a boolean specifying
whether the FIND_LIBRARY command should automatically search
the lib64 vari- ant of directories called lib in the search
path when building 64-bit binaries.</p>

<p>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_OPENBSD_VERSIONING Whether FIND_LIBRARY
should find OpenBSD-style shared libraries.</p>

<p>This property is a boolean specifying whether the
FIND_LIBRARY command should find shared libraries with
OpenBSD-style ver- sioned extension:
&quot;.so.&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;&quot;. The property is
set to true on OpenBSD and false on other platforms.</p>

<p>GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE Enable global target
dependency graph debug mode.</p>

<p>CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target
dependency graph at the beginning of native build system
generation. This property causes it to display details of
its analysis to stderr.</p>

<p>GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES Disallow global target
dependency graph cycles.</p>

<p>CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target
dependency graph at the beginning of native build system
generation. It reports an error if the dependency graph
contains a cycle that does not consist of all STATIC library
targets. This property tells CMake to disallow all cycles
completely, even among static libraries.</p>

<p>IN_TRY_COMPILE Read-only property that is true during a
try-compile configura- tion.</p>

<p>True when building a project inside a TRY_COMPILE or
TRY_RUN command.</p>

<p>PACKAGES_FOUND List of packages which were found during
the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of packages which were found during the CMake run.
Whether a package has been found is determined using the
&lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.</p>

<p>PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND List of packages which were not found
during the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of packages which were not found during the CMake
run. Whether a package has been found is determined using
the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.</p>

<p>PREDEFINED_TARGETS_FOLDER Name of FOLDER for targets
that are added automatically by CMake.</p>

<p>If not set, CMake uses
&quot;CMakePredefinedTargets&quot; as a default value for
this property. Targets such as INSTALL, PACKAGE and
RUN_TESTS will be organized into this FOLDER. See also the
docu- mentation for the FOLDER target property.</p>

<p>REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES If set, report any undefined
properties to this file.</p>

<p>If this property is set to a filename then when CMake
runs it will report any properties or variables that were
accessed but not defined into the filename specified in this
property.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE Specify a launcher for compile
rules.</p>

<p>Makefile generators prefix compiler commands with the
given launcher command line. This is intended to allow
launchers to intercept build problems with high granularity.
Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM Specify a launcher for custom
rules.</p>

<p>Makefile generators prefix custom commands with the
given launcher command line. This is intended to allow
launchers to intercept build problems with high granularity.
Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_LINK Specify a launcher for link rules.</p>

<p>Makefile generators prefix link and archive commands
with the given launcher command line. This is intended to
allow launch- ers to intercept build problems with high
granularity. Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this
property.</p>

<p>RULE_MESSAGES Specify whether to report a message for
each make rule.</p>

<p>This property specifies whether Makefile generators
should add a progress message describing what each build
rule does. If the property is not set the default is ON. Set
the property to OFF to disable granular messages and report
only as each target com- pletes. This is intended to allow
scripted builds to avoid the build time cost of detailed
reports. If a CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES cache entry exists its
value initializes the value of this prop- erty. Non-Makefile
generators currently ignore this property.</p>

<p>TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS Set if shared
libraries may be named like archives.</p>

<p>On AIX shared libraries may be named
&quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.a&quot;. This prop- erty is set to
true on such platforms.</p>

<p>TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS Does the target platform
support shared libraries.</p>

<p>TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean specifying
whether the target platform supports shared libraries.
Basically all current general general purpose OS do so, the
exception are usually embedded systems with no or special
OSs.</p>

<p>USE_FOLDERS Use the FOLDER target property to organize
targets into folders.</p>

<p>If not set, CMake treats this property as OFF by
default. CMake generators that are capable of organizing
into a hierarchy of folders use the values of the FOLDER
target property to name those folders. See also the
documentation for the FOLDER target property.</p>

<p>__CMAKE_DELETE_CACHE_CHANGE_VARS_ Internal property</p>

<p>Used to detect compiler changes, Do not set.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON DIRECTORIES ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
Additional files to clean during the make clean stage.</p>

<p>A list of files that will be cleaned as a part of the
&quot;make clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>CACHE_VARIABLES List of cache variables available in the
current directory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of CMake
cache vari- ables currently defined. It is intended for
debugging purposes.</p>

<p>CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM Should the output of custom commands be
left.</p>

<p>If this is true then the outputs of custom commands for
this directory will not be removed during the &quot;make
clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS Preprocessor definitions for
compiling a directorys sources.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a
semicolon-sepa- rated list of preprocessor definitions using
the syntax VAR or VAR=value. Function-style definitions are
not supported. CMake will automatically escape the value
correctly for the native build system (note that CMake
language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).
This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using
the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CON- FIG&gt; where
&lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex.
&quot;COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS_DEBUG&quot;). This property will
be initialized in each direc- tory by its value in the
directorys parent.</p>

<p>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are
not sup- ported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does
not support definition values with spaces (but NMake
does).</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support
for escap- ing certain values. CMake has work-arounds for
many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass
correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly,
do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape
sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header
file. Then report the limitation. Known limitations
include:</p>

<p># - broken almost everywhere ; - broken in VS IDE 7.0
and Borland Makefiles , - broken in VS IDE % - broken in
some cases in NMake &amp; | - broken in some cases on MinGW
^ &lt; &gt;</p>

<p>CMake does not reject these values outright because they
do work in some cases. Use with caution.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
preprocessor definitions in a directory.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS. This property will be initialized in
each directory by its value in the directorys parent.</p>

<p>COMPILE_OPTIONS List of options to pass to the
compiler.</p>

<p>This property specifies the list of directories given so
far for this property. This property exists on directories
and targets.</p>

<p>The target property values are used by the generators to
set the options for the compiler.</p>

<p>Contents of COMPILE_OPTIONS may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0
$&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt; = configuration name
$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1, else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0 , else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>DEFINITIONS For CMake 2.4 compatibility only. Use
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS instead.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of flags
given so far to the add_definitions command. It is intended
for debugging purposes. Use the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
instead.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL Exclude the directory from the all
target of its parent.</p>

<p>A property on a directory that indicates if its targets
are excluded from the default build target. If it is not,
then with a Makefile for example typing make will cause the
targets to be built. The same concept applies to the default
build of other generators.</p>

<p>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM Specify #include line
transforms for dependencies in a direc- tory.</p>

<p>This property specifies rules to transform macro-like
#include lines during implicit dependency scanning of C and
C++ source files. The list of rules must be
semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
&quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the % must be lit-
eral). During dependency scanning occurrences of
A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be replaced by the value
given with the macro argument substituted for %. For
example, the entry</p>

<p>MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;</p>

<p>will convert lines of the form</p>

<p>#include MYDIR(myheader.h)</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>#include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;</p>

<p>allowing the dependency to be followed.</p>

<p>This property applies to sources in all targets within a
direc- tory. The property value is initialized in each
directory by its value in the directorys parent.</p>

<p>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES List of preprocessor include file
search directories.</p>

<p>This property specifies the list of directories given so
far to the include_directories command. This property exists
on direc- tories and targets. In addition to accepting
values from the include_directories command, values may be
set directly on any directory or any target using the
set_property command. A tar- get gets its initial value for
this property from the value of the directory property. A
directory gets its initial value from its parent directory
if it has one. Both directory and target property values are
adjusted by calls to the include_directories command.</p>

<p>The target property values are used by the generators to
set the include paths for the compiler. See also the
include_directo- ries command.</p>

<p>INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION Include file scanning regular
expression.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the regular expression
used during dependency scanning to match include files that
should be followed. See the include_regular_expression
command.</p>

<p>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION Enable interprocedural
optimization for targets in a directory.</p>

<p>If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if
they are known to be supported by the compiler.</p>

<p>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a
directory.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZA- TION. If set, this property
overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.</p>

<p>LINK_DIRECTORIES List of linker search directories.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of
directories given so far to the link_directories command. It
is intended for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>LISTFILE_STACK The current stack of listfiles being
processed.</p>

<p>This property is mainly useful when trying to debug
errors in your CMake scripts. It returns a list of what list
files are currently being processed, in order. So if one
listfile does an INCLUDE command then that is effectively
pushing the included listfile onto the stack.</p>

<p>MACROS List of macro commands available in the current
directory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of CMake
macros cur- rently defined. It is intended for debugging
purposes. See the macro command.</p>

<p>PARENT_DIRECTORY Source directory that added current
subdirectory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the source directory
that added the current source directory as a subdirectory of
the build. In the top-level directory the value is the
empty-string.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE Specify a launcher for compile
rules.</p>

<p>See the global property of the same name for details.
This overrides the global property for a directory.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM Specify a launcher for custom
rules.</p>

<p>See the global property of the same name for details.
This overrides the global property for a directory.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_LINK Specify a launcher for link rules.</p>

<p>See the global property of the same name for details.
This overrides the global property for a directory.</p>

<p>TEST_INCLUDE_FILE A cmake file that will be included
when ctest is run.</p>

<p>If you specify TEST_INCLUDE_FILE, that file will be
included and processed when ctest is run on the
directory.</p>

<p>VARIABLES List of variables defined in the current
directory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of CMake
variables currently defined. It is intended for debugging
purposes.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_&lt;section&gt; Specify a
postSolution global section in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Setting a property like this generates an entry of the
following form in the solution file:</p>

<p>GlobalSection(&lt;section&gt;) = postSolution
&lt;contents based on property value&gt;
EndGlobalSection</p>

<p>The property must be set to a semicolon-separated list
of key=value pairs. Each such pair will be transformed into
an entry in the solution global section. Whitespace around
key and value is ignored. List elements which do not contain
an equal sign are skipped.</p>

<p>This property only works for Visual Studio 7 and above;
it is ignored on other generators. The property only applies
when set on a directory whose CMakeLists.txt contains a
project() com- mand.</p>

<p>Note that CMake generates postSolution sections
Extensibility- Globals and ExtensibilityAddIns by default.
If you set the cor- responding property, it will override
the default section. For example, setting
VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_ExtensibilityGlobals will override
the default contents of the ExtensibilityGlobals section,
while keeping ExtensibilityAddIns on its default.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_PRE_&lt;section&gt; Specify a
preSolution global section in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Setting a property like this generates an entry of the
following form in the solution file:</p>

<p>GlobalSection(&lt;section&gt;) = preSolution
&lt;contents based on property value&gt;
EndGlobalSection</p>

<p>The property must be set to a semicolon-separated list
of key=value pairs. Each such pair will be transformed into
an entry in the solution global section. Whitespace around
key and value is ignored. List elements which do not contain
an equal sign are skipped.</p>

<p>This property only works for Visual Studio 7 and above;
it is ignored on other generators. The property only applies
when set on a directory whose CMakeLists.txt contains a
project() com- mand.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON TARGETS &lt;CONFIG&gt;_OUTPUT_NAME Old
per-configuration target file base name.</p>

<p>This is a configuration-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME.
Use OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; instead.</p>

<p>&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX Postfix to append to the target
file name for configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;.</p>

<p>When building with configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; the
value of this property is appended to the target file name
built on disk. For non-executable targets, this property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX if it is set when a target is
created. This property is ignored on the Mac for Frameworks
and App Bundles.</p>

<p>&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET Value for symbol
visibility compile flags</p>

<p>The &lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET property determines
the value passed in a visibility related compile option,
such as -fvisi- bility= for &lt;LANG&gt;. This property only
has an affect for libraries and executables with exports.
This property is ini- tialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBIL- ITY_PRESET if it is set when a
target is created.</p>

<p>ALIASED_TARGET Name of target aliased by this
target.</p>

<p>If this is an ALIAS target, this property contains the
name of the target aliased.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory in which to
build ARCHIVE target files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which archive
target files should be built. Multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) append a per-configuration subdirectory to the
specified directory. There are three kinds of target files
that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.
Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static
libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module
libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL
platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is
treated as a runtime target and the corre- sponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration output directory for ARCHIVE target
files.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory
to the specified directory. This property is initialized by
the value of the variable
CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set
when a tar- get is created.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME Output name for ARCHIVE target
files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the base name for archive target
files. It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and
OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties. There are three kinds
of target files that may be built: archive, library, and
runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets.
Static libraries are always treated as archive targets.
Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For
non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library
targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library
is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Win- dows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
output name for ARCHIVE target files.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
ARCHIVE_OUT- PUT_NAME.</p>

<p>AUTOMOC Should the target be processed with automoc (for
Qt projects).</p>

<p>AUTOMOC is a boolean specifying whether CMake will
handle the Qt moc preprocessor automatically, i.e. without
having to use the QT4_WRAP_CPP() or QT5_WRAP_CPP() macro.
Currently Qt4 and Qt5 are supported. When this property is
set to TRUE, CMake will scan the source files at build time
and invoke moc accordingly. If an #include statement like
#include &quot;moc_foo.cpp&quot; is found, the Q_OBJECT
class declaration is expected in the header, and moc is run
on the header file. If an #include statement like #include
&quot;foo.moc&quot; is found, then a Q_OBJECT is expected in
the current source file and moc is run on the file itself.
Addition- ally, all header files are parsed for Q_OBJECT
macros, and if found, moc is also executed on those files.
The resulting moc files, which are not included as shown
above in any of the source files are included in a generated
&lt;targetname&gt;_auto- moc.cpp file, which is compiled as
part of the target.This prop- erty is initialized by the
value of the variable CMAKE_AUTOMOC if it is set when a
target is created.</p>

<p>Additional command line options for moc can be set via
the AUTO- MOC_MOC_OPTIONS property.</p>

<p>By setting the CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE variable to
TRUE the rules for searching the files which will be
processed by moc can be relaxed. See the documentation for
this variable for more details.</p>

<p>The global property AUTOMOC_TARGETS_FOLDER can be used
to group the automoc targets together in an IDE, e.g. in
MSVS.</p>

<p>AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS Additional options for moc when
using automoc (see the AUTOMOC property)</p>

<p>This property is only used if the AUTOMOC property is
set to TRUE for this target. In this case, it holds
additional command line options which will be used when moc
is executed during the build, i.e. it is equivalent to the
optional OPTIONS argument of the qt4_wrap_cpp() macro.</p>

<p>By default it is empty.</p>

<p>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH Should build tree targets have
install tree rpaths.</p>

<p>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether
to link the target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.
This takes precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the
need for relink- ing before installation. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>BUNDLE This target is a CFBundle on the Mac.</p>

<p>If a module library target has this property set to true
it will be built as a CFBundle when built on the mac. It
will have the directory structure required for a CFBundle
and will be suitable to be used for creating Browser Plugins
or other application resources.</p>

<p>BUNDLE_EXTENSION The file extension used to name a
BUNDLE target on the Mac.</p>

<p>The default value is &quot;bundle&quot; - you can also
use &quot;plugin&quot; or whatever file extension is
required by the host app for your bundle.</p>

<p>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL Properties which must be
compatible with their link interface</p>

<p>The COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL property may contain a
list of propertiesfor this target which must be consistent
when evalu- ated as a boolean in the INTERFACE of all linked
dependees. For example, if a property &quot;FOO&quot;
appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
&quot;INTERFACE_FOO&quot; property content in all of its
dependencies must be consistent with each other, and with
the &quot;FOO&quot; property in the dependee. Consistency in
this sense has the meaning that if the property is set, then
it must have the same boolean value as all others, and if
the property is not set, then it is ignored. Note that for
each dependee, the set of properties from this property must
not intersect with the set of properties from the
COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING property.</p>

<p>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING Properties which must be
string-compatible with their link interface</p>

<p>The COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING property may contain a
list of properties for this target which must be the same
when evaluated as a string in the INTERFACE of all linked
dependees. For exam- ple, if a property &quot;FOO&quot;
appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
&quot;INTERFACE_FOO&quot; property content in all of its
dependencies must be equal with each other, and with the
&quot;FOO&quot; property in the dependee. If the property is
not set, then it is ignored. Note that for each dependee,
the set of properties from this property must not intersect
with the set of properties from the
COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL property.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS Preprocessor definitions for
compiling a target s sources.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a
semicolon-sepa- rated list of preprocessor definitions using
the syntax VAR or VAR=value. Function-style definitions are
not supported. CMake will automatically escape the value
correctly for the native build system (note that CMake
language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).
This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using
the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CON- FIG&gt; where
&lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex.
&quot;COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS_DEBUG&quot;).</p>

<p>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are
not supported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does not
sup- port definition values with spaces (but NMake
does).</p>

<p>Contents of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0
$&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt; = configuration name
$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1, else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0 , else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support
for escap- ing certain values. CMake has work-arounds for
many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass
correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly,
do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape
sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header
file. Then report the limitation. Known limitations
include:</p>

<p># - broken almost everywhere ; - broken in VS IDE 7.0
and Borland Makefiles , - broken in VS IDE % - broken in
some cases in NMake &amp; | - broken in some cases on MinGW
^ &lt; &gt;</p>

<p>CMake does not reject these values outright because they
do work in some cases. Use with caution.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
preprocessor definitions on a target.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS.</p>

<p>COMPILE_FLAGS Additional flags to use when compiling
this targets sources.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler
flags used to build sources within the target. Use
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass additional preprocessor
definitions.</p>

<p>COMPILE_OPTIONS List of options to pass to the
compiler.</p>

<p>This property specifies the list of options specified so
far for this property. This property exists on directories
and targets.</p>

<p>The target property values are used by the generators to
set the options for the compiler.</p>

<p>Contents of COMPILE_OPTIONS may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;

$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1, else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0 , else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>DEBUG_POSTFIX See target property
&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.</p>

<p>This property is a special case of the more-general
&lt;CON- FIG&gt;_POSTFIX property for the DEBUG
configuration.</p>

<p>DEFINE_SYMBOL Define a symbol when compiling this target
s sources.</p>

<p>DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol
defined when compiling sources in a shared library. If not
set here then it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with
some substitutions if the target is not a valid C
identifier). This is useful for headers to know whether they
are being included from inside their library or outside to
properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations.</p>

<p>ENABLE_EXPORTS Specify whether an executable exports
symbols for loadable mod- ules.</p>

<p>Normally an executable does not export any symbols
because it is the final program. It is possible for an
executable to export symbols to be used by loadable modules.
When this property is set to true CMake will allow other
targets to &quot;link&quot; to the exe- cutable with the
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command. On all plat- forms a
target-level dependency on the executable is created for
targets that link to it. For DLL platforms an import library
will be created for the exported symbols and then used for
link- ing. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are
DLL plat- forms. For non-DLL platforms that require all
symbols to be resolved at link time, such as Mac OS X, the
module will &quot;link&quot; to the executable using a flag
like &quot;-bundle_loader&quot;. For other non-DLL platforms
the link rule is simply ignored since the dynamic loader
will automatically bind symbols when the module is
loaded.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL Exclude the target from the all
target.</p>

<p>A property on a target that indicates if the target is
excluded from the default build target. If it is not, then
with a Make- file for example typing make will cause this
target to be built. The same concept applies to the default
build of other genera- tors. Installing a target with
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD Exclude target from
&quot;Build Solution&quot;.</p>

<p>This property is only used by Visual Studio generators 7
and above. When set to TRUE, the target will not be built
when you press &quot;Build Solution&quot;.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration version of target exclusion from
&quot;Build Solu- tion&quot;.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD. If the generic
EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD is also set on a target,
EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_&lt;CONFIG&gt; takes precedence
in configu- rations for which it has a value.</p>

<p>EXPORT_NAME Exported name for target files.</p>

<p>This sets the name for the IMPORTED target generated
when it this target is is exported. If not set, the logical
target name is used by default.</p>

<p>EchoString A message to be displayed when the target is
built.</p>

<p>A message to display on some generators (such as
makefiles) when the target is built.</p>

<p>FOLDER Set the folder name. Use to organize targets in
an IDE.</p>

<p>Targets with no FOLDER property will appear as top level
enti- ties in IDEs like Visual Studio. Targets with the same
FOLDER property value will appear next to each other in a
folder of that name. To nest folders, use FOLDER values such
as GUI/Dialogs with / characters separating folder
levels.</p>

<p>FRAMEWORK This target is a framework on the Mac.</p>

<p>If a shared library target has this property set to true
it will be built as a framework when built on the mac. It
will have the directory structure required for a framework
and will be suit- able to be used with the -framework
option</p>

<p>Fortran_FORMAT Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the
Fortran source layout.</p>

<p>This property tells CMake whether the Fortran source
files in a target use fixed-format or free-format. CMake
will pass the corresponding format flag to the compiler. Use
the source-spe- cific Fortran_FORMAT property to change the
format of a specific source file. If the variable
CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.</p>

<p>Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY Specify output directory for
Fortran modules provided by the target.</p>

<p>If the target contains Fortran source files that provide
modules and the compiler supports a module output directory
this speci- fies the directory in which the modules will be
placed. When this property is not set the modules will be
placed in the build directory corresponding to the target s
source directory. If the variable
CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY is set when a target is
created its value is used to initialize this property.</p>

<p>Note that some compilers will automatically search the
module output directory for modules USEd during compilation
but others will not. If your sources USE modules their
location must be specified by INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES regardless
of this property.</p>

<p>GENERATOR_FILE_NAME Generators file for this target.</p>

<p>An internal property used by some generators to record
the name of the project or dsp file associated with this
target. Note that at configure time, this property is only
set for targets created by include_external_msproject().</p>

<p>GNUtoMS Convert GNU import library (.dll.a) to MS format
(.lib).</p>

<p>When linking a shared library or executable that exports
symbols using GNU tools on Windows (MinGW/MSYS) with Visual
Studio installed convert the import library (.dll.a) from
GNU to MS format (.lib). Both import libraries will be
installed by install(TARGETS) and exported by
install(EXPORT) and export() to be linked by applications
with either GNU- or MS-compatible tools.</p>

<p>If the variable CMAKE_GNUtoMS is set when a target is
created its value is used to initialize this property. The
variable must be set prior to the first command that enables
a language such as project() or enable_language(). CMake
provides the variable as an option to the user automatically
when configuring on Windows with GNU tools.</p>

<p>HAS_CXX Link the target using the C++ linker tool
(obsolete).</p>

<p>This is equivalent to setting the LINKER_LANGUAGE
property to CXX. See that propertys documentation for
details.</p>

<p>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM Specify #include line
transforms for dependencies in a target.</p>

<p>This property specifies rules to transform macro-like
#include lines during implicit dependency scanning of C and
C++ source files. The list of rules must be
semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
&quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the % must be lit-
eral). During dependency scanning occurrences of
A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be replaced by the value
given with the macro argument substituted for %. For
example, the entry</p>

<p>MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;</p>

<p>will convert lines of the form</p>

<p>#include MYDIR(myheader.h)</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>#include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;</p>

<p>allowing the dependency to be followed.</p>

<p>This property applies to sources in the target on which
it is set.</p>

<p>IMPORTED Read-only indication of whether a target is
IMPORTED.</p>

<p>The boolean value of this property is true for targets
created with the IMPORTED option to add_executable or
add_library. It is false for targets built within the
project.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS Configurations provided for an
IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Set this to the list of configuration names available
for an IMPORTED target. The names correspond to
configurations defined in the project from which the target
is imported. If the importing project uses a different set
of configurations the names may be mapped using the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt; prop- erty. Ignored for
non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_IMPLIB Full path to the import library for an
IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Set this to the location of the &quot;.lib&quot; part of
a windows DLL. Ignored for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_IMPLIB_&lt;CONFIG&gt; &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific
version of IMPORTED_IMPLIB property.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES Dependent shared
libraries of an imported shared library.</p>

<p>Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries
as part of their implementation. On some platforms the
linker searches for the dependent libraries of shared
libraries they are includ- ing in the link. Set this
property to the list of dependent shared libraries of an
imported library. The list should be disjoint from the list
of interface libraries in the INTER- FACE_LINK_LIBRARIES
property. On platforms requiring dependent shared libraries
to be found at link time CMake uses this list to add
appropriate files or paths to the link command line. Ignored
for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
&lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of
IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported. If set, this
property com- pletely overrides the generic property for the
named configura- tion.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES Languages compiled
into an IMPORTED static library.</p>

<p>Set this to the list of languages of source files
compiled to produce a STATIC IMPORTED library (such as
&quot;C&quot; or &quot;CXX&quot;). CMake accounts for these
languages when computing how to link a target to the
imported library. For example, when a C executable links to
an imported C++ static library CMake chooses the C++ linker
to satisfy language runtime dependencies of the static
library.</p>

<p>This property is ignored for targets that are not STATIC
libraries. This property is ignored for non-imported
targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
&lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported. If set, this
property com- pletely overrides the generic property for the
named configura- tion.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES Transitive link
interface of an IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Set this to the list of libraries whose interface is
included when an IMPORTED library target is linked to
another target. The libraries will be included on the link
line for the target. Unlike the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
property, this property applies to all imported target
types, including STATIC libraries. This property is ignored
for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>This property is ignored if the target also has a
non-empty INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.</p>

<p>This property is deprecated. Use
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
&lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported. If set, this
property com- pletely overrides the generic property for the
named configura- tion.</p>

<p>This property is ignored if the target also has a
non-empty INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.</p>

<p>This property is deprecated. Use
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY Repetition count
for cycles of IMPORTED static libraries.</p>

<p>This is LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY for IMPORTED
targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
&lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLIC- ITY.</p>

<p>If set, this property completely overrides the generic
property for the named configuration.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LOCATION Full path to the main file on disk for
an IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Set this to the location of an IMPORTED target file on
disk. For executables this is the location of the executable
file. For bundles on OS X this is the location of the
executable file inside Contents/MacOS under the application
bundle folder. For static libraries and modules this is the
location of the library or module. For shared libraries on
non-DLL platforms this is the location of the shared
library. For frameworks on OS X this is the location of the
library file symlink just inside the framework folder. For
DLLs this is the location of the &quot;.dll&quot; part of
the library. For UNKNOWN libraries this is the location of
the file to be linked. Ignored for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>Projects may skip IMPORTED_LOCATION if the
configuration-spe- cific property
IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; is set. To get the location
of an imported target read one of the LOCATION or LOCA-
TION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific
version of IMPORTED_LOCATION property.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_NO_SONAME Specifies that an IMPORTED shared
library target has no &quot;son- ame&quot;.</p>

<p>Set this property to true for an imported shared library
file that has no &quot;soname&quot; field. CMake may adjust
generated link commands for some platforms to prevent the
linker from using the path to the library in place of its
missing soname. Ignored for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_NO_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
&lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_NO_SONAME
property.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_SONAME The &quot;soname&quot; of an IMPORTED
target of shared library type.</p>

<p>Set this to the &quot;soname&quot; embedded in an
imported shared library. This is meaningful only on
platforms supporting the feature. Ignored for non-imported
targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific
version of IMPORTED_SONAME property.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORT_PREFIX What comes before the import library
name.</p>

<p>Similar to the target property PREFIX, but used for
import libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead
of regular libraries. A target property that can be set to
override the prefix (such as &quot;lib&quot;) on an import
library name.</p>

<p>IMPORT_SUFFIX What comes after the import library
name.</p>

<p>Similar to the target property SUFFIX, but used for
import libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead
of regular libraries. A target property that can be set to
override the suffix (such as &quot;.lib&quot;) on an import
library name.</p>

<p>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES List of preprocessor include file
search directories.</p>

<p>This property specifies the list of directories given so
far to the include_directories command. This property exists
on direc- tories and targets. In addition to accepting
values from the include_directories command, values may be
set directly on any directory or any target using the
set_property command. A target gets its initial value for
this property from the value of the directory property. A
directory gets its initial value from its parent directory
if it has one. Both directory and target prop- erty values
are adjusted by calls to the include_directories
command.</p>

<p>The target property values are used by the generators to
set the include paths for the compiler. See also the
include_directo- ries command.</p>

<p>Contents of INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

on all consumers will be set to OFF. If this property is
undefined, then con- sumers will determine their
POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property by other means. Consumers
must ensure that the targets that they link to have a
consistent requirement for their INTER-
FACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property.</p>

<p>INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES List of public
system include directories for a library.</p>

<p>Targets may populate this property to publish the
include direc- tories which contain system headers, and
therefore should not result in compiler warnings. Consuming
targets will then mark the same include directories as
system headers.</p>

<p>Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
genera- tion to produce information specific to each build
configura- tion. Valid expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0
$&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt; = configuration name
$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1 , else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0, else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION Enable interprocedural
optimization for a target.</p>

<p>If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if
they are known to be supported by the compiler.</p>

<p>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a
target.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZA- TION. If set, this property
overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.</p>

<p>LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a
target.</p>

<p>Target label semantics are currently unspecified.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory in which to
build LIBRARY target files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which library
target files should be built. Multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) append a per-configuration subdirectory to the
specified directory. There are three kinds of target files
that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.
Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static
libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module
libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL
platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is
treated as a runtime target and the corre- sponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration output directory for LIBRARY target
files.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory
to the specified directory. This property is initialized by
the value of the variable
CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set
when a tar- get is created.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME Output name for LIBRARY target
files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the base name for library target
files. It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and
OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties. There are three kinds
of target files that may be built: archive, library, and
runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets.
Static libraries are always treated as archive targets.
Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For
non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library
targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library
is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Win- dows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
output name for LIBRARY target files.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LIBRARY_OUT- PUT_NAME.</p>

<p>LINKER_LANGUAGE Specifies language whose compiler will
invoke the linker.</p>

<p>For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this
sets the language whose compiler is used to link the target
(such as &quot;C&quot; or &quot;CXX&quot;). A typical value
for an executable is the language of the source file
providing the program entry point (main). If not set, the
language with the highest linker preference value is the
default. See documentation of
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREF- ERENCE variables.</p>

<p>If this property is not set by the user, it will be
calculated at generate-time by CMake.</p>

<p>LINK_DEPENDS Additional files on which a target binary
depends for linking.</p>

<p>Specifies a semicolon-separated list of full-paths to
files on which the link rule for this target depends. The
target binary will be linked if any of the named files is
newer than it.</p>

<p>This property is ignored by non-Makefile generators. It
is intended to specify dependencies on &quot;linker
scripts&quot; for custom Makefile link rules.</p>

<p>LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED Do not depend on linked shared
library files.</p>

<p>Set this property to true to tell CMake generators not
to add file-level dependencies on the shared library files
linked by this target. Modification to the shared libraries
will not be sufficient to re-link this target. Logical
target-level depen- dencies will not be affected so the
linked shared libraries will still be brought up to date
before this target is built.</p>

<p>This property is initialized by the value of the
variable CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED if it is set when a
target is cre- ated.</p>

<p>LINK_FLAGS Additional flags to use when linking this
target.</p>

<p>The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags
to the link step of a target. LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; will
add to the con- figuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;, for example,
DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO.</p>

<p>LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration linker flags
for a target.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LINK_FLAGS.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES List public interface libraries
for a shared library or exe- cutable.</p>

<p>By default linking to a shared library target
transitively links to targets with which the library itself
was linked. For an executable with exports (see the
ENABLE_EXPORTS property) no default transitive link
dependencies are used. This property replaces the default
transitive link dependencies with an explicit list. When the
target is linked into another target the libraries listed
(and recursively their link interface libraries) will be
provided to the other target also. If the list is empty then
no transitive link dependencies will be incorporated when
this target is linked into another target even if the
default set is non-empty. This property is initialized by
the value of the variable CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES if
it is set when a target is created. This property is ignored
for STATIC libraries.</p>

<p>This property is overridden by the
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property if policy CMP0022 is
NEW.</p>

<p>This property is deprecated. Use
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration list of public interface libraries for a
tar- get.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LINK_INTER- FACE_LIBRARIES. If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.</p>

<p>This property is overridden by the
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property if policy CMP0022 is
NEW.</p>

<p>This property is deprecated. Use
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY Repetition count for STATIC
libraries with cyclic dependencies.</p>

<p>When linking to a STATIC library target with cyclic
dependencies the linker may need to scan more than once
through the archives in the strongly connected component of
the dependency graph. CMake by default constructs the link
line so that the linker will scan through the component at
least twice. This property specifies the minimum number of
scans if it is larger than the default. CMake uses the
largest value specified by any target in a component.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration repetition count for cycles of STATIC
libraries.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LINK_INTER- FACE_MULTIPLICITY. If set, this property
completely overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.</p>

<p>LINK_LIBRARIES List of direct link dependencies.</p>

<p>This property specifies the list of libraries or targets
which will be used for linking. In addition to accepting
values from the target_link_libraries command, values may be
set directly on any target using the set_property
command.</p>

<p>The target property values are used by the generators to
set the link libraries for the compiler. See also the tar-
get_link_libraries command.</p>

<p>Contents of LINK_LIBRARIES may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0
$&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt; = configuration name
$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1 , else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0, else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC End a link line such that static
system libraries are used.</p>

<p>Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and
-Bdynamic to determine whether to use static or shared
libraries for -lXXX options. CMake uses these options to set
the link type for libraries whose full paths are not known
or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the
platform. By default CMake adds an option at the end of the
library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type
back to its starting type. This property switches the final
linker search type to -Bstatic regardless of how it started.
See also LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC.</p>

<p>LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC Assume the linker looks for
static libraries by default.</p>

<p>Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and
-Bdynamic to determine whether to use static or shared
libraries for -lXXX options. CMake uses these options to set
the link type for libraries whose full paths are not known
or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the
platform. By default the linker search type is assumed to be
-Bdynamic at the beginning of the library list. This
property switches the assumption to -Bstatic. It is intended
for use when linking an executable statically (e.g. with the
GNU -static option). See also LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC.</p>

<p>LOCATION Read-only location of a target on disk.</p>

<p>For an imported target, this read-only property returns
the value of the LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property for an
unspecified con- figuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; provided by the
target.</p>

<p>For a non-imported target, this property is provided for
compat- ibility with CMake 2.4 and below. It was meant to
get the loca- tion of an executable targets output file for
use in add_cus- tom_command. The path may contain a
build-system-specific por- tion that is replaced at build
time with the configuration get- ting built (such as
&quot;$(ConfigurationName)&quot; in VS). In CMake 2.6 and
above add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target
name in its COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the
target location. In CMake 2.8.4 and above add_custom_command
recog- nizes generator expressions to refer to target
locations any- where in the command. Therefore this property
is not needed for creating custom commands.</p>

<p>Do not set properties that affect the location of a
target after reading this property. These include properties
whose names match
&quot;(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CON-
FIG&gt;)?&quot;, &quot;(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)&quot;, or
&quot;LINKER_LANGUAGE&quot;. Failure to follow this rule is
not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
undefined.</p>

<p>LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Read-only property providing a
target location on disk.</p>

<p>A read-only property that indicates where a targets main
file is located on disk for the configuration
&lt;CONFIG&gt;. The property is defined only for library and
executable targets. An imported target may provide a set of
configurations different from that of the importing project.
By default CMake looks for an exact-match but otherwise uses
an arbitrary available configura- tion. Use the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property to map imported
configurations explicitly.</p>

<p>Do not set properties that affect the location of a
target after reading this property. These include properties
whose names match
&quot;(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CON-
FIG&gt;)?&quot;, &quot;(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)&quot;, or
&quot;LINKER_LANGUAGE&quot;. Failure to follow this rule is
not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
undefined.</p>

<p>MACOSX_BUNDLE Build an executable as an application
bundle on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>When this property is set to true the executable when
built on Mac OS X will be created as an application bundle.
This makes it a GUI executable that can be launched from the
Finder. See the MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST target property for
information about creation of the Info.plist file for the
application bun- dle. This property is initialized by the
value of the variable CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE if it is set when
a target is created.</p>

<p>MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST Specify a custom Info.plist
template for a Mac OS X App Bundle.</p>

<p>An executable target with MACOSX_BUNDLE enabled will be
built as an application bundle on Mac OS X. By default its
Info.plist file is created by configuring a template called
MacOSXBundle- Info.plist.in located in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. This property specifies an alternative
template file name which may be a full path.</p>

<p>The following target properties may be set to specify
content to be configured into the file:</p>

<p>MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING MACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE
MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER
MACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME
MACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION MACOSX_BUNDLE_COPYRIGHT</p>

<p>CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect
all tar- gets in a directory that do not have each specific
property set. If a custom Info.plist is specified by this
property it may of course hard-code all the settings instead
of using the target properties.</p>

<p>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST Specify a custom Info.plist
template for a Mac OS X Framework.</p>

<p>A library target with FRAMEWORK enabled will be built as
a framework on Mac OS X. By default its Info.plist file is
cre- ated by configuring a template called MacOSXFramework-
Info.plist.in located in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. This
property specifies an alternative template file name which
may be a full path.</p>

<p>The following target properties may be set to specify
content to be configured into the file:</p>

<p>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER
MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION</p>

<p>CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect
all tar- gets in a directory that do not have each specific
property set. If a custom Info.plist is specified by this
property it may of course hard-code all the settings instead
of using the target properties.</p>

<p>MACOSX_RPATH Whether to use rpaths on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>When this property is set to true, the directory portion
of the&quot;install_name&quot; field of shared libraries
will default to &quot;@rpath&quot;.Runtime paths will also
be embedded in binaries using this target.This property is
initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH
if it is set when a target is cre- ated.</p>

<p>MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Map from project
configuration to IMPORTED target s configura- tion.</p>

<p>Set this to the list of configurations of an imported
target that may be used for the current project s
&lt;CONFIG&gt; configura- tion. Targets imported from
another project may not provide the same set of
configuration names available in the current project.
Setting this property tells CMake what imported con-
figurations are suitable for use when building the
&lt;CONFIG&gt; con- figuration. The first configuration in
the list found to be provided by the imported target is
selected. If this property is set and no matching
configurations are available, then the imported target is
considered to be not found. This property is ignored for
non-imported targets.</p>

<p>NAME Logical name for the target.</p>

<p>Read-only logical name for the target as used by
CMake.</p>

<p>NO_SONAME Whether to set &quot;soname&quot; when linking
a shared library or module.</p>

<p>Enable this boolean property if a generated shared
library or module should not have &quot;soname&quot; set.
Default is to set &quot;soname&quot; on all shared libraries
and modules as long as the platform sup- ports it.
Generally, use this property only for leaf private libraries
or plugins. If you use it on normal shared libraries which
other targets link against, on some platforms a linker will
insert a full path to the library (as specified at link
time) into the dynamic section of the dependent binary.
There- fore, once installed, dynamic loader may eventually
fail to locate the library for the binary.</p>

<p>OSX_ARCHITECTURES Target specific architectures for OS
X.</p>

<p>The OSX_ARCHITECTURES property sets the target binary
architec- ture for targets on OS X. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES if it is set when a target is
created. Use OSX_ARCHITECTURES_&lt;CONFIG&gt; to set the
binary architectures on a per-configuration basis.
&lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex:
&quot;OSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG&quot;).</p>

<p>OSX_ARCHITECTURES_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration OS X
binary architectures for a target.</p>

<p>This property is the configuration-specific version of
OSX_ARCHITECTURES.</p>

<p>OUTPUT_NAME Output name for target files.</p>

<p>This sets the base name for output files created for an
executable or library target. If not set, the logical target
name is used by default.</p>

<p>OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration target file
base name.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
OUTPUT_NAME.</p>

<p>PDB_NAME Output name for MS debug symbols .pdb file from
linker.</p>

<p>Set the base name for debug symbols file created for an
exe- cutable or shared library target. If not set, the
logical tar- get name is used by default.</p>

<p>This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6
genera- tor.</p>

<p>PDB_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration name for MS
debug symbols .pdb file.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
PDB_NAME.</p>

<p>This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6
genera- tor.</p>

<p>PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory for MS debug
symbols .pdb file from linker.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which the MS
debug symbols will be placed by the linker. This property is
initial- ized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6
genera- tor.</p>

<p>PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
output directory for MS debug symbols .pdb files.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory
to the specified directory. This property is initialized by
the value of the variable
CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set when
a target is created.</p>

<p>This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6
genera- tor.</p>

<p>POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE Whether to create a
position-independent target</p>

<p>The POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property determines
whether posi- tion independent executables or shared
libraries will be cre- ated. This property is true by
default for SHARED and MODULE library targets and false
otherwise. This property is initial- ized by the value of
the variable CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPEN- DENT_CODE if it is set
when a target is created.</p>

<p>POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT Deprecated install support.</p>

<p>The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run
before and after installing a target. They are used only
when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the
target. Use the INSTALL command instead.</p>

<p>PREFIX What comes before the library name.</p>

<p>A target property that can be set to override the prefix
(such as &quot;lib&quot;) on a library name.</p>

<p>PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT Deprecated install support.</p>

<p>The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run
before and after installing a target. They are used only
when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the
target. Use the INSTALL command instead.</p>

<p>PRIVATE_HEADER Specify private header files in a
FRAMEWORK shared library tar- get.</p>

<p>Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK
property gener- ate frameworks on OS X and normal shared
libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a
list of header files to be placed in the PrivateHeaders
directory inside the frame- work folder. On non-Apple
platforms these headers may be installed using the
PRIVATE_HEADER option to the install(TAR- GETS) command.</p>

<p>PROJECT_LABEL Change the name of a target in an IDE.</p>

<p>Can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE
like Visual Studio.</p>

<p>PUBLIC_HEADER Specify public header files in a FRAMEWORK
shared library tar- get.</p>

<p>Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK
property gener- ate frameworks on OS X and normal shared
libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a
list of header files to be placed in the Headers directory
inside the framework folder. On non-Apple platforms these
headers may be installed using the PUBLIC_HEADER option to
the install(TARGETS) command.</p>

<p>RESOURCE Specify resource files in a FRAMEWORK shared
library target.</p>

<p>Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK
property gener- ate frameworks on OS X and normal shared
libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a
list of files to be placed in the Resources directory inside
the framework folder. On non-Apple platforms these files may
be installed using the RESOURCE option to the
install(TARGETS) command.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE Specify a launcher for compile
rules.</p>

<p>See the global property of the same name for details.
This overrides the global and directory property for a
target.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM Specify a launcher for custom
rules.</p>

<p>See the global property of the same name for details.
This overrides the global and directory property for a
target.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_LINK Specify a launcher for link rules.</p>

<p>See the global property of the same name for details.
This overrides the global and directory property for a
target.</p>

<p>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory in which to
build RUNTIME target files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which runtime
target files should be built. Multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) append a per-configuration subdirectory to the
specified directory. There are three kinds of target files
that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.
Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static
libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module
libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL
platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is
treated as a runtime target and the corre- sponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_RUN-
TIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration output directory for RUNTIME target
files.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory
to the specified directory. This property is initialized by
the value of the variable CMAKE_RUN-
TIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set when a
target is created.</p>

<p>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME Output name for RUNTIME target
files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the base name for runtime target
files. It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and
OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties. There are three kinds
of target files that may be built: archive, library, and
runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets.
Static libraries are always treated as archive targets.
Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For
non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library
targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library
is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Win- dows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.</p>

<p>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
output name for RUNTIME target files.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
RUNTIME_OUT- PUT_NAME.</p>

<p>SKIP_BUILD_RPATH Should rpaths be used for the build
tree.</p>

<p>SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip
auto- matic generation of an rpath allowing the target to
run from the build tree. This property is initialized by the
value of the variable CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH if it is set
when a target is created.</p>

<p>SOURCES Source names specified for a target.</p>

<p>Read-only list of sources specified for a target. The
names returned are suitable for passing to the
set_source_files_prop- erties command.</p>

<p>SOVERSION What version number is this target.</p>

<p>For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used
to spec- ify the build version and API version respectively.
When build- ing or installing appropriate symlinks are
created if the plat- form supports symlinks and the linker
supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the
missing is assumed to have the same version number.
SOVERSION is ignored if NO_SONAME property is set. For
shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION
attribute is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot;
version number. These numbers are used as the image version
of the binary.</p>

<p>STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS Extra flags to use when linking
static libraries.</p>

<p>Extra flags to use when linking a static library.</p>

<p>STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
flags for creating a static library.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS.</p>

<p>SUFFIX What comes after the target name.</p>

<p>A target property that can be set to override the suffix
(such as &quot;.so&quot; or &quot;.exe&quot;) on the name of
a library, module or exe- cutable.</p>

<p>TYPE The type of the target.</p>

<p>This read-only property can be used to test the type of
the given target. It will be one of STATIC_LIBRARY,
MODULE_LIBRARY, SHARED_LIBRARY, EXECUTABLE or one of the
internal target types.</p>

<p>VERSION What version number is this target.</p>

<p>For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used
to spec- ify the build version and API version respectively.
When build- ing or installing appropriate symlinks are
created if the plat- form supports symlinks and the linker
supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the
missing is assumed to have the same version number. For
executables VERSION can be used to specify the build
version. When building or installing appropriate sym- links
are created if the platform supports symlinks. For shared
libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute
is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot; version
number. These numbers are used as the image version of the
binary.</p>

<p>VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN Whether to add a compile flag
to hide symbols of inline func- tions</p>

<p>The VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN property determines
whether a flag for hiding symbols for inline functions. the
value passed used in a visibility related compile option,
such as -fvisibility=. This property only has an affect for
libraries and executables with exports. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN if it is set when a target
is created.</p>

<p>VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES Visual Studio managed project .NET
references</p>

<p>Adds one or more semicolon-delimited .NET references to
a gener- ated Visual Studio project. For example,
&quot;System;System.Windows.Forms&quot;.</p>

<p>VS_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION Specify the .NET
target framework version.</p>

<p>Used to specify the .NET target framework version for
C++/CLI. For example, &quot;v4.5&quot;.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_&lt;variable&gt; Visual Studio
project-specific global variable.</p>

<p>Tell the Visual Studio generator to set the global
variable &lt;variable&gt; to a given value in the generated
Visual Studio project. Ignored on other generators. Qt
integration works bet- ter if VS_GLOBAL_QtVersion is set to
the version FindQt4.cmake found. For example,
&quot;4.7.3&quot;</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_KEYWORD Visual Studio project keyword.</p>

<p>Sets the &quot;keyword&quot; attribute for a generated
Visual Studio project. Defaults to &quot;Win32Proj&quot;.
You may wish to override this value with
&quot;ManagedCProj&quot;, for example, in a Visual Studio
man- aged C++ unit test project.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_PROJECT_TYPES Visual Studio project
type(s).</p>

<p>Can be set to one or more UUIDs recognized by Visual
Studio to indicate the type of project. This value is copied
verbatim into the generated project file. Example for a
managed C++ unit test- ing project:</p>


<p>{3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB};{8BC9CEB8-8B4A-11D0-8D11-00A0C91BC942}</p>

<p>UUIDs are semicolon-delimited.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_ROOTNAMESPACE Visual Studio project root
namespace.</p>

<p>Sets the &quot;RootNamespace&quot; attribute for a
generated Visual Studio project. The attribute will be
generated only if this is set.</p>

<p>VS_KEYWORD Visual Studio project keyword.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio keyword, for
example Qt integration works better if this is set to
Qt4VSv1.0.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_AUXPATH Visual Studio Source Code Control Aux
Path.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio source code
control aux- path property.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_LOCALPATH Visual Studio Source Code Control Local
Path.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio source code
control local path property.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME Visual Studio Source Code Control
Project.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio source code
control project name property.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_PROVIDER Visual Studio Source Code Control
Provider.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio source code
control provider property.</p>

<p>VS_WINRT_EXTENSIONS Visual Studio project C++/CX
language extensions for Windows Runtime</p>

<p>Can be set to enable C++/CX language extensions.</p>

<p>VS_WINRT_REFERENCES Visual Studio project Windows
Runtime Metadata references</p>

<p>Adds one or more semicolon-delimited WinRT references to
a gen- erated Visual Studio project. For example,
&quot;Windows;Win- dows.UI.Core&quot;.</p>

<p>WIN32_EXECUTABLE Build an executable with a WinMain
entry point on windows.</p>

<p>When this property is set to true the executable when
linked on Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry
point instead of just main(). This makes it a GUI executable
instead of a con- sole application. See the CMAKE_MFC_FLAG
variable documentation to configure use of MFC for WinMain
executables. This property is initialized by the value of
the variable CMAKE_WIN32_EXE- CUTABLE if it is set when a
target is created.</p>

<p>XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt; Set Xcode target
attributes directly.</p>

<p>Tell the Xcode generator to set &lt;an-attribute&gt; to
a given value in the generated Xcode project. Ignored on
other genera- tors.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON TESTS ATTACHED_FILES Attach a list of
files to a dashboard submission.</p>

<p>Set this property to a list of files that will be
encoded and submitted to the dashboard as an addition to the
test result.</p>

<p>ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL Attach a list of files to a
dashboard submission if the test fails.</p>

<p>Same as ATTACHED_FILES, but these files will only be
included if the test does not pass.</p>

<p>COST Set this to a floating point value. Tests in a test
set will be run in descending order of cost.</p>

<p>This property describes the cost of a test. You can
explicitly set this value; tests with higher COST values
will run first.</p>

<p>DEPENDS Specifies that this test should only be run
after the specified list of tests.</p>

<p>Set this to a list of tests that must finish before this
test is run.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Specify environment variables that should be
defined for running a test.</p>

<p>If set to a list of environment variables and values of
the form MYVAR=value those environment variables will be
defined while running the test. The environment is restored
to its previous state after the test is done.</p>

<p>FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION If the output matches this
regular expression the test will fail.</p>

<p>If set, if the output matches one of specified regular
expres- sions, the test will fail.For example:
FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
&quot;[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed&quot;</p>

<p>LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a
test.</p>

<p>The list is reported in dashboard submissions.</p>

<p>MEASUREMENT Specify a CDASH measurement and value to be
reported for a test.</p>

<p>If set to a name then that name will be reported to
CDASH as a named measurement with a value of 1. You may also
specify a value by setting MEASUREMENT to
&quot;measurement=value&quot;.</p>

<p>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION The output must match this
regular expression for the test to pass.</p>

<p>If set, the test output will be checked against the
specified regular expressions and at least one of the
regular expressions has to match, otherwise the test will
fail.</p>

<p>PROCESSORS How many process slots this test requires</p>

<p>Denotes the number of processors that this test will
require. This is typically used for MPI tests, and should be
used in con- junction with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL
option.</p>

<p>REQUIRED_FILES List of files required to run the
test.</p>

<p>If set to a list of files, the test will not be run
unless all of the files exist.</p>

<p>RESOURCE_LOCK Specify a list of resources that are
locked by this test.</p>

<p>If multiple tests specify the same resource lock, they
are guar- anteed not to run concurrently.</p>

<p>RUN_SERIAL Do not run this test in parallel with any
other test.</p>

<p>Use this option in conjunction with the ctest_test
PARAL- LEL_LEVEL option to specify that this test should not
be run in parallel with any other tests.</p>

<p>TIMEOUT How many seconds to allow for this test.</p>

<p>This property if set will limit a test to not take more
than the specified number of seconds to run. If it exceeds
that the test process will be killed and ctest will move to
the next test. This setting takes precedence over
CTEST_TESTING_TIMEOUT.</p>

<p>WILL_FAIL If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail
flag of the test.</p>

<p>This property can be used for tests that are expected to
fail and return a non zero return code.</p>

<p>WORKING_DIRECTORY The directory from which the test
executable will be called.</p>

<p>If this is not set it is called from the directory the
test exe- cutable is located in.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON SOURCE FILES ABSTRACT Is this source file
an abstract class.</p>

<p>A property on a source file that indicates if the source
file represents a class that is abstract. This only makes
sense for languages that have a notion of an abstract class
and it is only used by some tools that wrap classes into
other languages.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS Preprocessor definitions for
compiling a source file.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a
semicolon-sepa- rated list of preprocessor definitions using
the syntax VAR or VAR=value. Function-style definitions are
not supported. CMake will automatically escape the value
correctly for the native build system (note that CMake
language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).
This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using
the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CON- FIG&gt; where
&lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex.
&quot;COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS_DEBUG&quot;).</p>

<p>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are
not sup- ported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does
not support definition values with spaces (but NMake does).
Xcode does not support per-configuration definitions on
source files.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support
for escap- ing certain values. CMake has work-arounds for
many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass
correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly,
do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape
sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header
file. Then report the limitation. Known limitations
include:</p>

<p># - broken almost everywhere ; - broken in VS IDE 7.0
and Borland Makefiles , - broken in VS IDE % - broken in
some cases in NMake &amp; | - broken in some cases on MinGW
^ &lt; &gt;</p>

<p>CMake does not reject these values outright because they
do work in some cases. Use with caution.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
preprocessor definitions on a source file.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS. Note that Xcode does not support
per-configuration source file flags so this property will be
ignored by the Xcode generator.</p>

<p>COMPILE_FLAGS Additional flags to be added when
compiling this source file.</p>

<p>These flags will be added to the list of compile flags
when this source file builds. Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to
pass additional preprocessor definitions.</p>

<p>EXTERNAL_OBJECT If set to true then this is an object
file.</p>

<p>If this property is set to true then the source file is
really an object file and should not be compiled. It will
still be linked into the target though.</p>

<p>Fortran_FORMAT Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the
Fortran source layout.</p>

<p>This property tells CMake whether a given Fortran source
file uses fixed-format or free-format. CMake will pass the
corre- sponding format flag to the compiler. Consider using
the tar- get-wide Fortran_FORMAT property if all source
files in a target share the same format.</p>

<p>GENERATED Is this source file generated as part of the
build process.</p>

<p>If a source file is generated by the build process CMake
will handle it differently in terms of dependency checking
etc. Oth- erwise having a non-existent source file could
create problems.</p>

<p>HEADER_FILE_ONLY Is this source file only a header
file.</p>

<p>A property on a source file that indicates if the source
file is a header file with no associated implementation.
This is set automatically based on the file extension and is
used by CMake to determine if certain dependency information
should be com- puted.</p>

<p>KEEP_EXTENSION Make the output file have the same
extension as the source file.</p>

<p>If this property is set then the file extension of the
output file will be the same as that of the source file.
Normally the output file extension is computed based on the
language of the source file, for example .cxx will go to a
.o extension.</p>

<p>LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a
source file.</p>

<p>This property has meaning only when the source file is
listed in a target whose LABELS property is also set. No
other semantics are currently specified.</p>

<p>LANGUAGE What programming language is the file.</p>

<p>A property that can be set to indicate what programming
language the source file is. If it is not set the language
is determined based on the file extension. Typical values
are CXX C etc. Set- ting this property for a file means this
file will be compiled. Do not set this for headers or files
that should not be com- piled.</p>

<p>LOCATION The full path to a source file.</p>

<p>A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the
full path to the source file.</p>

<p>MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION Place a source file inside a Mac
OS X bundle, CFBundle, or framework.</p>

<p>Executable targets with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set
are built as Mac OS X application bundles on Apple
platforms. Shared library targets with the FRAMEWORK
property set are built as Mac OS X frameworks on Apple
platforms. Module library targets with the BUNDLE property
set are built as Mac OS X CFBundle bundles on Apple
platforms. Source files listed in the target with this
property set will be copied to a directory inside the bundle
or framework content folder specified by the property value.
For bundles the content folder is
&quot;&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents&quot;. For frame- works the
content folder is
&quot;&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/&lt;ver-
sion&gt;&quot;. For cfbundles the content folder is
&quot;&lt;name&gt;.bundle/Con- tents&quot; (unless the
extension is changed). See the PUB- LIC_HEADER,
PRIVATE_HEADER, and RESOURCE target properties for
specifying files meant for Headers, PrivateHeaders, or
Resources directories.</p>

<p>OBJECT_DEPENDS Additional files on which a compiled
object file depends.</p>

<p>Specifies a semicolon-separated list of full-paths to
files on which any object files compiled from this source
file depend. An object file will be recompiled if any of the
named files is newer than it.</p>

<p>This property need not be used to specify the dependency
of a source file on a generated header file that it
includes. Although the property was originally introduced
for this pur- pose, it is no longer necessary. If the
generated header file is created by a custom command in the
same target as the source file, the automatic dependency
scanning process will recognize the dependency. If the
generated header file is created by another target, an
inter-target dependency should be created with the
add_dependencies command (if one does not already exist due
to linking relationships).</p>

<p>OBJECT_OUTPUTS Additional outputs for a Makefile
rule.</p>

<p>Additional outputs created by compilation of this source
file. If any of these outputs is missing the object will be
recom- piled. This is supported only on Makefile generators
and will be ignored on other generators.</p>

<p>SYMBOLIC Is this just a name for a rule.</p>

<p>If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true the build system
will be informed that the source file is not actually
created on disk but instead used as a symbolic name for a
build rule.</p>

<p>WRAP_EXCLUDE Exclude this source file from any code
wrapping techniques.</p>

<p>Some packages can wrap source files into alternate
languages to provide additional functionality. For example,
C++ code can be wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG
etc. If WRAP_EXCLUDE is set to true (1 etc) that indicates
that this source file should not be wrapped.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON CACHE ENTRIES ADVANCED True if entry
should be hidden by default in GUIs.</p>

<p>This is a boolean value indicating whether the entry is
consid- ered interesting only for advanced configuration.
The mark_as_advanced() command modifies this property.</p>

<p>HELPSTRING Help associated with entry in GUIs.</p>

<p>This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help
users set it through a CMake GUI.</p>

<p>MODIFIED Internal management property. Do not set or
get.</p>

<p>This is an internal cache entry property managed by
CMake to track interactive user modification of entries.
Ignore it.</p>

<p>STRINGS Enumerate possible STRING entry values for GUI
selection.</p>

<p>For cache entries with type STRING, this enumerates a
set of values. CMake GUIs may use this to provide a
selection widget instead of a generic string entry field.
This is for conve- nience only. CMake does not enforce that
the value matches one of those listed.</p>

<p>TYPE Widget type for entry in GUIs.</p>

<p>Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs
present widgets to help users set values. The GUIs use this
property as a hint to determine the widget type. Valid TYPE
values are:</p>

<p>BOOL = Boolean ON/OFF value. PATH = Path to a directory.
FILEPATH = Path to a file. STRING = Generic string value.
INTERNAL = Do not present in GUI at all. STATIC = Value
managed by CMake, do not change. UNINITIALIZED = Type not
yet specified.</p>

<p>Generally the TYPE of a cache entry should be set by the
command which creates it (set, option, find_library,
etc.).</p>

<p>VALUE Value of a cache entry.</p>

<p>This property maps to the actual value of a cache entry.
Set- ting this property always sets the value without
checking, so use with care.</p>
