<p>rmid(1) Remote Method Invocation (RMI) Tools rmid(1)</p>

<p>NAME rmid - Starts the activation system daemon that
enables objects to be registered and activated in a Java
Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rmid [options]</p>

<p>options The command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rmid command starts the activation
system daemon. The activation system daemon must be started
before activatable objects can be either registered with the
activation system or activated in a JVM. For details on how
to write programs that use activatable objects, the Using
Activation tutorial at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/activation/overview.html</p>

<p>Start the daemon by executing the rmid command and
specifying a security policy file, as follows:</p>

<p>rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy</p>

<p>When you run Oracles implementation of the rmid command,
by default you must specify a security policy file so that
the rmid command can verify whether or not the information
in each ActivationGroupDesc is allowed to be used to start a
JVM for an activation group. Specifically, the command and
options specified by the CommandEnvironment and any
properties passed to an ActivationGroupDesc constructor must
now be explicitly allowed in the security policy file for
the rmid command. The value of the
sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy property dictates the policy
that the rmid command uses to determine whether or not the
information in an ActivationGroupDesc can be used to start a
JVM for an activation group. For more information see the
description of the -J-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=policy
option.</p>

<p>Executing the rmid command starts the Activator and an
internal registry on the default port1098 and binds an
ActivationSystem to the name
java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem in this internal
registry.</p>

<p>To specify an alternate port for the registry, you must
specify the -port option when you execute the rmid command.
For example, the following command starts the activation
system daemon and a registry on the registrys default port,
1099.</p>

<p>rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy -port 1099</p>

<p>START RMID ON DEMAND An alternative to starting rmid
from the command line is to configure inetd (Oracle Solaris)
or xinetd (Linux) to start rmid on demand.</p>

<p>When RMID starts, it attempts to obtain an inherited
channel (inherited from inetd/xinetd) by calling the
System.inheritedChannel method. If the inherited channel is
null or not an instance of
java.nio.channels.ServerSocketChannel, then RMID assumes
that it was not started by inetd/xinetd, and it starts as
previously described.</p>

<p>If the inherited channel is a ServerSocketChannel
instance, then RMID uses the java.net.ServerSocket obtained
from the ServerSocketChannel as the server socket that
accepts requests for the remote objects it exports: The
registry in which the java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem
is bound and the java.rmi.activation.Activator remote
object. In this mode, RMID behaves the same as when it is
started from the command line, except in the following
cases:</p>

<p>&middot; Output printed to System.err is redirected to a
file. This file is located in the directory specified by the
java.io.tmpdir system property (typically /var/tmp or /tmp)
with the prefix rmid-err and the suffix tmp.</p>

<p>&middot; The -port option is not allowed. If this option
is specified, then RMID exits with an error message.</p>

<p>&middot; The -log option is required. If this option is
not specified, then RMID exits with an error message</p>

<p>See the man pages for inetd (Oracle Solaris) or xinetd
(Linux) for details on how to configure services to be
started on demand.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -Coption Specifies an option that is passed as a
command-line argument to each child process (activation
group) of the rmid command when that process is created. For
example, you could pass a property to each virtual machine
spawned by the activation system daemon:</p>

<p>rmid -C-Dsome.property=value</p>

<p>This ability to pass command-line arguments to child
processes can be useful for debugging. For example, the
following command enables server-call logging in all child
JVMs.</p>

<p>rmid -C-Djava.rmi.server.logCalls=true</p>

<p>-Joption Specifies an option that is passed to the Java
interpreter running RMID. For example, to specify that the
rmid command use a policy file named rmid.policy, the -J
option can be used to define the java.security.policy
property on the rmid command line, for example:</p>

<p>rmid -J-Djava.security.policy-rmid.policy</p>

<p>-J-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=policy Specifies the
policy that RMID employs to check commands and command-line
options used to start the JVM in which an activation group
runs. Please note that this option exists only in Oracle s
implementation of the Java RMI activation daemon. If this
property is not specified on the command line, then the
result is the same as though -J-
Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=default were specified. The
possible values of policy can be default, policyClassName,
or none.</p>

<p>&middot; default</p>

<p>The default or unspecified value execPolicy allows the
rmid command to execute commands with specific command-line
options only when the rmid command was granted permission to
execute those commands and options in the security policy
file that the rmid command uses. Only the default activation
group implementation can be used with the default execution
policy.</p>

<p>The rmid command starts a JVM for an activation group
with the information in the groups registered activation
group descriptor, an ActivationGroupDesc. The group
descriptor specifies an optional
ActivationGroupDesc.CommandEnvironment that includes the
command to execute to start the activation group and any
command-line options to be added to the command line. By
default, the rmid command uses the java command found in
java.home. The group descriptor also contains properties
overrides that are added to the command line as options
defined as: -D&lt;property&gt;=&lt;value&gt;.The
com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission permission grants the rmid
command permission to execute a command that is specified in
the group descriptors CommandEnvironment to start an
activation group. The com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
permission enables the rmid command to use command-line
options, specified as properties overrides in the group
descriptor or as options in the CommandEnvironment when
starting the activation group.When granting the rmid command
permission to execute various commands and options, the
permissions ExecPermission and ExecOptionPermission must be
granted to all code sources.</p>

<p>ExecPermission</p>

<p>The ExecPermission class represents permission for the
rmid command to execute a specific command to start an
activation group.</p>

<p>Syntax: The name of an ExecPermission is the path name
of a command to grant the rmid command permission to
execute. A path name that ends in a slash (/) and an
asterisk (*) indicates that all of the files contained in
that directory where slash is the file-separator character,
File.separatorChar. A path name that ends in a slash (/) and
a minus sign (-) indicates all files and subdirectories
contained in that directory (recursively). A path name that
consists of the special token &lt;&lt;ALL FILES&gt;&gt;
matches any file.</p>

<p>A path name that consists of an asterisk (*) indicates
all the files in the current directory. A path name that
consists of a minus sign (-) indicates all the files in the
current directory and (recursively) all files and
subdirectories contained in the current directory.</p>

<p>ExecOptionPermission</p>

<p>The ExecOptionPermission class represents permission for
the rmid command to use a specific command-line option when
starting an activation group. The name of an
ExecOptionPermission is the value of a command-line
option.</p>

<p>Syntax: Options support a limited wild card scheme. An
asterisk signifies a wild card match, and it can appear as
the option name itself (matches any option), or an asterisk
(*) can appear at the end of the option name only when the
asterisk (*) follows a dot (.) or an equals sign (=).</p>

<p>For example: * or -Dmydir.* or -Da.b.c=* is valid, but
*mydir or -Da*b or ab* is not.</p>

<p>Policy file for rmid</p>

<p>When you grant the rmid command permission to execute
various commands and options, the permissions ExecPermission
and ExecOptionPermission must be granted to all code sources
(universally). It is safe to grant these permissions
universally because only the rmid command checks these
permissions.</p>

<p>An example policy file that grants various execute
permissions to the rmid command is:</p>

<p>grant { permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission
&quot;/files/apps/java/jdk1.7.0/solaris/bin/java&quot;;</p>

<p>permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission
&quot;/files/apps/rmidcmds/*&quot;;</p>

<p>permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
&quot;-Djava.security.policy=/files/policies/group.policy&quot;;</p>

<p>permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
&quot;-Djava.security.debug=*&quot;;</p>

<p>permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
&quot;-Dsun.rmi.*&quot;; };</p>

<p>The first permission granted allows the rmid tcommand o
execute the 1.7.0 release of the java command, specified by
its explicit path name. By default, the version of the java
command found in java.home is used (the same one that the
rmid command uses), and does not need to be specified in the
policy file. The second permission allows the rmid command
to execute any command in the directory
/files/apps/rmidcmds.</p>

<p>The third permission granted, an ExecOptionPermission,
allows the rmid command to start an activation group that
defines the security policy file to be
/files/policies/group.policy. The next permission allows the
java.security.debug property to be used by an activation
group. The last permission allows any property in the
sun.rmi property name hierarchy to be used by activation
groups.</p>

<p>To start the rmid command with a policy file, the
java.security.policy property needs to be specified on the
rmid command line, for example:</p>

<p>rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy.</p>

<p>&middot; &lt;policyClassName&gt;</p>

<p>If the default behavior is not flexible enough, then an
administrator can provide, when starting the rmid command,
the name of a class whose checkExecCommand method is
executed to check commands to be executed by the rmid
command.</p>

<p>The policyClassName specifies a public class with a
public, no-argument constructor and an implementation of the
following checkExecCommand method:</p>

<p>public void checkExecCommand(ActivationGroupDesc desc,
String[] command) throws SecurityException;</p>

<p>Before starting an activation group, the rmid command
calls the policys checkExecCommand method and passes to it
the activation group descriptor and an array that contains
the complete command to start the activation group. If the
checkExecCommand throws a SecurityException, then the rmid
command does not start the activation group and an
ActivationException is thrown to the caller attempting to
activate the object.</p>

<p>&middot; none</p>

<p>If the sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy property value is
none, then the rmid command does not perform any validation
of commands to start activation groups.</p>

<p>-log dir Specifies the name of the directory the
activation system daemon uses to write its database and
associated information. The log directory defaults to
creating a log, in the directory in which the rmid command
was executed.</p>

<p>-port port Specifies the port the registry uses. The
activation system daemon binds the ActivationSystem, with
the name java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem, in this
registry. The ActivationSystem on the local machine can be
obtained using the following Naming.lookup method call:</p>

<p>import java.rmi.*; import java.rmi.activation.*;</p>

<p>ActivationSystem system; system = (ActivationSystem)
Naming.lookup(&quot;//:port/java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem&quot;);</p>

<p>-stop Stops the current invocation of the rmid command
for a port specified by the -port option. If no port is
specified, then this option stops the rmid invocation
running on port 1098.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CLASSPATH Used to provide the
system a path to user-defined classes. Directories are
separated by colons, for example:
.:/usr/local/java/classes.</p>
