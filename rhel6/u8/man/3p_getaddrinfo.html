<p>FREEADDRINFO(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
FREEADDRINFO(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME freeaddrinfo, getaddrinfo - get address
information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; #include
&lt;netdb.h&gt;</p>

<p>void freeaddrinfo(struct addrinfo *ai); int
getaddrinfo(const char *restrict nodename, const char
*restrict servname, const struct addrinfo *restrict hints,
struct addrinfo **restrict res);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The freeaddrinfo() function shall free one
or more addrinfo structures returned by getaddrinfo(), along
with any additional storage associated with those
structures. If the ai_next field of the structure is not
null, the entire list of structures shall be freed. The
freeaddrinfo() function shall support the freeing of
arbitrary sublists of an addrinfo list originally returned
by getaddrinfo().</p>

<p>The getaddrinfo() function shall translate the name of a
service loca- tion (for example, a host name) and/or a
service name and shall return a set of socket addresses and
associated information to be used in cre- ating a socket
with which to address the specified service.</p>

<p>Note: In many cases it is implemented by the Domain Name
System, as documented in RFC 1034, RFC 1035, and RFC
1886.</p>

<p>The freeaddrinfo() and getaddrinfo() functions shall be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>The nodename and servname arguments are either null
pointers or point- ers to null-terminated strings. One or
both of these two arguments shall be supplied by the
application as a non-null pointer.</p>

<p>The format of a valid name depends on the address family
or families. If a specific family is not given and the name
could be interpreted as valid within multiple supported
families, the implementation shall attempt to resolve the
name in all supported families and, in absence of errors,
one or more results shall be returned.</p>

<p>If the nodename argument is not null, it can be a
descriptive name or can be an address string. If the
specified address family is AF_INET, AF_INET6, or AF_UNSPEC,
valid descriptive names include host names. If the specified
address family is AF_INET or AF_UNSPEC, address strings
using Internet standard dot notation as specified in
inet_addr() are valid.</p>

<p>If the specified address family is AF_INET6 or
AF_UNSPEC, standard IPv6 text forms described in inet_ntop()
are valid.</p>

<p>If nodename is not null, the requested service location
is named by nodename; otherwise, the requested service
location is local to the caller.</p>

<p>If servname is null, the call shall return network-level
addresses for the specified nodename. If servname is not
null, it is a null-termi- nated character string identifying
the requested service. This can be either a descriptive name
or a numeric representation suitable for use with the
address family or families. If the specified address family
is AF_INET, AF_INET6, or AF_UNSPEC, the service can be
specified as a string specifying a decimal port number.</p>

<p>If the hints argument is not null, it refers to a
structure containing input values that may direct the
operation by providing options and by limiting the returned
information to a specific socket type, address family,
and/or protocol. In this hints structure every member other
than ai_flags, ai_family, ai_socktype, and ai_protocol shall
be set to zero or a null pointer. A value of AF_UNSPEC for
ai_family means that the caller shall accept any address
family. A value of zero for ai_socktype means that the
caller shall accept any socket type. A value of zero for
ai_protocol means that the caller shall accept any proto-
col. If hints is a null pointer, the behavior shall be as if
it referred to a structure containing the value zero for the
ai_flags, ai_socktype, and ai_protocol fields, and AF_UNSPEC
for the ai_family field.</p>

<p>The ai_flags field to which the hints parameter points
shall be set to zero or be the bitwise-inclusive OR of one
or more of the values AI_PASSIVE, AI_CANONNAME,
AI_NUMERICHOST, AI_NUMERICSERV, AI_V4MAPPED, AI_ALL, and
AI_ADDRCONFIG.</p>

<p>If the AI_PASSIVE flag is specified, the returned
address information shall be suitable for use in binding a
socket for accepting incoming connections for the specified
service. In this case, if the nodename argument is null,
then the IP address portion of the socket address structure
shall be set to INADDR_ANY for an IPv4 address or
IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT for an IPv6 address. If the AI_PASSIVE flag
is not specified, the returned address information shall be
suitable for a call to connect() (for a connection-mode
protocol) or for a call to connect(), sendto(), or sendmsg()
(for a connectionless protocol). In this case, if the
nodename argument is null, then the IP address por- tion of
the socket address structure shall be set to the loopback
address. The AI_PASSIVE flag shall be ignored if the
nodename argument is not null.</p>

<p>If the AI_CANONNAME flag is specified and the nodename
argument is not null, the function shall attempt to
determine the canonical name corre- sponding to nodename
(for example, if nodename is an alias or shorthand notation
for a complete name).</p>

<p>Note: Since different implementations use different
conceptual models, the terms canonical name and alias cannot
be precisely defined for the general case. However, Domain
Name System imple- mentations are expected to interpret them
as they are used in RFC 1034.</p>

<p>A numeric host address string is not a name, and thus
does not have a canonical name form; no address to host name
translation is per- formed. See below for handling of the
case where a canonical name can- not be obtained.</p>

<p>If the AI_NUMERICHOST flag is specified, then a non-null
nodename string supplied shall be a numeric host address
string. Otherwise, an [EAI_NONAME] error is returned. This
flag shall prevent any type of name resolution service (for
example, the DNS) from being invoked.</p>

<p>If the AI_NUMERICSERV flag is specified, then a non-null
servname string supplied shall be a numeric port string.
Otherwise, an [EAI_NONAME] error shall be returned. This
flag shall prevent any type of name resolution service (for
example, NIS+) from being invoked.</p>

<p>If the AI_V4MAPPED flag is specified along with an
ai_family of AF_INET6, then getaddrinfo() shall return
IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses on finding no matching IPv6
addresses ( ai_addrlen shall be 16). The AI_V4MAPPED flag
shall be ignored unless ai_family equals AF_INET6. If the
AI_ALL flag is used with the AI_V4MAPPED flag, then
getaddrinfo() shall return all matching IPv6 and IPv4
addresses. The AI_ALL flag without the AI_V4MAPPED flag is
ignored.</p>

<p>If the AI_ADDRCONFIG flag is specified, IPv4 addresses
shall be returned only if an IPv4 address is configured on
the local system, and IPv6 addresses shall be returned only
if an IPv6 address is config- ured on the local system.</p>

<p>The ai_socktype field to which argument hints points
specifies the socket type for the service, as defined in
socket(). If a specific socket type is not given (for
example, a value of zero) and the service name could be
interpreted as valid with multiple supported socket types,
the implementation shall attempt to resolve the service name
for all supported socket types and, in the absence of
errors, all possible results shall be returned. A non-zero
socket type value shall limit the returned information to
values with the specified socket type.</p>

<p>If the ai_family field to which hints points has the
value AF_UNSPEC, addresses shall be returned for use with
any address family that can be used with the specified
nodename and/or servname. Otherwise, addresses shall be
returned for use only with the specified address family. If
ai_family is not AF_UNSPEC and ai_protocol is not zero, then
addresses are returned for use only with the specified
address family and proto- col; the value of ai_protocol
shall be interpreted as in a call to the socket() function
with the corresponding values of ai_family and
ai_protocol.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE A zero return value for getaddrinfo()
indicates successful completion; a non-zero return value
indicates failure. The possible values for the failures are
listed in the ERRORS section.</p>

<p>Upon successful return of getaddrinfo(), the location to
which res points shall refer to a linked list of addrinfo
structures, each of which shall specify a socket address and
information for use in creat- ing a socket with which to use
that socket address. The list shall include at least one
addrinfo structure. The ai_next field of each structure
contains a pointer to the next structure on the list, or a
null pointer if it is the last structure on the list. Each
structure on the list shall include values for use with a
call to the socket() func- tion, and a socket address for
use with the connect() function or, if the AI_PASSIVE flag
was specified, for use with the bind() function. The fields
ai_family, ai_socktype, and ai_protocol shall be usable as
the arguments to the socket() function to create a socket
suitable for use with the returned address. The fields
ai_addr and ai_addrlen are usable as the arguments to the
connect() or bind() functions with such a socket, according
to the AI_PASSIVE flag.</p>

<p>If nodename is not null, and if requested by the
AI_CANONNAME flag, the ai_canonname field of the first
returned addrinfo structure shall point to a null-terminated
string containing the canonical name corresponding to the
input nodename; if the canonical name is not available, then
ai_canonname shall refer to the nodename argument or a
string with the same contents. The contents of the ai_flags
field of the returned structures are undefined.</p>

<p>All fields in socket address structures returned by
getaddrinfo() that are not filled in through an explicit
argument (for example, sin6_flowinfo) shall be set to
zero.</p>

<p>Note: This makes it easier to compare socket address
structures.</p>

<p>ERRORS The getaddrinfo() function shall fail and return
the corresponding value if:</p>

<p>EAI_AGAIN The name could not be resolved at this time.
Future attempts may succeed.</p>

<p>EAI_BADFLAGS</p>

<p>The flags parameter had an invalid value.</p>

<p>EAI_FAIL A non-recoverable error occurred when
attempting to resolve the name.</p>

<p>EAI_FAMILY The address family was not recognized.</p>

<p>EAI_MEMORY There was a memory allocation failure when
trying to allocate storage for the return value.</p>

<p>EAI_NONAME The name does not resolve for the supplied
parameters.</p>

<p>Neither nodename nor servname were supplied. At least
one of these shall be supplied.</p>

<p>EAI_SERVICE The service passed was not recognized for
the specified socket type.</p>

<p>EAI_SOCKTYPE</p>

<p>The intended socket type was not recognized.</p>

<p>EAI_SYSTEM A system error occurred; the error code can
be found in errno.</p>

<p>EAI_OVERFLOW</p>

<p>An argument buffer overflowed.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If the caller handles only TCP and not
UDP, for example, then the ai_protocol member of the hints
structure should be set to IPPROTO_TCP when getaddrinfo() is
called.</p>

<p>If the caller handles only IPv4 and not IPv6, then the
ai_family member of the hints structure should be set to
AF_INET when getaddrinfo() is called.</p>

<p>The term canonical name is misleading; it is taken from
the Domain Name System (RFC 2181). It should be noted that
the canonical name is a result of alias processing, and not
necessarily a unique attribute of a host, address, or set of
addresses. See RFC 2181 for more discussion of this in the
Domain Name System context.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
