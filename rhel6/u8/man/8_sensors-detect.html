<p>NAME sensors-detect - detect hardware monitoring
chips</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sensors-detect</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sensors-detect is an interactive program
that will walk you through the process of scanning your
system for various hardware monitoring chips, or sensors,
supported by libsensors(3), or more generally by the
lm_sensors tool suite.</p>

<p>sensors-detect will look for the following devices, in
order:</p>

<p>&middot; Sensors embedded in CPUs, south bridges and
memory controllers.</p>

<p>&middot; Sensors embedded in Super I/O chips.</p>

<p>&middot; Hardware monitoring chips accessed through ISA
I/O ports.</p>

<p>&middot; Hardware monitoring chips reachable over the
SMBus or more gen- erally any I2C bus on your system.</p>

<p>As the last two detection steps can cause trouble on
some systems, they are normally not attempted if the second
detection step led to the dis- covery of a Super I/O chip
with complete hardware monitoring features. However, the
user is always free to ask for all detection steps if so is
his/her wish. This can be useful if a given system has more
than one hardware monitoring chip. Some vendors are known to
do this, most notably Asus and Tyan.</p>

<p>WARNING sensors-detect needs to access the hardware for
most of the chip detec- tions. By definition, it doesnt know
which chips are there before it manages to identify them.
This means that it can access chips in a way these chips do
not like, causing problems ranging from SMBus lockup to
permanent hardware damage (a rare case, thankfully.)</p>

<p>The authors made their best to make the detection as
safe as possible, and it turns out to work just fine in most
cases, however it is impos- sible to guarantee that
sensors-detect will not lock or kill a specific system. So,
as a rule of thumb, you should not run sensors-detect on
production servers, and you should not run sensors-detect if
cant afford replacing a random part of your system. Also, it
is recommended to not force a detection step which would
have been skipped by default, unless you know what you are
doing.</p>
