<p>NAME pnmcat - concatenate Netpbm images</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmcat</p>

<p>{-leftright | -lr | -topbottom | -tb}</p>

<p>[-white|-black]</p>

<p>[-jtop|-jbottom|-jcenter]</p>

<p>pnmfile ...</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmcat reads one or more PNM images as input,
concatenates them either left to right or top to bottom, and
produces a single PNM image as out- put.</p>

<p>To assemble a regular grid of images, you can use
pamundice.</p>

<p>To do the reverse, you might use pamdice to split an
image up into smaller ones of equal size or pamcut to chop
off part of an image or extract part of an image.</p>

<p>pnmtile concatenates a single input image to itself
repeatedly.</p>

<p>OPTIONS If the PNM images are not all the same height
(left-right) or width (top-bottom), the smaller ones have to
be justified with the largest. By default, pnmcat centers
them, but you can specify justification to one side or the
other with one of the -jxxx options. So, -topbottom -jleft
would stack the PNMs on top of each other, flush with the
left edge.</p>

<p>The -white and -black options specify what color to use
to fill in the extra space when doing this justification. If
neither is specified, pnmcat chooses whichever seems to be
right for the images.</p>
