<p>XMAG(1) XMAG(1)</p>

<p>NAME xmag - magnify parts of the screen</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xmag [ -mag magfactor ] [ -source geom ] [
-toolkitoption ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xmag program allows you to magnify
portions of an X screen. If no explicit region is specified,
a square with the pointer in the upper left corner is
displayed indicating the area to be enlarged. The area can
be dragged out to the desired size by pressing Button 2.
Once a region has been selected, a window is popped up
showing a blown up ver- sion of the region in which each
pixel in the source image is repre- sented by a small square
of the same color. Pressing Button1 in the enlargement
window shows the position and RGB value of the pixel under
the pointer until the button is released. Typing Q or ^C in
the enlargement window exits the program. The application
has 5 but- tons across its top. Close deletes this
particular magnification instance. Replace brings up the
rubber band selector again to select another region for this
magnification instance. New brings up the rub- ber band
selector to create a new magnification instance. Select puts
the magnification image into the primary selection. Paste
copies the primary selection buffer into xmag. Note that you
can cut and paste between xmag and the bitmap program.
Resizing xmag resizes the magni- fication area. xmag
preserves the colormap, visual, and window depth of the
source.</p>

<p>WIDGETS xmag uses the X Toolkit and the Athena Widget
Set. The magnified image is displayed in the Scale widget.
For more information, see the Athena Widget Set
documentation. Below is the widget structure of the xmag
application. Indentation indicates hierarchical structure.
The wid- get class name is given first, followed by the
widget instance name.</p>
