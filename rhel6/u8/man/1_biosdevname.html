<p>BIOSDEVNAME(1) BIOSDEVNAME(1)</p>

<p>NAME biosdevname - give BIOS-given name of a device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS biosdevname [options] [args]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION biosdevname takes a kernel device name as an
argument, and returns the BIOS-given name it
&quot;should&quot; be.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -i, --interface Treat [args] as ethernet
devs</p>

<p>-d, --debug Enable debugging</p>

<p>-p, --policy [physical|all_ethN]</p>

<p>-P, --prefix [string] string use for embedded NICs in
the physical policy (default=em)</p>

<p>-x, --nopirq Do not use $PIR table for mapping PCI
device to slot. Some BIOS have incorrect values.</p>

<p>-s, --smbios [x.y] Require minimum SMBIOS version
x.y</p>

<p>POLICIES The physical policy is the current default.
However, when invoking biosdevname in udev rules, one should
always specify the policy you want, as the default has
changed over time. The physical policy uses the following
scheme:</p>

<p>em&lt;port&gt;[_&lt;virtual instance&gt;] for embedded
NICs</p>

<p>p&lt;slot&gt;p&lt;port&gt;[_&lt;virtual instance&gt;]
for cards in PCI slots</p>

<p>The all_ethN policy makes a best guess at what the
device order should be, with embedded devices first, PCI
cards in ascending slot order, and ports in ascending PCI
bus/device/function order breadth-first. However, this
policy does not work if your PCI devices are hot-plugged or
hot-pluggable, including the virtual functions on an SR-IOV
device. In a hot-plug scenario, each separate udev instance
will be invoked in parallel, while the device tree is still
being populated with new devices. Each udev instance will
see a different PCI tree, and thus cannot provide consistent
enumeration. Use of this policy should be limited to only
scenarios where all PCI devices are present at boot
(cold-plug).</p>

<p>EXIT CODES Returns 0 on success, with BIOS-suggested
name printed to stdout. Returns 1 on provided device name
lookup failure. Returns 2 if system BIOS does not provide
naming information. biosdev- name requires system BIOS to
provide naming information, either via SMBIOS or sysfs
files. Returns 3 if not run as root but requires root
privileges. Returns 4 if running in a virtual machine.</p>

<p>RELATED PROGRAMS The dmidecode package contains two
tools useful for debugging BIOS fea- tures that biosdevname
uses, specifically dmidecode to read the SMBIOS Type 9 and
Type 41 tables, and biosdecode to read the PCI IRQ Routing
Table. Please include the output of each of these programs
in any bug reports.</p>
