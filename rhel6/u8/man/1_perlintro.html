<p>PERLINTRO(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLINTRO(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlintro -- a brief introduction and overview of
Perl</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document is intended to give you a
quick overview of the Perl programming language, along with
pointers to further documentation. It is intended as a
&quot;bootstrap&quot; guide for those who are new to the
language, and provides just enough information for you to be
able to read other peoples Perl and understand roughly what
it s doing, or write your own simple scripts.</p>

<p>This introductory document does not aim to be complete.
It does not even aim to be entirely accurate. In some cases
perfection has been sacrificed in the goal of getting the
general idea across. You are strongly advised to follow this
introduction with more information from the full Perl
manual, the table of contents to which can be found in
perltoc.</p>

<p>Throughout this document youll see references to other
parts of the Perl documentation. You can read that
documentation using the &quot;perldoc&quot; command or
whatever method youre using to read this document.</p>

<p>What is Perl? Perl is a general-purpose programming
language originally developed for text manipulation and now
used for a wide range of tasks including system
administration, web development, network programming, GUI
development, and more.</p>

<p>The language is intended to be practical (easy to use,
efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant,
minimal). Its major features are that it s easy to use,
supports both procedural and object-oriented (OO)
programming, has powerful built-in support for text
processing, and has one of the worlds most impressive
collections of third-party modules.</p>

<p>Different definitions of Perl are given in perl,
perlfaq1 and no doubt other places. From this we can
determine that Perl is different things to different people,
but that lots of people think its at least worth writing
about.</p>

<p>Running Perl programs To run a Perl program from the
Unix command line:</p>

<p>perl progname.pl</p>

<p>Alternatively, put this as the first line of your
script:</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/env perl</p>

<p>... and run the script as
&quot;/path/to/script.pl&quot;. Of course, itll need to be
executable first, so &quot;chmod 755 script.pl&quot; (under
Unix).</p>

<p>(This start line assumes you have the env program. You
can also put directly the path to your perl executable, like
in &quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot;).</p>

<p>For more information, including instructions for other
platforms such as Windows and Mac OS, read perlrun.</p>

<p>Safety net Perl by default is very forgiving. In order
to make it more robust it is recommended to start every
program with the following lines:</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings;</p>

<p>The two additional lines request from perl to catch
various common problems in your code. They check different
things so you need both. A potential problem caught by
&quot;use strict;&quot; will cause your code to stop
immediately when it is encountered, while &quot;use
warnings;&quot; will merely give a warning (like the
command-line switch -w) and let your code run. To read more
about them check their respective manual pages at strict and
warnings.</p>

<p>Basic syntax overview A Perl script or program consists
of one or more statements. These statements are simply
written in the script in a straightforward fashion. There is
no need to have a &quot;main()&quot; function or anything of
that kind.</p>

<p>Perl statements end in a semi-colon:</p>

<p>print &quot;Hello, world&quot;;</p>

<p>Comments start with a hash symbol and run to the end of
the line</p>

<p># This is a comment</p>

<p>Whitespace is irrelevant:</p>

<p>print &quot;Hello, world&quot; ;</p>

<p>... except inside quoted strings:</p>

<p># this would print with a linebreak in the middle print
&quot;Hello world&quot;;</p>

<p>Double quotes or single quotes may be used around
literal strings:</p>

<p>print &quot;Hello, world&quot;; print &rsquo;Hello,
world&rsquo;;</p>

<p>However, only double quotes &quot;interpolate&quot;
variables and special characters such as newlines
(&quot;0):</p>

<p>print &quot;Hello, $name0; # works fine print
&rsquo;Hello, $name0; # prints $nameliterally</p>

<p>Numbers dont need quotes around them:</p>

<p>print 42;</p>

<p>You can use parentheses for functions arguments or omit
them according to your personal taste. They are only
required occasionally to clarify issues of precedence.</p>

<p>print(&quot;Hello, world0); print &quot;Hello,
world0;</p>

<p>More detailed information about Perl syntax can be found
in perlsyn.</p>

<p>Perl variable types Perl has three main variable types:
scalars, arrays, and hashes.</p>

<p>Scalars A scalar represents a single value:</p>

<p>my $animal = &quot;camel&quot;; my $answer = 42;</p>

<p>Scalar values can be strings, integers or floating point
numbers, and Perl will automatically convert between them as
required. There is no need to pre-declare your variable
types, but you have to declare them using the &quot;my&quot;
keyword the first time you use them. (This is one of the
requirements of &quot;use strict;&quot;.)</p>

<p>Scalar values can be used in various ways:</p>

<p>print $animal; print &quot;The animal is $animal0; print
&quot;The square of $answer is &quot;, $answer * $answer,
&quot;0;</p>

<p>There are a number of &quot;magic&quot; scalars with
names that look like punctuation or line noise. These
special variables are used for all kinds of purposes, and
are documented in perlvar. The only one you need to know
about for now is $_ which is the &quot;default
variable&quot;. Its used as the default argument to a number
of functions in Perl, and its set implicitly by certain
looping constructs.</p>

<p>print; # prints contents of $_ by default</p>

<p>Arrays An array represents a list of values:</p>

<p>my @animals = (&quot;camel&quot;, &quot;llama&quot;,
&quot;owl&quot;); my @numbers = (23, 42, 69); my @mixed =
(&quot;camel&quot;, 42, 1.23);</p>

<p>Arrays are zero-indexed. Here s how you get at elements
in an array:</p>

<p>print $animals[0]; # prints &quot;camel&quot; print
$animals[1]; # prints &quot;llama&quot;</p>

<p>The special variable $#array tells you the index of the
last element of an array:</p>

<p>print $mixed[$#mixed]; # last element, prints 1.23</p>

<p>You might be tempted to use &quot;$#array + 1&quot; to
tell you how many items there are in an array. Dont bother.
As it happens, using @array where Perl expects to find a
scalar value (&quot;in scalar context&quot;) will give you
the number of elements in the array:</p>

<p>if (@animals &lt; 5) { ... }</p>

<p>The elements were getting from the array start with a
&quot;$&quot; because we re getting just a single value out
of the array -- you ask for a scalar, you get a scalar.</p>

<p>To get multiple values from an array:</p>

<p>@animals[0,1]; # gives (&quot;camel&quot;,
&quot;llama&quot;); @animals[0..2]; # gives
(&quot;camel&quot;, &quot;llama&quot;, &quot;owl&quot;);
@animals[1..$#animals]; # gives all except the first
element</p>

<p>This is called an &quot;array slice&quot;.</p>

<p>You can do various useful things to lists:</p>

<p>my @sorted = sort @animals; my @backwards = reverse
@numbers;</p>

<p>There are a couple of special arrays too, such as @ARGV
(the command line arguments to your script) and @_ (the
arguments passed to a subroutine). These are documented in
perlvar.</p>

<p>Hashes A hash represents a set of key/value pairs:</p>

<p>my %fruit_color = (&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;red&quot;,
&quot;banana&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;);</p>

<p>You can use whitespace and the &quot;=&gt;&quot;
operator to lay them out more nicely:</p>

<p>my %fruit_color = ( apple =&gt; &quot;red&quot;, banana
=&gt; &quot;yellow&quot;, );</p>

<p>To get at hash elements:</p>

<p>$fruit_color{&quot;apple&quot;}; # gives
&quot;red&quot;</p>

<p>You can get at lists of keys and values with
&quot;keys()&quot; and &quot;values()&quot;.</p>

<p>my @fruits = keys %fruit_colors; my @colors = values
%fruit_colors;</p>

<p>Hashes have no particular internal order, though you can
sort the keys and loop through them.</p>

<p>Just like special scalars and arrays, there are also
special hashes. The most well known of these is %ENV which
contains environment variables. Read all about it (and other
special variables) in perlvar.</p>

<p>Scalars, arrays and hashes are documented more fully in
perldata.</p>

<p>More complex data types can be constructed using
references, which allow you to build lists and hashes within
lists and hashes.</p>

<p>A reference is a scalar value and can refer to any other
Perl data type. So by storing a reference as the value of an
array or hash element, you can easily create lists and
hashes within lists and hashes. The following example shows
a 2 level hash of hash structure using anonymous hash
references.</p>

<p>my $variables = { scalar =&gt; { description =&gt;
&quot;single item&quot;, sigil =&gt; &rsquo;$&rsquo;, },
array =&gt; { description =&gt; &quot;ordered list of
items&quot;, sigil =&gt; &rsquo;@&rsquo;, }, hash =&gt; {
description =&gt; &quot;key/value pairs&quot;, sigil =&gt;
&rsquo;%&rsquo;, }, };</p>

<p>print &quot;Scalars begin with a
$variables-&gt;{&rsquo;scalar&rsquo;}-&gt;{&rsquo;sigil&rsquo;}0;</p>

<p>Exhaustive information on the topic of references can be
found in perlreftut, perllol, perlref and perldsc.</p>

<p>Variable scoping Throughout the previous section all the
examples have used the syntax:</p>

<p>my $var = &quot;value&quot;;</p>

<p>The &quot;my&quot; is actually not required; you could
just use:</p>

<p>$var = &quot;value&quot;;</p>

<p>However, the above usage will create global variables
throughout your program, which is bad programming practice.
&quot;my&quot; creates lexically scoped variables instead.
The variables are scoped to the block (i.e. a bunch of
statements surrounded by curly-braces) in which they are
defined.</p>

<p>my $x = &quot;foo&quot;; my $some_condition = 1; if
($some_condition) { my $y = &quot;bar&quot;; print $x; #
prints &quot;foo&quot; print $y; # prints &quot;bar&quot; }
print $x; # prints &quot;foo&quot; print $y; # prints
nothing; $y has fallen out of scope</p>

<p>Using &quot;my&quot; in combination with a &quot;use
strict;&quot; at the top of your Perl scripts means that the
interpreter will pick up certain common programming errors.
For instance, in the example above, the final &quot;print
$y&quot; would cause a compile-time error and prevent you
from running the program. Using &quot;strict&quot; is highly
recommended.</p>

<p>Conditional and looping constructs Perl has most of the
usual conditional and looping constructs except for
case/switch (but if you really want it, there is a Switch
module in Perl 5.8 and newer, and on CPAN. See the section
on modules, below, for more information about modules and
CPAN).</p>

<p>The conditions can be any Perl expression. See the list
of operators in the next section for information on
comparison and boolean logic operators, which are commonly
used in conditional statements.</p>

<p>if if ( condition ) { ... } elsif ( other condition ) {
... } else { ... }</p>

<p>Theres also a negated version of it:</p>

<p>unless ( condition ) { ... }</p>

<p>This is provided as a more readable version of &quot;if
(!condition)&quot;.</p>

<p>Note that the braces are required in Perl, even if you
ve only got one line in the block. However, there is a
clever way of making your one-line conditional blocks more
English like:</p>

<p># the traditional way if ($zippy) { print
&quot;Yow!&quot;; }</p>

<p># the Perlish post-condition way print &quot;Yow!&quot;
if $zippy; print &quot;We have no bananas&quot; unless
$bananas;</p>

<p>while while ( condition ) { ... }</p>

<p>Theres also a negated version, for the same reason we
have &quot;unless&quot;:</p>

<p>until ( condition ) { ... }</p>

<p>You can also use &quot;while&quot; in a
post-condition:</p>

<p>print &quot;LA LA LA0 while 1; # loops forever</p>

<p>for Exactly like C:</p>

<p>for ($i = 0; $i &lt;= $max; $i++) { ... }</p>

<p>The C style for loop is rarely needed in Perl since Perl
provides the more friendly list scanning &quot;foreach&quot;
loop.</p>

<p>foreach foreach (@array) { print &quot;This element is
$_0; }</p>

<p>print $list[$_] foreach 0 .. $max;</p>

<p># you don&rsquo;t have to use the default $_ either...
foreach my $key (keys %hash) { print &quot;The value of $key
is $hash{$key}0; }</p>

<p>For more detail on looping constructs (and some that
weren t mentioned in this overview) see perlsyn.</p>

<p>Builtin operators and functions Perl comes with a wide
selection of builtin functions. Some of the ones we ve
already seen include &quot;print&quot;, &quot;sort&quot; and
&quot;reverse&quot;. A list of them is given at the start of
perlfunc and you can easily read about any given function by
using &quot;perldoc -f functionname&quot;.</p>

<p>Perl operators are documented in full in perlop, but
here are a few of the most common ones:</p>

<p>Arithmetic + addition - subtraction * multiplication /
division</p>

<p>Numeric comparison == equality != inequality &lt; less
than &gt; greater than &lt;= less than or equal &gt;=
greater than or equal</p>

<p>String comparison eq equality ne inequality lt less than
gt greater than le less than or equal ge greater than or
equal</p>

<p>(Why do we have separate numeric and string comparisons?
Because we dont have special variable types, and Perl needs
to know whether to sort numerically (where 99 is less than
100) or alphabetically (where 100 comes before 99).</p>

<p>Boolean logic &amp;&amp; and || or ! not</p>

<p>(&quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot; and &quot;not&quot;
arent just in the above table as descriptions of the
operators -- theyre also supported as operators in their own
right. Theyre more readable than the C-style operators, but
have different precedence to &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; and
friends. Check perlop for more detail.)</p>

<p>Miscellaneous = assignment . string concatenation x
string multiplication .. range operator (creates a list of
numbers)</p>

<p>Many operators can be combined with a &quot;=&quot; as
follows:</p>

<p>$a += 1; # same as $a = $a + 1 $a -= 1; # same as $a =
$a - 1 $a .= &quot;0; # same as $a = $a . &quot;0;</p>

<p>Files and I/O You can open a file for input or output
using the &quot;open()&quot; function. Its documented in
extravagant detail in perlfunc and perlopentut, but in
short:</p>

<p>open(my $in, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;input.txt&quot;) or
die &quot;Can&rsquo;t open input.txt: $!&quot;; open(my
$out, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;output.txt&quot;) or die
&quot;Can&rsquo;t open output.txt: $!&quot;; open(my $log,
&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, &quot;my.log&quot;) or die
&quot;Can&rsquo;t open my.log: $!&quot;;</p>

<p>You can read from an open filehandle using the
&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; operator. In scalar context it reads a
single line from the filehandle, and in list context it
reads the whole file in, assigning each line to an element
of the list:</p>

<p>my $line = &lt;$in&gt;; my @lines = &lt;$in&gt;;</p>

<p>Reading in the whole file at one time is called
slurping. It can be useful but it may be a memory hog. Most
text file processing can be done a line at a time with Perls
looping constructs.</p>

<p>The &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; operator is most often seen in
a &quot;while&quot; loop:</p>

<p>while (&lt;$in&gt;) { # assigns each line in turn to $_
print &quot;Just read in this line: $_&quot;; }</p>

<p>We ve already seen how to print to standard output using
&quot;print()&quot;. However, &quot;print()&quot; can also
take an optional first argument specifying which filehandle
to print to:</p>

<p>print STDERR &quot;This is your final warning.0; print
$out $record; print $log $logmessage;</p>

<p>When you re done with your filehandles, you should
&quot;close()&quot; them (though to be honest, Perl will
clean up after you if you forget):</p>

<p>close $in or die &quot;$in: $!&quot;;</p>

<p>Regular expressions Perl s regular expression support is
both broad and deep, and is the subject of lengthy
documentation in perlrequick, perlretut, and elsewhere.
However, in short:</p>

<p>Simple matching if (/foo/) { ... } # true if $_ contains
&quot;foo&quot; if ($a =~ /foo/) { ... } # true if $a
contains &quot;foo&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;//&quot; matching operator is documented in
perlop. It operates on $_ by default, or can be bound to
another variable using the &quot;=~&quot; binding operator
(also documented in perlop).</p>

<p>Simple substitution s/foo/bar/; # replaces foo with bar
in $_ $a =~ s/foo/bar/; # replaces foo with bar in $a $a =~
s/foo/bar/g; # replaces ALL INSTANCES of foo with bar in
$a</p>

<p>The &quot;s///&quot; substitution operator is documented
in perlop.</p>

<p>More complex regular expressions You don t just have to
match on fixed strings. In fact, you can match on just about
anything you could dream of by using more complex regular
expressions. These are documented at great length in perlre,
but for the meantime, heres a quick cheat sheet:</p>

<p>. a single character a whitespace character (space, tab,
newline, ...) non-whitespace character a digit (0-9) a
non-digit 0 a word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _) W a non-word
character [aeiou] matches a single character in the given
set [^aeiou] matches a single character outside the given
set (foo|bar|baz) matches any of the alternatives
specified</p>

<p>^ start of string $ end of string</p>

<p>Quantifiers can be used to specify how many of the
previous thing you want to match on, where &quot;thing&quot;
means either a literal character, one of the metacharacters
listed above, or a group of characters or metacharacters in
parentheses.</p>

<p>* zero or more of the previous thing + one or more of
the previous thing ? zero or one of the previous thing {3}
matches exactly 3 of the previous thing {3,6} matches
between 3 and 6 of the previous thing {3,} matches 3 or more
of the previous thing</p>

<p>Some brief examples:</p>

<p>/^+/ string starts with one or more digits /^$/ nothing
in the string (start and end are adjacent) /({3}/ a three
digits, each followed by a whitespace character (eg &quot;3
4 5 &quot;) /(a.)+/ matches a string in which every
odd-numbered letter is a (eg &quot;abacadaf&quot;)</p>

<p># This loop reads from STDIN, and prints non-blank
lines: while (&lt;&gt;) { next if /^$/; print; }</p>

<p>Parentheses for capturing As well as grouping,
parentheses serve a second purpose. They can be used to
capture the results of parts of the regexp match for later
use. The results end up in $1, $2 and so on.</p>

<p># a cheap and nasty way to break an email address up
into parts</p>

<p>if ($email =~ /([^@]+)@(.+)/) { print &quot;Username is
$10; print &quot;Hostname is $20; }</p>

<p>Other regexp features Perl regexps also support
backreferences, lookaheads, and all kinds of other complex
details. Read all about them in perlrequick, perlretut, and
perlre.</p>

<p>Writing subroutines Writing subroutines is easy:</p>

<p>sub logger { my $logmessage = shift; open my $logfile,
&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, &quot;my.log&quot; or die &quot;Could
not open my.log: $!&quot;; print $logfile $logmessage; }</p>

<p>Now we can use the subroutine just as any other built-in
function:</p>

<p>logger(&quot;We have a logger subroutine!&quot;);</p>

<p>What s that &quot;shift&quot;? Well, the arguments to a
subroutine are available to us as a special array called @_
(see perlvar for more on that). The default argument to the
&quot;shift&quot; function just happens to be @_. So
&quot;my $logmessage = shift;&quot; shifts the first item
off the list of arguments and assigns it to $logmessage.</p>

<p>We can manipulate @_ in other ways too:</p>

<p>my ($logmessage, $priority) = @_; # common my
$logmessage = $_[0]; # uncommon, and ugly</p>

<p>Subroutines can also return values:</p>

<p>sub square { my $num = shift; my $result = $num * $num;
return $result; }</p>

<p>Then use it like:</p>

<p>$sq = square(8);</p>

<p>For more information on writing subroutines, see
perlsub.</p>

<p>OO Perl OO Perl is relatively simple and is implemented
using references which know what sort of object they are
based on Perl s concept of packages. However, OO Perl is
largely beyond the scope of this document. Read perlboot,
perltoot, perltooc and perlobj.</p>

<p>As a beginning Perl programmer, your most common use of
OO Perl will be in using third-party modules, which are
documented below.</p>

<p>Using Perl modules Perl modules provide a range of
features to help you avoid reinventing the wheel, and can be
downloaded from CPAN ( http://www.cpan.org/ ). A number of
popular modules are included with the Perl distribution
itself.</p>

<p>Categories of modules range from text manipulation to
network protocols to database integration to graphics. A
categorized list of modules is also available from CPAN.</p>

<p>To learn how to install modules you download from CPAN,
read perlmodinstall.</p>

<p>To learn how to use a particular module, use
&quot;perldoc Module::Name&quot;. Typically you will want to
&quot;use Module::Name&quot;, which will then give you
access to exported functions or an OO interface to the
module.</p>

<p>perlfaq contains questions and answers related to many
common tasks, and often provides suggestions for good CPAN
modules to use.</p>

<p>perlmod describes Perl modules in general. perlmodlib
lists the modules which came with your Perl
installation.</p>

<p>If you feel the urge to write Perl modules, perlnewmod
will give you good advice.</p>
