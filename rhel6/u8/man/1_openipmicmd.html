<p>openipmicmd(1) An IPMI Command Interface
openipmicmd(1)</p>

<p>NAME openipmicmd - An IPMI Command Interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS openipmicmd [-k entry-to-execute]
&lt;connection parms&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The openipmicmd program allows a user to
execute direct IPMI commands. It can work with direct
interface with the OpenIPMI driver or with IPMI LAN
interfaces.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -k entry-to-execute Execute a single command an
exit.</p>

<p>&lt;connectionparms&gt; The parameters for the
connection depend on the connection type. These are all
described in openipmi_conparms (7)</p>

<p>COMMANDS Once up, you can execute commands in the user
interface. Note that commands and responses are
asynchronous, you issue a command and the interface returns
immediately. When the response comes back, it will be dumped
on your console. That s a little strange looking, but IPMI
is ansychronous underneath. Note that the -k option is
synchronous, it will wait for the response or a timeout
before returning.</p>

<p>0f lun netfn cmd [data1 [data2 ...]] Send a command to
the BMC you are connected to.</p>

<p>channel [ipmb] IPMB-addr lun netfn [seq] cmd [data1
[data2 ...]] Send a command to a device on the IPMB bus. The
&quot;ipmb&quot; string is optional. The seq must be
provided if the netfn is a response (an odd number). It must
be the same sequence number that came in on the command in
the &quot;Command Sequence = seq&quot; part of the
command.</p>

<p>channel 00 IPMB-addr lun netfn cmd [data1 [data2 ...]]
Send a broadcast command to a device on the IPMB bus.</p>

<p>channel lan handle remote-swid local-swid lun netfn cmd
[data1 [data ...]] Send a command to a device over a LAN
channel. Note that this not the same as a LAN connection.
This sends a message through a local BMC to a remote system
that is hooked up with a LAN con- nection.</p>

<p>test_lat count command Executes the given commands (one
of the previous commands) count times and gives the average
time per command to execute. Note that &quot;count&quot; is
hexadecimal.</p>

<p>help Display some help.</p>

<p>regcmd netfn cmd Register to receive the given command.
If the driver receives an external command, it will print it
out. This only works with system interface connections, it
will not work on LAN connec- tions.</p>

<p>unregcmd netfn cmd Remove a command registration.</p>

openipmi_conparms(7)</p>

<p>KNOWN PROBLEMS The asychronous nature of the program can
be annoying.</p>
