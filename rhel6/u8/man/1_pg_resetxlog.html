<p>PG_RESETXLOG(1) PostgreSQL Server Applications
PG_RESETXLOG(1)</p>

<p>NAME pg_resetxlog - reset the write-ahead log and other
control information of a PostgreSQL database cluster</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pg_resetxlog [ -f ] [ -n ] [ -ooid ] [ -x xid ]
[ -e xid_epoch ] [ -m mxid ] [ -O mxoff ] [ -l
timelineid,fileid,seg ] datadir</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pg_resetxlog clears the write-ahead log
(WAL) and optionally resets some other control information
stored in the pg_control file. This function is sometimes
needed if these files have become corrupted. It should be
used only as a last resort, when the server will not start
due to such corruption.</p>

<p>After running this command, it should be possible to
start the server, but bear in mind that the database might
contain inconsistent data due to partially-committed
transactions. You should immediately dump your data, run
initdb, and reload. After reload, check for inconsistencies
and repair as needed.</p>

<p>This utility can only be run by the user who installed
the server, because it requires read/write access to the
data directory. For safety reasons, you must specify the
data directory on the command line. pg_resetxlog does not
use the environment variable PGDATA.</p>

<p>If pg_resetxlog complains that it cannot determine valid
data for pg_control, you can force it to proceed anyway by
specifying the -f (force) switch. In this case plausible
values will be substituted for the missing data. Most of the
fields can be expected to match, but man- ual assistance
might be needed for the next OID, next transaction ID and
epoch, next multitransaction ID and offset, and WAL starting
address fields. These fields can be set using the switches
discussed below. If you are not able to determine correct
values for all these fields, -f can still be used, but the
recovered database must be treated with even more suspicion
than usual: an immediate dump and reload is imperative. Do
not execute any data-modifying operations in the database
before you dump, as any such action is likely to make the
corruption worse.</p>

<p>The -o, -x, -e, -m, -O, and -l switches allow the next
OID, next trans- action ID, next transaction ID s epoch,
next multitransaction ID, next multitransaction offset, and
WAL starting address values to be set man- ually. These are
only needed when pg_resetxlog is unable to determine
appropriate values by reading pg_control. Safe values can be
determined as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; A safe value for the next transaction ID (-x)
can be determined by looking for the numerically largest
file name in the directory pg_clog under the data directory,
adding one, and then multiplying by 1048576. Note that the
file names are in hexadecimal. It is usually easiest to
specify the switch value in hexadecimal too. For example, if
0011 is the largest entry in pg_clog, -x 0x1200000 will work
(five trailing zeroes provide the proper multiplier).</p>

<p>&middot; A safe value for the next multitransaction ID
(-m) can be determined by looking for the numerically
largest file name in the directory pg_multixact/offsets
under the data directory, adding one, and then multiplying
by 65536. As above, the file names are in hexadecimal, so
the easiest way to do this is to specify the switch value in
hexadec- imal and add four zeroes.</p>

<p>&middot; A safe value for the next multitransaction
offset (-O) can be deter- mined by looking for the
numerically largest file name in the direc- tory
pg_multixact/members under the data directory, adding one,
and then multiplying by 65536. As above, the file names are
in hexadeci- mal, so the easiest way to do this is to
specify the switch value in hexadecimal and add four
zeroes.</p>

<p>&middot; The WAL starting address (-l) should be larger
than any WAL segment file name currently existing in the
directory pg_xlog under the data directory. These names are
also in hexadecimal and have three parts. The first part is
the timeline ID and should usually be kept the same. Do not
choose a value larger than 255 (0xFF) for the third part;
instead increment the second part and reset the third part
to 0. For example, if 00000001000000320000004A is the
largest entry in pg_xlog, -l 0x1,0x32,0x4B will work; but if
the largest entry is 000000010000003A000000FF, choose -l
0x1,0x3B,0x0 or more.</p>

<p>Note: pg_resetxlog itself looks at the files in pg_xlog
and chooses a default -l setting beyond the last existing
file name. Therefore, manual adjustment of -l should only be
needed if you are aware of WAL segment files that are not
currently present in pg_xlog, such as entries in an offline
archive; or if the contents of pg_xlog have been lost
entirely.</p>

<p>&middot; There is no comparably easy way to determine a
next OID thats beyond the largest one in the database, but
fortunately it is not critical to get the next-OID setting
right.</p>

<p>&middot; The transaction ID epoch is not actually stored
anywhere in the database except in the field that is set by
pg_resetxlog, so any value will work so far as the database
itself is concerned. You might need to adjust this value to
ensure that replication systems such as Slony-I work
correctly if so, an appropriate value should be obtainable
from the state of the downstream replicated database.</p>

<p>The -n (no operation) switch instructs pg_resetxlog to
print the values reconstructed from pg_control and then exit
without modifying anything. This is mainly a debugging tool,
but can be useful as a sanity check before allowing
pg_resetxlog to proceed for real.</p>

<p>NOTES This command must not be used when the server is
running. pg_resetxlog will refuse to start up if it finds a
server lock file in the data directory. If the server
crashed then a lock file might have been left behind; in
that case you can remove the lock file to allow pg_resetxlog
to run. But before you do so, make doubly certain that there
is no server process still alive.</p>
