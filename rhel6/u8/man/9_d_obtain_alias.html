<p>D_OBTAIN_ALIAS(9) The Linux VFS D_OBTAIN_ALIAS(9)</p>

<p>NAME d_obtain_alias - find or allocate a dentry for a
given inode</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct dentry * d_obtain_alias(struct inode *
inode);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS inode inode to allocate the dentry for</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Obtain a dentry for an inode resulting from
NFS filehandle conversion or similar open by handle
operations. The returned dentry may be anonymous, or may
have a full name (if the inode was already in the
cache).</p>

<p>When called on a directory inode, we must ensure that
the inode only ever has one dentry. If a dentry is found,
that is returned instead of allocating a new one.</p>

<p>On successful return, the reference to the inode has
been transferred to the dentry. In case of an error the
reference on the inode is released. To make it easier to use
in export operations a NULL or IS_ERR inode may be passed in
and will be the error will be propagate to the return value,
with a NULL inode replaced by ERR_PTR(-ESTALE).</p>
