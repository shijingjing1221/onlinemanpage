<p>NAME fenv.h - floating-point environment</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;fenv.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &lt;fenv.h&gt; header shall define the
following data types through type- def:</p>

<p>fenv_t Represents the entire floating-point environment.
The floating- point environment refers collectively to any
floating-point sta- tus flags and control modes supported by
the implementation.</p>

<p>fexcept_t Represents the floating-point status flags
collectively, includ- ing any status the implementation
associates with the flags. A floating-point status flag is a
system variable whose value is set (but never cleared) when
a floating-point exception is raised, which occurs as a side
effect of exceptional floating- point arithmetic to provide
auxiliary information. A floating- point control mode is a
system variable whose value may be set by the user to affect
the subsequent behavior of floating-point arithmetic.</p>

<p>The &lt;fenv.h&gt; header shall define the following
constants if and only if the implementation supports the
floating-point exception by means of the floating-point
functions feclearexcept(), fegetexceptflag(),
feraiseexcept(), fesetexceptflag(), and fetestexcept(). Each
expands to an integer constant expression with values such
that bitwise-inclusive ORs of all combinations of the
constants result in distinct values.</p>

<p>FE_DIVBYZERO FE_INEXACT FE_INVALID FE_OVERFLOW
FE_UNDERFLOW</p>

<p>The &lt;fenv.h&gt; header shall define the following
constant, which is sim- ply the bitwise-inclusive OR of all
floating-point exception constants defined above:</p>

<p>FE_ALL_EXCEPT</p>

<p>The &lt;fenv.h&gt; header shall define the following
constants if and only if the implementation supports getting
and setting the represented round- ing direction by means of
the fegetround() and fesetround() functions. Each expands to
an integer constant expression whose values are dis- tinct
non-negative vales.</p>

<p>FE_DOWNWARD FE_TONEAREST FE_TOWARDZERO FE_UPWARD</p>

<p>The &lt;fenv.h&gt; header shall define the following
constant, which repre- sents the default floating-point
environment (that is, the one installed at program startup)
and has type pointer to const-qualified fenv_t. It can be
used as an argument to the functions within the
&lt;fenv.h&gt; header that manage the floating-point
environment.</p>

<p>FE_DFL_ENV</p>

<p>The following shall be declared as functions and may
also be defined as macros. Function prototypes shall be
provided.</p>

<p>int feclearexcept(int); int fegetexceptflag(fexcept_t *,
int); int feraiseexcept(int); int fesetexceptflag(const
fexcept_t *, int); int fetestexcept(int); int
fegetround(void); int fesetround(int); int fegetenv(fenv_t
*); int feholdexcept(fenv_t *); int fesetenv(const fenv_t
*); int feupdateenv(const fenv_t *);</p>

<p>The FENV_ACCESS pragma provides a means to inform the
implementation when an application might access the
floating-point environment to test floating-point status
flags or run under non-default floating-point control modes.
The pragma shall occur either outside external declara-
tions or preceding all explicit declarations and statements
inside a compound statement. When outside external
declarations, the pragma takes effect from its occurrence
until another FENV_ACCESS pragma is encountered, or until
the end of the translation unit. When inside a compound
statement, the pragma takes effect from its occurrence until
another FENV_ACCESS pragma is encountered (including within
a nested compound statement), or until the end of the
compound statement; at the end of a compound statement the
state for the pragma is restored to its condition just
before the compound statement. If this pragma is used in any
other context, the behavior is undefined. If part of an
application tests floating-point status flags, sets
floating-point control modes, or runs under non-default mode
settings, but was translated with the state for the
FENV_ACCESS pragma off, the behavior is undefined. The
default state (on or off) for the pragma is
implementation-defined. (When execution passes from a part
of the application translated with FENV_ACCESS off to a part
translated with FENV_ACCESS on, the state of the
floating-point status flags is unspecified and the
floating-point control modes have their default
settings.)</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE This header is designed to support the
floating-point exception status flags and directed-rounding
control modes required by the IEC 60559:1989 standard, and
other similar floating-point state infor- mation. Also it is
designed to facilitate code portability among all
systems.</p>

<p>Certain application programming conventions support the
intended model of use for the floating-point
environment:</p>

<p>* A function call does not alter its caller s
floating-point control modes, clear its callers
floating-point status flags, nor depend on the state of its
callers floating-point status flags unless the function is
so documented.</p>

<p>* A function call is assumed to require default
floating-point control modes, unless its documentation
promises otherwise.</p>

<p>* A function call is assumed to have the potential for
raising float- ing-point exceptions, unless its
documentation promises otherwise.</p>

<p>With these conventions, an application can safely assume
default float- ing-point control modes (or be unaware of
them). The responsibilities associated with accessing the
floating-point environment fall on the application that does
so explicitly.</p>

<p>Even though the rounding direction macros may expand to
constants cor- responding to the values of FLT_ROUNDS, they
are not required to do so.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>#include &lt;fenv.h&gt; void f(double x) { #pragma STDC
FENV_ACCESS ON void g(double); void h(double); /* ... */ g(x
+ 1); h(x + 1); /* ... */ }</p>

<p>If the function g() might depend on status flags set as
a side effect of the first x+1, or if the second x+1 might
depend on control modes set as a side effect of the call to
function g(), then the application shall contain an
appropriately placed invocation as follows:</p>

<p>#pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON</p>

<p>RATIONALE The fexcept_t Type fexcept_t does not have to
be an integer type. Its values must be obtained by a call to
fegetexceptflag(), and cannot be created by logi- cal
operations from the exception macros. An implementation
might sim- ply implement fexcept_t as an int and use the
representations reflected by the exception macros, but is
not required to; other representations might contain extra
information about the exceptions. fexcept_t might be a
struct with a member for each exception (that might hold the
address of the first or last floating-point instruction that
caused that exception). The ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard makes
no claims about the internals of an fexcept_t, and so the
user cannot inspect it.</p>

<p>Exception and Rounding Macros Macros corresponding to
unsupported modes and rounding directions are not defined by
the implementation and must not be defined by the appli-
cation. An application might use #ifdef to test for
this.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
