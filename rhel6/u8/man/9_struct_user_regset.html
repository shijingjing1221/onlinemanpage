<p>STRUCT USER_REGSET(9) Machine State STRUCT
USER_REGSET(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_user_regset - accessible thread CPU
state</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct user_regset { user_regset_get_fn * get;
user_regset_set_fn * set; user_regset_active_fn * active;
user_regset_writeback_fn * writeback; unsigned int n;
unsigned int size; unsigned int align; unsigned int bias;
unsigned int core_note_type; };</p>

<p>MEMBERS get Function to fetch values.</p>

<p>set Function to store values.</p>

<p>active Function to report if regset is active, or
NULL.</p>

<p>writeback Function to write data back to user memory, or
NULL.</p>

<p>n Number of slots (registers).</p>

<p>size Size in bytes of a slot (register).</p>

<p>align Required alignment, in bytes.</p>

<p>bias Bias from natural indexing.</p>

<p>core_note_type ELF note n_type value used in core
dumps.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This data structure describes a machine
resource we call a register set. This is part of the state
of an individual thread, not necessarily actual CPU
registers per se. A register set consists of a number of
similar slots, given by n. Each slot is size bytes, and
aligned to align bytes (which is at least size).</p>

<p>These functions must be called only on the current
thread or on a thread that is in TASK_STOPPED or TASK_TRACED
state, that we are guaranteed will not be woken up and
return to user mode, and that we have called
wait_task_inactive on. (The target thread always might wake
up for SIGKILL while these functions are working, in which
case that thread&acute;s user_regset state might be
scrambled.)</p>

<p>The pos argument must be aligned according to align; the
count argument must be a multiple of size. These functions
are not responsible for checking for invalid arguments.</p>

<p>When there is a natural value to use as an index, bias
gives the difference between the natural index and the slot
index for the register set. For example, x86 GDT segment
descriptors form a regset; the segment selector produces a
natural index, but only a subset of that index space is
available as a regset (the TLS slots); subtracting bias from
a segment selector index value computes the regset slot.</p>

<p>If nonzero, core_note_type gives the n_type field (NT_*
value) of the core file note in which this regset&acute;s
data appears. NT_PRSTATUS is a special case in that the
regset data starts at offsetof(struct elf_prstatus, pr_reg)
into the note data; that is part of the per-machine ELF
formats userland knows about. In other cases, the core file
note contains exactly the whole regset (n * size) and
nothing else. The core file note is normally omitted when
there is an active function and it returns zero.</p>
