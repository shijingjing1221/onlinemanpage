<p>AC(1) AC(1)</p>

<p>NAME ac - print statistics about users connect time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ac [ -d | --daily-totals ] [ -y | --print-year
] [ -p | --individual-totals ] [ people ] [ -f | --file
filename ] [ -a | --all-days ] [ --complain ] [ --reboots ]
[ --supplants ] [ --timewarps ] [ --compatibility ] [
--tw-leniency num ] [ --tw-suspicious num ] [ -z |
--print-zeros ] [ --debug ] [ -V | --version ] [ -h | --help
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ac prints out a report of connect time (in
hours) based on the lo- gins/logouts in the current wtmp
file. A total is also printed out.</p>

<p>The accounting file wtmp is maintained by init(8) and
login(1). Nei- ther ac nor login creates the wtmp if it
doesnt exist, no accounting is done. To begin accounting,
create the file with a length of zero.</p>

<p>NOTE: The wtmp file can get really big, really fast. You
might want to trim it every once and a while.</p>

<p>GNU ac works nearly the same u*x ac, though it s a
little smarter in several ways. You should therefore expect
differences in the output of GNU ac and the output of acs on
other systems. Use the command info accounting to get
additional information.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d, --daily-totals Print totals for each day
rather than just one big total at the end. The output looks
like this: Jul 3 total 1.17 Jul 4 total 2.10 Jul 5 total
8.23 Jul 6 total 2.10 Jul 7 total 0.30</p>

<p>-p, --individual-totals Print time totals for each user
in addition to the usual every- thing-lumped-into-one value.
It looks like: bob 8.06 goff 0.60 maley 7.37 root 0.12 total
16.15</p>

<p>people Print out the sum total of the connect time used
by all of the users included in people. Note that people is
a space separated list of valid user names; wildcards are
not allowed.</p>

<p>-f, --file filename Read from the file filename instead
of the system s wtmp file.</p>

<p>--complain When the wtmp file has a problem (a
time-warp, missing record, or whatever), print out an
appropriate error.</p>

<p>--reboots Reboot records are NOT written at the time of
a reboot, but when the system restarts; therefore, it is
impossible to know exactly when the reboot occurred. Users
may have been logged into the system at the time of the
reboot, and many as automatically count the time between the
login and the reboot record against the user (even though
all of that time shouldnt be, perhaps, if the system is down
for a long time, for instance). If you want to count this
time, include the flag. *For vanilla ac compati- bility,
include this flag.*</p>

<p>--supplants Sometimes, a logout record is not written
for a specific termi- nal, so the time that the last user
accrued cannot be calculat- ed. If you want to include the
time from the users login to the next login on the terminal
(though probably incorrect), in- clude this you want to
include the time from the users login to the next login on
the terminal (though probably incorrect), in- clude this
flag. *For vanilla ac compatibility, include this flag.*</p>

<p>--timewarps Sometimes, entries in a wtmp file will
suddenly jump back into the past without a clock change
record occurring. It is impos- sible to know how long a user
was logged in when this occurs. If you want to count the
time between the login and the time warp against the user,
include this flag. *For vanilla ac com- patibility, include
this flag.*</p>

<p>--compatibility This is shorthand for typing out the
three above options.</p>

<p>-a, --all-days If we re printing daily totals, print a
record for every day in- stead of skipping intervening days
where there is no login ac- tivity. Without this flag, time
accrued during those interven- ing days gets listed under
the next day where there is login ac- tivity.</p>

<p>--tw-leniency num Set the time warp leniency to num
seconds. Records in wtmp files might be slightly out of
order (most notably when two lo- gins occur within a
one-second period - the second one gets written first). By
default, this value is set to 60. If the program notices
this problem, time is not assigned to users un- less the
--timewarps flag is used.</p>

<p>--tw-suspicious num Set the time warp suspicious value
to num seconds. If two records in the wtmp file are farther
than this number of seconds apart, there is a problem with
the wtmp file (or your machine hasn t been used in a year).
If the program notices this prob- lem, time is not assigned
to users unless the --timewarps flag is used.</p>

<p>-y, --print-year Print year when displaying dates.</p>

<p>-z, --print-zeros If a total for any category (save the
grand total) is zero, print it. The default is to suppress
printing.</p>

<p>--debug Print verbose internal information.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print the version number of ac to standard
output and quit.</p>

<p>-h, --help Prints the usage string and default locations
of system files to standard output and exits.</p>

<p>FILES wtmp The system wide login record file. See
wtmp(5) for further de- tails.</p>
