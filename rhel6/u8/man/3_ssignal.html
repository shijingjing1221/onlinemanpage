<p>GSIGNAL(3) Linux Programmer s Manual GSIGNAL(3)</p>

<p>NAME gsignal, ssignal - software signal facility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int);</p>

<p>int gsignal(intsignum);</p>

<p>sighandler_t ssignal(int signum, sighandler_t
action);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>gsignal(), ssignal(): _SVID_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Don t use these functions under Linux. Due
to a historical mistake, under Linux these functions are
aliases for raise(3) and signal(2), respectively.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, on System V-like systems, these functions
implement software signaling, entirely independent of the
classical signal(2) and kill(2) functions. The function
ssignal() defines the action to take when the software
signal with number signum is raised using the function gsig-
nal(), and returns the previous such action or SIG_DFL. The
function gsignal() does the following: if no action (or the
action SIG_DFL) was specified for signum, then it does
nothing and returns 0. If the action SIG_IGN was specified
for signum, then it does nothing and returns 1. Otherwise,
it resets the action to SIG_DFL and calls the action
function with argument signum, and returns the value
returned by that function. The range of possible values
signum varies (often 1-15 or 1-17).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These functions are available under AIX,
DG/UX, HP-UX, SCO, Solaris, Tru64. They are called obsolete
under most of these systems, and are broken under Linux libc
and glibc. Some systems also have gsignal_r() and
ssignal_r().</p>
