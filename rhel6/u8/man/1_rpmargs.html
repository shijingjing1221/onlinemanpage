<p>NAME rpmargs - process RPM packages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rpmargs [-h] -c command [-p] [FILE...]
[DIR...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rpmargs executes a command against each RPM
package given on the command line. Extra word splitting is
performed on the command. Each FILE is treated as RPM
package. Each DIR is processed with &quot;*.rpm&quot;
pattern, and RPM file basename is prepended to the command
output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p When processing a directory, list package
names, not file names; furthermore, enable special treatment
of packages with the same name; that is, process only the
one with the latest version.</p>

<p>-h Display this help and exit.</p>
