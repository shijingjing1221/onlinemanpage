<p>NAMED(8) BIND9 NAMED(8)</p>

<p>NAME named - Internet domain name server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS named [-4] [-6] [-c config-file] [-d
debug-level] [-E engine-name] [-f] [-g] [-m flag] [-n #cpus]
[-p port] [-s] [-S #max-socks] [-t directory] [-u user] [-v]
[-V] [-x cache-file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION named is a Domain Name System (DNS) server,
part of the BIND 9 distribution from ISC. For more
information on the DNS, see RFCs 1033, 1034, and 1035.</p>

<p>When invoked without arguments, named will read the
default configuration file /etc/named.conf, read any initial
data, and listen for queries.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -4 Use IPv4 only even if the host machine is
capable of IPv6. -4 and -6 are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>-6 Use IPv6 only even if the host machine is capable of
IPv4. -4 and -6 are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>-c config-file Use config-file as the configuration file
instead of the default, /etc/named.conf. To ensure that
reloading the configuration file continues to work after the
server has changed its working directory due to to a
possible directory option in the configuration file,
config-file should be an absolute pathname.</p>

<p>-d debug-level Set the daemons debug level to
debug-level. Debugging traces from named become more verbose
as the debug level increases.</p>

<p>-E engine-name Use a crypto hardware (OpenSSL engine)
for the crypto operations it supports, for instance
re-signing with private keys from a secure key store. When
compiled with PKCS#11 support engine-name defaults to
pkcs11, the empty name resets it to no engine.</p>

<p>-f Run the server in the foreground (i.e. do not
daemonize).</p>

<p>-g Run the server in the foreground and force all
logging to stderr.</p>

<p>-m flag Turn on memory usage debugging flags. Possible
flags are usage, trace, record, size, and mctx. These
correspond to the ISC_MEM_DEBUGXXXX flags described in
&lt;isc/mem.h&gt;.</p>

<p>-n #cpus Create #cpus worker threads to take advantage
of multiple CPUs. If not specified, named will try to
determine the number of CPUs present and create one thread
per CPU. If it is unable to determine the number of CPUs, a
single worker thread will be created.</p>

<p>-p port Listen for queries on port port. If not
specified, the default is port 53.</p>

<p>-s Write memory usage statistics to stdout on exit.
Note: This option is mainly of interest to BIND 9 developers
and may be removed or changed in a future release.</p>

<p>-S #max-socks Allow named to use up to #max-socks
sockets. Warning: This option should be unnecessary for the
vast majority of users. The use of this option could even be
harmful because the specified value may exceed the
limitation of the underlying system API. It is therefore set
only when the default configuration causes exhaustion of
file descriptors and the operational environment is known to
support the specified number of sockets. Note also that the
actual maximum number is normally a little fewer than the
specified value because named reserves some file descriptors
for its internal use.</p>

<p>-t directory Chroot to directory after processing the
command line arguments, but before reading the configuration
file. Warning: This option should be used in conjunction
with the -u option, as chrooting a process running as root
doesnt enhance security on most systems; the way chroot(2)
is defined allows a process with root privileges to escape a
chroot jail.</p>

<p>-u user Setuid to user after completing privileged
operations, such as creating sockets that listen on
privileged ports. Note: On Linux, named uses the kernel s
capability mechanism to drop all root privileges except the
ability to bind(2) to a privileged port and set process
resource limits. Unfortunately, this means that the -u
option only works when named is run on kernel 2.2.18 or
later, or kernel 2.3.99-pre3 or later, since previous
kernels did not allow privileges to be retained after
setuid(2).</p>

<p>-v Report the version number and exit.</p>

<p>-V Report the version number and build options, and
exit.</p>

<p>-x cache-file Load data from cache-file into the cache
of the default view. Warning: This option must not be used.
It is only of interest to BIND 9 developers and may be
removed or changed in a future release.</p>

<p>SIGNALS In routine operation, signals should not be used
to control the nameserver; rndc should be used instead.</p>

<p>SIGHUP Force a reload of the server.</p>

<p>SIGINT, SIGTERM Shut down the server.</p>

<p>The result of sending any other signals to the server is
undefined.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The named configuration file is too
complex to describe in detail here. A complete description
is provided in the BIND 9 Administrator Reference
Manual.</p>

<p>named inherits the umask (file creation mode mask) from
the parent process. If files created by named, such as
journal files, need to have custom permissions, the umask
should be set explicitly in the script used to start the
named process.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/named.conf The default configuration
file.</p>

<p>/var/run/named/named.pid The default process-id
file.</p>

<p>NOTES Red Hat SELinux BIND Security Profile:</p>

<p>By default, Red Hat ships BIND with the most secure
SELinux policy that will not prevent normal BIND operation
and will prevent exploitation of all known BIND security
vulnerabilities . See the selinux(8) man page for
information about SElinux.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to run named in a chroot environment
if the Red Hat SELinux policy for named is enabled. When
enabled, this policy is far more secure than a chroot
environment. Users are recommended to enable SELinux and
remove the bind-chroot package.</p>

<p>With this extra security comes some restrictions:</p>

<p>By default, the SELinux policy does not allow named to
write any master zone database files. Only the root user may
create files in the $ROOTDIR/var/named zone database file
directory (the options { &quot;directory&quot; } option),
where $ROOTDIR is set in /etc/sysconfig/named.</p>

<p>The &quot;named&quot; group must be granted read
privelege to these files in order for named to be enabled to
read them.</p>

<p>Any file created in the zone database file directory is
automatically assigned the SELinux file context named_zone_t
.</p>

<p>By default, SELinux prevents any role from modifying
named_zone_t files; this means that files in the zone
database directory cannot be modified by dynamic DNS (DDNS)
updates or zone transfers.</p>

<p>The Red Hat BIND distribution and SELinux policy creates
three directories where named is allowed to create and
modify files: /var/named/slaves, /var/named/dynamic
/var/named/data. By placing files you want named to modify,
such as slave or DDNS updateable zone files and database /
statistics dump files in these directories, named will work
normally and no further operator action is required. Files
in these directories are automatically assigned the
named_cache_t file context, which SELinux allows named to
write.</p>

<p>Red Hat BIND SDB support:</p>

<p>Red Hat ships named with compiled in Simplified Database
Backend modules that ISC provides in the
&quot;contrib/sdb&quot; directory. Install bind- sdb package
if you want use them</p>

<p>The SDB modules for LDAP, PostGreSQL, DirDB and SQLite
are compiled into named-sdb.</p>

<p>See the documentation for the various SDB modules in
/usr/share/doc/bind-sdb-*/ .</p>
