<p>sane-bh(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy sane-bh(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-bh - SANE backend for Bell+Howell Copiscan II
series document scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-bh library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
Bell+Howell Copiscan II series document scan- ners. The
Copiscan II 6338 has been the primary scanner model used
during development and testing, but since the programming
interface for the entire series is consistent the backend
should work for the follow- ing scanner models.</p>

<p>COPISCAN II 6338 Duplex Scanner with ACE COPISCAN II
2135 Simplex Scanner COPISCAN II 2137(A) Simplex Scanner
(with ACE) COPISCAN II 2138A Simplex Scanner with ACE
COPISCAN II 3238 Simplex Scanner COPISCAN II 3338(A) Simplex
Scanner (with ACE)</p>

<p>If you have a Bell+Howell scanner and are able to test
it with this backend, please contact
sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org with the model number and
testing results. Have a look at
http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html concerning
subscription to sane-devel. Additionally, the author is
curious as to the likelihood of using this backend with the
newer 4000 and 8000 series scanners. If you have such a
beast, please let me know.</p>

<p>The Bell+Howell Copiscan II series document scanners are
high volume, high throughput scanners designed for document
scanning applications. As such, they are lineart/grayscale
scanners supporting a fixed number of fairly low resolutions
(e.g. 200/240/300dpi). However, they do have a number of
interesting and useful features suited to needs of document
imaging applications. This backend attempts to support as
many of these features as possible.</p>

<p>The main technical reference used in writing this
backend is the Bell and Howell Copiscan II Remote SCSI
Controller (RSC) OEM Technical Man- ual Version 1.5. The
Linux SCSI programming HOWTO, the SANE API docu- mentation,
and SANE source code were also extremely valuable
resources.</p>

<p>The latest backend release, additional information and
helpful hints are available from the backend homepage:
http://www.martoneconsulting.com/sane-bh.html</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is the path-name for the special device
that corresponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI scanners, the
special device name must be a generic SCSI device or a
symlink to such a device. Under Linux, such a device name
takes a format such as /dev/sga or /dev/sg0, for example.
See sane-scsi(5) for details.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the bh.conf file is a list
of device names that corre- spond to Bell+Howell scanners.
See sane-scsi(5) on details of what constitutes a valid
device name. Additionally, options can be speci- fied; these
lines begin with the word &quot;option&quot;. Each option is
described in detail below. Empty lines and lines starting
with a hash mark (#) are ignored.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options can be specified in the
bh.conf file.</p>

<p>disable-optional-frames This option prevents the backend
from sending any optional frames. This option may be useful
when dealing with frontends which do not support these
optional frames. When this option is in effect, the data is
sent in a SANE_FRAME_GRAY frame. The optional frames sent by
this backend are: SANE_FRAME_G31D, SANE_FRAME_G32D,
SANE_FRAME_G42D and SANE_FRAME_TEXT. These frames are
generated based on the compression and barcode options.
These frames are never sent in preview mode.</p>

<p>fake-inquiry This option is used for debugging purposes
and its use is not encouraged. Essentially, it allows the
backend to initialize in the absence of a scanner. This is
useful for development and not much else. This option must
be specified earlier in the configuration file than the
devices which are to be &quot;faked&quot;.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/bh.conf The backend configuration file
(see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-bh.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-bh.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_BH If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 255 requests
all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels reduce
verbosity.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED FEATURES ADF support With document scanners,
automatic document feeder (ADF) support is a key feature.
The backend supports the ADF by default and returns
SANE_STATUS_NO_DOCS when the out-of-paper condition is
detected. The SANE frontend scanadf is a command line
frontend that supports multi-page scans. It has been used
successfully with this backend. The SANE frontend xsane is
an improved GUI frontend by Oliver Rauch. Support for
multi-page scans is included in xsane version 0.35 and
above.</p>

<p>Duplex scanning Some models, such as the COPISCAN II
6338, support duplex scan- ning. That is, they scan both
sides of the document during a single pass through the
scanner (the scanner has two cameras). This backend supports
duplex scanning (with the --duplex option). The front and
back page images are delivered consecu- tively as if they
were separately scanned pages.</p>

<p>Hardware compression The scanner is capable of
compressing the data into several industry standard formats
(CCITT G3, CCITT G3-2D, CCITT G4). This results in increased
performance as less data is passed from the scanner to the
host over the SCSI bus. The backend supports these
compression formats via the --g31d, --g32d, --g42d options,
respectively. Many SANE frontends are not equipped to deal
with these formats, however. The SANE frontend scanadf
supports these optional frame formats. The compressed image
data is written directly to a file and can then be pro-
cessed by a scan-script using the --scan-script option.
Exam- ples of this are given on the scanadf homepage.</p>

<p>Automatic Border Detection The scanner can automatically
detect the paper size and adjust the scanning window
geometry appropriately. The backend sup- ports this useful
feature with the --autoborder option. It is enabled by
default.</p>

<p>Batch Mode Scanning The batch scan mode allows for
maximum throughput. The Set Win- dow parameters must remain
constant during the entire batch.</p>

<p>Icon Generation The Icon function generates a thumbnail
of the full page image, that can be transferred as if it
were a separate page. This allows the host to quickly
display a thumbnail representation during the scanning
operation. Perhaps this would be a great way of implementing
a preview scan, but since a normal scan is so quick, it
might not be worth the trouble.</p>

<p>Multiple Sections Multiple sections (scanning
sub-windows) can be defined for the front and back pages.
Each section can have different charac- teristics (e.g.
geometry, compression). The sections are returned as if they
were separately scanned images. Addition- ally sections can
be used to greatly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of
the barcode/patchcode decoding process by limiting the
search area to a small subset of the page. Most Copiscan II
series scanners support up to 8 user-defined sections.</p>

<p>Support Barcode/Patchcode Decoding The RSC unit can
recognize Bar and Patch Codes of various types embedded in
the scanned image. The codes are decoded and the data is
returned to the frontend as a text frame. The text is
encoded in xml and contains a great deal of information
about the decoded data such as the location where it was
found, its orientation, and the time it took to find.
Further information on the content of this text frame as
well as some barcode decod- ing examples can be found on the
backend homepage.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Decoding a single barcode type per scan The
RSC unit can search for up to six different barcode types at
a time. While the code generally supports this as well, the
--barcode-search-bar option only allows the user to specify
a single barcode type. Perhaps another option which allows a
comma separated list of barcode type codes could be added to
address this.</p>

<p>Scanning a fixed number of pages in batch mode The
separation of front and back end functionality in SANE
presents a problem in supporting the cancel batch
functional- ity in the scanner. In batch mode, the scanner
is always a page ahead of the host. The host, knowing ahead
of time which page will be the last, can cancel batch mode
prior to initiating the last scan command. Currently, there
is no mechanism available for the frontend to pass this
knowledge to the backend. If batch mode is enabled and the
--end-count terminates a scanadf session, an extra page will
be pulled through the scanner, but is neither read nor
delivered to the frontend. The issue can be avoided by
specifying --batch=no when scanning a fixed number of
pages.</p>

<p>Revision 1.2 Patch detector There is an enhanced
patchcode detection algorithm available in the RSC with
revision 1.2 or higher that is faster and more reliable than
the standard Bar/Patch code decoder. This is not currently
supported.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Scan Mode Options:</p>

<p>--preview[=(yes|no)] [no] Request a preview-quality
scan. When preview is set to yes image compression is
disabled and the image is delivered in a SANE_FRAME_GRAY
frame.</p>

<p>--mode lineart|halftone [lineart] Selects the scan mode
(e.g., lineart,monochrome, or color).</p>

<p>--resolution 200|240|300dpi [200] Sets the resolution of
the scanned image. Each scanner model supports a list of
standard resolutions; only these resolutions can be
used.</p>

<p>--compression none|g31d|g32d|g42d [none] Sets the
compression mode of the scanner. Determines the type of data
returned from the scanner. Values are: none - uncompressed
data - delivered in a SANE_FRAME_GRAY frame g31d - CCITT G3
1 dimension (MH) - delivered in a SANE_FRAME_G31D frame g32d
- CCITT G3 2 dimensions (MR, K=4) - delivered in a
SANE_FRAME_G32D frame g42d - CCITT G4 (MMR) - delivered in a
SANE_FRAME_G42D frame NOTE: The use of g31d, g32d, and g42d
compression values causes the backend to generate optional
frame formats which may not be supported by all SANE
frontends.</p>

<p>Geometry Options:</p>

<p>--autoborder[=(yes|no)] [yes] Enable/Disable automatic
image border detection. When enabled, the RSC unit
automatically detects the image area and sets the window
geometry to match.</p>

<p>--paper-size Custom|Letter|Legal|A3|A4|A5|A6|B4|B5
[Custom] Specify the scan window geometry by specifying the
paper size of the documents to be scanned.</p>

<p>--tl-x 0..297.18mm [0] Top-left x position of scan
area.</p>

<p>--tl-y 0..431.8mm [0] Top-left y position of scan
area.</p>

<p>--br-x 0..297.18mm [297.18] Bottom-right x position of
scan area.</p>

<p>--br-y 0..431.8mm [431.8] Bottom-right y position of
scan area.</p>

<p>Feeder Options:</p>

<p>--source Automatic Document Feeder|Manual Feed Tray
[Automatic Document Feeder] Selects the scan source (such as
a document feeder). This option is provided to allow
multiple image scans with xsane; it has no other
purpose.</p>

<p>--batch[=(yes|no)] [no] Enable/disable batch mode
scanning. Batch mode allows scanning at maximum throughput
by buffering within the RSC unit. This option is recommended
when performing multiple pages scans until the feeder is
emptied.</p>

<p>--duplex[=(yes|no)] [no] Enable duplex (dual-sided)
scanning. The scanner takes an image of each side of the
document during a single pass through the scanner. The front
page is delivered followed by the back page. Most options,
such as compression, affect both the front and back
pages.</p>

<p>--timeout-adf 0..255 [0] Sets the timeout in seconds for
the automatic document feeder (ADF). The value 0 specifies
the hardware default value which varies based on the scanner
model.</p>

<p>--timeout-manual 0..255 [0] Sets the timeout in seconds
for semi-automatic feeder. The value 0 specifies the
hardware default value which varies based on the scanner
model.</p>

<p>--check-adf[=(yes|no)] [no] Check ADF Status prior to
starting scan using the OBJECT POSI- TION command. Note that
this feature requires RSC firmware level 1.5 or higher and
dip switch 4 must be in the on position. NOTE: This option
has not been tested extensively and may pro- duce
undesirable results.</p>

<p>Enhancement:</p>

<p>--control-panel[=(yes|no)] [yes] Enables the scanner s
control panel for selecting image enhance- ment parameters.
When the option is set to no the following options are used
to control image enhancement. See the Bell+Howell scanner
users guide for complete information on ACE
functionality.</p>

<p>--ace-function -4..4 [3] Specify the Automatic Contrast
Enhancement (ACE) Function.</p>

<p>--ace-sensitivity 0..9 [5] Specify the Automatic
Contrast Enhancement (ACE) Sensitivity.</p>

<p>--brightness 0..255 [0] Controls the brightness of the
acquired image. Ignored for ACE capable scanners.</p>

<p>--threshold 0..255 [0] Select minimum-brightness to get
a white point. Ignored for ACE capable scanners.</p>

<p>--contrast 0..255 [inactive] Controls the contrast of
the acquired image. This option is not currently used by the
scanner (and perhaps never will be).</p>

<p>--negative[=(yes|no)] [no] Swap black and white,
yielding a reverse-video image.</p>

<p>Icon:</p>

<p>--icon-width 0..3600pel (in steps of 8) [0] Width of
icon (thumbnail) image in pixels.</p>

<p>--icon-length 0..3600pel (in steps of 8) [0] Length of
icon (thumbnail) image in pixels.</p>

<p>Barcode Options:</p>

<p>--barcode-search-bar &lt;see list&gt; [none] Specifies
the barcode type to search for. If this option is not
specified, or specified with a value of none, then the
barcode decoding feature is completely disabled. The valid
barcode type are: none ean-8 ean-13 reserved-ean-add code39
code2-5-interleaved code2-5-3lines-matrix
code2-5-3lines-datalogic code2-5-5lines-industrial patchcode
codabar codabar-with-start-stop code39ascii code128
code2-5-5lines-iata</p>

<p>--barcode-search-count 1..7 [3] Number of times that the
RSC performs the decoding algorithm. Specify the smallest
number possible to increase performance. If you are having
trouble recognizing barcodes, it is suggested that you
increase this option to its maximum value (7).</p>

<p>--barcode-search-mode &lt;see list&gt; [horiz-vert]
Chooses the orientation of barcodes to be searched. The
valid orientations are: horiz-vert horizontal vertical
vert-horiz</p>

<p>--barcode-hmin 0..1660mm [5] Sets the barcode minimum
height in millimeters (larger values increase recognition
speed). Of course the actual barcodes in the document must
be of sufficient size.</p>

<p>--barcode-search-timeout 20..65535us [10000] Sets the
timeout for barcode searching in milliseconds. When the
timeout expires, the decoder will stop trying to decode bar-
codes.</p>

<p>--section &lt;string&gt; [] Specifies a series of image
sections. A section can be used to gather a subset image or
to provide a small area for barcode decoding. Each section
is specified in the following format (units are in
millimeters):</p>


<p>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;+&lt;top-left-x&gt;+&lt;top-left-y&gt;[:functioncode...]</p>

<p>Multiple sections can be specified by separating them
with commas.</p>

<p>For example 76.2x25.4+50.8+0:frontbar identifies an area
3 inches wide and 1 inch high with a top left corner at the
top of the page two inches from the left hand edge of the
page. This section will be used for barcode decoding on the
front page only.</p>

<p>For example 50.8x25.4+25.4+0:frontbar:front:g42d
identifies an area 2 inches wide and 1 inch high with a top
left corner at the top of the page one inch from the left
hand edge of the page. This section will be used for barcode
decoding on the front page as well as generating an image
compressed in g42d format.</p>

<p>Ordinarily barcodes are searched in the entire image.
However, when you specify sections all barcode searching is
done within the specific sections identified. This can
significantly speed up the decoding pro- cess.</p>

<p>The following functioncodes are available: front -
generate an image for the front page section back - generate
an image for the back page section frontbar - perform
barcode search in front page section backbar - perform
barcode search in back page section frontpatch - perform
patchcode search in front page section backpatch - perform
patchcode search in back page section none - use no image
compression g31d - use Group 3 1 dimension image compression
g32d - use Group 3 2 dimensions image compression g42d - use
Group 4 2 dimensions image compression</p>

<p>If you omit a compression functioncode, the full page
compression set- ting is used. If you specify multiple
compression functioncodes, only the last one is used.</p>

<p>--barcode-relmax 0..255 [0] Specifies the maximum
relation from the widest to the smallest bar.</p>

<p>--barcode-barmin 0..255 [0] Specifies the minimum number
of bars in Bar/Patch code.</p>

<p>--barcode-barmax 0..255 [0] Specifies the maximum number
of bars in a Bar/Patch code.</p>

<p>--barcode-contrast 0..6 [3] Specifies the image contrast
used in decoding. Use higher val- ues when there are more
white pixels in the code.</p>

<p>--barcode-patchmode 0..1 [0] Controls Patch Code
detection.</p>
