<p>NAME nping - Network packet generation tool / ping
utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nping [Options] {targets}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Nping is an open-source tool for network
packet generation, response analysis and response time
measurement. Nping allows users to generate network packets
of a wide range of protocols, letting them tune virtually
any field of the protocol headers. While Nping can be used
as a simple ping utility to detect active hosts, it can also
be used as a raw packet generator for network stack stress
tests, ARP poisoning, Denial of Service attacks, route
tracing, and other purposes.</p>

<p>Additionally, Nping offers a special mode of operation
called the &quot;Echo Mode&quot;, that lets users see how
the generated probes change in transit, revealing the
differences between the transmitted packets and the packets
received at the other end. See section &quot;Echo Mode&quot;
for details.</p>

<p>The output from Nping is a list of the packets that are
being sent and received. The level of detail depends on the
options used.</p>

<p>A typical Nping execution is shown in Example 1. The
only Nping arguments used in this example are -c, to specify
the number of times to target each host, --tcp to specify
TCP Probe Mode, -p 80,433 to specify the target ports; and
then the two target hostnames.</p>

<p>SEE THE MAN PAGE FOR MANY MORE OPTIONS, DESCRIPTIONS,
AND EXAMPLES</p>

<p>TARGET SPECIFICATION Everything on the Nping command
line that isn&acute;t an option or an option argument is
treated as a target host specification. Nping uses the same
syntax for target specifications that Nmap does. The
simplest case is a single target given by IP address or
hostname.</p>

<p>Nping supports CIDR-style. addressing. You can append
/numbits to an IPv4 address or hostname and Nping will send
probes to every IP address for which the first numbits are
the same as for the reference IP or hostname given. For
example, 192.168.10.0/24 would send probes to the 256 hosts
between 192.168.10.0 (binary: 11000000 10101000 00001010
00000000) and 192.168.10.255 (binary: 11000000 10101000
00001010 11111111), inclusive. 192.168.10.40/24 would ping
exactly the same targets. Given that the host
scanme.nmap.org. is at the IP address 64.13.134.52, the
specification scanme.nmap.org/16 would send probes to the
65,536 IP addresses between 64.13.0.0 and 64.13.255.255. The
smallest allowed value is /0, which targets the whole
Internet. The largest value is /32, which targets just the
named host or IP address because all address bits are
fixed.</p>

<p>CIDR notation is short but not always flexible enough.
For example, you might want to send probes to 192.168.0.0/16
but skip any IPs ending with .0 or .255 because they may be
used as subnet network and broadcast addresses. Nping
supports this through octet range addressing. Rather than
specify a normal IP address, you can specify a
comma-separated list of numbers or ranges for each octet.
For example, 192.168.0-255.1-254 will skip all addresses in
the range that end in .0 or .255, and 192.168.3-5,7.1 will
target the four addresses 192.168.3.1, 192.168.4.1,
192.168.5.1, and 192.168.7.1. Either side of a range may be
omitted; the default values are 0 on the left and 255 on the
right. Using - by itself is the same as 0-255, but remember
to use 0- in the first octet so the target specification
doesn&acute;t look like a command-line option. Ranges need
not be limited to the final octets: the specifier 0-.-.13.37
will send probes to all IP addresses on the Internet ending
in .13.37. This sort of broad sampling can be useful for
Internet surveys and research.</p>

<p>IPv6 addresses can only be specified by their fully
qualified IPv6 address or hostname. CIDR and octet ranges
aren&acute;t supported for IPv6 because they are rarely
useful.</p>

<p>Nping accepts multiple host specifications on the
command line, and they don&acute;t need to be the same type.
The command nping scanme.nmap.org 192.168.0.0/8
10.0.0,1,3-7.- does what you would expect.</p>

<p>OPTION SPECIFICATION Nping is designed to be very
flexible and fit a wide variety of needs. As with most
command-line tools, its behavior can be adjusted using
command-line options. These general principles apply to
option arguments, unless stated otherwise.</p>

<p>Options that take integer numbers can accept values
specified in decimal, octal or hexadecimal base. When a
number starts with 0x, it will be treated as hexadecimal;
when it simply starts with 0, it will be treated as octal.
Otherwise, Nping will assume the number has been specified
in base 10. Virtually all numbers that can be supplied from
the command line are unsigned so, as a general rule, the
minimum value is zero. Users may also specify the word
random or rand to make Nping generate a random value within
the expected range.</p>

<p>IP addresses may be given as IPv4 addresses (e.g.
192.168.1.1), IPv6 addresses (e.g.
2001:db8:85a3::8e4c:760:7146), or hostnames, which will be
resolved using the default DNS server configured in the host
system.</p>

<p>Options that take MAC addresses accept the usual
colon-separated 6 hex byte format (e.g. 00:50:56:d4:01:98).
Hyphens may also be used instead of colons (e.g.
00-50-56-c0-00-08). The special word random or rand sets a
random address and the word broadcast or bcast sets
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPERATION Unlike other ping and packet
generation tools, Nping supports multiple target host and
port specifications. While this provides great flexibility,
it is not obvious how Nping handles situations where there
is more than one host and/or more than one port to send
probes to. This section explains how Nping behaves in these
cases.</p>

<p>When multiple target hosts are specified, Nping rotates
among them in round-robin fashion. This gives slow hosts
more time to send their responses before another probe is
sent to them. Ports are also scheduled using round robin.
So, unless only one port is specified, Nping never sends two
probes to the same target host and port consecutively.</p>

<p>The loop around targets is the inner loop and the loop
around ports is the outer loop. All targets will be sent a
probe for a given port before moving on to the next port.
Between probes, Nping waits a configurable amount of time
called the inter-probe delay, which is controlled by the
--delay option. These examples show how it works.</p>

<p>PROBE MODES Nping supports a wide variety of protocols.
Although in some cases Nping can automatically determine the
mode from the options used, it is generally a good idea to
specify it explicitly.</p>

<p>--tcp-connect (TCP Connect mode) . TCP connect mode is
the default mode when a user does not have raw packet
privileges. Instead of writing raw packets as most other
modes do, Nping asks the underlying operating system to
establish a connection with the target machine and port by
issuing the connect system call. This is the same high-level
system call that web browsers, P2P clients, and most other
network-enabled applications use to establish a connection.
It is part of a programming interface known as the Berkeley
Sockets API. Rather than read raw packet responses off the
wire, Nping uses this API to obtain status information on
each connection attempt. For this reason, you will not be
able to see the contents of the packets that are sent or
received but only status information about the TCP
connection establishment taking place.</p>

<p>--tcp (TCP mode) . TCP is the mode that lets users
create and send any kind of TCP packet. TCP packets are sent
embedded in IP packets that can also be tuned. This mode can
be used for many different purposes. For example you could
try to discover open ports by sending TCP SYN messages
without completing the three-way handshake. This technique
is often referred to as half-open scanning, because you
don&acute;t open a full TCP connection. You send a SYN
packet, as if you are going to open a real connection and
then wait for a response. A SYN/ACK indicates the port is
open, while a RST indicates it&acute;s closed. If no
response is received one could assume that some intermediate
network device is filtering the responses. Another use could
be to see how a remote TCP/IP stack behaves when it receives
a non-RFC-compliant packet, like one with both SYN and RST
flags set. One could also do some evil by creating custom
RST packets using an spoofed IP address with the intent of
closing an active TCP connection.</p>

<p>--udp (UDP mode) . UDP mode can have two different
behaviours. Under normal circumstances, it lets users create
custom IP/UDP packets. However, if Nping is run by a user
without raw packet privileges and no changes to the default
protocol headers are requested, then Nping enters the
unprivileged UDP mode which basically sends UDP packets to
the specified target hosts and ports using the sendto system
call. Note that in this unprivileged mode it is not possible
to see low-level header information of the packets on the
wire but only status information about the amount of bytes
that are being transmitted and received. UDP mode can be
used to interact with any UDP-based server. Examples are DNS
servers, streaming servers, online gaming servers, and port
knocking/single-packet. authorization daemons.</p>

<p>--icmp (ICMP mode) . ICMP mode is the default mode when
the user runs Nping with raw packet privileges. Any kind of
ICMP message can be created. The default ICMP type is Echo,
i.e., ping. ICMP mode can be used for many different
purposes, from a simple request for a timestamp or a netmask
to the transmission of fake destination unreachable
messages, custom redirects, and router advertisements.</p>

<p>--arp (ARP/RARP mode) . ARP lets you create and send a
few different ARP-related packets. These include ARP, RARP,
DRARP, and InARP requests and replies. This mode can ban be
used to perform low-level host discovery, and conduct
ARP-cache poisoning attacks.</p>

<p>--traceroute (Traceroute mode) . Traceroute is not a
mode by itself but a complement to TCP, UDP, and ICMP modes.
When this option is specified Nping will set the IP TTL
value of the first probe to 1. When the next router receives
the packet it will drop it due to the expiration of the TTL
and it will generate an ICMP destination unreachable
message. The next probe will have a TTL of 2 so now the
first router will forward the packet while the second router
will be the one that drops the packet and generates the ICMP
message. The third probe will have a TTL value of 3 and so
on. By examining the source addresses of all those ICMP
Destination Unreachable messages it is possible to determine
the path that the probes take until they reach their final
destination.</p>

<p>TCP CONNECT MODE -p port_spec, --dest-port port_spec
(Target ports) . This option specifies which ports you want
to try to connect to. It can be a single port, a
comma-separated list of ports (e.g. 80,443,8080), a range
(e.g. 1-1023), and any combination of those (e.g.
21-25,80,443,1024-2048). The beginning and/or end values of
a range may be omitted, causing Nping to use 1 and 65535,
respectively. So you can specify -p- to target ports from 1
through 65535. Using port zero is allowed if you specify it
explicitly.</p>

<p>-g portnumber, --source-port portnumber (Spoof source
port) . This option asks Nping to use the specified port as
source port for the TCP connections. Note that this might
not work on all systems or may require root privileges.
Specified value must be an integer in the range
[065535].</p>

<p>TCP MODE -p port_spec, --dest-port port_spec (Target
ports) This option specifies which destination ports you
want to send probes to. It can be a single port, a
comma-separated list of ports (e.g. 80,443,8080), a range
(e.g. 1-1023), and any combination of those (e.g.
21-25,80,443,1024-2048). The beginning and/or end values of
a range may be omitted, causing Nping to use 1 and 65535,
respectively. So you can specify -p- to target ports from 1
through 65535. Using port zero is allowed if you specify it
explicitly.</p>

<p>-g portnumber, --source-port portnumber (Spoof source
port) This option asks Nping to use the specified port as
source port for the TCP connections. Note that this might
not work on all systems or may require root privileges.
Specified value must be an integer in the range
[065535].</p>

<p>--seq seqnumber (Sequence Number) . Specifies the TCP
sequence number. In SYN packets this is the initial sequence
number (ISN). In a normal transmission this corresponds to
the sequence number of the first byte of data in the
segment. seqnumber must be a number in the range [0
4294967295].</p>

<p>--flags flags (TCP Flags) . This option specifies which
flags should be set in the TCP packet. flags may be
specified in three different ways:</p>

<p>1. As a comma-separated list of flags, e.g. --flags
syn,ack,rst</p>

<p>2. As a list of one-character flag initials, e.g.
--flags SAR tells Nping to set flags SYN, ACK, and RST.</p>

<p>3. As an 8-bit hexadecimal number, where the supplied
number is the exact value that will be placed in the flags
field of the TCP header. The number should start with the
prefix 0x and should be in the range [0x000xFF], e.g.
--flags 0x20 sets the URG flag as 0x20 corresponds to binary
00100000 and the URG flag is represented by the third bit.
There are 8 possible flags to set: CWR, ECN, URG, ACK, PSH,
RST, SYN, and FIN. The special value ALL means to set all
flags. NONE means to set no flags. It is important that if
you don&acute;t want any flag to be set, you request it
explicitly because in some cases the SYN flag may be set by
default. Here is a brief description of the meaning of each
flag:</p>

<p>CWR (Congestion Window Reduced) . Set by an ECN-Capable
sender when it reduces its congestion window (due to a
retransmit timeout, a fast retransmit or in response to an
ECN notification.</p>

<p>ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) . During the
three-way handshake it indicates that sender is capable of
performing explicit congestion notification. Normally it
means that a packet with the IP Congestion Experienced flag
set was received during normal transmission. See RFC 3168.
for more information.</p>

<p>URG (Urgent) . Segment is urgent and the urgent pointer
field carries valid information.</p>

<p>ACK (Acknowledgement) . The segment carries an
acknowledgement and the value of the acknowledgement number
field is valid and contains the next sequence number that is
expected from the receiver.</p>

<p>PSH (Push) . The data in this segment should be
immediately pushed to the application layer on arrival.</p>

<p>RST (Reset) . There was some problem and the sender
wants to abort the connection.</p>

<p>SYN (Synchronize) . The segment is a request to
synchronize sequence numbers and establish a connection. The
sequence number field contains the sender&acute;s initial
sequence number.</p>

<p>FIN (Finish) . The sender wants to close the
connection.</p>

<p>--win size (Window Size) . Specifies the TCP window
size, this is, the number of octets the sender of the
segment is willing to accept from the receiver at one time.
This is usually the size of the reception buffer that the OS
allocates for a given connection. size must be a number in
the range [065535].</p>

<p>--badsum (Invalid Checksum) . Asks Nping to use an
invalid TCP checksum for the packets sent to target hosts.
Since virtually all host IP stacks properly drop these
packets, any responses received are likely coming from a
firewall or an IDS that didn&acute;t bother to verify the
checksum. For more details on this technique, see
http://nmap.org/p60-12.html.</p>

<p>UDP MODE -p port_spec, --dest-port port_spec (Target
ports) . This option specifies which ports you want UDP
datagrams to be sent to. It can be a single port, a
comma-separated list of ports (e.g. 80,443,8080), a range
(e.g. 1-1023), and any combination of those (e.g.
21-25,80,443,1024-2048). The beginning and/or end values of
a range may be omitted, causing Nping to use 1 and 65535,
respectively. So you can specify -p- to target ports from 1
through 65535. Using port zero is allowed if you specify it
explicitly.</p>

<p>-g portnumber, --source-port portnumber (Spoof source
port) . This option asks Nping to use the specified port as
source port for the transmitted datagrams. Note that this
might not work on all systems or may require root
privileges. Specified value must be an integer in the range
[065535].</p>

<p>--badsum (Invalid Checksum) Asks Nping to use an invalid
UDP checksum for the packets sent to target hosts. Since
virtually all host IP stacks properly drop these packets,
any responses received are likely coming from a firewall or
an IDS that didn&acute;t bother to verify the checksum. For
more details on this technique, see
http://nmap.org/p60-12.html.</p>

<p>ICMP MODE --icmp-type type (ICMP type) . This option
specifies which type of ICMP messages should be generated.
type can be supplied in two different ways. You can use the
official type numbers assigned by IANA[1] (e.g. --icmp-type
8 for ICMP Echo Request), or you can use any of the
mnemonics listed in the section called ICMP Types.</p>

<p>--icmp-code code (ICMP code) . This option specifies
which ICMP code should be included in the generated ICMP
messages. code can be supplied in two different ways. You
can use the official code numbers assigned by IANA[1] (e.g.
--icmp-code 1 for Fragment Reassembly Time Exceeded), or you
can use any of the mnemonics listed in the section called
ICMP Codes.</p>

<p>--icmp-id id (ICMP identifier) . This option specifies
the value of the identifier used in some of the ICMP
messages. In general it is used to match request and reply
messages. id must be a number in the range [065535].</p>

<p>--icmp-seq seq (ICMP sequence) . This option specifies
the value of the sequence number field used in some ICMP
messages. In general it is used to match request and reply
messages. id must be a number in the range [0 65535].</p>

<p>--icmp-redirect-addr addr (ICMP Redirect address) . This
option sets the address field in ICMP Redirect messages. In
other words, it sets the IP address of the router that
should be used when sending IP datagrams to the original
destination. addr can be either an IPv4 address or a
hostname.</p>

<p>--icmp-param-pointer pointer (ICMP Parameter Problem
pointer) . This option specifies the pointer that indicates
the location of the problem in ICMP Parameter Problem
messages. pointer should be a number in the range [0255].
Normally this option is only used when ICMP code is set to 0
(&quot;Pointer indicates the error&quot;).</p>

<p>--icmp-advert-lifetime ttl (ICMP Router Advertisement
Lifetime) . This option specifies the router advertisement
lifetime, this is, the number of seconds the information
carried in an ICMP Router Advertisement can be considered
valid for. ttl must be a positive integer in the range
[065535].</p>

<p>--icmp-advert-entry addr,pref (ICMP Router Advertisement
Entry) . This option adds a Router Advertisement entry to an
ICMP Router Advertisement message. The parameter must be two
values separated by a comma. addr is the router&acute;s IP
and can be specified either as an IP address in dot-decimal
notation or as a hostname. pref is the preference level for
the specified IP. It must be a number in the range [0
4294967295]. An example is --icmp-advert-entry
192.168.128.1,3.</p>

<p>--icmp-orig-time timestamp (ICMP Originate Timestamp) .
This option sets the Originate Timestamp in ICMP Timestamp
messages. The Originate Timestamp is expressed as the number
of milliseconds since midnight UTC and it corresponds to the
time the sender last touched the Timestamp message before
its transmission. timestamp can be specified as a regular
time (e.g. 10s, 3h, 1000ms), or the special string now. You
can add or subtract values from now, for example
--icmp-orig-time now-2s, --icmp-orig-time now+1h,
--icmp-orig-time now+200ms.</p>

<p>--icmp-recv-time timestamp (ICMP Receive Timestamp) .
This option sets the Receive Timestamp in ICMP Timestamp
messages. The Receive Timestamp is expressed as the number
of milliseconds since midnight UTC and it corresponds to the
time the echoer first touched the Timestamp message on
receipt. timestamp is as with --icmp-orig-time.</p>

<p>--icmp-trans-time timestamp (ICMP Transmit Timestamp) .
This option sets the Transmit Timestamp in ICMP Timestamp
messages. The Transmit Timestamp is expressed as the number
of milliseconds since midnight UTC and it corresponds to the
time the echoer last touched the Timestamp message before
its transmission. timestamp is as with --icmp-orig-time.</p>

<p>ICMP Types These identifiers may be used as mnemonics
for the ICMP type numbers given to the --icmp-type. option.
In general there are three forms of each identifier: the
full name (e.g. destination-unreachable), the short name
(e.g. dest-unr), or the initials (e.g. du). In ICMP types
that request something, the word &quot;request&quot; is
omitted.</p>

normally used by routers to inform a host that there is a
better route to use for sending datagrams. See also the
--icmp-redirect-addr option.</p>

(type 9). This message is used by routers to let hosts know
of their existence and capabilities. See also the
--icmp-advert-lifetime option.</p>

(type 10). This message is used by hosts to request Router
Advertisement messages from any listening routers.</p>

<p>time-exceeded, time-exc, te Time Exceeded (type 11).
This message is generated by some intermediate device
(normally a router) to indicate that a datagram has been
discarded before reaching its destination because the IP TTL
expired.</p>

<p>parameter-problem, member-pro, pp Parameter Problem
(type 12). This message is used when a device finds a
problem with a parameter in an IP header and it cannot
continue processing it. See also the --icmp-param-pointer
option.</p>

<p>timestamp, time, tm Timestamp Request (type 13). This
message is used to request a device to send a timestamp
value for propagation time calculation and clock
synchronization. See also the --icmp-orig-time,
--icmp-recv-time, and --icmp-trans-time.</p>

<p>timestamp-reply, time-rep, tr Timestamp Reply (type 14).
This message is sent in response to a Timestamp Request
message.</p>

<p>information, info, i Information Request (type 15). This
message is now obsolete but it was originally used to
request configuration information from another device.</p>

<p>information-reply, info-rep, ir Information Reply (type
16). This message is now obsolete but it was originally sent
in response to an Information Request message to provide
configuration information.</p>

<p>mask-request, mask, m Address Mask Request (type 17).
This message is used to ask a device to send its subnet
mask.</p>

<p>mask-reply, mask-rep, mr Address Mask Reply (type 18).
This message contains a subnet mask and is sent in response
to a Address Mask Request message.</p>

<p>traceroute, trace, tc Traceroute (type 30). This message
is normally sent by an intermediate device when it receives
an IP datagram with a traceroute option. ICMP Traceroute
messages are still experimental, see RFC 1393. for more
information.</p>

<p>ICMP Codes These identifiers may be used as mnemonics
for the ICMP code numbers given to the --icmp-code. option.
They are listed by the ICMP type they correspond to.</p>

<p>ARP MODE --arp-type type (ICMP Type) . This option
specifies which type of ARP messages should be generated.
type can be supplied in two different ways. You can use the
official numbers assigned by IANA[2] (e.g. --arp-type 1 for
ARP Request), or you can use one of the mnemonics from the
section called ARP Types.</p>

<p>--arp-sender-mac mac (Sender MAC address) . This option
sets the Sender Hardware Address field of the ARP header.
Although ARP supports many types of link layer addresses,
currently Nping only supports MAC addresses. mac must be
specified using the traditional MAC notation (e.g.
00:0a:8a:32:f4:ae). You can also use hyphens as separators
(e.g. 00-0a-8a-32-f4-ae).</p>

<p>--arp-sender-ip addr (Sender IP address) . This option
sets the Sender IP field of the ARP header. addr can be
given as an IPv4 address or a hostname.</p>

<p>--arp-target-mac mac (target MAC address) . This option
sets the Target Hardware Address field of the ARP
header.</p>

<p>--arp-target-ip addr (target ip address) . This option
sets the Target IP field of the ARP header.</p>

<p>ARP Types These identifiers may be used as mnemonics for
the ARP type numbers given to the --arp-type. option.</p>

<p>arp-request, arp, a ARP Request (type 1). ARP requests
are used to translate network layer addresses (normally IP
addresses) to link layer addresses (usually MAC addresses).
Basically, and ARP request is a broadcasted message that
asks the host in the same network segment that has a given
IP address to provide its MAC address.</p>

<p>arp-reply, arp-rep, ar ARP Reply (type 2). An ARP reply
is a message that a host sends in response to an ARP request
to provide its link layer address.</p>

<p>rarp-request, rarp, r RARP Requests (type 3). RARP
requests are used to translate a link layer address
(normally a MAC address) to a network layer address (usually
an IP address). Basically a RARP request is a broadcasted
message sent by a host that wants to know his own IP address
because it doesn&acute;t have any. It was the first protocol
designed to solve the bootstrapping problem. However, RARP
is now obsolete and DHCP is used instead. For more
information about RARP see RFC 903..</p>

<p>rarp-reply, rarp-rep, rr RARP Reply (type 4). A RARP
reply is a message sent in response to a RARP request to
provide an IP address to the host that sent the RARP request
in the first place.</p>

<p>drarp-request, drarp, d Dynamic RARP Request (type 5).
Dynamic RARP is an extension to RARP used to obtain or
assign a network layer address from a fixed link layer
address. DRARP was used mainly in Sun Microsystems platforms
in the late 90&acute;s but now it&acute;s no longer used.
See RFC 1931. for more information.</p>

<p>drarp-reply, drarp-rep, dr Dynamic RARP Reply (type 6).
A DRARP reply is a message sent in response to a RARP
request to provide network layer address.</p>

<p>drarp-error, drarp-err, de DRARP Error (type 7). DRARP
Error messages are usually sent in response to DRARP
requests to inform of some error. In DRARP Error messages,
the Target Protocol Address field is used to carry an error
code (usually in the first byte). The error code is intended
to tell why no target protocol address is being returned.
For more information see RFC 1931.</p>

<p>inarp-request, inarp, i Inverse ARP Request (type 8).
InARP requests are used to translate a link layer address to
a network layer address. It is similar to RARP request but
in this case, the sender of the InARP request wants to know
the network layer address of another node, not its own
address. InARP is mainly used in Frame Relay and ATM
networks. For more information see RFC 2390..</p>

<p>inarp-reply, inarp-rep, ir Inverse ARP Reply (type 9).
InARP reply messages are sent in response to InARP requests
to provide the network layer address associated with the
host that has a given link layer address.</p>

<p>arp-nak, an ARP NAK (type 10). ARP NAK messages are an
extension to the ATMARP protocol and they are used to
improve the robustness of the ATMARP server mechanism. With
ARP NAK, a client can determine the difference between a
catastrophic server failure and an ATMARP table lookup
failure. See RFC 1577. for more information.</p>

<p>IPV4 OPTIONS -S addr, --source-ip addr (Source IP
Address) . Sets the source IP address. This option lets you
specify a custom IP address to be used as source IP address
in sent packets. This allows spoofing the sender of the
packets. addr can be an IPv4 address or a hostname.</p>

<p>--dest-ip addr (Destination IP Address) . Adds a target
to Nping&acute;s target list. This option is provided for
consistency but its use is deprecated in favor of plain
target specifications. See the section called TARGET
SPECIFICATION.</p>

<p>--tos tos (Type of Service) . Sets the IP TOS field. The
TOS field is used to carry information to provide quality of
service features. It is normally used to support a technique
called Differentiated Services. See RFC 2474. for more
information. tos must be a number in the range [0255].</p>

<p>--id id (Identification) . Sets the IPv4 Identification
field. The Identification field is a 16-bit value that is
common to all fragments belonging to a particular message.
The value is used by the receiver to reassemble the original
message from the fragments received. id must be a number in
the range [065535].</p>

<p>--df (Don&acute;t Fragment) . Sets the Don&acute;t
Fragment bit in sent packets. When an IP datagram has its DF
flag set, intermediate devices are not allowed to fragment
it so if it needs to travel across a network with a MTU
smaller that datagram length the datagram will have to be
dropped. Normally an ICMP Destination Unreachable message is
generated and sent back to the sender.</p>

<p>--mf (More Fragments) . Sets the More Fragments bit in
sent packets. The MF flag is set to indicate the receiver
that the current datagram is a fragment of some larger
datagram. When set to zero it indicates that the current
datagram is either the last fragment in the set or that it
is the only fragment.</p>

<p>--ttl hops (Time To Live) . Sets the IPv4 Time-To-Live
(TTL) field in sent packets to the given value. The TTL
field specifies how long the datagram is allowed to exist on
the network. It was originally intended to represent a
number of seconds but it actually represents the number of
hops a packet can traverse before being dropped. The TTL
tries to avoid a situation in which undeliverable datagrams
keep being forwarded from one router to another endlessly.
hops must be a number in the range [0255].</p>

<p>--badsum-ip (Invalid IP checksum) . Asks Nping to use an
invalid IP checksum for packets sent to target hosts. Note
that some systems (like most Linux kernels), may fix the
checksum before placing the packet on the wire, so even if
Nping shows the incorrect checksum in its output, the
packets may be transparently corrected by the kernel.</p>

<p>--ip-options S|R [route]|L [route]|T|U ..., --ip-options
hex string (IP Options) . The IP protocol offers several
options which may be placed in packet headers. Unlike the
ubiquitous TCP options, IP options are rarely seen due to
practicality and security concerns. In fact, many Internet
routers block the most dangerous options such as source
routing. Yet options can still be useful in some cases for
determining and manipulating the network route to target
machines. For example, you may be able to use the record
route option to determine a path to a target even when more
traditional traceroute-style approaches fail. Or if your
packets are being dropped by a certain firewall, you may be
able to specify a different route with the strict or loose
source routing options.</p>

<p>The most powerful way to specify IP options is to simply
pass in hexadecimal data as the argument to --ip-options.
Precede each hex byte value with You may repeat certain
characters by following them with an asterisk and then the
number of times you wish them to repeat. For example, 1740*4
is the same as 1740000.</p>

<p>Note that if you specify a number of bytes that is not a
multiple of four, an incorrect IP header length will be set
in the IP packet. The reason for this is that the IP header
length field can only express multiples of four. In those
cases, the length is computed by dividing the header length
by 4 and rounding down. This will affect the way the header
that follows the IP header is interpreted, showing bogus
information in Nping or in the output of any sniffer.
Although this kind of situation might be useful for some
stack stress tests, users would normally want to specify
explicit padding, so the correct header length is set.</p>

<p>Nping also offers a shortcut mechanism for specifying
options. Simply pass the letter R, T, or U to request
record-route, record-timestamp, or both options together,
respectively. Loose or strict source routing may be
specified with an L or S followed by a space and then a
space-separated list of IP addresses.</p>

<p>For more information and examples of using IP options
with Nping, see the mailing list post at
http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2006/q3/0052.html.</p>

<p>--mtu size (Maximum Transmission Unit) . This option
sets a fictional MTU in Nping so IP datagrams larger than
size are fragmented before transmission. size must be
specified in bytes and corresponds to the number of octets
that can be carried on a single link-layer frame.</p>

<p>IPV6 OPTIONS -6, --ipv6 (Use IPv6) . Tells Nping to use
IP version 6 instead of the default IPv4. It is generally a
good idea to specify this option as early as possible in the
command line so Nping can parse it soon and know in advance
that the rest of the parameters refer to IPv6. The command
syntax is the same as usual except that you also add the -6
option. Of course, you must use IPv6 syntax if you specify
an address rather than a hostname. An address might look
like 3ffe:7501:4819:2000:210:f3ff:fe03:14d0, so hostnames
are recommended.</p>

<p>While IPv6 hasn&acute;t exactly taken the world by
storm, it gets significant use in some (usually Asian)
countries and most modern operating systems support it. To
use Nping with IPv6, both the source and target of your
packets must be configured for IPv6. If your ISP (like most
of them) does not allocate IPv6 addresses to you, free
tunnel brokers are widely available and work fine with
Nping. You can use the free IPv6 tunnel broker service at
http://www.tunnelbroker.net.</p>

<p>Please note that IPv6 support is still highly
experimental and many modes and options may not work with
it.</p>

<p>-S addr, --source-ip addr (Source IP Address) . Sets the
source IP address. This option lets you specify a custom IP
address to be used as source IP address in sent packets.
This allows spoofing the sender of the packets. addr can be
an IPv6 address or a hostname.</p>

<p>--dest-ip addr (Destination IP Address) . Adds a target
to Nping&acute;s target list. This option is provided for
consistency but its use is deprecated in favor of plain
target specifications. See the section called TARGET
SPECIFICATION.</p>

<p>--flow label (Flow Label) . Sets the IPv6 Flow Label.
The Flow Label field is 20 bits long and is intended to
provide certain quality-of-service properties for real-time
datagram delivery. However, it has not been widely adopted,
and not all routers or endpoints support it. Check RFC 2460.
for more information. label must be an integer in the range
[01048575].</p>

<p>--traffic-class class (Traffic Class) . Sets the IPv6
Traffic Class. This field is similar to the TOS field in
IPv4, and is intended to provide the Differentiated Services
method, enabling scalable service discrimination in the
Internet without the need for per-flow state and signaling
at every hop. Check RFC 2474. for more information. class
must be an integer in the range [0255].</p>

<p>--hop-limit hops (Hop Limit) . Sets the IPv6 Hop Limit
field in sent packets to the given value. The Hop Limit
field specifies how long the datagram is allowed to exist on
the network. It represents the number of hops a packet can
traverse before being dropped. As with the TTL in IPv4, IPv6
Hop Limit tries to avoid a situation in which undeliverable
datagrams keep being forwarded from one router to another
endlessly. hops must be a number in the range [0255].</p>

<p>ETHERNET OPTIONS In most cases Nping sends packets at
the raw IP level. This means that Nping creates its own IP
packets and transmits them through a raw socket. However, in
some cases it may be necessary to send packets at the raw
Ethernet level. This happens, for example, when Nping is run
under Windows (as Microsoft has disabled raw socket support
since Windows XP SP2), or when Nping is asked to send ARP
packets. Since in some cases it is necessary to construct
ethernet frames, Nping offers some options to manipulate the
different fields.</p>

<p>--dest-mac mac (Ethernet Destination MAC Address) . This
option sets the destination MAC address that should be set
in outgoing Ethernet frames. This is useful in case Nping
can&acute;t determine the next hop&acute;s MAC address or
when you want to route probes through a router other than
the configured default gateway. The MAC address should have
the usual format of six colon-separated bytes, e.g.
00:50:56:d4:01:98. Alternatively, hyphens may be used
instead of colons. Use the word random or rand to generate a
random address, and broadcast or bcast to use
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. If you set up a bogus destination MAC
address your probes may not reach the intended targets.</p>

<p>--source-mac mac (Ethernet Source MAC Address) . This
option sets the source MAC address that should be set in
outgoing Ethernet frames. This is useful in case Nping
can&acute;t determine your network interface MAC address or
when you want to inject traffic into the network while
hiding your network card&acute;s real address. The syntax is
the same as for --dest-mac. If you set up a bogus source MAC
address you may not receive probe replies.</p>

<p>--ether-type type (Ethertype) . This option sets the
Ethertype field of the ethernet frame. The Ethertype is used
to indicate which protocol is encapsulated in the payload.
type can be supplied in two different ways. You can use the
official numbers listed by the IEEE[3] (e.g. --ether-type
0x0800 for IP version 4), or one of the mnemonics from the
section called Ethernet Types.</p>

<p>PAYLOAD OPTIONS --data hex string (Append custom binary
data to sent packets) . This option lets you include binary
data as payload in sent packets. hex string may be specified
in any of the following formats: 0xAABBCCDDEEFF...,
AABBCCDDEEFF... or .... Examples of use are --data
0xdeadbeef and --dataCF09. Note that if you specify a number
like 0x00ff no byte-order conversion is performed. Make sure
you specify the information in the byte order expected by
the receiver.</p>

<p>--data-string string (Append custom string to sent
packets) . This option lets you include a regular string as
payload in sent packets. string can contain any string.
However, note that some characters may depend on your
system&acute;s locale and the receiver may not see the same
information. Also, make sure you enclose the string in
double quotes and escape any special characters from the
shell. Example: --data-string &quot;Jimmy Jazz...&quot;.</p>

<p>--data-length len (Append random data to sent packets) .
This option lets you include len random bytes of data as
payload in sent packets. len must be an integer in the range
[0 65400]. However, values higher than 1400 are not
recommended because it may not be possible to transmit
packets due to network MTU limitations.</p>

<p>ECHO MODE The &quot;Echo Mode&quot; is a novel technique
implemented by Nping which lets users see how network
packets change in transit, from the host where they
originated to the target machine. Basically, the Echo mode
turns Nping into two different pieces: the Echo server and
the Echo client. The Echo server is a network service that
has the ability to capture packets from the network and send
a copy (&quot;echo them&quot;) to the originating client
through a side TCP channel. The Echo client is the part that
generates such network packets, transmits them to the
server, and receives their echoed version through a side TCP
channel that it has previously established with the Echo
server.</p>

<p>This scheme lets the client see the differences between
the packets that it sends and what is actually received by
the server. By having the server send back copies of the
received packets through the side channel, things like NAT
devices become immediately apparent to the client because it
notices the changes in the source IP address (and maybe even
source port). Other devices like those that perform traffic
shaping, changing TCP window sizes or adding TCP options
transparently between hosts, turn up too.</p>

<p>The Echo mode is also useful for troubleshooting routing
and firewall issues. Among other things, it can be used to
determine if the traffic generated by the Nping client is
being dropped in transit and never gets to its destination
or if the responses are the ones that don&acute;t get back
to it.</p>

<p>Internally, client and server communicate over an
encrypted and authenticated channel, using the Nping Echo
Protocol (NEP), whose technical specification can be found
in http://nmap.org/svn/nping/docs/EchoProtoRFC.txt</p>

<p>The following paragraphs describe the different options
available in Nping&acute;s Echo mode.</p>

<p>--ec passphrase, --echo-client passphrase (Run Echo
client) . This option tells Nping to run as an Echo client.
passphrase is a sequence of ASCII characters that is used
used to generate the cryptographic keys needed for
encryption and authentication in a given session. The
passphrase should be a secret that is also known by the
server, and it may contain any number of printable ASCII
characters. Passphrases that contain whitespace or special
characters must be enclosed in double quotes.</p>

<p>When running Nping as an Echo client, most options from
the regular raw probe modes apply. The client may be
configured to send specific probes using flags like --tcp,
--icmp or --udp. Protocol header fields may be manipulated
normally using the appropriate options (e.g. --ttl, --seq,
--icmp-type, etc.). The only exceptions are ARP-related
flags, which are not supported in Echo mode, as protocols
like ARP are closely related to the data link layer and its
probes can&acute;t pass through different network
segments.</p>

<p>--es passphrase, --echo-server passphrase (Run Echo
server) . This option tells Nping to run as an Echo server.
passphrase is a sequence of ASCII characters that is used
used to generate the cryptographic keys needed for
encryption and authentication in a given session. The
passphrase should be a secret that is also known by the
clients, and it may contain any number of printable ASCII
characters. Passphrases that contain whitespace or special
characters must be enclosed in double quotes. Note that
although it is not recommended, it is possible to use empty
passphrases, supplying --echo-server &quot;&quot;. However,
if what you want is to set up an open Echo server, it is
better to use option --no-crypto. See below for details.</p>

<p>--ep port, --echo-port port (Set Echo TCP port number) .
This option asks Nping to use the specified TCP port number
for the Echo side channel connection. If this option is used
with --echo-server, it specifies the port on which the
server listens for connections. If it is used with
--echo-client, it specifies the port to connect to on the
remote host. By default, port number 9929 is used.</p>

<p>--nc, --no-crypto (Disable encryption and
authentication) . This option asks Nping not to use any
cryptographic operations during an Echo session. In
practical terms, this means that the Echo side channel
session data will be transmitted in the clear, and no
authentication will be performed by the server or client
during the session establishment phase. When --no-crypto is
used, the passphrase supplied with --echo-server or
--echo-client is ignored.</p>

<p>This option must be specified if Nping was compiled
without openSSL support. Note that, for technical reasons, a
passphrase still needs to be supplied after the
--echo-client or --echo-server flags, even though it will be
ignored.</p>

<p>The --no-crypto flag might be useful when setting up a
public Echo server, because it allows users to connect to
the Echo server without the need for any passphrase or
shared secret. However, it is strongly recommended to not
use --no-crypto unless absolutely necessary. Public Echo
servers should be configured to use the passphrase
&quot;public&quot; or the empty passphrase (--echo-server
&quot;&quot;) as the use of cryptography does not only
provide confidentiality and authentication but also message
integrity.</p>

<p>--once (Serve one client and quit) . This option asks
the Echo server to quit after serving one client. This is
useful when only a single Echo session wants to be
established as it eliminates the need to access the remote
host to shutdown the server.</p>

<p>The following examples illustrate how Nping&acute;s Echo
mode can be used to discover intermediate devices.</p>

<p>Example 2. Discovering NAT devices</p>

<p># nping --echo-client &quot;public&quot; echo.nmap.org
--udp</p>

6.18 seconds</p>

<p>The output clearly shows the presence of a NAT device in
the client&acute;s local network. Note how the captured
packet (CAPT) differs from the SENT packet: the source
address for the original packets is in the reserved
10.0.0.0/8 range, while the address seen by the server is
80.38.10.21, the Internet side address of the NAT device.
The source port was also modified by the device. The line
starting with RCVD corresponds to the responses generated by
the TCP/IP stack of the machine where the Echo server is
run.</p>

| Rx pkts/s: 0.20 Nping done: 1 IP address pinged in 6.39
seconds</p>

<p>In this example, the output is a bit more tricky. The
absence of error messages shows that the Echo client has
successfully established an Echo session with the server.
However, no CAPT packets can be seen in the output. This
means that none of the transmitted packets reached the
server. Interestingly, a TCP SYN-ACK packet was received in
response to the first TCP-SYN packet (and also, it is known
that the target host does not have port 80 open). This
behavior reveals the presence of a transparent web proxy
cache server (which in this case is an old MS ISA
server).</p>

<p>TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OPTIONS --delay time (Delay
between probes) . This option lets you control for how long
will Nping wait before sending the next probe. Like in many
other ping tools, the default delay is one second. time must
be a positive integer or floating point number. By default
it is specified in seconds, however you can give an explicit
unit by appending ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for
minutes, or h for hours (e.g. 2.5s, 45m, 2h).</p>

<p>--rate rate (Send probes at a given rate) . This option
specifies the number of probes that Nping should send per
second. This option and --delay are inverses; --rate 20 is
the same as --delay 0.05. If both options are used, only the
last one in the parameter list counts.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS -h, --help (Display help) .
Displays help information and exits.</p>

<p>-V, --version (Display version) . Displays the
program&acute;s version number and quits.</p>

<p>-c rounds, --count rounds (Stop after a given number of
rounds) . This option lets you specify the number of times
that Nping should loop over target hosts (and in some cases
target ports). Nping calls these rounds. In a basic
execution with only one target (and only one target port in
TCP/UDP modes), the number of rounds matches the number of
probes sent to the target host. However, in more complex
executions where Nping is run against multiple targets and
multiple ports, the number of rounds is the number of times
that Nping sends a complete set of probes that covers all
target IPs and all target ports. For example, if Nping is
asked to send TCP SYN packets to hosts 192.168.1.0-255 and
ports 80 and 433, then 256 &times; 2 = 512 packets are sent
in one round. So if you specify -c 100, Nping will loop over
the different target hosts and ports 100 times, sending a
total of 256 &times; 2 &times; 100 = 51200 packets. By
default Nping runs for 5 rounds. If a value of 0 is
specified, Nping will run for 232 rounds.</p>

<p>-e name, --interface name (Set the network interface to
be used) . This option tells Nping what interface should be
used to send and receive packets. Nping should be able to
detect this automatically, but it will tell you if it
cannot. name must be the name of an existing network
interface with an assigned IP address.</p>

<p>--privileged (Assume that the user is fully privileged)
. Tells Nping to simply assume that it is privileged enough
to perform raw socket sends, packet sniffing, and similar
operations that usually require special privileges. By
default Nping quits if such operations are requested by a
user that has no root or administrator privileges. This
option may be useful on Linux, BSD or similar systems that
can be configured to allow unprivileged users to perform
raw-packet transmissions. The NPING_PRIVILEGED. environment
variable may be set as an alternative to using
--privileged.</p>

<p>--unprivileged (Assume that the user lacks raw socket
privileges) . This option is the opposite of --privileged.
It tells Nping to treat the user as lacking network raw
socket and sniffing privileges. This is useful for testing,
debugging, or when the raw network functionality of your
operating system is somehow broken. The NPING_UNPRIVILEGED.
environment variable may be set as an alternative to using
--unprivileged.</p>

<p>--send-eth (Use raw ethernet sending) . Asks Nping to
send packets at the raw ethernet (data link) layer rather
than the higher IP (network) layer. By default, Nping
chooses the one which is generally best for the platform it
is running on. Raw sockets (IP layer) are generally most
efficient for Unix machines, while ethernet frames are
required for Windows operation since Microsoft disabled raw
socket support. Nping still uses raw IP packets despite this
option when there is no other choice (such as non-ethernet
connections).</p>

<p>--send-ip (Send at raw IP level) . Asks Nping to send
packets via raw IP sockets rather than sending lower level
ethernet frames. It is the complement to the --send-eth
option.</p>

<p>--bpf-filter filter spec --filter filter spec (Set
custom BPF filter) . This option lets you use a custom BPF
filter. By default Nping chooses a filter that is intended
to capture most common responses to the particular probes
that are sent. For example, when sending TCP packets, the
filter is set to capture packets whose destination port
matches the probe&acute;s source port or ICMP error messages
that may be generated by the target or any intermediate
device as a result of the probe. If for some reason you
expect strange packets in response to sent probes or you
just want to sniff a particular kind of traffic, you can
specify a custom filter using the BPF syntax used by tools
like tcpdump.. See the documentation at
http://www.tcpdump.org/ for more information.</p>

<p>-H, --hide-sent (Do not display sent packets) . This
option tells Nping not to print information about sent
packets. This can be useful when using very short
inter-probe delays (i.e., when flooding), because printing
information to the standard output has a computational cost
and disabling it can probably speed things up a bit. Also,
it may be useful when using Nping to detect active hosts or
open ports (e.g. sending probes to all TCP ports in a /24
subnet). In that case, users may not want to see thousands
of sent probes but just the replies generated by active
hosts.</p>

<p>-N, --no-capture (Do not attempt to capture replies) .
This option tells Nping to skip packet capture. This means
that packets in response to sent probes will not be
processed or displayed. This can be useful when doing
flooding and network stack stress tests. Note that when this
option is specified, most of the statistics shown at the end
of the execution will be useless. This option does not work
with TCP Connect mode.</p>

<p>OUTPUT OPTIONS -v[level], --verbose [level] (Increase or
set verbosity level) . Increases the verbosity level,
causing Nping to print more information during its
execution. There are 9 levels of verbosity (-4 to 4). Every
instance of -v increments the verbosity level by one (from
its default value, level 0). Every instance of option -q
decrements the verbosity level by one. Alternatively you can
specify the level directly, as in -v3 or -v-1. These are the
available levels:</p>

<p>Level 4 No output at all. In some circumstances you may
not want Nping to produce any output (like when one of your
work mates is watching over your shoulder). In that case
level 4 can be useful because although you won&acute;t see
any response packets, probes will still be sent.</p>

<p>Level 3 Like level 4 but displays fatal error messages
so you can actually see if Nping is running or it failed due
to some error.</p>

<p>Level 2 Like level 3 but also displays warnings and
recoverable errors.</p>

<p>Level 1 Displays traditional run-time information
(version, start time, statistics, etc.) but does not display
sent or received packets.</p>

<p>Level 0 This is the default verbosity level. It behaves
like level 1 but also displays sent and received packets and
some other important information.</p>

<p>Level 1 Like level 0 but it displays detailed
information about timing, flags, protocol details, etc.</p>

<p>Level 2 Like level 1 but displays very detailed
information about sent and received packets and other
interesting information.</p>

<p>Level 3 Like level 2 but also displays the raw
hexadecimal dump of sent and received packets.</p>

<p>Level 4 Currently unused.</p>

<p>-q[level], --reduce-verbosity [level] (Decrease
verbosity level) . Decreases the verbosity level, causing
Nping to print less information during its execution.</p>

<p>-d[level] (Increase or set debugging level) . When even
verbose mode doesn&acute;t provide sufficient data for you,
debugging is available to flood you with much more! As with
the -v, debugging is enabled with a command-line flag -d and
the debug level can be increased by specifying it multiple
times. There are 7 debugging levels (0 to 6). Every instance
of -d increments debugging level by one. Provide an argument
to -d to set the level directly; for example -d4.</p>

<p>Debugging output is useful when you suspect a bug in
Nping, or if you are simply confused as to what Nping is
doing and why. As this feature is mostly intended for
developers, debug lines aren&acute;t always
self-explanatory. You may get something like</p>

<p>NSOCK (1.0000s) Callback: TIMER SUCCESS for EID 12;
tcpconnect_event_handler(): Received callback of type TIMER
with status SUCCESS</p>

<p>If you don&acute;t understand a line, your only
recourses are to ignore it, look it up in the source code,
or request help from the development list (nmap-dev). Some
lines are self-explanatory, but the messages become more
obscure as the debug level is increased. These are the
available levels:</p>

<p>Level 0 Level 0. No debug information at all. This is
the default level.</p>

<p>Level 1 In this level, only very important or high-level
debug information will be printed.</p>

<p>Level 2 Like level 1 but also displays important or
medium-level debug information</p>

<p>Level 3 Like level 2 but also displays regular and
low-level debug information.</p>

<p>Level 4 Like level 3 but also displays messages only a
real Nping freak would want to see.</p>

<p>Level 5 Like level 4 but it enables basic debug
information related to external libraries like Nsock..</p>

<p>Level 6 Like level 5 but it enables full, very detailed,
debug information related to external libraries like
Nsock.</p>

<p>BUGS Like its author, Nping isn&acute;t perfect. But you
can help make it better by sending bug reports or even
writing patches. If Nping doesn&acute;t behave the way you
expect, first upgrade to the latest Nmap version available
from http://nmap.org/download.html. If the problem persists,
do some research to determine whether it has already been
discovered and addressed. Try searching for the error
message on our search page at
http://insecure.org/search.html or at Google. Also try
browsing the nmap-dev archives at http://seclists.org/. Read
this full manual page as well. If nothing comes out of this,
mail a bug report to nmap-dev@insecure.org. Please include
everything you have learned about the problem, as well as
what version of Nping you are running and what operating
system version it is running on. Problem reports and Nping
usage questions sent to nmap-dev@insecure.org are far more
likely to be answered than those sent to Fyodor directly. If
you subscribe to the nmap-dev list before posting, your
message will bypass moderation and get through more quickly.

<p>Code patches to fix bugs are even better than bug
reports. Basic instructions for creating patch files with
your changes are available at http://nmap.org/data/HACKING.
Patches may be sent to nmap-dev (recommended) or to any of
the authors listed in the next section directly.</p>
