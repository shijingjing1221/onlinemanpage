<p>NAME dtach - simple program that emulates the detach
feature of screen.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dtach -a &lt;socket&gt; &lt;options&gt; dtach
-A &lt;socket&gt; &lt;options&gt; &lt;command...&gt; dtach
-c &lt;socket&gt; &lt;options&gt; &lt;command...&gt; dtach
-n &lt;socket&gt; &lt;options&gt; &lt;command...&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dtach is a program that emulates the detach
feature of screen. It is designed to be transparent and
un-intrusive; it avoids interpreting the input and output
between attached terminals and the program under its
control. Consequently, it works best with full-screen
applications such as emacs.</p>

<p>dtach is intended for users who want the detach feature
of screen with- out the other overhead of screen. It is
tiny, does not use many libraries, and stays out of the way
as much as possible.</p>

<p>SESSIONS A session in dtach is a single instance in
which a program is running under the control of dtach. The
program is disassociated from the original terminal, and is
thus protected from your original terminal being
disconnected for some reason.</p>

<p>Other instances of dtach can attach themselves to a
particular session. Input and output is copied between the
program running in the dtach session, and the attached
terminals.</p>

<p>dtach avoids interpreting the communication stream
between the program and the attached terminals; it instead
relies on the ability of the attached terminals to manage
the screen.</p>

<p>Sessions are represented by Unix-domain sockets in the
filesystem. No other permission checking other than the
filesystem access checks is performed. dtach creates a
master process that monitors the session socket, the
program, and any attached terminals.</p>

<p>MODES dtach has several modes of operation. It can
create a new session in which a program is executed, or it
can attach to an existing session. The first argument
specifies which mode dtach should operate in.</p>

<p>-a Attach to an existing session. dtach attaches itself
to the session specified by &lt;socket&gt;. After the attach
is completed, the window size of the current terminal is
sent to the master process, and a redraw is also
requested.</p>

<p>-A Attach to an existing session, or create a new one.
dtach first tries to attach to the session specified by
&lt;socket&gt; if possi- ble. If the attempt to open the
socket fails, dtach tries to create a new session before
attaching to it.</p>

<p>-c Creates a new session. A new session is created in
which the specified program is executed. dtach then tries to
attach itself to the newly created session.</p>

<p>-n Creates a new session, without attaching to it. A new
session is created in which the specified program is
executed. dtach does not try to attach to the newly created
session, however, and exits instead.</p>

<p>OPTIONS dtach has a few options that allow you to modify
its behavior. Each attaching process can have separate
settings for these options, which allows for some
flexibility.</p>

<p>-e &lt;char&gt; Sets the detach character to
&lt;char&gt;. When the detach character is pressed, dtach
detaches itself from the current session and exits. The
process running in the session is unaffected by the detach.
By default, the detach character is set to ^ (Ctrl-.</p>

<p>-E Disables the detach character. dtach does not try to
scan input from the terminal for a detach character. The
only way to detach from the session is then by sending the
attaching process an appropriate signal.</p>

<p>-r &lt;method&gt; Sets the redraw method to
&lt;method&gt;. The valid methods are none, ctrl_l, or
winch.</p>

<p>none disables redrawing completely, ctrl_l sends a Ctrl
L char- acter to the program if the terminal is in
character-at-a-time and no-echo mode, and winch forces a
WINCH signal to be sent to the program.</p>

<p>When creating a new session, the specified method is
used as the default redraw method for the session. If not
specified, the ctrl_l method is used.</p>

<p>-z Disables processing of the suspend key. Normally,
dtach will suspend itself when the suspend key is pressed.
With this option, the suspend character is sent to the
session instead of being handled by dtach.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following example creates a new session
that has the detach charac- ter and suspend processing
disabled. A socket is created in the /tmp directory for the
session.</p>

<p>$ dtach -c /tmp/foozle -Ez bash</p>

<p>The following example attaches to the /tmp/foozle
session if it exists, and if not, creates a new session
using /tmp/foozle as the socket for the session. Processing
of the suspend character is also disabled for the attach
instance.</p>

<p>$ dtach -A /tmp/foozle -z bash</p>

<p>The following example attaches to the /tmp/foozle
session, using the winch redraw method to redraw the
screen.</p>

<p>$ dtach -a /tmp/foozle -r winch</p>

<p>The following example creates a new session and sets the
default redraw method for the session to the winch redraw
method.</p>

<p>$ dtach -c /tmp/foozle -r winch bash</p>
