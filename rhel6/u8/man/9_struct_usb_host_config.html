<p>STRUCT USB_HOST_CONF(9) Host-Side Data Types and Macro
STRUCT USB_HOST_CONF(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_usb_host_config - representation of a
device&acute;s configuration</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct usb_host_config { struct
usb_config_descriptor desc; char * string; struct
usb_interface_assoc_descriptor * intf_assoc[USB_MAXIADS];
struct usb_interface * interface[USB_MAXINTERFACES]; struct
usb_interface_cache * intf_cache[USB_MAXINTERFACES];
unsigned char * extra; int extralen; };</p>

<p>MEMBERS desc the device&acute;s configuration
descriptor.</p>

<p>string pointer to the cached version of the
iConfiguration string, if present for this
configuration.</p>

<p>intf_assoc[USB_MAXIADS] list of any interface
association descriptors in this config</p>

<p>interface[USB_MAXINTERFACES] array of pointers to
usb_interface structures, one for each interface in the
configuration. The number of interfaces is stored in
desc.bNumInterfaces. These pointers are valid only while the
the configuration is active.</p>

<p>intf_cache[USB_MAXINTERFACES] array of pointers to
usb_interface_cache structures, one for each interface in
the configuration. These structures exist for the entire
life of the device.</p>

<p>extra pointer to buffer containing all extra descriptors
associated with this configuration (those preceding the
first interface descriptor).</p>

<p>extralen length of the extra descriptors buffer.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION USB devices may have multiple
configurations, but only one can be active at any time. Each
encapsulates a different operational environment; for
example, a dual-speed device would have separate
configurations for full-speed and high-speed operation. The
number of configurations available is stored in the device
descriptor as bNumConfigurations.</p>

<p>A configuration can contain multiple interfaces. Each
corresponds to a different function of the USB device, and
all are available whenever the configuration is active. The
USB standard says that interfaces are supposed to be
numbered from 0 to desc.bNumInterfaces-1, but a lot of
devices get this wrong. In addition, the interface array is
not guaranteed to be sorted in numerical order. Use
usb_ifnum_to_if to look up an interface entry based on its
number.</p>

<p>Device drivers should not attempt to activate
configurations. The choice of which configuration to install
is a policy decision based on such considerations as
available power, functionality provided, and the
user&acute;s desires (expressed through userspace tools).
However, drivers can call usb_reset_configuration to
reinitialize the current configuration and all its
interfaces.</p>
