<p>NAME xwd - dump an image of an X window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xwd [-debug] [-help] [-nobdrs] [-out file]
[-xy] [-frame] [-add value] [-root | -id id | -name name ]
[-icmap] [-screen] [-silent] [-display display]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xwd is an X Window System window dumping
utility. Xwd allows X users to store window images in a
specially formatted dump file. This file can then be read by
various other X utilities for redisplay, printing, editing,
formatting, archiving, image processing, etc. The target
win- dow is selected by clicking the pointer in the desired
window. The keyboard bell is rung once at the beginning of
the dump and twice when the dump is completed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -display display This argument allows you to
specify the server to connect to; see X(7).</p>

<p>-help Print out the Usage: command syntax summary.</p>

<p>-nobdrs This argument specifies that the window dump
should not include the pixels that compose the X window
border. This is useful in situations where you may wish to
include the window contents in a document as an
illustration.</p>

<p>-out file This argument allows the user to explicitly
specify the output file on the command line. The default is
to output to standard out.</p>

<p>-xy This option applies to color displays only. It
selects XY format dumping instead of the default Z
format.</p>

<p>-add value This option specifies an signed value to be
added to every pixel.</p>

<p>-frame This option indicates that the window manager
frame should be included when manually selecting a
window.</p>

<p>-root This option indicates that the root window should
be selected for the window dump, without requiring the user
to select a window with the pointer.</p>

<p>-id id This option indicates that the window with the
specified resource id should be selected for the window
dump, without requiring the user to select a window with the
pointer.</p>

<p>-name name This option indicates that the window with
the specified WM_NAME property should be selected for the
window dump, without requiring the user to select a window
with the pointer.</p>

<p>-icmap Normally the colormap of the chosen window is
used to obtain RGB values. This option forces the first
installed colormap of the screen to be used instead.</p>

<p>-screen This option indicates that the GetImage request
used to obtain the image should be done on the root window,
rather than directly on the specified window. In this way,
you can obtain pieces of other windows that overlap the
specified window, and more importantly, you can capture
menus or other popups that are independent windows but
appear over the specified window.</p>

<p>-silent Operate silently, i.e. dont ring any bells
before and after dumping the window.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY To get default host and display
number.</p>

<p>FILES XWDFile.h X Window Dump File format definition
file.</p>
