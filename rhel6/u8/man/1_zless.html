<p>NAME zless - file perusal filter for crt viewing of
compressed text</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS zless [ name ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Zless is a filter which allows examination
of compressed or plain text files one screenful at a time on
a soft-copy terminal. It is the equivalent of setting the
environment variable LESSOPEN to |gzip -cdfq -- %s, and the
environment variable LESSMETACHARS to and then running less.
However, enough people seem to think that having the command
zless available is important to be worth providing it.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO zmore(1), less(1)</p>

<p>BUGS Zless does not work with compressed data that is
piped to it via stan- dard input; it requires that input
files be specified as arguments.</p>
