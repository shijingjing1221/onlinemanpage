<p>PTHREAD_RWLOCK_TRYWRLOCK(3PPOSIX Programmer s
ManuPTHREAD_RWLOCK_TRYWRLOCK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_rwlock_trywrlock, pthread_rwlock_wrlock -
lock a read-write lock object for writing</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_rwlock_trywrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock);
int pthread_rwlock_wrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() function
shall apply a write lock like the pthread_rwlock_wrlock()
function, with the exception that the func- tion shall fail
if any thread currently holds rwlock (for reading or
writing).</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlock_wrlock() function shall apply a write
lock to the read-write lock referenced by rwlock. The
calling thread acquires the write lock if no other thread
(reader or writer) holds the read-write lock rwlock.
Otherwise, the thread shall block until it can acquire the
lock. The calling thread may deadlock if at the time the
call is made it holds the read-write lock (whether a read or
write lock).</p>

<p>Implementations may favor writers over readers to avoid
writer starva- tion.</p>

<p>Results are undefined if any of these functions are
called with an uninitialized read-write lock.</p>

<p>If a signal is delivered to a thread waiting for a
read-write lock for writing, upon return from the signal
handler the thread resumes waiting for the read-write lock
for writing as if it was not interrupted.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() function
shall return zero if the lock for writing on the read-write
lock object referenced by rwlock is acquired. Otherwise, an
error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>If successful, the pthread_rwlock_wrlock() function
shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() function shall
fail if:</p>

<p>EBUSY The read-write lock could not be acquired for
writing because it was already locked for reading or
writing.</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() and
pthread_rwlock_wrlock() functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by rwlock does not refer to
an initialized read-write lock object.</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlock_wrlock() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EDEADLK The current thread already owns the read-write
lock for writing or reading.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Applications using these functions may
be subject to priority inver- sion, as discussed in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.285,
Priority Inversion.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
