<p>Tcl_AppInit(3) Tcl Library Procedures Tcl_AppInit(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_AppInit - perform application-specific
initialization</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tcl_AppInit(interp)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter for the
application.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_AppInit is a hook procedure that is
invoked by the main programs for Tcl applications such as
tclsh and wish. Its purpose is to allow new Tcl applications
to be created without modifying the main programs provided
as part of Tcl and Tk. To create a new application you write
a new version of Tcl_AppInit to replace the default version
provided by Tcl, then link your new Tcl_AppInit with the Tcl
library.</p>

<p>Tcl_AppInit is invoked by Tcl_Main and Tk_Main after
their own initial- ization and before entering the main loop
to process commands. Here are some examples of things that
Tcl_AppInit might do:</p>

<p>[1] Call initialization procedures for various packages
used by the application. Each initialization procedure adds
new commands to interp for its package and performs other
package-specific ini- tialization.</p>

<p>[2] Process command-line arguments, which can be
accessed from the Tcl variables argv and argv0 in
interp.</p>

<p>[3] Invoke a startup script to initialize the
application.</p>

<p>Tcl_AppInit returns TCL_OK or TCL_ERROR. If it returns
TCL_ERROR then it must leave an error message in for the
interpreter s result; other- wise the result is ignored.</p>

<p>In addition to Tcl_AppInit, your application should also
contain a pro- cedure main that calls Tcl_Main as follows:
Tcl_Main(argc, argv, Tcl_AppInit); The third argument to
Tcl_Main gives the address of the application- specific
initialization procedure to invoke. This means that you do
not have to use the name Tcl_AppInit for the procedure, but
in practice the name is nearly always Tcl_AppInit (in
versions before Tcl 7.4 the name Tcl_AppInit was implicit;
there was no way to specify the proce- dure explicitly). The
best way to get started is to make a copy of the file
tclAppInit.c from the Tcl library or source directory. It
already contains a main procedure and a template for
Tcl_AppInit that you can modify for your application.</p>
