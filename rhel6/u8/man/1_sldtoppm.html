<p>NAME sldtoppm - convert an AutoCAD slide file to a PPM
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sldtoppm [-adjust] [-dir] [{-height|-ysize} s]
[-info] [{-lib|-Lib} name] [-scale s] [-verbose]
[{-width|-xsize} s] [slidefile]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>sldtoppm reads an AutoCAD&reg; slide file and outputs a
PPM image. If you dont specify slidefile, sldtoppm reads
input from Standard Input. sldtoppm uses the ppmdraw library
to convert the vector and polygon information in the slide
file to a raster; see the file ppmdraw.h for details on this
package.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -adjust If the display on which the slide file
was created had non- square pixels, when you process the
slide with sldtoppm and dont specify -adjust, sldtoppm
issues the following warning;</p>

<p>Warning - pixels on source screen were non-square.</p>

<p>Specifying -adjust will correct the image width to
compensate. Speci- fying the -adjust option causes sldtoppm
to scale the width of the image so that pixels in the
resulting PPM image are square (and hence circles appear as
true circles, not ellipses). The scaling is per- formed in
the vector domain, before scan converting the objects. The
results are, therefore, superior in appearance to what youd
obtain were you to perform the equivalent scaling with
pamscale after the bitmap had been created.</p>

<p>-dir The input is assumed to be an AutoCAD slide library
file. A directory listing each slide in the library is
printed on stan- dard error.</p>

<p>-height size Scales the image in the vector domain so it
is size pixels in height. If you don t specify -width or
-xsize, sldtoppm adjusts the width to preserve the pixel
aspect ratio.</p>

<p>-info Dump the slide file header on standard error,
displaying the original screen size and aspect ratio among
other information.</p>

<p>-lib name Extracts the slide with the given name from
the slide library given as input. sldtoppm converts the
specified name to upper case.</p>

<p>-Lib name Extracts the slide with the given name from
the slide library given as input. sldtoppm uses name in the
case specified; it does not convert it to upper case.</p>

<p>-scale s Scales the image by factor s, which may be any
floating point value greater than zero. sldtoppm does the
scaling after aspect ratio adjustment, if any. Since it does
the scaling in the vec- tor domain, before rasterisation,
the results look much better than running the output of
sldtoppm through pamscale.</p>

<p>-verbose Dumps the slide file header and lists every
vector and polygon to Standard Error.</p>

<p>-width size Scales the image in the vector domain so it
is size pixels wide. If you dont specify -height or -ysize,
sldtoppm adjusts the height to preserve the pixel aspect
ratio.</p>

<p>-xsize size Scales the image in the vector domain so it
is size pixels wide. If you dont specify -height or -ysize,
sldtoppm adjusts the height to preserve the pixel aspect
ratio.</p>

<p>-ysize size Scales the image in the vector domain so it
is size pixels in height. If you don t specify -width or
-xsize, sldtoppm adjusts the width to preserve the pixel
aspect ratio.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS sldtoppm can convert only Level 2 slides.
Level 1 format has been obsolete since the advent of AutoCAD
Release 9 in 1987, and was not portable across machine
architectures.</p>

<p>Slide library items with names containing 8 bit (such as
ISO) or 16 bit (Kanji, for example) characters may not be
found when chosen with the -lib option unless sldtoppm was
built with character set conversion functions appropriate to
the locale. You can always retrieve slides from libraries
regardless of the character set by using the -Lib option and
specifying the precise name of library member. Use the -dir
option to list the slides in a library if you re unsure of
the exact name.</p>
