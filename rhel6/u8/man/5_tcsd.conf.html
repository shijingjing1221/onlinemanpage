<p>NAME tcsd.conf - configuration file for the trousers TCS
daemon.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This file, by default /etc/tcsd.conf is read
by the trousers TCSD dae- mon, tcsd (see tcsd(8)). The
tcsd.conf file that is installed by trousers contains all
the default options, commented out.</p>

<p>OPTIONS port The port that TCSD will listen on for
connections, local and remote, from applications.</p>

<p>num_threads The maximum number of threads that the TCSD
will spawn simultaneously to service applications. After
num_threads threads have been spawned, any application that
attempts to connect to the TCSD will receive an error.</p>

<p>system_ps_file The location of the system persistent
storage file. The system persistent storage file holds keys
and data across restarts of the TCSD and system reboots.</p>

<p>firmware_log_file Path to the file containing the
current firmware PCR event log data. The interface to this
log is usually provided by the TPM device driver.</p>

<p>kernel_log_file Path to the file containing the current
kernel PCR event log data. By default, this data will be
parsed in the format pro- vided by the Integrity Measurement
Architecture LSM.</p>

<p>firmware_pcrs A list of PCR indices that are manipulated
only by the system firmware and therefore are not extended
or logged by the TCSD. Applications that call Tcsi_PcrExtend
on PCRs listed here will receive an error.</p>

<p>kernel_pcrs A list of PCR indices that are manipulated
only by the ker- nel and therefore are not extended or
logged by the TCSD. Applications that call Tcsi_PcrExtend on
PCRs listed here will receive an error.</p>

<p>platform_cred Path to the platform credential for your
TPM. Your TPM manufacturer may have provided you with a set
of credentials (certifi- cates) that should be used when
creating identities using your TPM. When a user of your TPM
makes an identity, this credential will be encrypted as part
of that process. See the 1.1b TPM Main specification section
9.3 for information on this process.</p>

<p>conformance_cred Path to the conformance credential for
your TPM. Your TPM manufacturer may have provided you with a
set of credentials (cer- tificates) that should be used when
creating identities using your TPM. When a user of your TPM
makes an identity, this credential will be encrypted as part
of that process. See the 1.1b TPM Main specification section
9.3 for information on this process.</p>

<p>endorsement_cred Path to the endorsement credential for
your TPM. Your TPM manufacturer may have provided you with a
set of credentials (cer- tificates) that should be used when
creating identities using your TPM. When a user of your TPM
makes an identity, this credential will be encrypted as part
of that process. See the 1.1b TPM Main specification section
9.3 for information on this process.</p>

<p>remote_ops A list of TCS commands which will be allowed
to be executed on this machines TCSD by TSPs on non-local
hosts (over the internet). By default, access to all
operations is denied.</p>

<p>host_platform_class Determines the TCG specification of
the hosts platform class. This refers to one of the
specifications contained in the TCG web site. The default is
PC specification version 1.2 .</p>

<p>all_platform_classes Specifies all the TCG defined
platforms associated with the host platform. The
host_platform_class must not be defined here. By default,
all platforms but the host platform are associated.</p>
