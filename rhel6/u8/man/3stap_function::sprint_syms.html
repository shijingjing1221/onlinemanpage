<p>FUNCTION::SPRINT_SYM(3stap) Context Functions
FUNCTION::SPRINT_SYM(3stap)</p>

<p>NAME function::sprint_syms - Return stack for kernel
addresses from string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sprint_syms(callers:string)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS callers String with list of hexadecimal
(kernel) addresses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Perform a symbolic lookup of the addresses
in the given string, which are assumed to be the result of a
prior calls to stack, callers, and similar functions.</p>

<p>Returns a simple backtrace from the given hex string.
One line per address. Includes the symbol name (or hex
address if symbol couldn&acute;t be resolved) and module
name (if found), as obtained from symdata. Includes the
offset from the start of the function if found, otherwise
the offset will be added to the module (if found, between
brackets). Returns the backtrace as string (each line
terminated by a newline character). Note that the returned
stack will be truncated to MAXSTRINGLEN, to print fuller and
richer stacks use print_syms.</p>
