<p>NAME XChangeDeviceDontPropagateList,
XGetDeviceDontPropagateList - query or change the
dont-propagate-list for extension devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;</p>

<p>int XChangeDeviceDontPropagateList( Display *display,
Window window, int count, XEventClass *event_list, int
mode);</p>

<p>XEventClass* XGetDeviceDontPropagateList( Display
*display, Window window, int *count);</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window whose dont-propagate-list is
to be queried or modified.</p>

<p>event_list Specifies a pointer to a list of event
classes.</p>

<p>mode Specifies the mode.You can pass AddToList, or
DeleteFromList.</p>

<p>count Specifies the number of event classes in the
list.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XChangeDeviceDontPropagateList request
modifies the list of events that should not be propagated to
ancestors of the event window. This request allows extension
events to be added to or deleted from that list. By default,
all events are propagated to ancestor windows. Once
modified, the list remains modified for the life of the
window. Events are not removed from the list because the
client that added them has terminated.</p>

<p>Suppression of event propagation is not allowed for all
input extension events. If a specified event class is one
that cannot be suppressed, a BadClass error will result.
Events that can be suppressed include DeviceKeyPress,
DeviceKeyRelease, DeviceButtonPress, DeviceButtonRelease,
DeviceMotionNotify, ProximityIn, and ProximityOut.</p>

<p>XChangeDeviceDontPropagateList can generate a BadDevice,
BadClass, or BadValue error.</p>

<p>The XGetDeviceDontPropagateList request queries the list
of events that should not be propagated to ancestors of the
event window.</p>

<p>XGetDeviceDontPropagateList can generate a BadClass or
BadWindow error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid device was specified.
The specified device does not exist or has not been opened
by this client via XOpenInputDevice. This error may also
occur if some other client has caused the specified device
to become the X keyboard or X pointer device via the
XChangeKeyboardDevice or XChangePointerDevice requests.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument&rsquo;s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
set of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p>BadWindow An invalid window id was specified.</p>

<p>BadClass An invalid event class was specified.</p>
