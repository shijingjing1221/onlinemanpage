<p>rmiregistry(1) Remote Method Invocation (RMI) Tools
rmiregistry(1)</p>

<p>NAME rmiregistry - Starts a remote object registry on
the specified port on the current host.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rmiregistry [ port ]</p>

<p>port The number of a port on the current host at which
to start the remote object registry.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rmiregistry command creates and starts a
remote object registry on the specified port on the current
host. If the port is omitted, then the registry is started
on port 1099. The rmiregistry command produces no output and
is typically run in the background, for example:</p>

<p>A remote object registry is a bootstrap naming service
that is used by RMI servers on the same host to bind remote
objects to names. Clients on local and remote hosts can then
look up remote objects and make remote method
invocations.</p>

<p>The registry is typically used to locate the first
remote object on which an application needs to call methods.
That object then provides application-specific support for
finding other objects.</p>

<p>The methods of the java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry
class are used to get a registry operating on the local host
or local host and port.</p>

<p>The URL-based methods of the java.rmi.Naming class
operate on a registry and can be used to look up a remote
object on any host and on the local host. Bind a simple name
(string) to a remote object, rebind a new name to a remote
object (overriding the old binding), unbind a remote object,
and list the URL bound in the registry.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -J Used with any Java option to pass the option
following the -J (no spaces between the -J and the option)
to the Java interpreter.</p>
