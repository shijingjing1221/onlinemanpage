<p>NAME guestmount - Mount a guest filesystem on the host
using FUSE and libguestfs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS guestmount [--options] -a disk.img -m device
[--ro] mountpoint</p>

<p>guestmount [--options] -a disk.img -i [--ro]
mountpoint</p>

<p>guestmount [--options] -d Guest -i [--ro] mountpoint</p>

<p>WARNING You must not use &quot;guestmount&quot; in
read-write mode on live virtual machines. If you do this,
you risk disk corruption in the VM.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The guestmount program can be used to mount
virtual machine filesystems and other disk images on the
host. It uses libguestfs for access to the guest filesystem,
and FUSE (the &quot;filesystem in userspace&quot;) to make
it appear as a mountable device.</p>

<p>Along with other options, you have to give at least one
device (-a option) or libvirt domain (-d option), and at
least one mountpoint (-m option) or use the -i inspection
option or the --live option. How this works is better
explained in the guestfish(1) manual page, or by looking at
the examples below.</p>

<p>FUSE lets you mount filesystems as non-root. The
mountpoint must be owned by you, and the filesystem will not
be visible to any other users unless you make certain global
configuration changes to &quot;/etc/fuse.conf&quot;. To
unmount the filesystem, use the &quot;fusermount -u&quot;
command.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES For a typical Windows guest which has its main
filesystem on the first partition:</p>

<p>guestmount -a windows.img -m /dev/sda1 --ro /mnt</p>

<p>For a typical Linux guest which has a /boot filesystem
on the first partition, and the root filesystem on a logical
volume:</p>

<p>guestmount -a linux.img -m /dev/VG/LV -m /dev/sda1:/boot
--ro /mnt</p>

<p>To get libguestfs to detect guest mountpoints for
you:</p>

<p>guestmount -a guest.img -i --ro /mnt</p>

<p>For a libvirt guest called &quot;Guest&quot; you could
do:</p>

<p>guestmount -d Guest -i --ro /mnt</p>

<p>If you dont know what filesystems are contained in a
guest or disk image, use virt-filesystems(1) first:</p>

<p>virt-filesystems -d MyGuest</p>

<p>If you want to trace the libguestfs calls but without
excessive debugging information, we recommend:</p>

<p>guestmount [...] --trace /mnt</p>

<p>If you want to debug the program, we recommend:</p>

<p>guestmount [...] --trace --verbose /mnt</p>

<p>NOTES Other users cannot see the filesystem by default
If you mount a filesystem as one user (eg. root), then other
users will not be able to see it by default. The fix is to
add the FUSE &quot;allow_other&quot; option when
mounting:</p>

<p>sudo guestmount [...] -o allow_other /mnt</p>

<p>Enabling FUSE On some distros, you may need to add
yourself to a special group (eg. &quot;fuse&quot;) before
you can use any FUSE filesystem. This is necessary on Debian
and derivatives.</p>

<p>On other distros, no special group is required. It is
not necessary on Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>

<p>fusermount error: &quot;Device or resource busy&quot;
You can see this error when another process on the system
jumps into the mountpoint you have just created, holding it
open and preventing you from unmounting it. The usual
culprits are various GUI &quot;indexing&quot; programs.</p>

<p>The popular workaround for this problem is to retry the
&quot;fusermount -u&quot; command a few times until it
works. Unfortunately this isnt a reliable fix if (for
example) the mounted filesystem is particularly large and
the intruding program particularly persistent.</p>

<p>timeout=10</p>

<p>count=$timeout while ! fusermount -u $mountpoint
&amp;&amp; [ $count -gt 0 ]; do sleep 1 ((count--)) done if
[ $count -eq 0 ]; then echo &quot;$0: fusermount failed
after $timeout seconds&quot; exit 1 fi</p>

<p>A proper fix is to use a private mountpoint by creating
a new mount namespace using the Linux-specific
clone(2)/unshare(2) flag &quot;CLONE_NEWNS&quot;.
Unfortunately at the moment this requires root and we would
also probably need to add it as a feature to guestmount.</p>

<p>Race conditions possible when shutting down the
connection When &quot;fusermount -u&quot; exits, guestmount
may still be running and cleaning up the mountpoint. The
disk image will not be fully finalized.</p>

<p>This means that scripts like the following have a nasty
race condition:</p>

<p>guestmount -a disk.img -i /mnt # copy things into /mnt
fusermount -u /mnt # immediately try to use
&rsquo;disk.img&rsquo; ** UNSAFE **</p>

<p>The solution is to use the --pid-file option to write
the guestmount PID to a file, then after fusermount spin
waiting for this PID to exit.</p>

<p>guestmount -a disk.img -i --pid-file guestmount.pid
/mnt</p>

<p># ... # ...</p>

<p># Save the PID of guestmount *before* calling
fusermount. pid=&quot;$(cat guestmount.pid)&quot;</p>

<p>timeout=10</p>

<p># fusermount retry code, see above # ... # ...</p>

<p>count=$timeout while kill -0 &quot;$pid&quot;
2&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; [ $count -gt 0 ]; do sleep 1
((count--)) done if [ $count -eq 0 ]; then echo &quot;$0:
wait for guestmount to exit failed after $timeout
seconds&quot; exit 1 fi</p>

<p># Now it is safe to use the disk image.</p>

<p>Note that if you use the &quot;guestfs_mount_local&quot;
API directly (see &quot;MOUNT LOCAL&quot; in guestfs(3))
then it is much easier to write a safe, race-free
program.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a image --add image Add a block device or
virtual machine image.</p>

<p>The format of the disk image is auto-detected. To
override this and force a particular format use the
--format=.. option.</p>

<p>-c URI --connect URI When used in conjunction with the
-d option, this specifies the libvirt URI to use. The
default is to use the default libvirt connection.</p>

<p>-d libvirt-domain --domain libvirt-domain Add disks from
the named libvirt domain. If the --ro option is also used,
then any libvirt domain can be used. However in write mode,
only libvirt domains which are shut down can be named
here.</p>

<p>Domain UUIDs can be used instead of names.</p>

<p>--dir-cache-timeout N Set the readdir cache timeout to N
seconds, the default being 60 seconds. The readdir cache
[actually, there are several semi- independent caches] is
populated after a readdir(2) call with the stat and extended
attributes of the files in the directory, in anticipation
that they will be requested soon after.</p>

<p>There is also a different attribute cache implemented by
FUSE (see the FUSE option -o attr_timeout), but the FUSE
cache does not anticipate future requests, only cache
existing ones.</p>

<p>--echo-keys When prompting for keys and passphrases,
guestfish normally turns echoing off so you cannot see what
you are typing. If you are not worried about Tempest attacks
and there is no one else in the room you can specify this
flag to see what you are typing.</p>

<p>--format=raw|qcow2|.. --format The default for the -a
option is to auto-detect the format of the disk image. Using
this forces the disk format for -a options which follow on
the command line. Using --format with no argument switches
back to auto-detection for subsequent -a options.</p>

<p>If you have untrusted raw-format guest disk images, you
should use this option to specify the disk format. This
avoids a possible security problem with malicious guests
(CVE-2010-3851). See also &quot;guestfs_add_drive_opts&quot;
in guestfs(3).</p>

<p>--fuse-help Display help on special FUSE options (see -o
below).</p>

<p>--help Display brief help and exit.</p>

<p>-i --inspector Using virt-inspector(1) code, inspect the
disks looking for an operating system and mount filesystems
as they would be mounted on the real virtual machine.</p>

<p>--keys-from-stdin Read key or passphrase parameters from
stdin. The default is to try to read passphrases from the
user by opening &quot;/dev/tty&quot;.</p>

<p>--live Connect to a live virtual machine. (Experimental,
see &quot;ATTACHING TO RUNNING DAEMONS&quot; in
guestfs(3)).</p>

<p>-m dev[:mountpoint[:options[:fstype]] --mount
dev[:mountpoint[:options[:fstype]]] Mount the named
partition or logical volume on the given mountpoint in the
guest (this has nothing to do with mountpoints in the
host).</p>

<p>If the mountpoint is omitted, it defaults to
&quot;/&quot;. You have to mount something on
&quot;/&quot;.</p>

<p>The third (and rarely used) part of the mount parameter
is the list of mount options used to mount the underlying
filesystem. If this is not given, then the mount options are
either the empty string or &quot;ro&quot; (the latter if the
--ro flag is used). By specifying the mount options, you
override this default choice. Probably the only time you
would use this is to enable ACLs and/or extended attributes
if the filesystem can support them:</p>

<p>-m /dev/sda1:/:acl,user_xattr</p>

<p>The fourth part of the parameter is the filesystem
driver to use, such as &quot;ext3&quot; or &quot;ntfs&quot;.
This is rarely needed, but can be useful if multiple drivers
are valid for a filesystem (eg: &quot;ext2&quot; and
&quot;ext3&quot;), or if libguestfs misidentifies a
filesystem.</p>

<p>-n --no-sync By default, we attempt to sync the guest
disk when the FUSE mountpoint is unmounted. If you specify
this option, then we dont attempt to sync the disk. See the
discussion of autosync in the guestfs(3) manpage.</p>

<p>-o option --option option Pass extra options to
FUSE.</p>

<p>To get a list of all the extra options supported by
FUSE, use the command below. Note that only the FUSE -o
options can be passed, and only some of them are a good
idea.</p>

<p>guestmount --fuse-help</p>

<p>Some potentially useful FUSE options:</p>

<p>-o allow_other Allow other users to see the
filesystem.</p>

<p>-o attr_timeout=N Enable attribute caching by FUSE, and
set the timeout to N seconds.</p>

<p>-o kernel_cache Allow the kernel to cache files (reduces
the number of reads that have to go through the guestfs(3)
API). This is generally a good idea if you can afford the
extra memory usage.</p>

<p>-o uid=N -o gid=N Use these options to map all UIDs and
GIDs inside the guest filesystem to the chosen values.</p>

<p>--pid-file filename Write the PID of the guestmount
worker process to &quot;filename&quot;.</p>

<p>-r --ro Add devices and mount everything read-only. Also
disallow writes and make the disk appear read-only to
FUSE.</p>

<p>This is highly recommended if you are not going to edit
the guest disk. If the guest is running and this option is
not supplied, then there is a strong risk of disk corruption
in the guest. We try to prevent this from happening, but it
is not always possible.</p>

<p>See also &quot;OPENING DISKS FOR READ AND WRITE&quot; in
guestfish(1).</p>

<p>--selinux Enable SELinux support for the guest.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Enable verbose messages from underlying
libguestfs.</p>

<p>-V --version Display the program version and exit.</p>

<p>-w --rw This changes the -a, -d and -m options so that
disks are added and mounts are done read-write.</p>

<p>See &quot;OPENING DISKS FOR READ AND WRITE&quot; in
guestfish(1).</p>

<p>-x --trace Trace libguestfs calls and entry into each
FUSE function.</p>

<p>This also stops the daemon from forking into the
background.</p>

<p>FILES $HOME/.libguestfs-tools.rc
/etc/libguestfs-tools.conf This configuration file controls
the default read-only or read- write mode (--ro or
--rw).</p>

<p>See &quot;OPENING DISKS FOR READ AND WRITE&quot; in
guestfish(1).</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS This program returns 0 if successful, or
non-zero if there was an error.</p>
