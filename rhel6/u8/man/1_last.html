<p>LAST,LASTB(1) Linux System Administrator s Manual
LAST,LASTB(1)</p>

<p>NAME last, lastb - show listing of last logged in
users</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS last [-R] [-num] [ -n num ] [-adFiowx] [ -f
file ] [ -t YYYYMMDDHHMMSS ] [name...] [tty...] lastb [-R]
[-num] [ -n num ] [ -f file ] [-adFiowx] [name...]
[tty...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Last searches back through the file
/var/log/wtmp (or the file desig- nated by the -f flag) and
displays a list of all users logged in (and out) since that
file was created. Names of users and ttys can be given, in
which case last will show only those entries matching the
arguments. Names of ttys can be abbreviated, thus last 0 is
the same as last tty0.</p>

<p>When last catches a SIGINT signal (generated by the
interrupt key, usu- ally control-C) or a SIGQUIT signal
(generated by the quit key, usually control-, last will show
how far it has searched through the file; in the case of the
SIGINT signal last will then terminate.</p>

<p>The pseudo user reboot logs in each time the system is
rebooted. Thus last reboot will show a log of all reboots
since the log file was cre- ated.</p>

<p>Lastb is the same as last, except that by default it
shows a log of the file /var/log/btmp, which contains all
the bad login attempts.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f file Tells last to use a specific file
instead of /var/log/wtmp.</p>

<p>-num This is a count telling last how many lines to
show.</p>

<p>-n num The same.</p>

<p>-t YYYYMMDDHHMMSS Display the state of logins as of the
specified time. This is useful, e.g., to determine easily
who was logged in at a partic- ular time -- specify that
time with -t and look for &quot;still logged in&quot;.</p>

<p>-f file Specifies a file to search other than
/var/log/wtmp.</p>

<p>-R Suppresses the display of the hostname field.</p>

<p>-a Display the hostname in the last column. Useful in
combination with the next flag.</p>

<p>-d For non-local logins, Linux stores not only the host
name of the remote host but its IP number as well. This
option translates the IP number back into a hostname.</p>

<p>-F Print full login and logout times and dates.</p>

<p>-i This option is like -d in that it displays the IP
number of the remote host, but it displays the IP number in
numbers-and-dots notation.</p>

<p>-o Read an old-type wtmp file (written by linux-libc5
applica- tions).</p>

<p>-w Display full user and domain names in the output.</p>

<p>-x Display the system shutdown entries and run level
changes.</p>

<p>NOTES The files wtmp and btmp might not be found. The
system only logs infor- mation in these files if they are
present. This is a local configura- tion issue. If you want
the files to be used, they can be created with a simple
touch(1) command (for example, touch /var/log/wtmp).</p>

<p>FILES /var/log/wtmp /var/log/btmp</p>
