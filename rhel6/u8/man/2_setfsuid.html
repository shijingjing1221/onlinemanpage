<p>SETFSUID(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SETFSUID(2)</p>

<p>NAME setfsuid - set user identity used for file system
checks</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt; /* glibc uses
&lt;sys/fsuid.h&gt; */</p>

<p>int setfsuid(uid_t fsuid);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The system call setfsuid() sets the user ID
that the Linux kernel uses to check for all accesses to the
file system. Normally, the value of fsuid will shadow the
value of the effective user ID. In fact, when- ever the
effective user ID is changed, fsuid will also be changed to
the new value of the effective user ID.</p>

<p>Explicit calls to setfsuid() and setfsgid(2) are usually
only used by programs such as the Linux NFS server that need
to change what user and group ID is used for file access
without a corresponding change in the real and effective
user and group IDs. A change in the normal user IDs for a
program such as the NFS server is a security hole that can
expose it to unwanted signals. (But see below.)</p>

<p>setfsuid() will only succeed if the caller is the
superuser or if fsuid matches either the real user ID,
effective user ID, saved set-user-ID, or the current value
of fsuid.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, the previous value of fsuid is
returned. On error, the current value of fsuid is
returned.</p>

<p>VERSIONS This system call is present in Linux since
version 1.2.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO setfsuid() is Linux-specific and should
not be used in programs intended to be portable.</p>

<p>NOTES When glibc determines that the argument is not a
valid user ID, it will return -1 and set errno to EINVAL
without attempting the system call.</p>

<p>Note that at the time this system call was introduced, a
process could send a signal to a process with the same
effective user ID. Today sig- nal permission handling is
slightly different.</p>

<p>BUGS No error messages of any kind are returned to the
caller. At the very least, EPERM should be returned when the
call fails (because the caller lacks the CAP_SETUID
capability).</p>
