<p>SHM_OPEN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SHM_OPEN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME shm_open - open a shared memory object
(REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</p>

<p>int shm_open(const char *name, int oflag, mode_t
mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The shm_open() function shall establish a
connection between a shared memory object and a file
descriptor. It shall create an open file description that
refers to the shared memory object and a file descrip- tor
that refers to that open file description. The file
descriptor is used by other functions to refer to that
shared memory object. The name argument points to a string
naming a shared memory object. It is unspecified whether the
name appears in the file system and is visible to other
functions that take pathnames as arguments. The name
argument conforms to the construction rules for a pathname.
If name begins with the slash character, then processes
calling shm_open() with the same value of name refer to the
same shared memory object, as long as that name has not been
removed. If name does not begin with the slash char- acter,
the effect is implementation-defined. The interpretation of
slash characters other than the leading slash character in
name is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>If successful, shm_open() shall return a file descriptor
for the shared memory object that is the lowest numbered
file descriptor not currently open for that process. The
open file description is new, and therefore the file
descriptor does not share it with any other processes. It is
unspecified whether the file offset is set. The FD_CLOEXEC
file descriptor flag associated with the new file descriptor
is set.</p>

<p>The file status flags and file access modes of the open
file descrip- tion are according to the value of oflag. The
oflag argument is the bitwise-inclusive OR of the following
flags defined in the &lt;fcntl.h&gt; header. Applications
specify exactly one of the first two values (access modes)
below in the value of oflag:</p>

<p>O_RDONLY Open for read access only.</p>

<p>O_RDWR Open for read or write access.</p>

<p>Any combination of the remaining flags may be specified
in the value of oflag:</p>

<p>O_CREAT If the shared memory object exists, this flag
has no effect, except as noted under O_EXCL below.
Otherwise, the shared memory object is created; the user ID
of the shared memory object shall be set to the effective
user ID of the process; the group ID of the shared memory
object is set to a system default group ID or to the
effective group ID of the process. The permission bits of
the shared memory object shall be set to the value of the
mode argument except those set in the file mode creation
mask of the process. When bits in mode other than the file
permission bits are set, the effect is unspecified. The mode
argument does not affect whether the shared memory object is
opened for reading, for writing, or for both. The shared
memory object has a size of zero.</p>

<p>O_EXCL If O_EXCL and O_CREAT are set, shm_open() fails
if the shared memory object exists. The check for the
existence of the shared memory object and the creation of
the object if it does not exist is atomic with respect to
other processes executing shm_open() naming the same shared
memory object with O_EXCL and O_CREAT set. If O_EXCL is set
and O_CREAT is not set, the result is undefined.</p>

<p>O_TRUNC If the shared memory object exists, and it is
successfully opened O_RDWR, the object shall be truncated to
zero length and the mode and owner shall be unchanged by
this function call. The result of using O_TRUNC with
O_RDONLY is undefined.</p>

<p>When a shared memory object is created, the state of the
shared memory object, including all data associated with the
shared memory object, persists until the shared memory
object is unlinked and all other ref- erences are gone. It
is unspecified whether the name and shared memory object
state remain valid after a system reboot.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the shm_open()
function shall return a non- negative integer representing
the lowest numbered unused file descrip- tor. Otherwise, it
shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The shm_open() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES The shared memory object exists and the
permissions specified by oflag are denied, or the shared
memory object does not exist and permission to create the
shared memory object is denied, or O_TRUNC is specified and
write permission is denied.</p>

<p>EEXIST O_CREAT and O_EXCL are set and the named shared
memory object already exists.</p>

<p>EINTR The shm_open() operation was interrupted by a
signal.</p>

<p>EINVAL The shm_open() operation is not supported for the
given name.</p>

<p>EMFILE Too many file descriptors are currently in use by
this process.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the name argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENFILE Too many shared memory objects are currently open
in the system.</p>

<p>ENOENT O_CREAT is not set and the named shared memory
object does not exist.</p>

<p>ENOSPC There is insufficient space for the creation of
the new shared memory object.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE When the Memory Mapped Files option is
supported, the normal open() call is used to obtain a
descriptor to a file to be mapped according to existing
practice with mmap(). When the Shared Memory Objects option
is supported, the shm_open() function shall obtain a
descriptor to the shared memory object to be mapped.</p>

<p>There is ample precedent for having a file descriptor
represent several types of objects. In the POSIX.1-1990
standard, a file descriptor can represent a file, a pipe, a
FIFO, a tty, or a directory. Many imple- mentations simply
have an operations vector, which is indexed by the file
descriptor type and does very different operations. Note
that in some cases the file descriptor passed to generic
operations on file descriptors is returned by open() or
creat() and in some cases returned by alternate functions,
such as pipe(). The latter technique is used by
shm_open().</p>

<p>Note that such shared memory objects can actually be
implemented as mapped files. In both cases, the size can be
set after the open using ftruncate(). The shm_open()
function itself does not create a shared object of a
specified size because this would duplicate an extant func-
tion that set the size of an object referenced by a file
descriptor.</p>

<p>On implementations where memory objects are implemented
using the existing file system, the shm_open() function may
be implemented using a macro that invokes open(), and the
shm_unlink() function may be implemented using a macro that
invokes unlink().</p>

<p>For implementations without a permanent file system, the
definition of the name of the memory objects is allowed not
to survive a system reboot. Note that this allows systems
with a permanent file system to implement memory objects as
data structures internal to the implementa- tion as
well.</p>

<p>On implementations that choose to implement memory
objects using memory directly, a shm_open() followed by an
ftruncate() and close() can be used to preallocate a shared
memory area and to set the size of that preallocation. This
may be necessary for systems without virtual mem- ory
hardware support in order to ensure that the memory is
contiguous.</p>

<p>The set of valid open flags to shm_open() was restricted
to O_RDONLY, O_RDWR, O_CREAT, and O_TRUNC because these
could be easily implemented on most memory mapping systems.
This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 is silent on the results
if the implementation cannot supply the requested file
access because of implementation-defined reasons, including
hard- ware ones.</p>

<p>The error conditions [EACCES] and [ENOTSUP] are provided
to inform the application that the implementation cannot
complete a request.</p>

<p>[EACCES] indicates for implementation-defined reasons,
probably hard- ware-related, that the implementation cannot
comply with a requested mode because it conflicts with
another requested mode. An example might be that an
application desires to open a memory object two times, map-
ping different areas with different access modes. If the
implementa- tion cannot map a single area into a process
space in two places, which would be required if different
access modes were required for the two areas, then the
implementation may inform the application at the time of the
second open.</p>

<p>[ENOTSUP] indicates for implementation-defined reasons,
probably hard- ware-related, that the implementation cannot
comply with a requested mode at all. An example would be
that the hardware of the implementa- tion cannot support
write-only shared memory areas.</p>

<p>On all implementations, it may be desirable to restrict
the location of the memory objects to specific file systems
for performance (such as a RAM disk) or
implementation-defined reasons (shared memory supported
directly only on certain file systems). The shm_open()
function may be used to enforce these restrictions. There
are a number of methods available to the application to
determine an appropriate name of the file or the location of
an appropriate directory. One way is from the environment
via getenv(). Another would be from a configuration
file.</p>

<p>This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 specifies that
memory objects have initial contents of zero when created.
This is consistent with current behavior for both files and
newly allocated memory. For those implemen- tations that use
physical memory, it would be possible that such imple-
mentations could simply use available memory and give it to
the process uninitialized. This, however, is not consistent
with standard behavior for the uninitialized data area, the
stack, and of course, files. Finally, it is highly desirable
to set the allocated memory to zero for security reasons.
Thus, initializing memory objects to zero is required.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
