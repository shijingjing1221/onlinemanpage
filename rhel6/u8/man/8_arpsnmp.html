<p>NAME arpsnmp - keep track of ethernet/ip address
pairings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS arpsnmp [ -d ] [ -f datafile ] [ -e username ]
[ -s username ] file [ ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Arpsnmp keeps track for ethernet/ip address
pairings. It syslogs activ- ity and reports certain changes
via email. Arpsnmp reads information from a file (usually
generated by snmpwalk(1)).</p>

<p>The -d flag is used enable debugging. This also inhibits
mailing the reports. Instead, they are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>The -f flag is used to set the ethernet/ip address
database filename. The default is arp.dat.</p>

<p>Note that an empty arp.dat file must be created before
the first time you run arpsnmp.</p>

<p>If the -e flag is used, arpsnmp sends e-mail messages to
username rather than the default (root). If a single -
character is given for the username, sending of e-mail is
suppressed, but logging via syslog is still done as usual.
(This can be useful during initial runs, to collect data
without being flooded with messages about new stations.)</p>

<p>If the -s flag is used, arpsnmp sends e-mail messages
with username as the return address, rather than the default
(root).</p>

<p>REPORT MESSAGES (See the arpwatch(8) man page for
details on the report messages gener- ated by
arpsnmp(8).)</p>

<p>FILES /var/lib/arpwatch - default directory arp.dat -
ethernet/ip address database ethercodes.dat - vendor
ethernet block list</p>

arent always successful.</p>
