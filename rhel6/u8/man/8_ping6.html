<p>PING(8) System Manager s Manual: iputils PING(8)</p>

<p>NAME ping, ping6 - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network
hosts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ping [ -LRUbdfnqrvVaAB] [ -c count] [ -i
interval] [ -l preload] [ -p pattern] [ -s packetsize] [ -t
ttl] [ -w deadline] [ -F flowla- bel] [ -I interface] [ -M
hint] [ -Q tos] [ -S sndbuf] [ -T times- tamp option] [ -W
timeout] [ hop ...] destination</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ping uses the ICMP protocol s mandatory
ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a
host or gateway. ECHO_REQUEST datagrams (pings) have an IP
and ICMP header, followed by a struct timeval and then an
arbitrary number of pad bytes used to fill out the
packet.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Audible ping.</p>

<p>-A Adaptive ping. Interpacket interval adapts to
round-trip time, so that effectively not more than one (or
more, if preload is set) unanswered probes present in the
network. Minimal interval is 200msec for not super-user. On
networks with low rtt this mode is essentially equivalent to
flood mode.</p>

<p>-b Allow pinging a broadcast address.</p>

<p>-B Do not allow ping to change source address of probes.
The address is bound to one selected when ping starts.</p>

<p>-c count Stop after sending count ECHO_REQUEST packets.
With deadline option, ping waits for count ECHO_REPLY
packets, until the time- out expires.</p>

<p>-d Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used.
Essentially, this socket option is not used by Linux
kernel.</p>

<p>-F flow label Allocate and set 20 bit flow label on echo
request packets. (Only ping6). If value is zero, kernel
allocates random flow label.</p>

<p>-f Flood ping. For every ECHO_REQUEST sent a period . is
printed, while for ever ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is
printed. This provides a rapid display of how many packets
are being dropped. If interval is not given, it sets
interval to zero and outputs packets as fast as they come
back or one hun- dred times per second, whichever is more.
Only the super-user may use this option with zero
interval.</p>

<p>-i interval Wait interval seconds between sending each
packet. The default is to wait for one second between each
packet normally, or not to wait in flood mode. Only
super-user may set interval to val- ues less 0.2
seconds.</p>

<p>-I interface address Set source address to specified
interface address. Argument may be numeric IP address or
name of device. When pinging IPv6 link- local address this
option is required.</p>

<p>-l preload If preload is specified, ping sends that many
packets not wait- ing for reply. Only the super-user may
select preload more than 3.</p>

<p>-L Suppress loopback of multicast packets. This flag
only applies if the ping destination is a multicast
address.</p>

<p>-n Numeric output only. No attempt will be made to
lookup symbolic names for host addresses.</p>

<p>-p pattern You may specify up to 16 pad bytes to fill
out the packet you send. This is useful for diagnosing
data-dependent problems in a network. For example, -p ff
will cause the sent packet to be filled with all ones.</p>

<p>-Q tos Set Quality of Service -related bits in ICMP
datagrams. tos can be either decimal or hex number.
Traditionally (RFC1349), these have been interpreted as: 0
for reserved (currently being rede- fined as congestion
control), 1-4 for Type of Service and 5-7 for Precedence.
Possible settings for Type of Service are: min- imal cost:
0x02, reliability: 0x04, throughput: 0x08, low delay: 0x10.
Multiple TOS bits should not be set simultaneously. Pos-
sible settings for special Precedence range from priority
(0x20) to net control (0xe0). You must be root
(CAP_NET_ADMIN capabil- ity) to use Critical or higher
precedence value. You cannot set bit 0x01 (reserved) unless
ECN has been enabled in the kernel. In RFC2474, these fields
has been redefined as 8-bit Differenti- ated Services (DS),
consisting of: bits 0-1 of separate data (ECN will be used,
here), and bits 2-7 of Differentiated Ser- vices Codepoint
(DSCP).</p>

<p>-q Quiet output. Nothing is displayed except the summary
lines at startup time and when finished.</p>

<p>-R Record route. Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the
ECHO_REQUEST packet and displays the route buffer on
returned packets. Note that the IP header is only large
enough for nine such routes. Many hosts ignore or discard
this option.</p>

<p>-r Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to
a host on an attached interface. If the host is not on a
directly- attached network, an error is returned. This
option can be used to ping a local host through an interface
that has no route through it provided the option -I is also
used.</p>

<p>-s packetsize Specifies the number of data bytes to be
sent. The default is 56, which translates into 64 ICMP data
bytes when combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header
data.</p>

<p>-S sndbuf Set socket sndbuf. If not specified, it is
selected to buffer not more than one packet.</p>

<p>-t ttl Set the IP Time to Live.</p>

<p>-T timestamp option Set special IP timestamp options.
timestamp option may be either tsonly (only timestamps),
tsandaddr (timestamps and addresses) or tsprespec host1
[host2 [host3 [host4]]] (timestamp prespecified hops).</p>

<p>-M hint Select Path MTU Discovery strategy. hint may be
either do (pro- hibit fragmentation, even local one), want
(do PMTU discovery, fragment locally when packet size is
large), or dont (do not set DF flag).</p>

<p>-U Print full user-to-user latency (the old behaviour).
Normally ping prints network round trip time, which can be
different f.e. due to DNS failures.</p>

<p>-v Verbose output.</p>

<p>-V Show version and exit.</p>

<p>-w deadline Specify a timeout, in seconds, before ping
exits regardless of how many packets have been sent or
received. In this case ping does not stop after count packet
are sent, it waits either for deadline expire or until count
probes are answered or for some error notification from
network.</p>

<p>-W timeout Time to wait for a response, in seconds. The
option affects only timeout in absense of any responses,
otherwise ping waits for two RTTs.</p>

<p>When using ping for fault isolation, it should first be
run on the local host, to verify that the local network
interface is up and run- ning. Then, hosts and gateways
further and further away should be pinged . Round-trip times
and packet loss statistics are computed. If duplicate
packets are received, they are not included in the packet
loss calculation, although the round trip time of these
packets is used in calculating the minimum/average/maximum
round-trip time numbers. When the specified number of
packets have been sent (and received) or if the program is
terminated with a SIGINT, a brief summary is dis- played.
Shorter current statistics can be obtained without
termination of process with signal SIGQUIT.</p>

<p>If ping does not receive any reply packets at all it
will exit with code 1. If a packet count and deadline are
both specified, and fewer than count packets are received by
the time the deadline has arrived, it will also exit with
code 1. On other error it exits with code 2. Otherwise it
exits with code 0. This makes it possible to use the exit
code to see if a host is alive or not.</p>

<p>This program is intended for use in network testing,
measurement and management. Because of the load it can
impose on the network, it is unwise to use ping during
normal operations or from automated scripts.</p>

<p>ICMP PACKET DETAILS An IP header without options is 20
bytes. An ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet contains an additional 8
bytes worth of ICMP header followed by an arbitrary amount
of data. When a packetsize is given, this indicated the size
of this extra piece of data (the default is 56). Thus the
amount of data received inside of an IP packet of type ICMP
ECHO_REPLY will always be 8 bytes more than the requested
data space (the ICMP header).</p>

<p>If the data space is at least of size of struct timeval
ping uses the beginning bytes of this space to include a
timestamp which it uses in the computation of round trip
times. If the data space is shorter, no round trip times are
given.</p>

<p>DUPLICATE AND DAMAGED PACKETS ping will report duplicate
and damaged packets. Duplicate packets should never occur,
and seem to be caused by inappropriate link-level
retransmissions. Duplicates may occur in many situations and
are rarely (if ever) a good sign, although the presence of
low levels of duplicates may not always be cause for
alarm.</p>

<p>Damaged packets are obviously serious cause for alarm
and often indicate broken hardware somewhere in the ping
packet s path (in the network or in the hosts).</p>

<p>TRYING DIFFERENT DATA PATTERNS The (inter)network layer
should never treat packets differently depend- ing on the
data contained in the data portion. Unfortunately, data-
dependent problems have been known to sneak into networks
and remain undetected for long periods of time. In many
cases the particular pat- tern that will have problems is
something that doesnt have sufficient transitions, such as
all ones or all zeros, or a pattern right at the edge, such
as almost all zeros. It isnt necessarily enough to specify a
data pattern of all zeros (for example) on the command line
because the pattern that is of interest is at the data link
level, and the relationship between what you type and what
the controllers trans- mit can be complicated.</p>

<p>This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you
will probably have to do a lot of testing to find it. If you
are lucky, you may man- age to find a file that either cant
be sent across your network or that takes much longer to
transfer than other similar length files. You can then
examine this file for repeated patterns that you can test
using the -p option of ping.</p>

<p>TTL DETAILS The TTL value of an IP packet represents the
maximum number of IP routers that the packet can go through
before being thrown away. In current practice you can expect
each router in the Internet to decre- ment the TTL field by
exactly one.</p>

<p>The TCP/IP specification states that the TTL field for
TCP packets should be set to 60, but many systems use
smaller values (4.3 BSD uses 30, 4.2 used 15).</p>

<p>The maximum possible value of this field is 255, and
most Unix systems set the TTL field of ICMP ECHO_REQUEST
packets to 255. This is why you will find you can ping some
hosts, but not reach them with tel- net(1) or ftp(1).</p>

<p>In normal operation ping prints the ttl value from the
packet it receives. When a remote system receives a ping
packet, it can do one of three things with the TTL field in
its response:</p>

<p>&middot; Not change it; this is what Berkeley Unix
systems did before the 4.3BSD Tahoe release. In this case
the TTL value in the received packet will be 255 minus the
number of routers in the round-trip path.</p>

<p>&middot; Set it to 255; this is what current Berkeley
Unix systems do. In this case the TTL value in the received
packet will be 255 minus the number of routers in the path
from the remote system to the pinging host.</p>

<p>&middot; Set it to some other value. Some machines use
the same value for ICMP packets that they use for TCP
packets, for example either 30 or 60. Others may use
completely wild values.</p>

<p>BUGS &middot; Many Hosts and Gateways ignore the
RECORD_ROUTE option.</p>

<p>&middot; The maximum IP header length is too small for
options like RECORD_ROUTE to be completely useful. Theres
not much that that can be done about this, however.</p>

<p>&middot; Flood pinging is not recommended in general,
and flood pinging the broadcast address should only be done
under very controlled condi- tions.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO netstat(1), ifconfig(8).</p>

<p>HISTORY The ping command appeared in 4.3BSD.</p>

<p>The version described here is its descendant specific to
Linux.</p>

<p>SECURITY ping requires CAP_NET_RAWIO capability to be
executed. It may be used as set-uid root.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY ping is part of iputils package and the
latest versions are available in source form at
