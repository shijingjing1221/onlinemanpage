<p>PTHREAD_GETSPECIFIC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_GETSPECIFIC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_getspecific, pthread_setspecific -
thread-specific data manage- ment</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *pthread_getspecific(pthread_key_t key); int
pthread_setspecific(pthread_key_t key, const void
*value);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_getspecific() function shall
return the value currently bound to the specified key on
behalf of the calling thread.</p>

<p>The pthread_setspecific() function shall associate a
thread-specific value with a key obtained via a previous
call to pthread_key_create(). Different threads may bind
different values to the same key. These val- ues are
typically pointers to blocks of dynamically allocated memory
that have been reserved for use by the calling thread.</p>

<p>The effect of calling pthread_getspecific() or
pthread_setspecific() with a key value not obtained from
pthread_key_create() or after key has been deleted with
pthread_key_delete() is undefined.</p>

<p>Both pthread_getspecific() and pthread_setspecific() may
be called from a thread-specific data destructor function. A
call to pthread_getspe- cific() for the thread-specific data
key being destroyed shall return the value NULL, unless the
value is changed (after the destructor starts) by a call to
pthread_setspecific(). Calling pthread_setspe- cific() from
a thread-specific data destructor routine may result either
in lost storage (after at least
PTHREAD_DESTRUCTOR_ITERATIONS attempts at destruction) or in
an infinite loop.</p>

<p>Both functions may be implemented as macros.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The pthread_getspecific() function shall
return the thread-specific data value associated with the
given key. If no thread-specific data value is associated
with key, then the value NULL shall be returned.</p>

<p>If successful, the pthread_setspecific() function shall
return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are returned from
pthread_getspecific().</p>

<p>The pthread_setspecific() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to associate the value
with the key.</p>

<p>The pthread_setspecific() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The key value is invalid.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Performance and ease-of-use of
pthread_getspecific() are critical for functions that rely
on maintaining state in thread-specific data. Since no
errors are required to be detected by it, and since the only
error that could be detected is the use of an invalid key,
the function to pthread_getspecific() has been designed to
favor speed and simplicity over error reporting.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
