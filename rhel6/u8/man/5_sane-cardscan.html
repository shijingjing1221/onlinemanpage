<p>sane-cardscan(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-cardscan(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-cardscan - SANE backend for Corex CardScan usb
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-cardscan library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend which provides access to
the Corex CardScan 800c &amp; 600c small- format
scanners.</p>

<p>The backend supports only grayscale and color modes and
media of (theo- retically) infinite length.</p>

<p>This backend may support other scanners. The best way to
determine level of support is to get a trace of the windows
driver in action, and send it to the author.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The cardscan backend supports the following
options:</p>

<p>mode m Selects the mode for the scan. Options are
&quot;Gray&quot; and &quot;Color&quot;.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
&quot;cardscan.conf&quot; is used to tell the backend how to
look for scanners, and provide options controlling the
operation of the backend. This file is read each time the
frontend asks the backend for a list of scanners, generally
only when the frontend starts. If the configuration file is
missing, the backend will use a set of compiled defaults,
which are identical to the default configuration file
shipped with SANE.</p>

<p>Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in 2
ways:</p>

<p>&quot;usb 0x04c5 0x1042&quot; (or other vendor/product
ids) Requests backend to search all usb busses in the system
for a device which uses that vendor and product id. The
device will then be queried to determine if it is a cardscan
scanner.</p>

<p>&quot;usb /dev/usb/scanner0&quot; (or other device file)
Some systems use a kernel driver to access usb scanners.
This method is untested.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are two configuration options that
control the pro- tocol used by the backend:</p>

<p>&quot;lines_per_block 16&quot; (or other number from 1
to 32) Controls the number of lines of image data which will
be aquired in each pass. Older scanners will require this
number set lower, often 1.</p>

<p>&quot;has_cal_buffer 1&quot; (1 or 0) Causes the backend
to get calibration data from scanner during initialization.
Older scanners do not support this request, and must be set
to 0.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The backend uses a single environment
variable, SANE_DEBUG_CARDSCAN, which enables debugging
output to stderr. Valid values are:</p>

<p>5 Errors 10 Function trace 15 Function detail 20 Option
commands 25 SCSI/USB trace 30 SCSI/USB detail 35 Useless
noise</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES The scanner does not seem to have much
control possible, so the backend cannot set x/y coordinate
values, resolutions, etc. These things could be simulated in
the backend, but there are plenty of command line tools. The
backend also does not send all the commands that the windows
driver does, so it may not function the same. The backend
does not have the calibration or ejection options of the
windows driver.</p>
