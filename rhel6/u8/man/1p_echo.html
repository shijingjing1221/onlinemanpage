<p>ECHO(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ECHO(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME echo - write arguments to standard output</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS echo [string ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The echo utility writes its arguments to
standard output, followed by a &lt;newline&gt;. If there are
no arguments, only the &lt;newline&gt; is written.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The echo utility shall not recognize the
&quot;--&quot; argument in the manner specified by Guideline
10 of the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines; &quot;--&quot;
shall be recognized as a string operand.</p>

<p>Implementations shall not support any options.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>string A string to be written to standard output. If the
first operand is -n, or if any of the operands contain a
backslash ) character, the results are
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>On XSI-conformant systems, if the first operand is -n,
it shall be treated as a string, not an option. The
following character sequences shall be recognized on
XSI-conformant systems within any of the argu- ments:</p>

<p>a Write an &lt;alert&gt;.</p>

<p>b Write a &lt;backspace&gt;.</p>

<p>Suppress the &lt;newline&gt; that otherwise follows the
final argument in the output. All characters following the
ments shall be ignored.</p>

<p>f Write a &lt;form-feed&gt;.</p>

<p>n Write a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>r Write a &lt;carriage-return&gt;.</p>

<p>t Write a &lt;tab&gt;.</p>

<p>Write a &lt;vertical-tab&gt;.</p>

<p>\ Write a backslash character.</p>

<p>0num Write an 8-bit value that is the zero, one, two, or
three-digit octal number num.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of echo:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The echo utility arguments shall be separated by
single &lt;space&gt;s and a &lt;newline&gt; shall follow the
last argument. Output transformations shall occur based on
the escape sequences in the input. See the OPERANDS sec-
tion.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE It is not possible to use echo
portably across all POSIX systems unless both -n (as the
first argument) and escape sequences are omitted.</p>

<p>The printf utility can be used portably to emulate any
of the tradi- tional behaviors of the echo utility as
follows (assuming that IFS has its standard value or is
unset):</p>

<p>* The historic System V echo and the requirements on XSI
implementa- tions in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 are
equivalent to:</p>

<p>printf &quot;%n&quot; &quot;$*&quot;</p>

<p>* The BSD echo is equivalent to:</p>

<p>if [ &quot;X$1&quot; = &quot;X-n&quot; ] then shift
printf &quot;%s&quot; &quot;$*&quot; else printf
&quot;%n&quot; &quot;$*&quot; fi</p>

<p>New applications are encouraged to use printf instead of
echo.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The echo utility has not been made obsolescent
because of its extremely widespread use in historical
applications. Conforming applications that wish to do
prompting without &lt;newline&gt;s or that could possibly be
expecting to echo a -n, should use the printf utility
derived from the Ninth Edition system.</p>

<p>As specified, echo writes its arguments in the simplest
of ways. The two different historical versions of echo vary
in fatally incompatible ways.</p>

<p>The BSD echo checks the first argument for the string -n
which causes it to suppress the &lt;newline&gt; that would
otherwise follow the final argument in the output.</p>

<p>The System V echo does not support any options, but
allows escape sequences within its operands, as described
for XSI implementations in the OPERANDS section.</p>

<p>The echo utility does not support Utility Syntax
Guideline 10 because historical applications depend on echo
to echo all of its arguments, except for the -n option in
the BSD version.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
