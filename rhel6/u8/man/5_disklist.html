<p>NAME disklist - List of partitions to back up for
Amanda</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The disklist file determines which disks
will be backed up by Amanda. The file usually contains one
line per disk: hostname diskname [diskdevice] dumptype
[spindle [interface] ]</p>

<p>All pairs [ hostname diskname ] must be unique.</p>

<p>Lines starting with # are ignored, as are blank lines.
The fields have the following meanings:</p>

<p>hostname The name of the host to be backed up. If
diskdevice refers to a PC share, this is the host Amanda
will run the Samba smbclient program on to back up the
share.</p>

<p>diskname The name of the disk (a label). In most case,
you set your diskname to the diskdevice and you don&acute;t
set the diskdevice. If you want multiple entries with the
same diskdevice, you must set a different diskname for each
entry. It&acute;s the diskname that you use on the
commandline for any Amanda command. Look at the
example/disklist file for example.</p>

<p>diskdevice Default: same as diskname. The name of the
disk device to be backed up. It may be a full device name, a
device name without the /dev/ prefix, e.g. sd0a, or a mount
point such as /usr.</p>

<p>It may also refer to a PC share by starting the name
with two (forward) slashes, e.g. //some-pc/home. In this
case, the program option in the associated dumptype must be
entered as GNUTAR. It is the combination of the double slash
disk name and program GNUTAR in the dumptype that triggers
the use of Samba.</p>

<p>dumptype Refers to a dumptype defined in the amanda.conf
file. Dumptypes specify backup related parameters, such as
whether to compress the backups, whether to record backup
results in /etc/dumpdates, the disk&acute;s relative
priority, etc.</p>

<p>spindle Default: -1. A number used to balance backup
load on a host. Amanda will not run multiple backups at the
same time on the same spindle, unless the spindle number is
-1, which means there is no spindle restriction.</p>

<p>interface Default: local. The name of a network
interface definition in the amanda.conf file, used to
balance network load.</p>

<p>Instead of naming a dumptype, it is possible to define
one in-line, enclosing dumptype options within curly braces,
one per line, just like a dumptype definition in
amanda.conf. Since pre-existing dumptypes are valid option
names, this syntax may be used to customize dumptypes for
particular disks.</p>

<p>A line break must follow the left curly bracket.</p>

<p>For instance, if a dumptype named normal is used for
most disks, but use of the holding disk needs to be disabled
for the file system that holds it, this would work instead
of defining a new dumptype: hostname diskname [ diskdevice ]
{ normal holdingdisk never } [ spindle [ interface ] ]</p>
