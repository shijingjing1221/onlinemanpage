<p>NAME git-http-push - Push objects over HTTP/DAV to
another repository</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git http-push [--all] [--dry-run] [--force]
[--verbose] &lt;url&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [&lt;ref&gt;...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends missing objects to remote repository,
and updates the remote branch.</p>

<p>NOTE: This command is temporarily disabled if your
libcurl is older than 7.16, as the combination has been
reported not to work and sometimes corrupts repository.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --all Do not assume that the remote repository
is complete in its current state, and verify all objects in
the entire local refs history exist in the remote
repository.</p>

<p>--force Usually, the command refuses to update a remote
ref that is not an ancestor of the local ref used to
overwrite it. This flag disables the check. What this means
is that the remote repository can lose commits; use it with
care.</p>

<p>--dry-run Do everything except actually send the
updates.</p>

<p>--verbose Report the list of objects being walked
locally and the list of objects successfully sent to the
remote repository.</p>

<p>-d, -D Remove &lt;ref&gt; from remote repository. The
specified branch cannot be the remote HEAD. If -d is
specified the following other conditions must also be
met:</p>

<p>&middot; Remote HEAD must resolve to an object that
exists locally</p>

<p>&middot; Specified branch resolves to an object that
exists locally</p>

<p>&middot; Specified branch is an ancestor of the remote
HEAD</p>

<p>&lt;ref&gt;... The remote refs to update.</p>

<p>SPECIFYING THE REFS A &lt;ref&gt; specification can be
either a single pattern, or a pair of such patterns
separated by a colon &quot;:&quot; (this means that a ref
name cannot have a colon in it). A single pattern
&lt;name&gt; is just a shorthand for
&lt;name&gt;:&lt;name&gt;.</p>

<p>Each pattern pair consists of the source side (before
the colon) and the destination side (after the colon). The
ref to be pushed is determined by finding a match that
matches the source side, and where it is pushed is
determined by using the destination side.</p>

<p>&middot; It is an error if &lt;src&gt; does not match
exactly one of the local refs.</p>

<p>&middot; If &lt;dst&gt; does not match any remote ref,
either</p>

<p>&middot; it has to start with &quot;refs/&quot;;
&lt;dst&gt; is used as the destination literally in this
case.</p>

<p>&middot; &lt;src&gt; == &lt;dst&gt; and the ref that
matched the &lt;src&gt; must not exist in the set of remote
refs; the ref matched &lt;src&gt; locally is used as the
name of the destination.</p>

<p>Without --force, the &lt;src&gt; ref is stored at the
remote only if &lt;dst&gt; does not exist, or &lt;dst&gt; is
a proper subset (i.e. an ancestor) of &lt;src&gt;. This
check, known as &quot;fast-forward check&quot;, is performed
in order to avoid accidentally overwriting the remote ref
and lose other peoples&acute; commits from there.</p>

<p>With --force, the fast-forward check is disabled for all
refs.</p>

<p>Optionally, a &lt;ref&gt; parameter can be prefixed with
a plus + sign to disable the fast-forward check only on that
ref.</p>
