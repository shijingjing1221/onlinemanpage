<p>NAME ftpusers - list of users that may not log in via
the FTP daemon</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The text file ftpusers contains a list of
users that may not log in using the File Transfer Protocol
(FTP) server daemon. This file is used not merely for system
administration purposes but for improving security within a
TCP/IP networked environment. It will typically con- tain a
list of the users that either have no business using ftp or
have too many privileges to be allowed to log in through the
FTP server dae- mon. Such users usually include root,
daemon, bin, uucp, and news. If your FTP server daemon
doesnt use ftpusers then it is suggested that you read its
documentation to find out how to block access for certain
users. Washington University FTP server Daemon (wuftpd) and
Profes- sional FTP Daemon (proftpd) are known to make use of
ftpusers.</p>

<p>Format The format of ftpusers is very simple. There is
one account name (or username) per line. Lines starting with
a # are ignored.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/ftpusers</p>

<p>SEE ALSO passwd(5), proftpd(8), wuftpd(8)</p>
