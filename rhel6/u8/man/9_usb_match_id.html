<p>USB_MATCH_ID(9) USB Core APIs USB_MATCH_ID(9)</p>

<p>NAME usb_match_id - find first usb_device_id matching
device or interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS const struct usb_device_id *
usb_match_id(struct usb_interface * interface, const struct
usb_device_id * id);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS interface the interface of interest</p>

<p>id array of usb_device_id structures, terminated by zero
entry</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION usb_match_id searches an array of
usb_device_id&acute;s and returns the first one matching the
device or interface, or null. This is used when binding (or
rebinding) a driver to an interface. Most USB device drivers
will use this indirectly, through the usb core, but some
layered driver frameworks use it directly. These device
tables are exported with MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE, through
modutils, to support the driver loading functionality of USB
hotplugging.</p>

<p>WHAT MATCHES The match_flags element in a usb_device_id
controls which members are used. If the corresponding bit is
set, the value in the device_id must match its corresponding
member in the device or interface descriptor, or else the
device_id does not match.</p>

<p>driver_info is normally used only by device drivers, but
you can create a wildcard matches anything usb_device_id as
a driver&acute;s modules.usbmap entry if you provide an id
with only a nonzero driver_info field. If you do this, the
USB device driver&acute;s probe routine should use
additional intelligence to decide whether to bind to the
specified interface.</p>

<p>WHAT MAKES GOOD USB_DEVICE_ID TABLES The match algorithm
is very simple, so that intelligence in driver selection
must come from smart driver id records. Unless you have good
reasons to use another selection policy, provide match
elements only in related groups, and order match specifiers
from specific to general. Use the macros provided for that
purpose if you can.</p>

<p>The most specific match specifiers use device descriptor
data. These are commonly used with product-specific matches;
the USB_DEVICE macro lets you provide vendor and product
IDs, and you can also match against ranges of product
revisions. These are widely used for devices with
application or vendor specific bDeviceClass values.</p>

<p>Matches based on device class/subclass/protocol
specifications are slightly more general; use the
USB_DEVICE_INFO macro, or its siblings. These are used with
single-function devices where bDeviceClass doesn&acute;t
specify that each interface has its own class.</p>

<p>Matches based on interface class/subclass/protocol are
the most general; they let drivers bind to any interface on
a multiple-function device. Use the USB_INTERFACE_INFO
macro, or its siblings, to match class-per-interface style
devices (as recorded in bInterfaceClass).</p>

<p>Note that an entry created by USB_INTERFACE_INFO
won&acute;t match any interface if the device class is set
to Vendor-Specific. This is deliberate; according to the USB
spec the meanings of the interface class/subclass/protocol
for these devices are also vendor-specific, and hence
matching against a standard product class wouldn&acute;t
work anyway. If you really want to use an interface-based
match for such a device, create a match record that also
specifies the vendor ID. (Unforunately there isn&acute;t a
standard macro for creating records like this.)</p>

<p>Within those groups, remember that not all combinations
are meaningful. For example, don&acute;t give a product
version range without vendor and product IDs; or specify a
protocol without its associated class and subclass.</p>
