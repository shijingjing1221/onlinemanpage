<p>NAME xlogo - X Window System logo</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xlogo [-toolkitoption ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xlogo program displays the X Window
System logo.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Xlogo accepts all of the standard X Toolkit
command line options, as well as the following:</p>

<p>-render This option indicates that the logo should be
drawn with anti- aliased edges using the RENDER
extension.</p>

<p>-sharp If -render is also specified, this forces the
edges to be ren- dered in sharp mode, (ie. 1-bit alpha
channel).</p>

<p>-shape This option indicates that the logo window should
be shaped rather than rectangular.</p>

<p>RESOURCES The default width and the default height are
each 100 pixels. This program uses the Logo widget in the
Athena widget set. It understands all of the Simple widget
resource names and classes as well as:</p>

<p>foreground (class Foreground) Specifies the color for
the logo. The default is depends on whether reverseVideo is
specified. If reverseVideo is speci- fied the default is
XtDefaultForeground, otherwise the default is
XtDefaultBackground.</p>

<p>shapeWindow (class ShapeWindow) Specifies that the
window is shaped to the X logo. The default is False.</p>

<p>WIDGETS In order to specify resources, it is useful to
know the hierarchy of the widgets which compose xlogo. In
the notation below, indentation indicates hierarchical
structure. The widget class name is given first, followed by
the widget instance name.</p>

<p>XLogo xlogo Logo xlogo</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY to get the default host and display
number.</p>

<p>XENVIRONMENT to get the name of a resource file that
overrides the global resources stored in the
RESOURCE_MANAGER property.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XLogo specifies
required resources</p>

<p>AUTHORS Ollie Jones of Apollo Computer and Jim Fulton of

on a graphic design by Danny Chong and Ross Chapman of
Apollo Computer.</p>
