<p>XkbSetIndicatorMap(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbSetIndicatorMap(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbSetIndicatorMap - Downloads the changes to the
server based on modi- fications to a local copy of the
keyboard description which will update the maps for one or
more indicators</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Bool XkbSetIndicatorMap (Display *dpy, unsigned
int which, XkbDescPtr desc);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - dpy connection to the X server</p>

<p>- which mask of indicators to change</p>

<p>- desc keyboard description from which the maps are
taken</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This section discusses the effects of
explicitly changing indicators depending upon different
settings in the indicator map. See Tables 1 and Table 2 for
information on the effects of the indicator map fields when
explicit changes are made.</p>

<p>Table 1 XkbIndicatorMapRec which_groups and groups,
Indicator Drives Keyboard
----------------------------------------------------------------
which_groups New State Effect on Keyboard Group State
----------------------------------------------------------------
XkbIM_UseNone On or Off No effect XkbIM_UseBase On or Off No
effect XkbIM_UseLatched On The groups field is treated as a
group mask. The keyboard group latch is changed to the
lowest numbered group speci- fied in groups; if groups is
empty, the keyboard group latch is changed to zero.
XkbIM_UseLatched Off The groups field is treated as a group
mask. If the indicator is explicitly extinguished, keyboard
group latch is changed to the lowest numbered group not
specified in groups; if groups is zero, the key- board group
latch is set to the index of the highest legal keyboard
group. XkbIM_UseLocked or XkbIM_UseEffective On If the
groups mask is empty, group is not changed; other- wise, the
locked keyboard group is changed to the lowest numbered
group specified in groups. XkbIM_UseLocked or</p>

<p>XkbIM_UseEffective Off Locked keyboard group is changed
to the lowest numbered group that is not specified in the
groups mask, or to Group1 if the groups mask contains all
keyboard groups.</p>

<p>Table 2 XkbIndicatorMapRec which_mods and mods,
Indicator Drives Keyboard
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
which_mods New State Effect on Keyboard Modifiers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XkbIM_UseNone or XkbIM_UseBase On or Off No Effect
XkbIM_UseLatched On Any modifiers specified in the mask
field of mods are added to the latched modifiers.
XkbIM_UseLatched Off Any modifiers specified in the mask
field of mods are removed from the latched modifiers.
XkbIM_UseLocked, XkbIM_UseCompat, or XkbIM_UseEffective On
Any modifiers specified in the mask field of mods are added
to the locked modifiers. XkbIM_UseLocked Off Any modifiers
specified in the mask field of mods are removed from the
locked modifiers. XkbIM_UseCompat or XkbIM_UseEffective Off
Any modifiers specified in the mask field of mods are
removed from both the locked and latched modifiers.</p>

<p>If XkbIM_LEDDrivesKB is set and XkbIM_NoExplicit is not,
and if you call a function that updates the server s image
of the indicator map (such as XkbSetIndicatorMap or
XkbSetNamedIndicator), Xkb changes the keyboard state and
controls to reflect the other fields of the indicator map.
If you attempt to explicitly change the value of an
indicator for which XkbIM_LEDDrivesKB is absent or for which
XkbIM_NoExplicit is present, keyboard state or controls are
unaf- fected.</p>

<p>If neither XkbIM_NoAutomatic nor XkbIM_NoExplicit is set
in an indica- tor map, Xkb honors any request to change the
state of the indicator, but the new state might be
immediately superseded by automatic changes to the indicator
state if the keyboard state or controls change.</p>

<p>The effects of changing an indicator that drives the
keyboard are cumu- lative; it is possible for a single
change to affect keyboard group, modifiers, and controls
simultaneously.</p>

<p>If you change an indicator for which both the
XkbIM_LEDDrivesKB and XkbIM_NoAutomatic flags are specified,
Xkb applies the keyboard changes specified in the other
indicator map fields and changes the indicator to reflect
the state that was explicitly requested. The indicator
remains in the new state until it is explicitly changed
again.</p>

<p>If the XkbIM_NoAutomatic flag is not set and
XkbIM_LEDDrivesKB is set, Xkb applies the changes specified
in the other indicator map fields and sets the state of the
indicator to the values specified by the indica- tor map.
Note that it is possible in this case for the indicator to
end up in a different state than the one that was explicitly
requested. For example, Xkb does not extinguish an indicator
with which_mods of XkbIM_UseBase and mods of Shift if, at
the time Xkb processes the request to extinguish the
indicator, one of the Shift keys is physi- cally
depressed.</p>

<p>If you explicitly light an indicator for which
XkbIM_LEDDrivesKB is set, Xkb enables all of the boolean
controls specified in the ctrls field of its indicator map.
Explicitly extinguishing such an indicator causes Xkb to
disable all of the boolean controls specified in ctrls.</p>

<p>For each bit set in the which parameter,
XkbSetIndicatorMap sends the corresponding indicator map
from the desc parameter to the server.</p>
