<p>DESCRIPTION This utility sends a MODE SENSE SCSI command
to the DEVICE and outputs the response. There is a 6 byte
and 10 byte (cdb) variant of the MODE SENSE command, this
utility defaults to the 10 byte variant.</p>

<p>This utility decodes mode page headers and block
descriptors but out- puts the contents of each mode page in
hex. It also has no facility to change the mode page
contents or block descriptor data. Mode page con- tents are
decoded and can be changed by the sdparm utility.</p>

<p>This utility supports two command line syntaxes, the
preferred one is shown first in the synopsis and explained
in this section. A later sec- tion on the old command line
syntax outlines the second group of options.</p>

<p>If no page is given (and --list is not selected) then
--all is assumed. The --all option requests all mode pages
(but not subpages) in a single response.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-a, --all output all the mode pages reported by the
DEVICE. This is what the page code 63 (0x3f) is defined to
do. When used once, mode subpages are not fetched. When used
twice (e.g. -aa ), all mode pages and subpages are requested
which is equivalent to --page=63,255.</p>

<p>-c, --control=PC PC is the page control value. Up to
four different versions of each page are held by the device:
0 : current values (i.e. those active at present) 1 :
changeable values 2 : default values (i.e. the manufacturer
s settings) 3 : saved values The changeable values are bit
masks showing which fields could be changed with a MODE
SELECT. The saved values will be re-instated the next time
the device is power cycled or reset. If this option is not
given then current values [0] are assumed.</p>

<p>-d, --dbd disable block descriptors. By default, block
descriptors (usu- ally one (for disks) or none) are returned
in a MODE SENSE response. This option sets the &quot;disable
block descriptors&quot; (DBD) bit in the cdb which instructs
the device not to return any block descriptors in its
response. Older devices may not support this setting and may
return an &quot;illegal request&quot; sense key;
alternatively they may ignore it. Oddly the Reduced Block
Com- mand set (RBC) requires this bit set.</p>

<p>-D, --dbout disable outputting block descriptors.
Irrespective of whether block descriptors are present in the
response or not, they are not output.</p>

<p>-e, --examine examine each mode page in the range 0
through to 62 (inclusive). If some response is given then
print out the mode page name or number (in hex) if the name
is not known.</p>

<p>-f, --flexible Some devices, bridges and/or drivers
attempt crude translations between MODE SENSE 6 and 10 byte
commands without correcting the response. This will cause
the response to be mis-interpreted (usually with an error
saying the response is malformed). With this option, the
length of the response is checked, and if it looks wrong,
the response is then decoded as if the other mode sense (cdb
length) was sent.</p>

<p>-h, --help print out the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex The default action is to decode known mode
page numbers (and subpage numbers) into text. When this
option is used once, the response is output in hexadecimal.
When this option is used twice, mode page numbers and page
control values are output in hex.</p>

<p>-l, --list lists all common page and subpage codes and
their names that are found in the command set that matches
the peripheral type of the given DEVICE. If no DEVICE and no
--page=PG is given then the common page and subpage codes
and their names are listed for SBC (e.g. a disk). If no
DEVICE is given and a --page=PG is given then the common
page and subpage codes and their names are listed for the
command set whose peripheral device type matches the value
given to PG. For example sg_mode --list --page=1 lists the
command mode pages and subpages for tape devices.
Additionally if a sub_page_code is given then it is
interpreted as a transport identifier and command transport
specific mode page codes and their names are listed
following the main mode page list. Other options are
ignored.</p>

<p>-L, --llbaa set the Long LBA Accepted (LLBAA) bit in the
MODE SENSE (10) cdb. This bit is not defined in the MODE
SENSE (6) cdb so set- ting the -L and --six options is
reported as an error. When set the DEVICE may respond with
16 byte block descriptors as indicated by the LongLBA field
in the response. In most cases setting this option is not
needed.</p>

<p>-m, --maxlen=LEN The LEN argument is the maximum
response length in bytes. It is the allocation length field
in the cdb. When not given (or LEN is zero) then the
allocation length field is set to 4096 for MODE SENSE (10)
or 252 for MODE SENSE (6). The LEN argument must be
non-negative and no greater than 65535 for MODE SENSE (10)
and not greater than 255 for MODE SENSE (6).</p>

<p>-O, --old switch to older style options.</p>

<p>-p, --page=PG page code to fetch. The PG is assumed to
be a decimal value unless prefixed by 0x or has a trailing
h. It should be a value between 0 and 63 (inclusive). When
not given and a default is required then a value of 63
(0x3f), which fetches all mode pages, is used.</p>

<p>-p, --page=PG,SPG page code and subpage code values to
fetch. Both arguments are assumed to be decimal unless
flagged as hexadecimal. The page code should be between 0
and 63 inclusive. The subpage code should be between 0 and
255 inclusive. The default value for the subpage code is
0.</p>

<p>-r, --raw output the response in binary to stdout. Error
messages and warnings, if any, are sent to stderr. When this
option is used twice (e.g. -rr) then has the same action as
-R</p>

<p>-R output the selected mode page to stdout a byte per
line. Each line contains two hexadecimal digits (e.g.
&quot;3e&quot;). Useful as input (after editing) to the
sg_wr_mode(8) utility.</p>

<p>-6, --six by default this utility sends a 10 byte MODE
SENSE command to the DEVICE. However some SCSI devices only
support 6 byte MODE SENSE commands (e.g. SCSI-2 tape
drives). This parameter forces the use of 6 byte MODE SENSE
commands.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase level of verbosity. Can be used
multiple times.</p>

<p>-V, --version print out version string then exit.</p>

<p>NOTES If the normal sg_modes utility fails with
&quot;illegal command operation code&quot; then try the
--six (or -6) option.</p>

<p>This utility performs a SCSI INQUIRY command to
determine the periph- eral type of the device (e.g. 0 -&gt;
Direct Access Device (disk)) prior to sending a MODE SENSE
command. This helps in decoding the block descriptor and
mode pages.</p>

<p>In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the DEVICE must be a
SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block devices
(e.g. SCSI disks and DVD drives) can also be specified. For
example &quot;sg_modes -a /dev/sda&quot; will work in the
2.6 series kernels.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_modes is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p>OLDER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS The options in this section
were the only ones available prior to sg3_utils version 1.23
. In sg3_utils version 1.23 and later these older options
can be selected by either setting the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS
environment variable or using --old (or -O) as the first
option.</p>

<p>-6 by default this utility sends a 10 byte MODE SENSE
command to the DEVICE. This parameter forces the use of 6
byte MODE SENSE commands. See --six in the main
description.</p>

<p>-a see --all in the main description.</p>

<p>-A output all the mode pages and subpages supported by
the DEVICE. Same as --all --all in the new syntax.</p>

<p>-c=PC PC is the page control value. See --control=PC in
the main description.</p>

<p>-d see --dbd in the main description.</p>

<p>-D see --dbout in the main description.</p>

<p>-e see --examine in the main description.</p>

<p>-f see --flexible in the main description.</p>

<p>-h The default action is to decode known mode page
numbers (and subpage numbers) into text. With this option
mode page numbers (and subpage numbers) are output in
hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-H same action as the -h option.</p>

<p>-l see --list in the main description.</p>

<p>-L see --llbaa in the main description.</p>

<p>-N switch to the newer style options.</p>

<p>-m=LEN see --maxlen=LEN in the main description.</p>

<p>-p=PG PG is page code to fetch. Should be a hexadecimal
number between 0 and 3f inclusive (0 to 63 decimal). The
default value when required is 3f (fetch all mode
pages).</p>

<p>-p=PG,SPG page code and subpage code values to fetch.
The page code should be a hexadecimal number between 0 and
3f inclusive. The subpage code should be a hexadecimal
number between 0 and ff inclusive. The default value for the
subpage code is 0.</p>

<p>-r output the selected mode page to stdout a byte per
line. Each line contains two hexadecimal digits (e.g.
&quot;3e&quot;). Useful as input (after editing) to the
sg_wr_mode(8) utility.</p>

<p>-subp=SPG sub page code to fetch. Should be a
hexadecimal number between 0 and 0xff inclusive. The default
value is 0.</p>

<p>-v increase verbosity of output.</p>

<p>-V print out version string then exit.</p>

<p>-? output usage message then exit. Ignore all other
parameters.</p>
