<p>NAME raddebug - Display debugging output from a running
server.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS raddebug [-c condition] [-d config_directory]
[-i ipv4-address] [-I ipv6-address] [-f socket_file] [-t
timeout] [-u user-name]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION raddebug is a shell script wrapper around
radmin that automates the process of obtaining debugging
output from a running server. It does this without impacting
service availability, unlike using radiusd -X. There are a
number of prerequisites that are required for its proper
operation:</p>

<p>* radmin must be available in the PATH. * The user
running raddebug must have permission to connect to the
server control socket. * The control socket must be
configured. For instructions, see
raddb/sites-available/control-socket * The control socket
must be marked as &quot;mode = rw&quot;. * The user running
raddebug must have permission to read and write files in the
&quot;logdir&quot; directory. This is usually
/var/log/radiusd.</p>

<p>For a number of reasons, the debugging output is placed
in an interme- diate file, rather than being sent directly
to standard output. In order to prevent this file from
growing too large, the raddebug program is automatically
terminated after 10 seconds. This timeout can be changed via
the &quot;-t&quot; parameter.</p>

<p>When the script exits, debug mode in the server is
disabled, and the intermediate file is deleted.</p>

<p>Debug output from a live server can be redirected to
only one location. If a second instance of raddebug is
started while the first one is still running, the later one
will over-ride the first one, and the first will stop
producing output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c condition Set a specific debug condition. The
format of the condition is as specified in the CONDITIONS
section of the unlang manual page.</p>

<p>-f socket_file The path to the control socket. See the
radmin manual page for more description of this option.</p>

<p>-i ipv4-address Show debug output for the client having
the given IPv4 address. This option is equivalent to using:
-c (Packet-Src-IP-Address == ipv4-address)</p>

<p>-d config directory The radius configuration directory,
usually /etc/raddb. See the radmin manual page for more
description of this option.</p>

<p>-I ipv6-address Show debug output for the client having
the given IPv6 address. This option is equivalent to using:
-c (Packet-Src-IPv6-Address == ipv6-address)</p>

<p>-t timeout Stop printing debug output after
&quot;timeout&quot; seconds. The default timeout is sixty
(60) seconds. Use &quot;-t 0&quot; to print debugging output
forever, or until the script exits.</p>

<p>-u name Show debug output for users having the given
name. This option is equivalent to using: -c (User-Name ==
name)</p>
