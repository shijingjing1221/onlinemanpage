<p>VIRT-VIEWER(1) Virtualization Support VIRT-VIEWER(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-viewer - display the graphical console for a
virtual machine</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-viewer [OPTIONS] --
DOMAIN-NAME|ID|UUID</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION virt-viewer is a minimal tool for displaying
the graphical console of a virtual machine. The console is
accessed using the VNC or SPICE protocol. The guest can be
referred to based on its name, ID, or UUID. If the guest is
not already running, then the viewer can be told to wait
until it starts before attempting to connect to the console.
The viewer can connect to remote hosts to lookup the console
information and then also connect to the remote console
using the same network transport.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are accepted when running
&quot;virt-viewer&quot;:</p>

<p>-h, --help Display command line help summary</p>

<p>-V, --version Display program version number</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Display information about the
connection</p>

<p>-c URI, --connect=URI Specify the hypervisor connection
URI</p>

<p>-w, --wait Wait for the domain to start up before
attempting to connect to the console</p>

<p>-r, --reconnect Automatically reconnect to the domain if
it shuts down and restarts</p>

<p>-z PCT, --zoom=PCT Zoom level of the display window in
percentage. Range 10-400.</p>

<p>-d, --direct Do not attempt to tunnel the console over
SSH, even if the main connection URI used SSH.</p>

<p>-a, --attach Instead of making a direct TCP/UNIX socket
connection to the remote display, ask libvirt to provide a
pre-connected socket for the display. This avoids the need
to authenticate with the remote display server directly.
This option will only work when connecting to a guest that
is running on the same host as the virt-viewer program. If
attaching to the guest via libvirt fails, virt-viewer will
automatically fallback to trying a regular direct TCP/UNIX
socket connection.</p>

<p>-f, --full-screen Start with the window maximised to
fullscreen</p>

<p>If supported, the remote display will be reconfigured to
match the physical client monitor configuration, by enabling
or disabling extra monitors as necessary. This is currently
implemented by the Spice backend only.</p>

<p>To specify which client monitors are used in fullscreen
mode, see the CONFIGURATION section below.</p>

<p>--debug Print debugging information</p>

<p>-H HOTKEYS, --hotkeys HOTKEYS Set global hotkey
bindings. By default, keyboard shortcuts only work when the
guest display widget does not have focus. Any actions
specified in HOTKEYS will be effective even when the guest
display widget has input focus. The format for HOTKEYS is
&lt;action1&gt;=&lt;key1&gt;[+&lt;key2&gt;][,&lt;action2&gt;=&lt;key3&gt;[+&lt;key4&gt;]].
Key-names are case-insensitive. Valid actions are:
toggle-fullscreen, release-cursor, secure-attention,
smartcard-insert and smartcard- remove. The
&quot;secure-attention&quot; action sends a secure attention
sequence (Ctrl+Alt+Del) to the guest. Examples:</p>


<p>--hotkeys=toggle-fullscreen=shift+f11,release-cursor=shift+f12</p>

<p>--hotkeys=release-cursor=ctrl+alt</p>

<p>Note that hotkeys for which no binding is given are
disabled. Although the hotkeys specified here are handled by
the client, it is still possible to send these key
combinations to the guest via a menu item.</p>

<p>-k, --kiosk Start in kiosk mode. In this mode, the
application will start in fullscreen with minimal UI. It
will prevent the user from quitting or performing any
interaction outside of usage of the remote desktop
session.</p>

<p>Note that it cant offer a complete secure solution by
itself. Your kiosk system must have additional configuration
and security settings to lock down the OS. In particular,
you must configure or disable the window manager, limit the
session capabilities, use some restart/watchdog mechanism,
disable VT switching etc.</p>

<p>--kiosk-quit &lt;never|on-disconnect&gt; By default,
when kiosk mode is enabled, virt-viewer will remain open
when the connection to the remote server is terminated. By
setting kiosk-quit option to &quot;on-disconnect&quot;
value, virt-viewer will quit instead. Please note that
--reconnect takes precedence over this option, and will
attempt to do a reconnection before it quits.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION A small number of configuration options
can be controlled by editing the settings file located in
the user configuration directory:</p>

<p>&lt;USER-CONFIG-DIR&gt;/virt-viewer/settings</p>

<p>This file is a text file in INI format, with application
options in the [virt-viewer] group and per-guest options in
a group identified by the guest s UUID. The application
options should not be edited manually. There is also a
special [fallback] group which specifies options for all
guests that dont have an explicit group.</p>

<p>For each guest, the initial fullscreen monitor
configuration can be specified by using the monitor-mapping
key. This configuration only takes effect when the
-f/--full-screen option is specified.</p>

<p>The value of this key is a list of mappings between a
guest display and a client monitor. Each mapping is
separated by a semicolon character, and the mappings have
the format
&lt;GUEST-DISPLAY-ID&gt;:&lt;CLIENT-MONITOR-ID&gt;.</p>

<p>For example, to map guest displays 1 and 2 to client
monitors 2 and 3 for the guest with a UUID of
e4591275-d9d3-4a44-a18b-ef2fbc8ac3e2, use:</p>

<p>[e4591275-d9d3-4a44-a18b-ef2fbc8ac3e2]
monitor-mapping=1:2;2:3</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To connect to the guest called demo running
under Xen</p>

<p>virt-viewer demo</p>

<p>To connect to the guest with ID 7 running under QEMU</p>

<p>virt-viewer --connect qemu:///system 7</p>

<p>To wait for the guest with UUID
66ab33c0-6919-a3f7-e659-16c82d248521 to startup and then
connect, also reconnecting upon restart of VM</p>

<p>virt-viewer --reconnect --wait
66ab33c0-6919-a3f7-e659-16c82d248521</p>

<p>To connect to a remote console using TLS</p>

<p>virt-viewer --connect xen://example.org/ demo</p>

<p>To connect to a remote host using SSH, lookup the guest
config and then make a direct non-tunnelled connection of
the console</p>

<p>virt-viewer --direct --connect
xen+ssh://root@example.org/ demo</p>
