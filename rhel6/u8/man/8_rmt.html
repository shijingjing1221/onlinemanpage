<p>RMT(8) System management commands RMT(8)</p>

<p>NAME rmt - remote magtape protocol module</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rmt</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rmt is a program used by the remote dump(8),
restore(8) or tar(1) pro- grams in manipulating a magnetic
tape drive through an interprocess communication connection.
Rmt is normally started up with an rexec(3) or rcmd(3)
call.</p>

<p>The rmt program accepts requests specific to the
manipulation of mag- netic tapes, performs the commands,
then responds with a status indica- tion. All responses are
in ASCII and in one of the following two forms.</p>

<p>Successful commands have responses of: Anumber</p>

<p>where number is an ASCII representation of a decimal
number.</p>

<p>Unsuccessful commands are responded to with:
Eerror-numbererror-message</p>

<p>where error-number is one of the possible error numbers
described in intro(2) and error-message is the corresponding
error string as printed from a call to perror(3).</p>

<p>The protocol is comprised of the following commands,
which are sent as indicated - no spaces are supplied between
the command and its argu- ments, or between its arguments,
and indicates that a newline should be supplied:</p>

<p>Odevicemode Open the specified device using the
indicated mode. Device is a full pathname and mode is an
ASCII representation of a decimal number suitable for
passing to open(2). If a device had already been opened, it
is closed before a new open is performed.</p>

<p>Cdevice Close the currently open device. The device
specified is ignored.</p>

<p>Lwhenceoffset Perform an lseek(2) operation using the
specified parameters. The response value is that returned
from the lseek call.</p>

<p>Wcount Write data onto the open device. Rmt reads count
bytes from the connection, aborting if a premature
end-of-file is encountered. The response value is that
returned from the write(2) call.</p>

<p>Rcount Read count bytes of data from the open device. If
count exceeds the size of the data buffer (10 kilobytes), it
is truncated to the data buffer size. Rmt then performs the
requested read(2) and responds with Acount-readif the read
was successful; oth- erwise an error in the standard format
is returned. If the read was successful, the data read is
then sent.</p>

<p>Ioperationcount Perform a MTIOCOP ioctl(2) command using
the specified parame- ters. The parameters are interpreted
as the ASCII representations of the decimal values to place
in the mt_op and mt_count fields of the structure used in
the ioctl call. The return value is the count parameter when
the operation is suc- cessful.</p>

<p>By issuing the I-nn command, a client will specify that
he is using the VERSION 1 protocol.</p>

<p>For a VERSION 0 client, the operation parameter is the
platform mt_op value (could be different if the client and
the rmt server are on two different platforms). For a
VERSION 1 client, the operation parameter is standardized as
below:</p>

<p>0 Issue a MTWEOF command (write count end-of-file
records).</p>

<p>1 Issue a MTFSF command (forward space over count file
marks).</p>

<p>2 Issue a MTBSF command (backward space over count file
marks).</p>

<p>3 Issue a MTFSR command (forward space count
inter-record gaps).</p>

<p>4 Issue a MTBSR command (backward space count
inter-record gaps).</p>

<p>5 Issue a MTREW command (rewind).</p>

<p>6 Issue a MTOFFL command (rewind and put the drive
offline).</p>

<p>7 Issue a MTNOP command (no operation, set status
only).</p>

<p>ioperationcount Perform an extended MTIOCOP ioctl(2)
command using the specified parameters. The parameters are
interpreted as the ASCII repre- sentations of the decimal
values to place in the mt_op and mt_count fields of the
structure used in the ioctl call. The return value is the
count parameter when the operation is suc- cessful. The
possible operations are:</p>

<p>0 Issue a MTCACHE command (switch cache on).</p>

<p>1 Issue a MTNOCACHE command (switch cache off).</p>

<p>2 Issue a MTRETEN command (retension the tape).</p>

<p>3 Issue a MTERASE command (erase the entire tape).</p>

<p>4 Issue a MTEOM command (position to end of media).</p>

<p>5 Issue a MTNBSF command (backward space count files to
BOF).</p>

<p>S Return the status of the open device, as obtained with
a MTI- OCGET ioctl call. If the operation was successful, an
ack is sent with the size of the status buffer, then the
status buffer is sent (in binary, which is non-portable
between different platforms).</p>

<p>ssub-command This is a replacement for the previous S
command, portable across different platforms. If the open
device is a magnetic tape, return members of the magnetic
tape status structure, as obtained with a MTIOCGET ioctl
call. If the open device is not a magnetic tape, an error is
returned. If the MTIOCGET operation was successful, the
numerical value of the structure member is returned in
decimal. The following sub commands are supported:</p>

<p>T return the content of the structure member mt_type
which contains the type of the magnetic tape device.</p>

<p>D return the content of the structure member mt_dsreg
which contains the &quot;drive status register&quot;.</p>

<p>E return the content of the structure member mt_erreg
which contains the &quot;error register&quot;. This
structure member must be retrieved first because it is
cleared after each MTI- OCGET ioctl call.</p>

<p>R return the content of the structure member mt_resid
which contains the residual count of the last I/O.</p>

<p>F return the content of the structure member mt_fileno
which contains the file number of the current tape posi-
tion.</p>

<p>B return the content of the structure member mt_blkno
which contains the block number of the current tape
position.</p>

<p>f return the content of the structure member mt_flags
which contains MTF_ flags from the driver.</p>

<p>b return the content of the structure member mt_bf which
contains the optimum blocking factor.</p>

<p>Any other command causes rmt to exit.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All responses are of the form described
above.</p>

<p>BUGS People should be discouraged from using this for a
remote file access protocol.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The dump/restore backup suit was ported to Linux
s Second Extended File System by Remy Card
&lt;card@Linux.EU.Org&gt;. He maintained the initial ver-
sions of dump (up and including 0.4b4, released in january
1997).</p>

<p>Starting with 0.4b5, the new maintainer is Stelian Pop
&lt;stelian@popies.net&gt;.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The dump/restore backup suit is available
from &lt;http://dump.source- forge.net&gt;</p>

<p>HISTORY The rmt command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>BSD version 0.4b42 of June 18, 2009 RMT(8)</p>
