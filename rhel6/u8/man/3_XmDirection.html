<p>NAME XmDirection Data type for the direction of widget
components</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmDirection is the data type specifying the
direction in which the sys- tem displays subwidgets,
children of widgets, or other visual compo- nents that are
to be laid out. This data type also affects traversal order
within tab groups.</p>

<p>XmDirection is implemented as an unsigned char bit mask.
The horizon- tal and vertical directions can be specified
independent of each other. XmDirection also specifies the
precedence of the horizontal and verti- cal directions
relative to each other. For example, a value of
XmRIGHT_TO_LEFT_TOP_TO_BOTTOM lays out a component
horizontally from right to left first, then vertically top
to bottom.</p>

<p>XmDirection provides the following masks, each of which
corresponds to a particular bit in XmDirection:</p>

<p>&middot; XmRIGHT_TO_LEFT_MASK</p>

<p>&middot; XmLEFT_TO_RIGHT_MASK</p>

<p>&middot; XmTOP_TO_BOTTOM_MASK</p>

<p>&middot; XmBOTTOM_TO_TOP_MASK</p>

<p>&middot; XmPRECEDENCE_HORIZ_MASK</p>

<p>&middot; XmPRECEDENCE_VERT_MASK</p>

<p>In addition to the preceding single bit masks,
XmDirection also pro- vides the following multiple bit
masks. These multiple bit masks are particularly useful as
arguments to XmDirectionMatchPartial:</p>

<p>&middot; XmHORIZONTAL_MASK</p>

<p>&middot; XmPRECEDENCE_MASK</p>

<p>&middot; XmVERTICAL_MASK</p>

<p>Motif also provides the following enumerated constants
for specifying various combinations of directions:</p>

<p>XmRIGHT_TO_LEFT_TOP_TO_BOTTOM Specifies that the
components are laid out from right to left first, then top
to bottom.</p>

<p>XmLEFT_TO_RIGHT_TOP_TO_BOTTOM Specifies that the
components are laid out from left to right first, then top
to bottom.</p>

<p>XmRIGHT_TO_LEFT_BOTTOM_TO_TOP Specifies that the
components are laid out from right to left first, then
bottom to top.</p>

<p>XmLEFT_TO_RIGHT_BOTTOM_TO_TOP Specifies that the
components are laid out from left to right first, then
bottom to top.</p>

<p>XmTOP_TO_BOTTOM_RIGHT_TO_LEFT Specifies that the
components are laid out from top to bottom first, then right
to left.</p>

<p>XmTOP_TO_BOTTOM_LEFT_TO_RIGHT Specifies that the
components are laid out from top to bottom first, then left
to right.</p>

<p>XmBOTTOM_TO_TOP_RIGHT_TO_LEFT Specifies that the
components are laid out from bottom to top first, then right
to left.</p>

<p>XmBOTTOM_TO_TOP_LEFT_TO_RIGHT Specifies that the
components are laid out from bottom to top first, then left
to right.</p>

<p>XmTOP_TO_BOTTOM Specifies that the components are laid
out from top to bot- tom. If horizontal direction is
important, do not use this constant.</p>

<p>XmBOTTOM_TO_TOP Specifies that the components are laid
out from bottom to top. If horizontal direction is
important, do not use this constant.</p>

<p>XmDEFAULT_DIRECTION Specifies that the components are
laid out according to the default direction. (This constant
is primarily for widget writers.)</p>

<p>XmLEFT_TO_RIGHT Specifies that the components are laid
out from left to right. If vertical direction is important,
do not use this constant.</p>

<p>XmRIGHT_TO_LEFT Specifies that the components are laid
out from right to left. If vertical direction is important,
do not use this constant.</p>
