<p>IPSEC_SPIGRP(8) Executable programs IPSEC_SPIGRP(8)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec_spigrp - group/ungroup IPSEC Security
Associations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipsec spigrp ipsecspigrp [--label label]
af1dst1spi1proto1 [af2dst2spi2proto2 [af3dst3spi3proto3
[af4dst4spi4proto4]]] ipsecspigrp [--label label] --said SA1
[SA2 [SA3 [SA4]]] ipsecspigrp --help ipsecspigrp
--version</p>

<p>OBSOLETE Note that spi is only supported on the classic
KLIPS stack. It is not supported on any other stack and will
be completely removed in future versions. A replacement
command still needs to be designed</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Spigrp groups IPSEC Security Associations
(SAs) together or ungroups previously grouped SAs. An entry
in the IPSEC extended routing table can only point (via a
destination address, a Security Parameters Index (SPI) and a
protocol identifier) to one SA. If more than one transform
must be applied to a given type of packet, this can be
accomplished by setting up several SAs with the same
destination address but potentially different SPIs and
protocols, and grouping them with spigrp.</p>

<p>The SAs to be grouped, specified by destination address
(DNS name lookup, IPv4 dotted quad or IPv6 coloned hex), SPI
(&acute;0x&acute;-prefixed hexadecimal number) and protocol
(&quot;ah&quot;, &quot;esp&quot;, &quot;comp&quot; or
&quot;tun&quot;), are listed from the inside transform to
the outside; in other words, the transforms are applied in
the order of the command line and removed in the reverse
order. The resulting SA group is referred to by its first SA
(by af1, dst1, spi1 and proto1).</p>

<p>The --said option indicates that the SA IDs are to be
specified as one argument each, in the format
&lt;proto&gt;&lt;af&gt;&lt;spi&gt;@&lt;dest&gt;. The SA IDs
must all be specified as separate parameters without the
--said option or all as monolithic parameters after the
--said option.</p>

<p>The SAs must already exist and must not already be part
of a group.</p>

<p>If spigrp is invoked with only one SA specification, it
ungroups the previously-grouped set of SAs containing the SA
specified.</p>

<p>The --label option identifies all responses from that
command invocation with a user-supplied label, provided as
an argument to the label option. This can be helpful for
debugging one invocation of the command out of a large
number.</p>

<p>The command form with no additional arguments lists the
contents of /proc/net/ipsec_spigrp. The format of
/proc/net/ipsec_spigrp is discussed in ipsec_spigrp(5).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES ipsec spigrp inet gw2 0x113 tun inet gw2 0x115
esp inet gw2 0x116 ah groups 3 SAs together, all destined
for gw2, but with an IPv4-in-IPv4 tunnel SA applied first
with SPI 0x113, then an ESP header to encrypt the packet
with SPI 0x115, and finally an AH header to authenticate the
packet with SPI 0x116.</p>

<p>ipsec spigrp --said tun.113@gw2 esp.115@gw2 ah.116@gw2
groups 3 SAs together, all destined for gw2, but with an
IPv4-in-IPv4 tunnel SA applied first with SPI 0x113, then an
ESP header to encrypt the packet with SPI 0x115, and finally
an AH header to authenticate the packet with SPI 0x116.</p>

<p>ipsec spigrp --said tun:233@3049:1::1 esp:235@3049:1::1
ah:236@3049:1::1 groups 3 SAs together, all destined for
3049:1::1, but with an IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel SA applied first
with SPI 0x233, then an ESP header to encrypt the packet
with SPI 0x235, and finally an AH header to authenticate the
packet with SPI 0x236.</p>

<p>ipsec spigrp inet6 3049:1::1 0x233 tun inet6 3049:1::1
0x235 esp inet6 3049:1::1 0x236 ah groups 3 SAs together,
all destined for 3049:1::1, but with an IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel
SA applied first with SPI 0x233, then an ESP header to
encrypt the packet with SPI 0x235, and finally an AH header
to authenticate the packet with SPI 0x236.</p>

<p>BUGS Yes, it really is limited to a maximum of four SAs,
although admittedly it&acute;s hard to see why you would
need more.</p>
