<p>NAME .k5login - Kerberos V5 acl file for host
access.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The .k5login file, which resides in a user s
home directory, contains a list of the Kerberos principals.
Anyone with valid tickets for a prin- cipal in the file is
allowed host access with the UID of the user in whose home
directory the file resides. One common use is to place a
.k5login file in roots home directory, thereby granting
system admin- istrators remote root access to the host via
Kerberos.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Suppose the user &quot;alice&quot; had a
.k5login file in her home directory con- taining the
following line:</p>

<p>bob@FUBAR.ORG</p>

<p>This would allow &quot;bob&quot; to use any of the
Kerberos network applications, such as telnet(1), rlogin(1),
rsh(1), and rcp(1), to access alices account, using bobs
Kerberos tickets.</p>

<p>Let us further suppose that &quot;alice&quot; is a
system administrator. Alice and the other system
administrators would have their principals in roots .k5login
file on each host:</p>

<p>alice@BLEEP.COM joeadmin/root@BLEEP.COM</p>

<p>This would allow either system administrator to log in
to these hosts using their Kerberos tickets instead of
having to type the root pass- word. Note that because
&quot;bob&quot; retains the Kerberos tickets for his own
principal, &quot;bob@FUBAR.ORG&quot;, he would not have any
of the privileges that require alices tickets, such as root
access to any of the sites hosts, or the ability to change
alices password.</p>
