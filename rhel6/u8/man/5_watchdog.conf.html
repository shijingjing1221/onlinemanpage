<p>WATCHDOG.CONF(5) WATCHDOG.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME watchdog.conf - configuration file for the watchdog
daemon</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This file carries all configuration options
for the Linux watchdog dae- mon. Each option has to be
written on a line for itself. Comments start with #. Blanks
are ignored except after the = sign. An empty text after the
= sign disables the feature as long as that makes sense.</p>

<p>OPTIONS interval = &lt;interval&gt; Set the interval
between two writes to the watchdog device. The kernel
drivers expects a write command every minute. Otherwise the
system will be rebooted. Default value is 10 seconds. An
interval of more than a minute can only be used with the -f
com- mand-line option.</p>

<p>logtick = &lt;logtick&gt; If you enable verbose logging,
a message is written into the syslog or a logfile. While
this is nice, it is not necessary to get a message every 10
seconds which really fills up disk and needs CPU. logtick
allows adjustment of the number of intervals skipped before
a log message is written. If you use logtick = 60 and
interval = 10, only every 10 minutes (600 seconds) a message
is written. This may make the exact time of a crash harder
to find but greatly reduces disk usage and administrator
nerves if you re looking for a particular syslog entry in
between of watchdog messages.</p>

<p>max-load-1 = &lt;load1&gt; Set the maximal allowed load
average for a 1 minute span. Once this load average is
reached the system is rebooted. Default value is 0. That
means the load average check is disabled. Be careful not to
this parameter too low. To set a value less then the
predefined minimal value of 2, you have to use the -f com-
mandline option.</p>

<p>max-load-5 = &lt;load5&gt; Set the maximal allowed load
average for a 5 minute span. Once this load average is
reached the system is rebooted. Default value is
3/4*max-load-1. Be careful not to this parameter too low. To
set a value less then the predefined minimal value of 2, you
have to use the -f commandline option.</p>

<p>max-load-15 = &lt;load15&gt; Set the maximal allowed
load average for a 15 minute span. Once this load average is
reached the system is rebooted. Default value is
1/2*max-load-1. Be careful not to this parameter too low. To
set a value less then the predefined minimal value of 2, you
have to use the -f commandline option.</p>

<p>min-memory = &lt;minpage&gt; Set the minimal amount of
virtual memory that has to stay free. Note that this is in
pages. Default value is 0 pages which means this test is
disabled. The page size is taken from the system include
files.</p>

<p>max-temperature = &lt;temp&gt; Set the maximal allowed
temperature. Once this temperature is reached the system is
halted. Default value is 120. There is no unit conversion,
so make sure you use the same unit as your hardware.
Watchdog will issue warnings once the temperature increases
90%, 95% and 98% of this temperature.</p>

<p>watchdog-device = &lt;device&gt; Set the watchdog device
name. Default is to disable keep alive support.</p>

<p>watchdog-timeout = &lt;timeout&gt; Set the watchdog
device timeout during startup. If not set, the default is
driver-dependent.</p>

<p>temperature-device = &lt;temp-dev&gt; Set the
temperature device name. Default is to disable tempera- ture
checking.</p>

<p>file = &lt;filename&gt; Set file name for file mode.
This option can be given as often as you like to check
several files.</p>

<p>change = &lt;mtime&gt; Set the change interval time for
file mode. This options always belongs to the active
filename, that is when finding a change = line watchdog
assumes it belongs to the most recently read file = line.
They dont neccessarily have to follow each other directly.
But you cannot specify a change = before a file =. The
default is to only stat the file and dont look for
changes.</p>

<p>pidfile = &lt;pidfilename&gt; Set pidfile name for
server test mode. This option can be given as often as you
like to check several servers.</p>

<p>ping = &lt;ip-addr&gt; Set IP address for ping mode.
This option can be used more than once to check different
connections.</p>

<p>interface = &lt;if-name&gt; Set interface name for
network mode. This option can be used more than once to
check different interfaces.</p>

<p>test-binary = &lt;testbin&gt; Execute the given binary
to do some user defined tests.</p>

<p>test-timeout = &lt;timeout in seconds&gt; User defined
tests may only run for &lt;timeout&gt; seconds. Set to 0 for
unlimited.</p>

<p>repair-binary = &lt;repbin&gt; Execute the given binary
in case of a problem instead of shut- ting down the
system.</p>

<p>admin = &lt;mail-address&gt; Email address to send admin
mail to. That is, who shall be noti- fied that the machine
is being halted or rebooted. Default is root. If you want to
disable notification via email just set admin to en empty
string.</p>

<p>realtime = &lt;yes|no&gt; If set to yes watchdog will
lock itself into memory so it is never swapped out.</p>

<p>priority = &lt;schedule priority&gt; Set the schedule
priority for realtime mode.</p>

<p>test-directory = &lt;test directory&gt; Set the
directory to run user test/repair scripts. Default is
/etc/watchdog.d See the Test Directory section in
watchdog(8) for more information.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/watchdog.conf The watchdog configuration
file</p>

<p>/etc/watchdog.d A directory containing test-or-repair
commands. See the Test Directory section in watchdog(8) for
more information.</p>
