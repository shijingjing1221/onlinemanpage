<p>MKFONTSCALE(1) MKFONTSCALE(1)</p>

<p>NAME mkfontscale - create an index of scalable font
files for X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mkfontscale [ -b ] [ -s ] [ -o filename ] [ -x
suffix ] [ -a encoding ] ... [ -f fuzz ] [ -l ] [ -e
directory ] [ -p prefix ] [ -r prefix ] [ -n prefix ] [ -- ]
[ directory ] ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For each directory argument, mkfontscale
reads all of the scalable font files in the directory. For
every font file found, an X11 font name (XLFD) is generated,
and is written together with the file name to a file
fonts.scale in the directory.</p>

<p>The resulting fonts.scale file should be checked and
possibly manually edited before being used as input for the
mkfontdir(1) program.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b read bitmap fonts. By default, bitmap fonts
are ignored.</p>

<p>-s ignore scalable fonts. By default, scalable fonts are
read. If -b is set, this flag has the side effect of
enabling the reading of fonts.scale files.</p>

<p>-o filename send program output to filename; default is
fonts.scale if bitmap fonts are not being read, and
fonts.dir if they are. If filename is relative, it is
created in the directory being pro- cessed. If it is the
special value -, output is written to standard output.</p>

<p>-x suffix exclude all files with the specified
suffix.</p>

<p>-a encoding add encoding to the list of encodings
searched for.</p>

<p>-f fuzz set the fraction of characters that may be
missing in large encodings to fuzz percent. Defaults to
2%.</p>

<p>-l Write fonts.dir files suitable for implementations
that cannot reencode legacy fonts (BDF and PCF). By default,
it is assumed that the implementation can reencode
Unicode-encoded legacy fonts.</p>

<p>-e specifies a directory with encoding files. Every such
directory is scanned for encoding files, the list of which
is then written to an &quot;encodings.dir&quot; file in
every font directory.</p>

<p>-p Specifies a prefix that is prepended to the encoding
file path names when they are written to the
&quot;encodings.dir&quot; file. The prefix is prepended
literally: if a / is required between the prefix and the
path names, it must be supplied explicitly as part of the
prefix.</p>

<p>-r Keep non-absolute encoding directories in their
relative form when writing the &quot;encodings.dir&quot;
file. The default is to con- vert relative encoding
directories to absolute directories by prepending the
current directory. The positioning of this options is
significant, as this option only applies to subse- quent -e
options.</p>

<p>-n do not scan for fonts, do not write font directory
files. This option is useful when generating encoding
directories only.</p>

<p>-- end of options.</p>

xfs(1), xset(1)</p>

<p>NOTES The format of the fonts.scale, fonts.dir and
encodings.dir files is documented in the mkfontdir(1) manual
page.</p>

<p>Mkfontscale will overwrite any fonts.scale file even if
it has been hand-edited.</p>

<p>mkfontscale -b -s -l is equivalent to mkfontdir.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The version of mkfontscale included in this X.Org
Foundation release was originally written by Juliusz
Chroboczek &lt;jch@freedesktop.org&gt; for the XFree86
project. The functionality of this program was inspired by
the ttmkfdir utility by Joerg Pommnitz.</p>
