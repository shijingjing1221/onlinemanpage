<p>NAME xjc - Compiles an XML schema file into fully
annotated Java classes.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xjc [ options ] schema file/URL/dir/jar ... [-b
bindinfo ] ...</p>

<p>options The command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p>schema file/URL/dir/jar ... The location of the XML
schema file. If dir is specified, then all schema files in
it are compiled. If jar is specified, then the
/META-INF/sun-jaxb.episode binding file is compiled.</p>

<p>-b bindinfo The location of the bindings files.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Start the binding compiler with the
appropriate xjc shell script in the bin directory for your
platform. There is also an Ant task to run the binding
complier. See Using the XJC with Ant at
http://jaxb.java.net/nonav/2.1.3/docs/xjcTask.html</p>

<p>OPTIONS &middot; See also Nonstandard Options</p>

<p>&middot; See also Deprecated and Removed Options</p>

<p>-nv By default, the XJC binding compiler performs strict
validation of the source schema before processing it. Use
this option to disable strict schema validation. This does
not mean that the binding compiler will not perform any
validation, but means that it will perform a less-strict
validation.</p>

<p>-extension By default, the XJC binding compiler strictly
enforces the rules outlined in the Compatibility chapter of
the JAXB Specification. Appendix E.2 defines a set of W3C
XML Schema features that are not completely supported by
JAXB v1.0. In some cases, you may be allowed to use them in
the -extension mode enabled by this switch. In the default
(strict) mode, you are also limited to using only the
binding customization defined in the specification. By using
the -extension switch, you will be allowed to use the JAXB
Vendor Extensions.</p>

<p>-b file Specifies one or more external binding files to
process. Each binding file must have its own -b switch. The
syntax of the external binding files is flexible. You can
have a single binding file that contains customization for
multiple schemas or you can break the customization into
multiple bindings files: xjc schema1.xsd schema2.xsd
schema3.xsd -b bindings123.xjbxjc schema1.xsd schema2.xsd
schema3.xsd -b bindings1.xjb -b bindings2.xjb -b
bindings3.xjb. In addition, the ordering of the schema files
and binding files on the command line does not matter.</p>

<p>-d dir By default, the XJC binding compiler generates
the Java content classes in the current directory. Use this
option to specify an alternate output directory. The output
directory must already exist. The XJC binding compiler does
not create it for you.</p>

<p>-p pkg When you specify a target package with this
command-line option, it overrides any binding customization
for the package name and the default package name algorithm
defined in the specification.</p>

<p>-httpproxy proxy Specifies the HTTP or HTTPS proxy in
the format [user[:password]@]proxyHost[:proxyPort]. The old
-host and -port options are still supported by the RI for
backward compatibility, but they were deprecated. The
password specified with this option is an argument that is
visible to other users who use the top command. For greater
security, use the -httpproxyfile option.</p>

<p>-httpproxyfile file Specifies the HTTP or HTTPS proxy
with a file. The same format as the -httpproxy option, but
the password specified in the file is not visible to other
users.</p>

<p>-classpath arg Specifies where to find client
application class files used by the jxb:javaType and
xjc:superClass customization.</p>

<p>-catalog file Specifies catalog files to resolve
external entity references. Supports the TR9401, XCatalog,
and OASIS XML Catalog formats. See XML Entity and URI
Resolvers at http://xerces.apache.org/xml-
commons/components/resolver/resolver-article.html</p>

<p>-readOnly By default, the XJC binding compiler does not
write-protect the Java source files it generates. Use this
option to force the XJC binding compiler to mark the
generated Java sources as read-only.</p>

<p>-npa Suppresses the generation of package level
annotations into **/package-info.java. Using this switch
causes the generated code to internalize those annotations
into the other generated classes.</p>

<p>-no-header Suppresses the generation of a file header
comment that includes some note and time stamp. Using this
makes the generated code more compatible with the diff
command.</p>

<p>-target 2.0 Avoids generating code that relies on any
JAXB 2.1 features. This will allow the generated code to run
with JAXB 2.0 runtime environment (such as Java SE 6).</p>

<p>-xmlschema Treats input schemas as W3C XML Schema
(default). If you do not specify this switch, then your
input schemas are treated as though they are W3C XML
Schemas.</p>

<p>-relaxing Treats input schemas as RELAX NG (experimental
and unsupported). Support for RELAX NG schemas is provided
as a JAXB Vendor Extension.</p>

<p>-relaxing-compact Treat input schemas as RELAX NG
compact syntax (experimental and unsupported). Support for
RELAX NG schemas is provided as a JAXB Vendor Extension.</p>

<p>-dtd Treats input schemas as XML DTD (experimental and
unsupported). Support for RELAX NG schemas is provided as a
JAXB Vendor Extension.</p>

<p>-wsdl Treats input as WSDL and compiles schemas inside
it (experimental and unsupported).</p>

<p>-quiet Suppress compiler output, such as progress
information and warnings.</p>

<p>-verbose Be extra verbose, such as printing
informational messages or displaying stack traces upon some
errors.</p>

<p>-help Displays a brief summary of the compiler
switches.</p>

<p>-version Displays the compiler version information.</p>

<p>schema file/URL/dir Specifies one or more schema files
to compile. If you specify a directory, then the xjc command
scans it for all schema files and compiles them.</p>

<p>NONSTANDARD OPTIONS -XLocator Causes the generated code
to expose SAX Locator information about the source XML in
the Java bean instances after unmarshalling.</p>

<p>-Xsync-methods Causes all of the generated method
signatures to include the synchronized keyword.</p>

<p>-mark-generated Marks the generated code with the
annotation @javax.annotation.Generated.</p>

<p>-episode file Generates the specified episode file for
separate compilation.</p>

<p>DEPRECATED AND REMOVED OPTIONS -host &amp; -port These
options are replaced with the -httpproxy option. For
backward compatibility, these options are supported, but
will not be documented and might be removed from future
releases.</p>

<p>-use-runtime Because the JAXB 2.0 specification has
defined a portable runtime environment, it is no longer
necessary for the JAXB RI to generate
**/impl/runtimepackages. Therefore, this switch is obsolete
and was removed.</p>

<p>-source The -source compatibility switch was introduced
in the first JAXB 2.0 Early Access release. This switch is
removed from future releases of JAXB 2.0. If you need to
generate 1.0.x code, then use an installation of the 1.0.x
code base.</p>

<p>COMPILER RESTRICTIONS In general, it is safest to
compile all related schemas as a single unit with the same
binding compiler switches. Keep the following list of
restrictions in mind when running the xjc command. Most of
these issues only apply when you compile multiple schemas
with multiple invocations of the xjc command.</p>

<p>To compile multiple schemas at the same time, keep the
following precedence rules for the target Java package name
in mind:</p>

<p>1. The -p option has the highest precedence.</p>

<p>2. jaxb:package customization.</p>

<p>3. If targetNamespace is declared, then apply the
targetNamespace to the Java package name algorithm defined
in the specification.</p>

<p>4. If no targetNamespace is declared, then use a hard
coded package named generated.</p>

<p>You cannot have more than one jaxb:schemaBindings per
name space, so it is impossible to have two schemas in the
same target name space compiled into different Java
packages.</p>

<p>All schemas being compiled into the same Java package
must be submitted to the XJC binding compiler at the same
time. They cannot be compiled independently and work as
expected.</p>

<p>Element substitution groups that are spread across
multiple schema files must be compiled at the same time.</p>
