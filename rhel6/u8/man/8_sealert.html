<p>NAME sealert - setroubleshoot client tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sealert [-b] [-f local_id] [-h] [-s] [-S] [-l
id] [-a file] [-u] [-p] [-P plugin_name]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the sealert
program.</p>

<p>sealert is the user interface component (either GUI or
command line) to the setroubleshoot system. setroubleshoot
is used to diagnose SELinux denials and attempts to provide
user friendly explanations for a SELinux denial (e.g. AVC)
and recommendations for how one might adjust the system to
prevent the denial in the future.</p>

<p>In a standard configuration setroubleshoot is composed
of two compo- nents, setroubleshootd and sealert.</p>

<p>setroubleshootd is a system daemon which runs with root
privileges and listens for audit events emitted from the
kernel related to SELinux. The audit daemon must be running.
The audit daemon sends a dbus mes- sage to the
setroubleshootd daemon when the system gets an SELinux AVC
denial. The setroubleshootd daemon then runs a series of
analysis plu- gins which examines the audit data related to
the AVC. It records the results of the analysis and signals
any clients which have attached to the setroubleshootd
daemon that a new alert has been seen.</p>

<p>sealert can be run in either a GUI mode or a command
line mode. In both instances sealert run as a user process
with the privileges associated with the user. In GUI mode it
attaches to a setroubleshootd server instance and listens
for notifications of new alerts. When a new alert arrives it
alerts the desktop user via a notification in the status
icon area. The user may then click on the alert notification
which will open an alert browser. In addition to the current
alert sealert communicates with the setroubleshootd daemon
to access all prior alerts stored in the setroubleshoot
database.</p>

<p>The user may elect to tag any given alert as
&quot;ignore&quot; in the browser which prevents any future
notification for the given alert. This is useful when a user
is already aware of a reoccurring problem.</p>

<p>sealert may also be run in command line mode. The two
most useful com- mand line options are -l to
&quot;lookup&quot; an alert ID and -a to &quot;analyze&quot;
a log file. When setroubleshootd generates a new alert it
assigns it a local ID and writes this as a syslog message.
The -l lookup option may then be used to retrieve the alert
from the setroubleshootd alert database and write it to
stdout. This is most useful when setrou- bleshootd is being
run on a headless system without the GUI desktop alert
facility. The -a analyze option is equivalent to the
&quot;Scan Log- file&quot; command in the browser. The log
file is scanned for audit mes- sages, analysis is performed,
alerts generated, and then written to stdout.</p>

<p>LOG FILE SCANNING You may ask sealert to parse a file
accumulating all the audit messages it finds in that file.
As each audit event is recognized it is pre- sented for
analysis which may generate an alert report if the analysis
was successful. If the same type of event is seen multiple
times resulting in the same report the results are coalesced
into a single report. The report count field will indicate
the number of times the tool thought it saw the same issue.
The report will also include a list of every line number on
which it found an audit record which con- tributed to the
coalesced report. This will allow you to coordinate the
contents of the file with the analysis results if need
be.</p>

<p>Log file scanning may be initiated from the sealert
browser via the File::ScanLogFile menu or from the command
line via sealert -a file- name . Please note that sealert
runs as a user level process with the permissions of the
user running it. Many system log files are readable by root
only. To work around this if you have root access one can
copy the file as root to a temporary file and change it s
permissions. This is a good solution when scanning via the
GUI as a normal user. Or you might consider suing to root
and run the analysis via the command line (e.g. sealert -a
filename).</p>

<p>The audit records in the log file must be valid
syntactically correct audit messages or the parser will
ignore them.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b --browser Launch the browser</p>

<p>-f --fix Execute the fix command for the avc with the
given uuid and plu- gin, requires --plugin option.</p>

<p>-h --help Show this message</p>

<p>-s --service Start sealert service, Usually used by
dbus.</p>

<p>-S --noservice Start sealert without dbus service as
stand alone app</p>

<p>-l --lookupid id Lookup alert by id, if id is wildcard *
then return all alerts</p>

<p>-a --analyze file Scan a log file, analyze its AVCs</p>

<p>-u --user logon as user</p>

<p>-p --password set user password</p>

<p>-P --plugin Set plugin name associated with the --fix
option</p>
