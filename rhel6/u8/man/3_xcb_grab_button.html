<p>xcb_grab_button(3) XCB Requests xcb_grab_button(3)</p>

<p>NAME xcb_grab_button - Grab pointer button(s)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</p>

<p>Request function xcb_void_cookie_t
xcb_grab_button(xcb_connection_t *conn, uint8_t
owner_events, xcb_window_t grab_window, uint16_t event_mask,
uint8_t pointer_mode, uint8_t keyboard_mode, xcb_window_t
confine_to, xcb_cursor_t cursor, uint8_t button, uint16_t
modifiers);</p>

<p>REQUEST ARGUMENTS conn The XCB connection to X11.</p>

<p>owner_events If 1, the grab_window will still get the
pointer events. If 0, events are not reported to the
grab_window.</p>

<p>grab_window Specifies the window on which the pointer
should be grabbed.</p>

<p>event_mask Specifies which pointer events are reported
to the client.</p>

<p>TODO: which values?</p>

<p>pointer_mode One of the following values:</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_MODE_SYNC The state of the keyboard appears to
freeze: No further keyboard events are generated by the
server until the grabbing client issues a releasing Allow-
Events request or until the keyboard grab is re- leased.</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC Keyboard event processing continues
normally.</p>

<p>keyboard_mode One of the following values:</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_MODE_SYNC The state of the keyboard appears to
freeze: No further keyboard events are generated by the
server until the grabbing client issues a releasing Allow-
Events request or until the keyboard grab is re- leased.</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC Keyboard event processing continues
normally.</p>

<p>confine_to Specifies the window to confine the pointer
in (the user will not be able to move the pointer out of
that window).</p>

<p>The special value XCB_NONE means don t confine the
pointer.</p>

<p>cursor Specifies the cursor that should be displayed or
XCB_NONE to not change the cursor.</p>

<p>button One of the following values:</p>

<p>XCB_BUTTON_INDEX_ANY Any of the following (or none):</p>

<p>XCB_BUTTON_INDEX_1 The left mouse button.</p>

<p>XCB_BUTTON_INDEX_2 The right mouse button.</p>

<p>XCB_BUTTON_INDEX_3 The middle mouse button.</p>

<p>XCB_BUTTON_INDEX_4 Scroll wheel. TODO: direction?</p>

<p>XCB_BUTTON_INDEX_5 Scroll wheel. TODO: direction?</p>

<p>modifiers The modifiers to grab.</p>

<p>Using the special value XCB_MOD_MASK_ANY means grab the
pointer with all possible modifier combinations.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This request establishes a passive grab. The
pointer is actively grabbed as described in GrabPointer, the
last-pointer-grab time is set to the time at which the
button was pressed (as transmitted in the But- tonPress
event), and the ButtonPress event is reported if all of the
following conditions are true:</p>

<p>The pointer is not grabbed and the specified button is
logically pressed when the specified modifier keys are
logically down, and no other buttons or modifier keys are
logically down.</p>

<p>The grab-window contains the pointer.</p>

<p>The confine-to window (if any) is viewable.</p>

<p>A passive grab on the same button/key combination does
not exist on any ancestor of grab-window.</p>

<p>The interpretation of the remaining arguments is the
same as for Grab- Pointer. The active grab is terminated
automatically when the logical state of the pointer has all
buttons released, independent of the logi- cal state of
modifier keys. Note that the logical state of a device (as
seen by means of the protocol) may lag the physical state if
device event processing is frozen. This request overrides
all previous passive grabs by the same client on the same
button/key combinations on the same window. A modifier of
AnyModifier is equivalent to issuing the re- quest for all
possible modifier combinations (including the combination of
no modifiers). It is not required that all specified
modifiers have currently assigned keycodes. A button of
AnyButton is equivalent to is- suing the request for all
possible buttons. Otherwise, it is not re- quired that the
button specified currently be assigned to a physical
button.</p>

<p>An Access error is generated if some other client has
already issued a GrabButton request with the same button/key
combination on the same window. When using AnyModifier or
AnyButton, the request fails com- pletely (no grabs are
established), and an Access error is generated if there is a
conflicting grab for any combination. The request has no ef-
fect on an active grab.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if
any) have to be handled in the event loop.</p>

<p>If you want to handle errors directly with
xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_grab_button_checked. See
xcb-requests(3) for details.</p>

<p>ERRORS xcb_access_error_t Another client has already
issued a GrabButton with the same button/key combination on
the same window.</p>

<p>xcb_cursor_error_t The specified cursor does not
exist.</p>

<p>xcb_value_error_t TODO: reasons?</p>

<p>xcb_window_error_t The specified window does not
exist.</p>
