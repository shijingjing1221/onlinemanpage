<p>WMEMCMP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WMEMCMP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wmemcmp - compare wide characters in memory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>int wmemcmp(const wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2,
size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wmemcmp() function shall compare the
first n wide characters of the object pointed to by ws1 to
the first n wide characters of the object pointed to by ws2.
This function shall not be affected by locale and all
wchar_t values shall be treated identically. The null wide
charac- ter and wchar_t values not corresponding to valid
characters shall not be treated specially.</p>

<p>If n is zero, the application shall ensure that ws1 and
ws2 are valid pointers, and the function shall behave as if
the two objects compare equal.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wmemcmp() function shall return an
integer greater than, equal to, or less than zero,
respectively, as the object pointed to by ws1 is greater
than, equal to, or less than the object pointed to by
ws2.</p>
