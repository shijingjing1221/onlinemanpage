<p>NAME XmClipboardEndRetrieve A clipboard function that
completes retrieval of data from the clipboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardEndRetrieve (display, window) Display * display;
Window window; (void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardEndRetrieve suspends copying data
incrementally from the clipboard. It tells the clipboard
routines that the application is through copying an item
from the clipboard. Until this function is called, data
items can be retrieved incrementally from the clipboard with
XmClipboardRetrieve. The act of copying data is started with
the XmClipboardStartRetrieve function.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window ID of a widget that relates
the applica- tion window to the clipboard. The widgets
window ID can be obtained with XtWindow. The same
application instance should pass the same window ID to each
of the clipboard functions that it calls.</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardSuccess The function was
successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>
