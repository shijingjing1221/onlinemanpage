<p>SEEKDIR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SEEKDIR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME seekdir - set the position of a directory
stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;</p>

<p>void seekdir(DIR *dirp, long loc);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The seekdir() function shall set the
position of the next readdir() operation on the directory
stream specified by dirp to the position specified by loc.
The value of loc should have been returned from an earlier
call to telldir(). The new position reverts to the one
associ- ated with the directory stream when telldir() was
performed.</p>

<p>If the value of loc was not obtained from an earlier
call to telldir(), or if a call to rewinddir() occurred
between the call to telldir() and the call to seekdir(), the
results of subsequent calls to readdir() are
unspecified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The seekdir() function shall not return a
value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The original standard developers perceived
that there were restrictions on the use of the seekdir() and
telldir() functions related to imple- mentation details, and
for that reason these functions need not be sup- ported on
all POSIX-conforming systems. They are required on implemen-
tations supporting the XSI extension.</p>

<p>One of the perceived problems of implementation is that
returning to a given point in a directory is quite difficult
to describe formally, in spite of its intuitive appeal, when
systems that use B-trees, hashing functions, or other
similar mechanisms to order their directories are
considered. The definition of seekdir() and telldir() does
not specify whether, when using these interfaces, a given
directory entry will be seen at all, or more than once.</p>

<p>On systems not supporting these functions, their
capability can some- times be accomplished by saving a
filename found by readdir() and later using rewinddir() and
a loop on readdir() to relocate the position from which the
filename was saved.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
