Please contribute to the initial review in Mozilla NSS bug
836477[1]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Signing Tool, signtool, creates digital
signatures and uses a Java Archive (JAR) file to associate
the signatures with files in a directory. Electronic
software distribution over any network involves potential
security problems. To help address some of these problems,
you can associate digital signatures with the files in a JAR
archive. Digital signatures allow SSL-enabled clients to
perform two important operations:</p>

<p>* Confirm the identity of the individual, company, or
other entity whose digital signature is associated with the
files</p>

<p>* Check whether the files have been tampered with since
being signed</p>

<p>If you have a signing certificate, you can use Netscape
Signing Tool to digitally sign files and package them as a
JAR file. An object-signing certificate is a special kind of
certificate that allows you to associate your digital
signature with one or more files.</p>

<p>An individual file can potentially be signed with
multiple digital signatures. For example, a commercial
software developer might sign the files that constitute a
software product to prove that the files are indeed from a
particular company. A network administrator manager might
sign the same files with an additional digital signature
based on a company-generated certificate to indicate that
the product is approved for use within the company.</p>

<p>The significance of a digital signature is comparable to
the significance of a handwritten signature. Once you have
signed a file, it is difficult to claim later that you
didn&rsquo;t sign it. In some situations, a digital
signature may be considered as legally binding as a
handwritten signature. Therefore, you should take great care
to ensure that you can stand behind any file you sign and
distribute.</p>

<p>For example, if you are a software developer, you should
test your code to make sure it is virus-free before signing
it. Similarly, if you are a network administrator, you
should make sure, before signing any code, that it comes
from a reliable source and will run correctly with the
software installed on the machines to which you are
distributing it.</p>

<p>Before you can use Netscape Signing Tool to sign files,
you must have an object-signing certificate, which is a
special certificate whose associated private key is used to
create digital signatures. For testing purposes only, you
can create an object-signing certificate with Netscape
Signing Tool 1.3. When testing is finished and you are ready
to disitribute your software, you should obtain an
object-signing certificate from one of two kinds of
sources:</p>

<p>* An independent certificate authority (CA) that
authenticates your identity and charges you a fee. You
typically get a certificate from an independent CA if you
want to sign software that will be distributed over the
Internet.</p>

<p>* CA server software running on your corporate intranet
or extranet. Netscape Certificate Management System provides
a complete management solution for creating, deploying, and
managing certificates, including CAs that issue
object-signing certificates.</p>

<p>You must also have a certificate for the CA that issues
your signing certificate before you can sign files. If the
certificate authority&rsquo;s certificate isn&rsquo;t
already installed in your copy of Communicator, you
typically install it by clicking the appropriate link on the
certificate authority&rsquo;s web site, for example on the
page from which you initiated enrollment for your signing
certificate. This is the case for some test certificates, as
well as certificates issued by Netscape Certificate
Management System: you must download the the CA certificate
in addition to obtaining your own signing certificate. CA
certificates for several certificate authorities are
preinstalled in the Communicator certificate database.</p>

<p>When you receive an object-signing certificate for your
own use, it is automatically installed in your copy of the
Communicator client software. Communicator supports the
public-key cryptography standard known as PKCS #12, which
governs key portability. You can, for example, move an
object-signing certificate and its associated private key
from one computer to another on a credit-card-sized device
called a smart card.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b basename Specifies the base filename for the
.rsa and .sf files in the META-INF directory to conform with
the JAR format. For example, -b signatures causes the files
to be named signatures.rsa and signatures.sf. The default is
signtool.</p>

<p>-c# Specifies the compression level for the -J or -Z
option. The symbol # represents a number from 0 to 9, where
0 means no compression and 9 means maximum compression. The
higher the level of compression, the smaller the output but
the longer the operation takes. If the -c# option is not
used with either the -J or the -Z option, the default
compression value used by both the -J and -Z options is
6.</p>

<p>-d certdir Specifies your certificate database
directory; that is, the directory in which you placed your
key3.db and cert7.db files. To specify the current
directory, use &quot;-d.&quot; (including the period). The
Unix version of signtool assumes ~/.netscape unless told
otherwise. The NT version of signtool always requires the
use of the -d option to specify where the database files are
located.</p>

<p>-e extension Tells signtool to sign only files with the
given extension; for example, use -e&quot;.class&quot; to
sign only Java class files. Note that with Netscape Signing
Tool version 1.1 and later this option can appear multiple
times on one command line, making it possible to specify
multiple file types or classes to include.</p>

<p>-f commandfile Specifies a text file containing Netscape
Signing Tool options and arguments in keyword=value format.
All options and arguments can be expressed through this
file. For more information about the syntax used with this
file, see &quot;Tips and Techniques&quot;.</p>

<p>-G nickname Generates a new private-public key pair and
corresponding object-signing certificate with the given
nickname. The newly generated keys and certificate are
installed into the key and certificate databases in the
directory specified by the -d option. With the NT version of
Netscape Signing Tool, you must use the -d option with the
-G option. With the Unix version of Netscape Signing Tool,
omitting the -d option causes the tool to install the keys
and certificate in the Communicator key and certificate
databases. If you are installing the keys and certificate in
the Communicator databases, you must exit Communicator
before using this option; otherwise, you risk corrupting the
databases. In all cases, the certificate is also output to a
file named x509.cacert, which has the MIME-type
application/x-x509-ca-cert. Unlike certificates normally
used to sign finished code to be distributed over a network,
a test certificate created with -G is not signed by a
recognized certificate authority. Instead, it is
self-signed. In addition, a single test signing certificate
functions as both an object-signing certificate and a CA.
When you are using it to sign objects, it behaves like an
object-signing certificate. When it is imported into browser
software such as Communicator, it behaves like an
object-signing CA and cannot be used to sign objects. The -G
option is available in Netscape Signing Tool 1.0 and later
versions only. By default, it produces only RSA certificates
with 1024-byte keys in the internal token. However, you can
use the -s option specify the required key size and the -t
option to specify the token.</p>

<p>-i scriptname Specifies the name of an installer script
for SmartUpdate. This script installs files from the JAR
archive in the local system after SmartUpdate has validated
the digital signature. For more details, see the description
of -m that follows. The -i option provides a straightforward
way to provide this information if you don&rsquo;t need to
specify any metadata other than an installer script.</p>

<p>-J Signs a directory of HTML files containing JavaScript
and creates as many archive files as are specified in the
HTML tags. Even if signtool creates more than one archive
file, you need to supply the key database password only
once. The -J option is available only in Netscape Signing
Tool 1.0 and later versions. The -J option cannot be used at
the same time as the -Z option. If the -c# option is not
used with the -J option, the default compression value is 6.
Note that versions 1.1 and later of Netscape Signing Tool
correctly recognizes the CODEBASE attribute, allows paths to
be expressed for the CLASS and SRC attributes instead of
filenames only, processes LINK tags and parses HTML
correctly, and offers clearer error messages.</p>

<p>-j directory Specifies a special JavaScript directory.
This option causes the specified directory to be signed and
tags its entries as inline JavaScript. This special type of
entry does not have to appear in the JAR file itself.
Instead, it is located in the HTML page containing the
inline scripts. When you use signtool -v, these entries are
displayed with the string NOT PRESENT.</p>

<p>-k key ... directory Specifies the nickname (key) of the
certificate you want to sign with and signs the files in the
specified directory. The directory to sign is always
specified as the last command-line argument. Thus, it is
possible to write signtool -k MyCert -d . signdir You may
have trouble if the nickname contains a single quotation
mark. To avoid problems, escape the quotation mark using the
escape conventions for your platform. It&rsquo;s also
possible to use the -k option without signing any files or
specifying a directory. For example, you can use it with the
-l option to get detailed information about a particular
signing certificate.</p>

<p>-l Lists signing certificates, including issuing CAs. If
any of your certificates are expired or invalid, the list
will so specify. This option can be used with the -k option
to list detailed information about a particular signing
certificate. The -l option is available in Netscape Signing
Tool 1.0 and later versions only.</p>

<p>-L Lists the certificates in your database. An asterisk
appears to the left of the nickname for any certificate that
can be used to sign objects with signtool.</p>

<p>--leavearc Retains the temporary .arc (archive)
directories that the -J option creates. These directories
are automatically erased by default. Retaining the temporary
directories can be an aid to debugging.</p>

<p>-m metafile Specifies the name of a metadata control
file. Metadata is signed information attached either to the
JAR archive itself or to files within the archive. This
metadata can be any ASCII string, but is used mainly for
specifying an installer script. The metadata file contains
one entry per line, each with three fields: field #1: file
specification, or + if you want to specify global metadata
(that is, metadata about the JAR archive itself or all
entries in the archive) field #2: the name of the data you
are specifying; for example: Install-Script field #3: data
corresponding to the name in field #2 For example, the -i
option uses the equivalent of this line: + Install-Script:
script.js This example associates a MIME type with a file:
movie.qt MIME-Type: video/quicktime For information about
the way installer script information appears in the manifest
file for a JAR archive, see The JAR Format on Netscape
DevEdge.</p>

<p>-M Lists the PKCS #11 modules available to signtool,
including smart cards. The -M option is available in
Netscape Signing Tool 1.0 and later versions only. For
information on using Netscape Signing Tool with smart cards,
see &quot;Using Netscape Signing Tool with Smart
Cards&quot;. For information on using the -M option to
verify FIPS-140-1 validated mode, see &quot;Netscape Signing
Tool and FIPS-140-1&quot;.</p>

<p>--norecurse Blocks recursion into subdirectories when
signing a directory&rsquo;s contents or when parsing
HTML.</p>

<p>-o Optimizes the archive for size. Use this only if you
are signing very large archives containing hundreds of
files. This option makes the manifest files (required by the
JAR format) considerably smaller, but they contain slightly
less information.</p>

<p>--outfile outputfile Specifies a file to receive
redirected output from Netscape Signing Tool.</p>

<p>-p password Specifies a password for the private-key
database. Note that the password entered on the command line
is displayed as plain text.</p>

<p>-s keysize Specifies the size of the key for generated
certificate. Use the -M option to find out what tokens are
available. The -s option can be used with the -G option
only.</p>

<p>-t token Specifies which available token should generate
the key and receive the certificate. Use the -M option to
find out what tokens are available. The -t option can be
used with the -G option only.</p>

<p>-v archive Displays the contents of an archive and
verifies the cryptographic integrity of the digital
signatures it contains and the files with which they are
associated. This includes checking that the certificate for
the issuer of the object-signing certificate is listed in
the certificate database, that the CA&rsquo;s digital
signature on the object-signing certificate is valid, that
the relevant certificates have not expired, and so on.</p>

<p>--verbosity value Sets the quantity of information
Netscape Signing Tool generates in operation. A value of 0
(zero) is the default and gives full information. A value of
-1 suppresses most messages, but not error messages.</p>

<p>-w archive Displays the names of signers of any files in
the archive.</p>

<p>-x directory Excludes the specified directory from
signing. Note that with Netscape Signing Tool version 1.1
and later this option can appear multiple times on one
command line, making it possible to specify several
particular directories to exclude.</p>

<p>-z Tells signtool not to store the signing time in the
digital signature. This option is useful if you want the
expiration date of the signature checked against the current
date and time rather than the time the files were
signed.</p>

<p>-Z jarfile Creates a JAR file with the specified name.
You must specify this option if you want signtool to create
the JAR file; it does not do so automatically. If you
don&rsquo;t specify -Z, you must use an external ZIP tool to
create the JAR file. The -Z option cannot be used at the
same time as the -J option. If the -c# option is not used
with the -Z option, the default compression value is 6.</p>

<p>THE COMMAND FILE FORMAT Entries in a Netscape Signing
Tool command file have this general format: keyword=value
Everything before the = sign on a single line is a keyword,
and everything from the = sign to the end of line is a
value. The value may include = signs; only the first = sign
on a line is interpreted. Blank lines are ignored, but white
space on a line with keywords and values is assumed to be
part of the keyword (if it comes before the equal sign) or
part of the value (if it comes after the first equal sign).
Keywords are case insensitive, values are generally case
sensitive. Since the = sign and newline delimit the value,
it should not be quoted.</p>

test.f</p>

<p>Using Netscape Signing Tool with a ZIP Utility</p>

<p>To use Netscape Signing Tool with a ZIP utility, you
must have the utility in your path environment variable. You
should use the zip.exe utility rather than pkzip.exe, which
cannot handle long filenames. You can use a ZIP utility
instead of the -Z option to package a signed archive into a
JAR file after you have signed it:</p>

<p>cd signdir</p>

<p>zip -r ../myjar.jar * adding: META-INF/ (stored 0%)
adding: META-INF/manifest.mf (deflated 15%) adding:
META-INF/signtool.sf (deflated 28%) adding:
META-INF/signtool.rsa (stored 0%) adding: text.txt (stored
0%)</p>

<p>Generating the Keys and Certificate</p>

<p>The signtool option -G generates a new public-private
key pair and certificate. It takes the nickname of the new
certificate as an argument. The newly generated keys and
certificate are installed into the key and certificate
databases in the directory specified by the -d option. With
the NT version of Netscape Signing Tool, you must use the -d
option with the -G option. With the Unix version of Netscape
Signing Tool, omitting the -d option causes the tool to
install the keys and certificate in the Communicator key and
certificate databases. In all cases, the certificate is also
output to a file named x509.cacert, which has the MIME-type
application/x-x509-ca-cert.</p>

<p>Certificates contain standard information about the
entity they identify, such as the common name and
organization name. Netscape Signing Tool prompts you for
this information when you run the command with the -G
option. However, all of the requested fields are optional
for test certificates. If you do not enter a common name,
the tool provides a default name. In the following example,
the user input is in boldface:</p>

<p>signtool -G MyTestCert</p>

<p>using certificate directory: /u/someuser/.netscape Enter
certificate information. All fields are optional. Acceptable
characters are numbers, letters, spaces, and apostrophes.
certificate common name: Test Object Signing Certificate
organization: Netscape Communications Corp. organization
unit: Server Products Division state or province: California
country (must be exactly 2 characters): US username:
someuser email address: someuser@netscape.com Enter Password
or Pin for &quot;Communicator Certificate DB&quot;:
[Password will not echo] generated public/private key pair
certificate request generated certificate has been signed
certificate &quot;MyTestCert&quot; added to database
Exported certificate to x509.raw and x509.cacert.</p>

<p>The certificate information is read from standard input.
Therefore, the information can be read from a file using the
redirection operator (&lt;) in some operating systems. To
create a file for this purpose, enter each of the seven
input fields, in order, on a separate line. Make sure there
is a newline character at the end of the last line. Then run
signtool with standard input redirected from your file as
follows:</p>

<p>signtool -G MyTestCert inputfile</p>

<p>The prompts show up on the screen, but the responses
will be automatically read from the file. The password will
still be read from the console unless you use the -p option
to give the password on the command line.</p>

<p>Using the -M Option to List Smart Cards</p>

<p>You can use the -M option to list the PKCS #11 modules,
including smart cards, that are available to signtool:</p>

<p>signtool -d &quot;c:0tscapesersjsmith&quot; -M</p>

<p>using certificate directory: c:0tscapeserssername

<p>Using Netscape Signing Tool and a Smart Card to Sign
Files</p>

<p>The signtool command normally takes an argument of the
-k option to specify a signing certificate. To sign with a
smart card, you supply only the fully qualified name of the
certificate.</p>

<p>To see fully qualified certificate names when you run
Communicator, click the Security button in Navigator, then
click Yours under Certificates in the left frame. Fully
qualified names are of the format smart card:certificate,
for example &quot;MyCard:My Signing Cert&quot;. You use this
name with the -k argument as follows:</p>

<p>signtool -k &quot;MyCard:My Signing Cert&quot;
directory</p>

<p>Verifying FIPS Mode</p>

<p>Use the -M option to verify that you are using the
FIPS-140-1 module.</p>

<p>signtool -d &quot;c:0tscapesersjsmith&quot; -M</p>

<p>using certificate directory: c:0tscapesersjsmith Listing
