<p>XkbAllocDeviceInfo(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbAllocDeviceInfo(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbAllocDeviceInfo - Obtain an XkbDeviceInfoRec
structure</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS XkbDeviceInfoPtr XkbAllocDeviceInfo (unsigned
int device_spec, unsigned int n_buttons, unsigned int
sz_leds);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - device_spec device ID with which structure
will be used</p>

<p>- n_buttons number of button actions to allocate space
for</p>

<p>- sz_leds number of LED feedbacks to allocate space
for</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XkbAllocDeviceInfo allocates space for an
XkbDeviceInfoRec structure and initializes that structures
device_spec field with the device ID specified by
device_spec. If n_buttons is nonzero, n_buttons XkbAc- tions
are linked into the XkbDeviceInfoRec structure and
initialized to zero. If sz_leds is nonzero, sz_leds
XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structures are also allocated and linked
into the XkbDeviceInfoRec structure. If you request
XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structures be allocated using this
request, you must initialize them explicitly.</p>

<p>To obtain an XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structure, use
XkbAllocDeviceLedInfo.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES Information about X Input Extension devices
is transferred between a client program and the Xkb
extension in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure:</p>

<p>typedef struct { char * name; / name for device */ Atom
type; / name for class of devices */ unsigned short
device_spec; / device of interest */ Bool has_own_state; /
True=&gt;this device has its own state */ unsigned short
supported; / bits indicating supported capabilities */
unsigned short unsupported; / bits indicating unsupported
capabilities */ unsigned short num_btns; / number of entries
in btn_acts */ XkbAction * btn_acts; / button actions */
unsigned short sz_leds; / total number of entries in LEDs
vector */ unsigned short num_leds; / number of valid entries
in LEDs vector */ unsigned short dflt_kbd_fb; / input
extension ID of default (core kbd) indicator */ unsigned
short dflt_led_fb; / input extension ID of default indicator
feedback */ XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr leds; / LED descriptions */
} XkbDeviceInfoRec, *XkbDeviceInfoPtr;</p>

<p>typedef struct { unsigned short led_class; / class for
this LED device*/ unsigned short led_id; / ID for this LED
device */ unsigned int phys_indicators; / bits for which
LEDs physically present */ unsigned int maps_present; / bits
for which LEDs have maps in maps */ unsigned int
names_present; / bits for which LEDs are in names */
unsigned int state; / 1 bit =&gt; corresponding LED is on */
Atom names[XkbNumIndicators]; / names for LEDs */
XkbIndicatorMapRec maps; / indicator maps for each LED */ }
