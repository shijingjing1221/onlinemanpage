<p>REMOVEXATTR(2) System calls REMOVEXATTR(2)</p>

<p>NAME removexattr, lremovexattr, fremovexattr - remove an
extended attribute</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;attr/xattr.h&gt;</p>

<p>int removexattr (const char *path, const char *name);
int lremovexattr (const char *path, const char *name); int
fremovexattr (int filedes, const char *name);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Extended attributes are name:value pairs
associated with inodes (files, directories, symlinks, etc).
They are extensions to the normal attributes which are
associated with all inodes in the system (i.e. the stat(2)
data). A complete overview of extended attributes concepts
can be found in attr(5).</p>

<p>removexattr removes the extended attribute identified by
name and asso- ciated with the given path in the
filesystem.</p>

<p>lremovexattr is identical to removexattr, except in the
case of a sym- bolic link, where the extended attribute is
removed from the link itself, not the file that it refers
to.</p>

<p>fremovexattr is identical to removexattr, only the
extended attribute is removed from the open file pointed to
by filedes (as returned by open(2)) in place of path.</p>

<p>An extended attribute name is a simple NULL-terminated
string. The name includes a namespace prefix - there may be
several, disjoint namespaces associated with an individual
inode.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On failure,
-1 is returned and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>If the named attribute does not exist, errno is set to
ENOATTR.</p>

<p>If extended attributes are not supported by the
filesystem, or are dis- abled, errno is set to ENOTSUP.</p>

<p>The errors documented for the stat(2) system call are
also applicable here.</p>
