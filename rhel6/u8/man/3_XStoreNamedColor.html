<p>XStoreColors(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XStoreColors(3)</p>

<p>NAME XStoreColors, XStoreColor, XStoreNamedColor - set
colors</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XStoreColors(Display *display, Colormap
colormap, XColor color[], int ncolors);</p>

<p>int XStoreColor(Display *display, Colormap colormap,
XColor *color);</p>

<p>int XStoreNamedColor(Display *display, Colormap
colormap, char *color, unsigned long pixel, int flags);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS color Specifies the pixel and RGB values or
the color name string (for example, red).</p>

<p>color Specifies an array of color definition structures
to be stored.</p>

<p>colormap Specifies the colormap.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>flags Specifies which red, green, and blue components
are set.</p>

<p>ncolors Specifies the number of XColor structures in the
color defi- nition array.</p>

<p>pixel Specifies the entry in the colormap.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XStoreColors function changes the
colormap entries of the pixel values specified in the pixel
members of the XColor structures. You specify which color
components are to be changed by setting DoRed, DoGreen,
and/or DoBlue in the flags member of the XColor structures.
If the colormap is an installed map for its screen, the
changes are visible immediately. XStoreColors changes the
specified pixels if they are allocated writable in the
colormap by any client, even if one or more pixels generates
an error. If a specified pixel is not a valid index into the
colormap, a BadValue error results. If a specified pixel
either is unallocated or is allocated read-only, a BadAccess
error results. If more than one pixel is in error, the one
that gets reported is arbitrary.</p>

<p>XStoreColors can generate BadAccess, BadColor, and
BadValue errors.</p>

<p>The XStoreColor function changes the colormap entry of
the pixel value specified in the pixel member of the XColor
structure. You specified this value in the pixel member of
the XColor structure. This pixel value must be a read/write
cell and a valid index into the colormap. If a specified
pixel is not a valid index into the colormap, a BadValue
error results. XStoreColor also changes the red, green,
and/or blue color components. You specify which color
components are to be changed by setting DoRed, DoGreen,
and/or DoBlue in the flags member of the XColor structure.
If the colormap is an installed map for its screen, the
changes are visible immediately.</p>

<p>XStoreColor can generate BadAccess, BadColor, and
BadValue errors.</p>

<p>The XStoreNamedColor function looks up the named color
with respect to the screen associated with the colormap and
stores the result in the specified colormap. The pixel
argument determines the entry in the colormap. The flags
argument determines which of the red, green, and blue
components are set. You can set this member to the bitwise
inclu- sive OR of the bits DoRed, DoGreen, and DoBlue. If
the color name is not in the Host Portable Character
Encoding, the result is implementa- tion-dependent. Use of
uppercase or lowercase does not matter. If the specified
pixel is not a valid index into the colormap, a BadValue
error results. If the specified pixel either is unallocated
or is allocated read-only, a BadAccess error results.</p>

<p>XStoreNamedColor can generate BadAccess, BadColor,
BadName, and Bad- Value errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAccess A client attempted to free a color
map entry that it did not already allocate.</p>

<p>BadAccess A client attempted to store into a read-only
color map entry.</p>

<p>BadColor A value for a Colormap argument does not name a
defined Col- ormap.</p>

<p>BadName A font or color of the specified name does not
exist.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>
