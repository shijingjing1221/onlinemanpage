<p>NAME resolver - DNS client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/resolv.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The resolver is the DNS client used on most
Linux and BSD systems. It comes with glibc. Its
configuration file /etc/resolv.conf (note the spelling)
determines the DNS servers to use, and various other options
- see below.</p>

<p>Almost all machines have a DNS server set up in this
file - if it doesnt exist, the system will assume theres a
DNS server running on the local machine, and work out the
search path from the machines domain name.</p>

<p>The config file is read the first time the DNS client is
invoked by a process.</p>

<p>The different configuration options are:</p>

<p>nameserver IP address of a DNS server to use. Multiple
name servers may be listed, each on their own line. The
resolver will use them in order listed - if the first server
times out answering the query, the next server will be
tried, and so on. If the resolver runs out out of name
servers, the first server will be queried again, until a
maximum number of retries are made.</p>

<p>The maximum number of DNS servers to use is set by MAXNS
(see &lt;resolv.h&gt; )</p>

<p>search Domain(s) to use for DNS lookups when no domain
is specified. List each domain following the search keyword
with spaces or tabs between them. Each possible domain will
be checked in order until a match is found. Note that this
process may be slow (queries will time out if no server is
available for a domain) and will generate a lot of network
traffic if the servers for the listed domains arent
local.</p>

<p>The search list is currently limited to six domains with
a total of 256 characters. If search isn t specified, the
search list will be determined from the local domain name
(whatever comes after the first dot). If the host name
doesnt contain a domain, the root domain is used.</p>

<p>By default, it search contains only the local domain
name.</p>

<p>domain Local domain name. You can use this instead of
the search option to specify a single domain to check if a
hostname isnt specified. Most people just use search instead
(that option lets you use multiple servers, domain doesnt).
You cant use domain and search at the same time - theyre
mutu- ally exclusive.</p>

<p>If domain isn t specified, the domain will be determined
from the local domain name (whatever comes after the first
dot). If the host name doesnt contain a domain, the root
domain is used.</p>

<p>sortlist Sorts addresses returned by the gethostbyname
system call. A sortlist is specified by IP address netmask
pairs. The net- mask is optional and defaults to the natural
netmask of the net. The IP address and optional network
pairs are separated by slashes. Up to 10 pairs may be
specified. For example:</p>

<p>sortlist 130.155.160.0/255.255.240.0 130.155.0.0</p>

<p>options Allows certain internal resolver variables to be
modified. The syntax is options option ... where option is
one of the following:</p>

<p>debug sets RES_DEBUG in _res.options.</p>

<p>ndots:n sets a threshold for the number of dots which
must appear in a name given to res_query() (see resolver(3))
before an initial absolute query will be made. The default
for n is 1 , meaning that if there are any dots in a name,
the name will be tried first as an absolute name before any
search list elements are appended to it.</p>

<p>timeout:n sets the amount of time the resolver will wait
for a response from a remote name server before retry- ing
the query via a different name server. Mea- sured in
seconds, the default is RES_TIMEOUT (see &lt;resolv.h&gt;
).</p>

<p>attempts:n sets the number of times the resolver will
send a query to its name servers before giving up and
returning an error to the calling application. The default
is RES_DFLRETRY (see &lt;resolv.h&gt; ).</p>

<p>rotate sets RES_ROTATE in _res.options, which causes
round robin selection of nameservers from among those
listed. This has the effect of spreading the query load
among all listed servers, rather than having all clients try
the first listed server first every time.</p>

<p>no-check-names sets RES_NOCHECKNAME in _res.options,
which dis- ables the modern BIND checking of incoming host
names and mail names for invalid characters such as
underscore (_), non-ASCII, or control characters.</p>

<p>inet6 sets RES_USE_INET6 in _res.options. This has the
effect of trying a AAAA query before an A query inside the
gethostbyname function, and of mapping IPv4 responses in
IPv6 tunnelled form if no AAAA records are found but an A
record set exists.</p>

<p>ip6-dotint / no-ip6-dotint sets / clears the
RES_NOIP6DOTINT bit in _res.options, which when set
(ip6-dotint) will enable reverse IPv6 lookups to be made in
the (dep- recated) ip6.int zone; when clear (no-ip6-dotint),
reverse IPv6 lookups are made in the ip6.arpa zone by
default.</p>

<p>ip6-bytestring sets RES_USEBSTRING in _res.options. This
causes reverse IPv6 lookups to be made using the bit-label
format of RFC 2673; if not set, then nibble format is
used.</p>

<p>The domain and search keywords are mutually exclusive.
If more than one instance of these keywords is present, the
last instance wins.</p>

<p>The search keyword of a systems resolv.conf file can be
overridden on a per-process basis by setting the environment
variable LOCALDOMAIN to a space-separated list of search
domains.</p>

<p>The options keyword of a systems resolv.conf file can be
amended on a per-process basis by setting the environment
variable RES_OPTIONS to a space-separated list of resolver
options as explained above under options.</p>

<p>The keyword and value must appear on a single line, and
the keyword (e.g., nameserver) must start the line. The
value follows the keyword, separated by white space.</p>
