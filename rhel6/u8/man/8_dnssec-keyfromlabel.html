<p>NAME dnssec-keyfromlabel - DNSSEC key generation
tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dnssec-keyfromlabel {-l label} [-3] [-a
algorithm] [-A date/offset] [-c class] [-D date/offset] [-E
engine] [-f flag] [-G] [-I date/offset] [-k] [-K directory]
[-n nametype] [-P date/offset] [-p protocol] [-R
date/offset] [-t type] [-v level] [-y] {name}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dnssec-keyfromlabel gets keys with the given
label from a crypto hardware and builds key files for DNSSEC
(Secure DNS), as defined in RFC 2535 and RFC 4034.</p>

<p>The name of the key is specified on the command line.
This must match the name of the zone for which the key is
being generated.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a algorithm Selects the cryptographic
algorithm. The value of algorithm must be one of RSAMD5,
RSASHA1, DSA, NSEC3RSASHA1, NSEC3DSA, RSASHA256, RSASHA512
or ECCGOST. These values are case insensitive.</p>

<p>If no algorithm is specified, then RSASHA1 will be used
by default, unless the -3 option is specified, in which case
NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used instead. (If -3 is used and an
algorithm is specified, that algorithm will be checked for
compatibility with NSEC3.)</p>

<p>Note 1: that for DNSSEC, RSASHA1 is a mandatory to
implement algorithm, and DSA is recommended.</p>

<p>Note 2: DH automatically sets the -k flag.</p>

<p>-3 Use an NSEC3-capable algorithm to generate a DNSSEC
key. If this option is used and no algorithm is explicitly
set on the command line, NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used by
default.</p>

<p>-E engine Specifies the name of the crypto hardware
(OpenSSL engine). When compiled with PKCS#11 support it
defaults to &quot;pkcs11&quot;.</p>

<p>-l label Specifies the label of the key pair in the
crypto hardware. The label may be preceded by an optional
OpenSSL engine name, separated by a colon, as in
&quot;pkcs11:keylabel&quot;.</p>

<p>-n nametype Specifies the owner type of the key. The
value of nametype must either be ZONE (for a DNSSEC zone key
(KEY/DNSKEY)), HOST or ENTITY (for a key associated with a
host (KEY)), USER (for a key associated with a user(KEY)) or
OTHER (DNSKEY). These values are case insensitive.</p>

<p>-C Compatibility mode: generates an old-style key,
without any metadata. By default, dnssec-keyfromlabel will
include the keys creation date in the metadata stored with
the private key, and other dates may be set there as well
(publication date, activation date, etc). Keys that include
this data may be incompatible with older versions of BIND;
the -C option suppresses them.</p>

<p>-c class Indicates that the DNS record containing the
key should have the specified class. If not specified, class
IN is used.</p>

<p>-f flag Set the specified flag in the flag field of the
KEY/DNSKEY record. The only recognized flags are KSK (Key
Signing Key) and REVOKE.</p>

<p>-G Generate a key, but do not publish it or sign with
it. This option is incompatible with -P and -A.</p>

<p>-h Prints a short summary of the options and arguments
to dnssec-keyfromlabel.</p>

<p>-K directory Sets the directory in which the key files
are to be written.</p>

<p>-k Generate KEY records rather than DNSKEY records.</p>

<p>-p protocol Sets the protocol value for the key. The
protocol is a number between 0 and 255. The default is 3
(DNSSEC). Other possible values for this argument are listed
in RFC 2535 and its successors.</p>

<p>-t type Indicates the use of the key. type must be one
of AUTHCONF, NOAUTHCONF, NOAUTH, or NOCONF. The default is
AUTHCONF. AUTH refers to the ability to authenticate data,
and CONF the ability to encrypt data.</p>

<p>-v level Sets the debugging level.</p>

<p>-y Allows DNSSEC key files to be generated even if the
key ID would collide with that of an existing key, in the
event of either key being revoked. (This is only safe to use
if you are sure you wont be using RFC 5011 trust anchor
maintenance with either of the keys involved.)</p>

<p>TIMING OPTIONS Dates can be expressed in the format
YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the argument begins with a +
or -, it is interpreted as an offset from the present time.
For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one of the
suffixes y, mo, w, d, h, or mi, then the offset is computed
in years (defined as 365 24-hour days, ignoring leap years),
months (defined as 30 24-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or
minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is
computed in seconds.</p>

<p>-P date/offset Sets the date on which a key is to be
published to the zone. After that date, the key will be
included in the zone but will not be used to sign it. If not
set, and if the -G option has not been used, the default is
&quot;now&quot;.</p>

<p>-A date/offset Sets the date on which the key is to be
activated. After that date, the key will be included in the
zone and used to sign it. If not set, and if the -G option
has not been used, the default is &quot;now&quot;.</p>

<p>-R date/offset Sets the date on which the key is to be
revoked. After that date, the key will be flagged as
revoked. It will be included in the zone and will be used to
sign it.</p>

<p>-I date/offset Sets the date on which the key is to be
retired. After that date, the key will still be included in
the zone, but it will not be used to sign it.</p>

<p>-D date/offset Sets the date on which the key is to be
deleted. After that date, the key will no longer be included
in the zone. (It may remain in the key repository,
however.)</p>

<p>GENERATED KEY FILES When dnssec-keyfromlabel completes
successfully, it prints a string of the form
Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii to the standard output. This is an
identification string for the key files it has
generated.</p>

<p>&middot; nnnn is the key name.</p>

<p>&middot; aaa is the numeric representation of the
algorithm.</p>

<p>&middot; iiiii is the key identifier (or footprint).</p>

<p>dnssec-keyfromlabel creates two files, with names based
on the printed string. Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key contains the
public key, and Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private contains the
private key.</p>

<p>The .key file contains a DNS KEY record that can be
inserted into a zone file (directly or with a $INCLUDE
statement).</p>

<p>The .private file contains algorithm-specific fields.
For obvious security reasons, this file does not have
general read permission.</p>
