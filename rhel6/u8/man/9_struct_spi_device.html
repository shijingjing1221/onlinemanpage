<p>STRUCT SPI_DEVICE(9) Serial Peripheral Interface (S
STRUCT SPI_DEVICE(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_spi_device - Master side proxy for an SPI
slave device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct spi_device { struct device dev; struct
spi_master * master; u32 max_speed_hz; u8 chip_select; u8
mode; #define SPI_CPHA 0x01 #define SPI_CPOL 0x02 #define

<p>MEMBERS dev Driver model representation of the
device.</p>

<p>master SPI controller used with the device.</p>

<p>max_speed_hz Maximum clock rate to be used with this
chip (on this board); may be changed by the device&acute;s
driver. The spi_transfer.speed_hz can override this for each
transfer.</p>

<p>chip_select Chipselect, distinguishing chips handled by
master.</p>

<p>mode The spi mode defines how data is clocked out and
in. This may be changed by the device&acute;s driver. The
active low default for chipselect mode can be overridden (by
specifying SPI_CS_HIGH) as can the MSB first default for
each word in a transfer (by specifying SPI_LSB_FIRST).</p>

<p>bits_per_word Data transfers involve one or more words;
word sizes like eight or 12 bits are common. In-memory
wordsizes are powers of two bytes (e.g. 20 bit samples use
32 bits). This may be changed by the device&acute;s driver,
or left at the default (0) indicating protocol words are
eight bit bytes. The spi_transfer.bits_per_word can override
this for each transfer.</p>

<p>irq Negative, or the number passed to request_irq to
receive interrupts from this device.</p>

<p>controller_state Controller&acute;s runtime state</p>

<p>controller_data Board-specific definitions for
controller, such as FIFO initialization parameters; from
board_info.controller_data</p>

<p>modalias[SPI_NAME_SIZE] Name of the driver to use with
this device, or an alias for that name. This appears in the
sysfs modalias attribute for driver coldplugging, and in
uevents used for hotplugging</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A spi_device is used to interchange data
between an SPI slave (usually a discrete chip) and CPU
memory.</p>

<p>In dev, the platform_data is used to hold information
about this device that&acute;s meaningful to the
device&acute;s protocol driver, but not to its controller.
One example might be an identifier for a chip variant with
slightly different functionality; another might be
information about how this particular board wires the
chip&acute;s pins.</p>
