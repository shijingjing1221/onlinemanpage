<p>NAME XmDropSite The DropSite Registry</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/DragDrop.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A client registers a widget or gadget as a
drop site using the XmDrop- SiteRegister function. In
addition, this routine defines the behavior and capabilities
of a drop site by specifying appropriate resources. For
example, the XmNimportTargets and XmNnumImportTargets
resources identify respectively the selection target types
and number of types supported by a drop site. The visual
animation effects associated with a drop site are also
described with DropSite resources.</p>

<p>Drop site animation effects that occur in response to
the pointer entering a valid drop site are called drag-under
effects. A receiver can select from several animation styles
supplied by the toolkit or can provide customized animation
effects. Drag-under effects supplied by the toolkit include
border highlighting, shadow in/out drawing, and pixmap
representation.</p>

<p>When a preregister drag protocol style is used, the
toolkit generates drag-under visual effects based on the
value of the XmNanimationStyle resource. In dynamic mode, if
the drop site XmNdragProc resource is NULL, the toolkit also
provides animation effects based on the XmNani- mationStyle
resource. Otherwise, if the XmNdragProc routine is speci-
fied, the receiver can either assume responsibility for
animation effects (through the XmNdragProc routine) or rely
on the toolkit to provide animation. An application can
either handle all or none of the animation effects for a
particular drop site. That is, an application should never
do a partial job of animation on a particular drop site.</p>

<p>Drop sites may overlap. The initial stacking order
corresponds to the order in which the drop sites were
registered. When a drop site over- laps another drop site,
the drag-under effects of the drop site under- neath are
clipped by the obscuring drop site(s).</p>

<p>The XmDropSiteUpdate routine sets resources for a widget
that is regis- tered as a drop site. XmDropSiteRetrieve gets
drop site resource values previously specified for a
registered widget. These routines are used instead of
XtSetValues and XtGetValues.</p>

<p>Classes XmDropSite does not inherit from any widget
class.</p>

<p>New Resources The following table defines a set of
widget resources used by the pro- grammer to specify data.
To reference a resource by name or by class in a .Xdefaults
file, remove the XmN or XmC prefix and use the remaining
letters. To specify one of the defined values for a resource
in a .Xde- faults file, remove the Xm prefix and use the
remaining letters (in either lowercase or uppercase, but
include any underscores between words). The codes in the
access column indicate if the given resource can be set at
creation time (C), set by using XmDropSiteUpdate (S),
retrieved by using XmDropSiteRetrieve (G), or is not
applicable (N/A).</p>

XmNanimationMask Specifies a mask to use with the pixmap
specified by XmNani- mationPixmap when the animation style
is XmDRAG_UNDER_PIXMAP.</p>

<p>XmNanimationPixmap Specifies a pixmap for drag-under
animation when the anima- tion style is XmDRAG_UNDER_PIXMAP.
The pixmap is drawn with its origin at the upper left corner
of the bounding box of the drop site. If the drop site
window is larger than the animation pixmap, the portion of
the window not covered by the pixmap will be tiled with the
windows background color.</p>

<p>XmNanimationPixmapDepth Specifies the depth of the
pixmap specified by the XmNanima- tionPixmap resource. When
the depth is 1, the colors are taken from the foreground and
background of the drop site widget. For any other value,
drop site animation occurs only if the
XmNanimationPixmapDepth matches the depth of the drop site
window. Colors are derived from the current colormap.</p>

<p>XmNanimationStyle Specifies the drag-under animation
style used when a drag enters a valid drop site. The
possible values are</p>

<p>XmDRAG_UNDER_HIGHLIGHT The drop site uses highlighting
effects.</p>

<p>XmDRAG_UNDER_SHADOW_OUT The drop site uses an outset
shadow.</p>

<p>XmDRAG_UNDER_SHADOW_IN The drop site uses an inset
shadow.</p>

<p>XmDRAG_UNDER_PIXMAP The drop site uses the pixmap
specified by XmNani- mationPixmap to indicate that it can
receive the drop.</p>

<p>XmDRAG_UNDER_NONE The drop site does not use animation
effects. A client using a dynamic protocol, may provide
drag- under effects in its XmNdragProc routine.</p>

<p>XmNdragProc Specifies the procedure that is invoked when
the drop site receives a crossing, motion, or operation
changed message. This procedure is called only when a
dynamic protocol is used. The type of structure whose
address is passed to this procedure is
XmDragProcCallbackStruct. The reason sent to the procedure
is one of the following:</p>

<p>&middot; XmCR_DROP_SITE_ENTER_MESSAGE</p>

<p>&middot; XmCR_DROP_SITE_LEAVE_MESSAGE</p>

<p>&middot; XmCR_DRAG_MOTION</p>

<p>&middot; XmCR_OPERATION_CHANGED</p>

<p>The drag procedure may change the values of some members
of the XmDragProcCallbackStruct passed to it. After the drag
procedure returns, the toolkit uses the final values in ini-
tializing some members of the callback structure passed to
the appropriate callbacks of the initiator (the DragContexts
XmNdropSiteEnterCallback, XmNdropSiteLeaveCallback, XmNdrag-
MotionCallback, or XmNoperationChangedCallback
callbacks).</p>

<p>XmNdropProc Specifies the procedure that is invoked when
a drop (exclud- ing a cancel or interrupt action) occurs on
a drop site regardless of the status of the drop site. The
type of the structure whose address is passed to this
procedure is XmDropProcCallbackStruct. The reason sent to
the procedure is XmCR_DROP_MESSAGE.</p>

<p>The drop procedure may change the values of some members
of the XmDropProcCallbackStruct passed to it. After the drop
procedure returns, the toolkit uses the final values in ini-
tializing some members of the XmDropStartCallbackStruct
passed to the initiators drop start callbacks (the DragCon-
texts XmNdropStartCallback callbacks).</p>

<p>XmNdropRectangles Specifies a list of rectangles that
describe the shape of a drop site. The locations of the
rectangles are relative to the origin of the enclosing
object. When XmNdropRectangles is NULL, the drop site is
assumed to be the sensitive area of the enclosing widget. If
XmNdropSiteType is XmDROP_SITE_COM- POSITE, this resource
cannot be specified by the application.</p>

<p>Retrieving this resource returns allocated memory that
needs to be freed with the XtFree function.</p>

<p>XmNdropSiteActivity Indicates whether a drop site is
active or inactive. The val- ues are XmDROP_SITE_ACTIVE,
XmDROP_SITE_INACTIVE, and XmDROP_SITE_IGNORE. An active drop
site can receive a drop, whereas an inactive drop site is
dormant. An inactive drop site is treated as if it was not a
registered drop site and any drag-under visuals associated
with entering or leaving the drop site do not occur.
However, it is still used for clipping drag-under effects. A
value of XmDROP_SITE_IGNORE indicates that a drop site
should be ignored for all pur- poses.</p>

<p>XmNdropSiteOperations Specifies the set of valid
operations associated with a drop site. This resource is a
bit mask that is formed by combin- ing one or more of the
following values using a bitwise oper- ation such as
inclusive OR (|): XmDROP_COPY, XmDROP_LINK, and XmDROP_MOVE.
The value XmDROP_NOOP for this resource indi- cates that no
operations are valid.</p>

<p>XmNdropSiteType Specifies the type of the drop site. The
possible values are</p>

<p>XmDROP_SITE_SIMPLE The widget does not have any
additional children that are registered as drop sites.</p>

<p>XmDROP_SITE_COMPOSITE The widget will have children that
are registered as drop sites.</p>

<p>XmNimportTargets Specifies the list of target atoms that
this drop site accepts.</p>

<p>XmNnumDropRectangles Specifies the number of rectangles
in the XmNdropRectangles list. If the drop site type is
XmDROP_SITE_COMPOSITE, this resource can not be specified by
the application.</p>

<p>XmNnumImportTargets Specifies the number of atoms in the
target atom list.</p>

<p>Callback Information A pointer to the following
structure is passed to the XmNdragProc rou- tine when the
drop site receives crossing, motion, or operation changed
messages:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int reason; XEvent *event; Time
timeStamp; Widget dragContext; Position x; Position y;
unsigned char dropSiteStatus; unsigned char operation;
unsigned char operations; Boolean animate; }
XmDragProcCallbackStruct, *XmDragProcCallback;</p>

<p>reason Indicates why the callback was invoked.</p>

<p>event Points to the XEvent that triggered the
callback.</p>

<p>timeStamp Specifies the timestamp of the logical
event.</p>

<p>dragContext Specifies the ID of the DragContext widget
associated with the transaction.</p>

<p>x Indicates the x-coordinate of the pointer relative to
the drop site.</p>

<p>y Indicates the y-coordinate of the pointer relative to
the drop site.</p>

<p>dropSiteStatus An IN/OUT member that indicates whether
or not a drop site is valid.</p>

<p>When reason is XmCR_DROP_SITE_ENTER_MESSAGE or
XmCR_OPERA- TION_CHANGED, or reason is XmCR_DRAG_MOTION or
XmCR_DROP_SITE_LEAVE_MESSAGE and the pointer is not in the
same drop site as on the previous invocation of the drag
pro- cedure, the toolkit initializes dropSiteStatus to
XmDROP_SITE_VALID if the DragContext s XmNexportTargets and
the DropSite s XmNimportTargets are compatible and if the
initial value of the operation member is not XmDROP_NOOP.
Otherwise, the toolkit initializes dropSiteStatus to
XmDROP_SITE_INVALID.</p>

<p>When the reason is XmCR_DRAG_MOTION or
XmCR_DROP_SITE_LEAVE_MESSAGE and the pointer is within the
same drop site as on the previous invocation of the drag
pro- cedure, the toolkit initializes dropSiteStatus to the
value of dropSiteStatus at the time the previous invocation
of the drag procedure returns.</p>

<p>The drag procedure may change the value of this member.
After the drag procedure returns, the toolkit uses the final
value in initializing the dropSiteStatus member of the call-
back struct passed to the appropriate callbacks of the ini-
tiator.</p>

<p>operation An IN/OUT member that identifies an
operation.</p>

<p>The toolkit initializes operation by selecting an
operation from the bitwise AND of the initial value of the
operations member and the value of the DropSite s
XmNdropSiteOperations resource. The toolkit searches this
set first for XmDROP_MOVE, then for XmDROP_COPY, then for
XmDROP_LINK, and initializes operation to the first
operation it finds in the set. If the toolkit finds none of
these operations in the set, it initializes operation to
XmDROP_NOOP.</p>

<p>The drag procedure may change the value of this member.
After the drag procedure returns, the toolkit uses the final
value in initializing the operation member of the callback
struct passed to the appropriate callbacks of the
initiator.</p>

<p>operations An IN/OUT member that indicates the set of
operations sup- ported for the source data.</p>

<p>If the user does not select an operation (by pressing a
modi- fier key), the toolkit initializes operations to the
value of the DragContexts XmNdragOperations resource. If the
user does select an operation, the toolkit initializes
operations to the bitwise AND of the corresponding operation
and the value of the DragContext s XmNdragOperations
resource. If the resulting set of operations is empty, the
toolkit ini- tializes operations to XmDROP_NOOP.</p>

<p>The drag procedure may change the value of this member.
After the drag procedure returns, the toolkit uses the final
value in initializing the operations member of the callback
struct passed to the appropriate callbacks of the
initiator.</p>

<p>animate An OUT member that indicates whether the toolkit
or the receiver client provides drag-under effects for a
valid drop site. If animate is set to True, the toolkit
provides drop site animation per the XmNanimationStyle
resource value; if it is set to False, the receiver
generates drag-under anima- tion effects.</p>

<p>A pointer to the following structure is passed to the
XmNdropProc rou- tine when the drop site receives a drop
message:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int reason; XEvent *event; Time
timeStamp; Widget dragContext; Position x; Position y;
unsigned char dropSiteStatus; unsigned char operation;
unsigned char operations; unsigned char dropAction; }
XmDropProcCallbackStruct, *XmDropProcCallback;</p>

<p>reason Indicates why the callback was invoked.</p>

<p>event Specifies the XEvent that triggered the
callback.</p>

<p>timeStamp Specifies the timestamp of the logical
event.</p>

<p>dragContext Specifies the ID of the DragContext widget
associated with the transaction.</p>

<p>x Indicates the x-coordinate of the pointer relative to
the drop site.</p>

<p>y Indicates the y-coordinate of the pointer relative to
the drop site.</p>

<p>dropSiteStatus An IN/OUT member that indicates whether
or not a drop site is valid.</p>

<p>The toolkit initializes dropSiteStatus to
XmDROP_SITE_VALID if the DragContext s XmNexportTargets and
the DropSites XmN- importTargets are compatible and if the
initial value of the operation member is not XmDROP_NOOP.
Otherwise, the toolkit initializes dropSiteStatus to
XmDROP_SITE_INVALID.</p>

<p>The drop procedure may change the value of this member.
After the drop procedure returns, the toolkit uses the final
value in initializing the dropSiteStatus member of the
XmDropStartCallbackStruct passed to the initiators drop
start callbacks (the DragContext s XmNdropStartCallback
call- backs).</p>

<p>operation An IN/OUT member that identifies an
operation.</p>

<p>The toolkit initializes operation by selecting an
operation from the bitwise AND of the initial value of the
operations member and the value of the DropSite s
XmNdropSiteOperations resource. The toolkit searches this
set first for XmDROP_MOVE, then for XmDROP_COPY, then for
XmDROP_LINK, and initializes operation to the first
operation it finds in the set. If it finds none of these
operations in the set, it initializes operation to
XmDROP_NOOP.</p>

<p>The drop procedure may change the value of this member.
After the drop procedure returns, the toolkit uses the final
value in initializing the operation member of the XmDrop-
StartCallbackStruct passed to the initiators drop start
callbacks (the DragContexts XmNdropStartCallback
callbacks).</p>

<p>operations An IN/OUT member that indicates the set of
operations sup- ported for the source data.</p>

<p>If the user does not select an operation (by pressing a
modi- fier key), the toolkit initializes operations to the
value of the DragContext s XmNdragOperations resource. If
the user does select an operation, the toolkit initializes
operations to the bitwise AND of the corresponding operation
and the value of the DragContext s XmNdragOperations
resource. If the resulting set of operations is empty, the
toolkit ini- tializes operations to XmDROP_NOOP.</p>

<p>The drop procedure may change the value of this member.
After the drop procedure returns, the toolkit uses the final
value in initializing the operations member of the XmDrop-
StartCallbackStruct passed to the initiators drop start
callbacks (the DragContexts XmNdropStartCallback
callbacks).</p>

<p>dropAction An IN/OUT member that identifies the action
associated with the drop. The possible values are</p>

<p>XmDROP A drop was attempted. If the drop site is valid,
drop transfer handling proceeds.</p>

<p>XmDROP_HELP The user has requested help on the drop
site.</p>

<p>The drop procedure may change the value of this member.
After the drop procedure returns, the toolkit uses the final
value in initializing the dropAction member of the XmDrop-
StartCallbackStruct passed to the initiators drop start
callbacks (the DragContexts XmNdropStartCallback
callbacks).</p>
