<p>rmic(1) Remote Method Invocation (RMI) Tools rmic(1)</p>

<p>NAME rmic - Generates stub, skeleton, and tie classes
for remote objects that use the Java Remote Method Protocol
(JRMP) or Internet Inter-Orb protocol (IIOP). Also generates
Object Management Group (OMG) Interface Definition Language
(IDL)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rmic [ options ]
package-qualified-class-names</p>

<p>options The command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p>package-qualified-class-names Class names that include
their packages, for example, java.awt.Color.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Deprecation Note: Support for static
generation of Java Remote Method Protocol (JRMP) stubs and
skeletons has been deprecated. Oracle recommends that you
use dynamically generated JRMP stubs instead, eliminating
the need to use this tool for JRMP-based applications. See
the java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject specification at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/rmi/server/UnicastRemoteObject.html
for further information.</p>

<p>The rmic compiler generates stub and skeleton class
files using the Java Remote Method Protocol (JRMP) and stub
and tie class files (IIOP protocol) for remote objects.
These class files are generated from compiled Java
programming language classes that are remote object
implementation classes. A remote implementation class is a
class that implements the interface java.rmi.Remote. The
class names in the rmic command must be for classes that
were compiled successfully with the javac command and must
be fully package qualified. For example, running the rmic
command on the class file name HelloImpl as shown here
creates the HelloImpl_Stub.classfile in the hello
subdirectory (named for the classs package):</p>

<p>rmic hello.HelloImpl</p>

<p>A skeleton for a remote object is a JRMP protocol
server-side entity that has a method that dispatches calls
to the remote object implementation.</p>

<p>A tie for a remote object is a server-side entity
similar to a skeleton, but communicates with the client with
the IIOP protocol.</p>

<p>A stub is a client-side proxy for a remote object that
is responsible for communicating method invocations on
remote objects to the server where the actual remote object
implementation resides. A clients reference to a remote
object, therefore, is actually a reference to a local
stub.</p>

<p>By default, the rmic command generates stub classes that
use the 1.2 JRMP stub protocol version only, as though the
-v1.2 option was specified. The -vcompat option was the
default in releases before 5.0. Use the -iiop option to
generate stub and tie classes for the IIOP protocol. See
Options.</p>

<p>A stub implements only the remote interfaces, and not
any local interfaces that the remote object also implements.
Because a JRMP stub implements the same set of remote
interfaces as the remote object, a client can use the Java
programming language built-in operators for casting and type
checking. For IIOP, the PortableRemoteObject.narrow method
must be used.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -bootclasspath path Overrides the location of
bootstrap class files.</p>

<p>-classpath path Specifies the path the rmic command uses
to look up classes. This option overrides the default or the
CLASSPATH environment variable when it is set. Directories
are separated by colons. The general format for path is:
.:&lt;your_path&gt;, for example:
.:/usr/local/java/classes.</p>

<p>-d directory Specifies the root destination directory
for the generated class hierarchy. You can use this option
to specify a destination directory for the stub, skeleton,
and tie files. For example, the following command places the
stub and skeleton classes derived from MyClass into the
directory /java/classes/exampleclass.</p>

<p>rmic -d /java/classes exampleclass.MyClass</p>

<p>If the -d option is not specified, then the default
behavior is as if -d . was specified. The package hierarchy
of the target class is created in the current directory, and
stub/tie/skeleton files are placed within it. In some
earlier releases of the rmic command, if the -d option was
not specified, then the package hierarchy was not created,
and all of the output files were placed directly in the
current directory.</p>

<p>-extdirs path Overrides the location of installed
extensions.</p>

<p>-g Enables the generation of all debugging information,
including local variables. By default, only line number
information is generated.</p>

<p>-idl Causes the rmic command to generate OMG IDL for the
classes specified and any classes referenced. IDL provides a
purely declarative, programming language-independent way to
specify an API for an object. The IDL is used as a
specification for methods and data that can be written in
and called from any language that provides CORBA bindings.
This includes Java and C++ among others. See Java IDL: IDL
to Java Language Mapping at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/idl/mapping/jidlMapping.html</p>

<p>When the -idl option is used, other options also
include:</p>

<p>&middot; The -always or -alwaysgenerate options force
regeneration even when existing stubs/ties/IDL are newer
than the input class.</p>

<p>&middot; The -factory option uses the factory keyword in
generated IDL.</p>

<p>&middot; The -idlModule from
JavaPackage[.class]toIDLModule specifies IDLEntity package
mapping, for example: -idlModulemy.module
my::real::idlmod.</p>

<p>&middot; -idlFilefromJavaPackage[.class] toIDLFile
specifies IDLEntity file mapping, for example: -idlFile
test.pkg.X TEST16.idl.</p>

<p>-iiop Causes the rmic command to generate IIOP stub and
tie classes, rather than JRMP stub and skeleton classes. A
stub class is a local proxy for a remote object and is used
by clients to send calls to a server. Each remote interface
requires a stub class, which implements that remote
interface. A client reference to a remote object is a
reference to a stub. Tie classes are used on the server side
to process incoming calls, and dispatch the calls to the
proper implementation class. Each implementation class
requires a tie class.</p>

<p>If you call the rmic command with the -iiop, then it
generates stubs and ties that conform to this naming
convention:</p>

<p>_&lt;implementationName&gt;_stub.class
_&lt;interfaceName&gt;_tie.class</p>

<p>&middot; When you use the -iiop option, other options
also include:</p>

<p>&middot; The -always or -alwaysgenerate options force
regeneration even when existing stubs/ties/IDL are newer
than the input class.</p>

<p>&middot; The -nolocalstubs option means do not create
stubs optimized for same-process clients and servers.</p>

<p>&middot; The -noValueMethods option must be used with
the -idl option. The -noValueMethods option prevents the
addition of valuetype methods and initializers to emitted
IDL. These methods and initializers are optional for
valuetypes, and are generated unless the -noValueMethods
option is specified with the -idl option.</p>

<p>&middot; The -poa option changes the inheritance from
org.omg.CORBA_2_3.portable.ObjectImpl to
org.omg.PortableServer.Servant. The PortableServer module
for the Portable Object Adapter (POA) defines the native
Servant type. In the Java programming language, the Servant
type is mapped to the Java org.omg.PortableServer.Servant
class. It serves as the base class for all POA servant
implementations and provides a number of methods that can be
called by the application programmer, and methods that are
called by the POA and that can be overridden by the user to
control aspects of servant behavior. Based on the OMG IDL to
Java Language Mapping Specification, CORBA V 2.3.1
ptc/00-01-08.pdf..RE</p>

<p>-J Used with any Java command, the -J option passes the
argument that follows the -J (no spaces between the -Jand
the argument) to the Java interpreter</p>

<p>-keep or -keepgenerated Retains the generated .java
source files for the stub, skeleton, and tie classes and
writes them to the same directory as the.class files.</p>

<p>-nowarn Turns off warnings. When the -nowarn options is
used. The compiler does not print out any warnings.</p>

<p>-nowrite Does not write compiled classes to the file
system.</p>

<p>-vcompat (deprecated) Generates stub and skeleton
classes that are compatible with both the 1.1 and 1.2 JRMP
stub protocol versions. This option was the default in
releases before 5.0. The generated stub classes use the 1.1
stub protocol version when loaded in a JDK 1.1 virtual
machine and use the 1.2 stub protocol version when loaded
into a 1.2 (or later) virtual machine. The generated
skeleton classes support both 1.1 and 1.2 stub protocol
versions. The generated classes are relatively large to
support both modes of operation. Note: This option has been
deprecated. See Description.</p>

<p>-verbose Causes the compiler and linker to print out
messages about what classes are being compiled and what
class files are being loaded.</p>

<p>-v1.1 (deprecated) Generates stub and skeleton classes
for the 1.1 JRMP stub protocol version only. The -v1.1
option is only useful for generating stub classes that are
serialization-compatible with preexisting, statically
deployed stub classes that were generated by the rmic
command from JDK 1.1 and that cannot be upgraded (and
dynamic class loading is not being used). Note: This option
has been deprecated. See Description.</p>

<p>-v1.2 (deprecated) (Default) Generates stub classes for
the 1.2 JRMP stub protocol version only. No skeleton classes
are generated because skeleton classes are not used with the
1.2 stub protocol version. The generated stub classes do not
work when they are loaded into a JDK 1.1 virtual machine.
Note: This option has been deprecated. See Description.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CLASSPATH Used to provide the
system a path to user-defined classes. Directories are
separated by colons, for example:
.:/usr/local/java/classes.</p>
