<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>void Tcl_ConditionNotify(condPtr)</p>

<p>void Tcl_ConditionWait(condPtr, mutexPtr, timePtr)</p>

<p>void Tcl_ConditionFinalize(condPtr)</p>

<p>Void * Tcl_GetThreadData(keyPtr, size)</p>

<p>void Tcl_MutexLock(mutexPtr)</p>

<p>void Tcl_MutexUnlock(mutexPtr)</p>

<p>void Tcl_MutexFinalize(mutexPtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_CreateThread(idPtr, threadProc, clientData,
stackSize, flags)</p>

<p>int Tcl_JoinThread(id, result)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Condition *condPtr (in) A condition
variable, which must be associated with a mutex lock.</p>

<p>Tcl_Mutex *mutexPtr (in) A mutex lock.</p>

<p>Tcl_Time *timePtr (in) A time limit on the con- dition
wait. NULL to wait forever. Note that a polling value of 0
sec- onds does not make much sense.</p>

<p>Tcl_ThreadDataKey *keyPtr (in) This identifies a block
of thread local storage. The key should be static and
process-wide, yet each thread will end up associating a
different block of storage with this key.</p>

<p>int *size (in) The size of the thread local storage
block. This amount of data is allocated and initialized to
zero the first time each thread calls Tcl_GetThreadData.</p>

<p>Tcl_ThreadId *idPtr (out) The referred storage will
contain the id of the newly created thread as returned by
the operating system.</p>

<p>Tcl_ThreadId id (in) Id of the thread waited upon.</p>

<p>Tcl_ThreadCreateProc threadProc (in) This procedure will
act as the main() of the newly created thread. The specified
clientData will be its sole argument.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary information. Passed
as sole argument to the threadProc.</p>

<p>int stackSize (in) The size of the stack given to the
new thread.</p>

<p>int flags (in) Bitmask containing flags allowing the
caller to modify behaviour of the new thread.</p>

<p>int *result (out) The referred storage is used to place
the exit code of the thread waited upon into it.

<p>INTRODUCTION Beginning with the 8.1 release, the Tcl
core is thread safe, which allows you to incorporate Tcl
into multithreaded applications without customizing the Tcl
core. To enable Tcl multithreading support, you must include
the --enable-threads option to configure when you config-
ure and compile your Tcl core.</p>

<p>An important constraint of the Tcl threads
implementation is that only the thread that created a Tcl
interpreter can use that interpreter. In other words,
multiple threads can not access the same Tcl interpreter.
(However, a single thread can safely create and use multiple
inter- preters.)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl provides Tcl_CreateThread for creating
threads. The caller can determine the size of the stack
given to the new thread and modify the behaviour through the
supplied flags. The value TCL_THREAD_STACK_DEFAULT for the
stackSize indicates that the default size as specified by
the operating system is to be used for the new thread. As
for the flags, currently only the values TCL_THREAD_NOFLAGS
and TCL_THREAD_JOINABLE are defined. The first of them
invokes the default behaviour with no specialties. Using the
second value marks the new thread as joinable. This means
that another thread can wait for the such marked thread to
exit and join it.</p>

<p>Restrictions: On some UNIX systems the pthread-library
does not contain the functionality to specify the stack size
of a thread. The specified value for the stack size is
ignored on these systems. Windows cur- rently does not
support joinable threads. This flag value is therefore
ignored on this platform.</p>

<p>Tcl provides the Tcl_ExitThread and Tcl_FinalizeThread
functions for terminating threads and invoking optional
per-thread exit handlers. See the Tcl_Exit page for more
information on these procedures.</p>

<p>The Tcl_JoinThread function is provided to allow threads
to wait upon the exit of another thread, which must have
been marked as joinable through usage of the
TCL_THREAD_JOINABLE-flag during its creation via
Tcl_CreateThread.</p>

<p>Trying to wait for the exit of a non-joinable thread or
a thread which is already waited upon will result in an
error. Waiting for a joinable thread which already exited is
possible, the system will retain the necessary information
until after the call to Tcl_JoinThread. This means that not
calling Tcl_JoinThread for a joinable thread will cause a
memory leak.</p>

<p>The Tcl_GetThreadData call returns a pointer to a block
of thread-pri- vate data. Its argument is a key that is
shared by all threads and a size for the block of storage.
The storage is automatically allocated and initialized to
all zeros the first time each thread asks for it. The
storage is automatically deallocated by
Tcl_FinalizeThread.</p>

<p>SYNCHRONIZATION AND COMMUNICATION Tcl provides
Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent and Tcl_ThreadAlert for handling event
queuing in multithreaded applications. See the Notifier
manual page for more information on these procedures.</p>

<p>A mutex is a lock that is used to serialize all threads
through a piece of code by calling Tcl_MutexLock and
Tcl_MutexUnlock. If one thread holds a mutex, any other
thread calling Tcl_MutexLock will block until
Tcl_MutexUnlock is called. A mutex can be destroyed after
its use by calling Tcl_MutexFinalize. The result of locking
a mutex twice from the same thread is undefined. On some
platforms it will result in a deadlock. The Tcl_MutexLock,
Tcl_MutexUnlock and Tcl_MutexFinalize procedures are defined
as empty macros if not compiling with threads enabled. For
declaration of mutexes the TCL_DECLARE_MUTEX macro should be
used. This macro assures correct mutex handling even when
the core is compiled without threads enabled.</p>

<p>A condition variable is used as a signaling mechanism: a
thread can lock a mutex and then wait on a condition
variable with Tcl_Condition- Wait. This atomically releases
the mutex lock and blocks the waiting thread until another
thread calls Tcl_ConditionNotify. The caller of
Tcl_ConditionNotify should have the associated mutex held by
previously calling Tcl_MutexLock, but this is not enforced.
Notifying the condi- tion variable unblocks all threads
waiting on the condition variable, but they do not proceed
until the mutex is released with Tcl_MutexUn- lock. The
implementation of Tcl_ConditionWait automatically locks the
mutex before returning.</p>

<p>The caller of Tcl_ConditionWait should be prepared for
spurious notifi- cations by calling Tcl_ConditionWait within
a while loop that tests some invariant.</p>

<p>A condition variable can be destroyed after its use by
calling Tcl_Con- ditionFinalize.</p>

<p>The Tcl_ConditionNotify, Tcl_ConditionWait and
Tcl_ConditionFinalize procedures are defined as empty macros
if not compiling with threads enabled.</p>

<p>INITIALIZATION All of these synchronization objects are
self-initializing. They are implemented as opaque pointers
that should be NULL upon first use. The mutexes and
condition variables are either cleaned up by process exit
handlers (if living that long) or explicitly by calls to
Tcl_MutexFi- nalize or Tcl_ConditionFinalize. Thread local
storage is reclaimed during Tcl_FinalizeThread.</p>

<p>SCRIPT-LEVEL ACCESS TO THREADS Tcl provides no built-in
commands for scripts to use to create, manage, or join
threads, nor any script-level access to mutex or condition
variables. It provides such facilities only via C
interfaces, and leaves it up to packages to expose these
matters to the script level. One such package is the Thread
package.</p>
