<p>NAME cyrus-master - cyrus-master Cyrus process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cyrus-master [ -C alternate imapd.conf ] [ -M
alternate cyrus.conf ] [ -l listen queue ] [ -p pidfile ] [
-P snmp agentx ping interval ] [ -j janitor period ] [ -d ]
[ -D ] [ -x snmp agentx socket ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Cyrus-master is the process that controls
all of the Cyrus processes. This process is responsible for
creating all imapd, pop3d, lmtpd and sieved child processes.
This process also initializes the Berkeley DB code and
performs scheduled cleanup/maintenance.</p>

<p>If this process dies, then no new sessions will be
started.</p>

<p>It kills itself and all child processes when it receives
a SIGTERM.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C alternate imapd.conf Specifies an alternate
imapd.conf for use by cyrus-master (note that this will not
affect any sub-processes spawned by cyrus- master, you
should specify those specifically in the respective entries
in cyrus.conf).</p>

<p>-M alternate cyrus.conf Specifies an alternate
cyrus.conf for use by cyrus-master.</p>

<p>-l listen queue backlog Increase the listen queue
backlog. By default, the listen queue is set to 32. On
systems with a high connection rate, it may be desirable to
increase this value. refer to listen(2) for details.</p>

<p>-j janitor full-sweeps per second Sets the amount of
times per second the janitor should sweep the entire child
table. Leave it at the default of 1 unless you have a really
high fork rate (and you have not increased the child hash
table size when you compiled Cyrus from its default of 10000
entries).</p>

<p>-p pidfile Use pidfile as the pidfile. If not specified,
defaults to /var/run/cyrus-master.pid</p>

<p>-P snmp agentx ping interval Sets the amount on time in
seconds the subagent will try and reconnect to the
cyrus-master agent (snmpd) if it ever becomes (or starts)
disconnected. Requires net-snmp 5.0 or higher.</p>

<p>-d Start in daemon mode (run in background and
disconnect from con- trolling terminal).</p>

<p>-D Don t close stdin/stdout/stderr. Primiarly useful for
debugging.</p>

<p>-x snmp agentx socket Address the cyrus-master agent
(most likely snmpd) listens on. Requires net-snmp 5.0 or
higher.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION Upon execution, cyrus-master reads its
configuration information out of the cyrus.conf(5) file.</p>

<p>Cyrus-master rereads its configuration file when it
receives a hangup signal, SIGHUP. Services and events may be
added, deleted or modified when the configuration file is
reread. Any active services removed from the configuration
file will be allowed to run until completion.</p>

<p>NOTES The environment variable CYRUS_VERBOSE can be set
to log additional debugging information. Setting the value
to 1 results in base level logging. Setting it higher
results in more log messages being gener- ated.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/cyrus.conf, /etc/imapd.conf,
/var/run/cyrus-master.pid</p>
