<p>XkbComputeShapeTop(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbComputeShapeTop(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbComputeShapeTop - Determines the bounding box of
the top surface of a shape</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Bool XkbComputeShapeTop (XkbShapePtr shape,
XkbBoundsPtr bounds_rtrn);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - shape shape to be examined</p>

<p>- bounds_rtrn backfilled with the bounding box for the
shape</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkb provides a number of convenience
functions to help use a keyboard geometry. These include
functions to return the bounding box of a shapes top surface
and to update the bounding box of a shape row or
section.</p>

<p>A shape is made up of a number of outlines. Each outline
is a polygon made up of a number of points. The bounding box
of a shape is a rectan- gle that contains all the outlines
of that shape.</p>

<p>XkbComputeShapeTop returns a BoundsRec that contains two
x and y coor- dinates. These coordinates describe the
corners of a rectangle that contains the outline that
describes the top surface of the shape. The top surface is
defined to be the approximating outline if the approx field
of shape is not NULL. If approx is NULL, the top surface is
defined as the last outline in the shape_s array of
outlines. XkbCom- puteShapeTop returns False if shape is
NULL or if there are no outlines for the shape; otherwise,
it returns True.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES typedef struct _XkbBounds { short x1,y1; /
upper left corner of the bounds, in mm/10 */ short x2,y2; /
lower right corner of the bounds, in mm/10 */ }
XkbBoundsRec, *XkbBoundsPtr;</p>
