<p>NAME amcrypt-ossl-asym - crypt program for Amanda
asymmetric data encryption using OpenSSL</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amcrypt-ossl-asym [-d]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION amcrypt-ossl-asym uses OpenSSL to encrypt
and decrypt data. OpenSSL is available from www.openssl.org.
OpenSSL offers a wide variety of cipher choices (
amcrypt-ossl-asym defaults to 256-bit AES) and can use
hardware cryptographic accelerators on several
platforms.</p>

<p>amcrypt-ossl-asym will search for the OpenSSL program in
the following directories:
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ssl/bin:/usr/local/ssl/bin.</p>

<p>GENERATING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE KEYS RSA keys can be
generated with the standard OpenSSL commands, e.g.: $ cd
/var/lib/amanda $ openssl genrsa -aes128 -out
backup-privkey.pem 1024 Generating RSA private key, 1024 bit
long modulus [...] Enter pass phrase for backup-privkey.pem:
ENTER YOUR PASS PHRASE Verifying - Enter pass phrase for
backup-key.pem: ENTER YOUR PASS PHRASE</p>

<p>$ openssl rsa -in backup-privkey.pem -pubout -out
backup-pubkey.pem Enter pass phrase for backup-privkey.pem:
ENTER YOUR PASS PHRASE Writing RSA key</p>

<p>To generate a private key without a passphrase, omit the
-aes128 option. See openssl_genrsa(1) for more key
generation options.</p>

<p>Note that it is always possible to generate the public
key from the private key.</p>

<p>KEY AND PASSPHRASE MANAGEMENT amcrypt-ossl-asym uses the
public key to encrypt data. The security of the data does
not depend on the confidentiality of the public key. The
private key is used to decrypt data, and must be protected.
Encrypted backup data cannot be recovered without the
private key. The private key may optionally be encrypted
with a passphrase.</p>

<p>While the public key must be online at all times to
perorm backups, the private key and optional passphrase are
only needed to restore data. It is recommended that the
latter be stored offline all other times. For example, you
could keep the private key on removable media, and copy it
into place for a restore; or you could keep the private key
online, encrypted with a passphrase that is present only for
a restore.</p>

<p>OpenSSL&acute;s key derivation routines use a salt to
guard against dictionary attacks on the pass phrase; still
it is important to pick a pass phrase that is hard to guess.
The Diceware method (see www.diceware.com) can be used to
create passphrases that are difficult to guess and easy to
remember.</p>

<p>FILES /var/lib/amanda/backup-privkey.pem File containing
the RSA private key. It should not be readable by any user
other than the Amanda user.</p>

<p>/var/lib/amanda/backup-pubkey.pem File containing the
RSA public key.</p>

<p>/var/lib/amanda/.am_passphrase File containing the
passphrase. It should not be readable by any user other than
the Amanda user.</p>
