<p>ALARM(2) Linux Programmer s Manual ALARM(2)</p>

<p>NAME alarm - set an alarm clock for delivery of a
signal</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>unsigned int alarm(unsigned int seconds);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION alarm() arranges for a SIGALRM signal to be
delivered to the calling process in seconds seconds.</p>

<p>If seconds is zero, no new alarm() is scheduled.</p>

<p>In any event any previously set alarm() is canceled.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE alarm() returns the number of seconds
remaining until any previously scheduled alarm was due to be
delivered, or zero if there was no previ- ously scheduled
alarm.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD.</p>

<p>NOTES alarm() and setitimer(2) share the same timer;
calls to one will inter- fere with use of the other.</p>

<p>sleep(3) may be implemented using SIGALRM; mixing calls
to alarm() and sleep(3) is a bad idea.</p>

<p>Scheduling delays can, as ever, cause the execution of
the process to be delayed by an arbitrary amount of
time.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO gettimeofday(2), pause(2), select(2),
setitimer(2), sigaction(2), sig- nal(2), sleep(3),
time(7)</p>
