<p>NAME cgconfigparser - setup control group file
system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cgconfigparser [-h] [-l &lt;filename&gt;] [-L
&lt;directory&gt;] [...]</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, --help Displays help.</p>

<p>-l, --load=FILE Parses the control groups configuration
file Sets up the control group file system defined by the
configuration file and mounts mount points defined by the
configuration file. The format of the file is described in
cgconfig.conf. This option can be used multiple times and
can be mixed with -L option.</p>

<p>-L, --load-directory=DIR Finds all files in given
directory and parses them in alphabeti- cal order like they
were specified by -l option. This option can be used
multiple times and can be mixed with -l option.</p>

<p>-a &lt;agid&gt;:&lt;auid&gt; defines the default owner
of the rest of the defined control group s files. These
users are allowed to set subsystem parame- ters and create
subgroups. The default value is the same as has the parent
cgroup.</p>

<p>-d, --dperm=mode sets the default permissions of a
control groups directory. The permissions needs to be
specified as octal numbers e.g. -d 775.</p>

<p>-f, --fperm=mode sets the default permissions of the
control group files. The permissions needs to be specified
as octal numbers e.g. -f 775. The value is not used as given
because the current owners per- missions are used as an
umask (so 777 will set group and others permissions to the
owners permissions).</p>

<p>-s, --tperm=mode sets the default permissions of the
control group tasks files. The permissions needs to be
specified as octal numbers e.g. -f 775. The value is not
used as given because the current owners permissions are
used as an umask (so 777 will set group and oth- ers
permissions to the owners permissions).</p>

<p>-t &lt;tuid&gt;:&lt;tgid&gt; defines the default owner
of tasks file of the defined control group. I.e. this user
and members of this group have write access to the file.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CGROUP_LOGLEVEL controls verbosity
of the tool. Allowed values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING or
ERROR.</p>
