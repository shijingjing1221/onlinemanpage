<p>SETUP(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SETUP(2)</p>

<p>NAME setup - setup devices and file systems, mount root
file system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setup(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION setup() is called once from within
linux/init/main.c. It calls ini- tialization functions for
devices and file systems configured into the kernel and then
mounts the root file system.</p>

<p>No user process may call setup(). Any user process, even
a process with superuser permission, will receive EPERM.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE setup() always returns -1 for a user
process.</p>

<p>ERRORS EPERM Always, for a user process.</p>

<p>VERSIONS Since Linux 2.1.121, no such function exists
anymore.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function is Linux-specific, and
should not be used in programs intended to be portable, or
indeed in any programs at all.</p>

<p>NOTES The calling sequence varied: at some times setup
() has had a single argument void *BIOS and at other times a
single argument int magic.</p>

<p>COLOPHON This page is part of release 3.22 of the Linux
man-pages project. A description of the project, and
information about reporting bugs, can be found at
