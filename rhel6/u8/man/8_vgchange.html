[VolumeGroupName...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vgchange allows you to change the attributes
of one or more volume groups. Its main purpose is to
activate and deactivate VolumeGroupName, or all volume
groups if none is specified. Only active volume groups are
subject to changes and allow access to their logical
volumes. [Not yet implemented: During volume group
activation, if vgchange recognizes snapshot logical volumes
which were dropped because they ran out of space, it
displays a message informing the administrator that such
snapshots should be removed (see lvremove(8)). ]</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm(8) for common options.</p>

<p>-A, --autobackup {y|n} Controls automatic backup of
metadata after the change. See vgcfgbackup(8). Default is
yes.</p>

<p>-a, --activate [a|e|s|l]{y|n} Controls the availability
of the logical volumes in the volume group for input/output.
In other words, makes the logical vol- umes known/unknown to
the kernel. If autoactivation option is used (-aay), each
logical volume in the volume group is acti- vated only if it
matches an item in the activation/auto_activa-
tion_volume_list set in lvm.conf. If this list is not set,
then all volumes are considered for activation. The -aay
option should be also used during system boot so its
possible to select which volumes to activate using the
activation/auto_acti- vation_volume_list settting.</p>

<p>Activation of a logical volume creates a symbolic link
/dev/Vol- umeGroupName/LogicalVolumeName pointing to the
device node. This link is removed on deactivation. All
software and scripts should access the device through this
symbolic link and present this as the name of the device.
The location and name of the underlying device node may
depend on the distribution and con- figuration (e.g. udev)
and might change from release to release.</p>

<p>In a clustered VG, clvmd is used for activation, and the
follow- ing options are possible:</p>

<p>With -aey, clvmd activates the LV in exclusive mode
(with an exclusive lock), allowing a single node to activate
the LV.</p>

<p>With -asy, clvmd activates the LV in shared mode (with a
shared lock), allowing multiple nodes to activate the LV
concurrently. If the LV type prohibits shared access, such
as an LV with a snapshot, the s option is ignored and an
exclusive lock is used.</p>

<p>With -ay (no mode specified), clvmd activates the LV in
shared mode if the LV type allows concurrent access, such as
a linear LV. Otherwise, clvmd activates the LV in exclusive
mode.</p>

<p>With -aey, -asy, and -ay, clvmd attempts to activate the
LV on all nodes. If exclusive mode is used, then only one of
the nodes will be successful.</p>

<p>With -an, clvmd attempts to deactivate the LV on all
nodes.</p>

<p>With -aly, clvmd activates the LV only on the local
node, and -aln deactivates only on the local node. If the LV
type allows concurrent access, then shared mode is used,
otherwise exclu- sive.</p>

<p>LVs with snapshots are always activated exclusively
because they can only be used on one node at once.</p>

<p>For local VGs, -ay, -aey, and -asy are all
equivalent.</p>

<p>In a shared VG, lvmlockd is used for locking if LVM is
compiled with lockd support, and the following options are
possible:</p>

<p>With -aey, the command activates the LV in exclusive
mode, allowing a single host to activate the LV (the host
running the command). Before activating the LV, the command
uses lvmlockd to acquire an exclusive lock on the LV. If the
lock cannot be acquired, the LV is not activated and an
error is reported. This would happen if the LV is active on
another host.</p>

<p>With -asy, the command activates the LV in shared mode,
allowing multiple hosts to activate the LV concurrently.
Before activat- ing the LV, the command uses lvmlockd to
acquire a shared lock on the LV. If the lock cannot be
acquired, the LV is not acti- vated and an error is
reported. This would happen if the LV is active exclusively
on another host. If the LV type prohibits shared access,
such as a snapshot, the command will report an error and
fail.</p>

<p>With -an, the command deactivates the LV on the host
running the command. After deactivating the LV, the command
uses lvmlockd to release the current lock on the LV.</p>

<p>With lvmlockd, an unspecified mode is always exclusive,
-ay defaults to -aey.</p>

<p>--activationmode {complete|degraded|partial} The
activation mode determines whether logical volumes are
allowed to activate when there are physical volumes missing
(e.g. due to a device failure). complete is the most
restric- tive; allowing only those logical volumes to be
activated that are not affected by the missing PVs. degraded
allows RAID logi- cal volumes to be activated even if they
have PVs missing. (Note that the &quot;mirror&quot; segment
type is not considered a RAID logical volume. The
&quot;raid1&quot; segment type should be used instead.)
Finally, partial allows any logical volume to be activated
even if portions are missing due to a missing or failed PV.
This last option should only be used when performing
recovery or repair operations. degraded is the default mode.
To change it, modify activation_mode in lvm.conf(5).</p>

<p>-K, --ignoreactivationskip Ignore the flag to skip
Logical Volumes during activation.</p>

<p>-c, --clustered {y|n} If clustered locking is enabled,
this indicates whether this Volume Group is shared with
other nodes in the cluster or whether it contains only local
disks that are not visible on the other nodes. If the
cluster infrastructure is unavailable on a particular node
at a particular time, you may still be able to use Volume
Groups that are not marked as clustered.</p>

<p>--detachprofile Detach any metadata configuration
profiles attached to given Volume Groups. See lvm.conf(5)
for more information about meta- data profiles.</p>

<p>-u, --uuid Generate new random UUID for specified Volume
Groups.</p>

<p>--monitor {y|n} Start or stop monitoring a mirrored or
snapshot logical volume with dmeventd, if it is installed.
If a device used by a moni- tored mirror reports an I/O
error, the failure is handled according to
mirror_image_fault_policy and mirror_log_fault_pol- icy set
in lvm.conf(5).</p>

<p>--poll {y|n} Without polling a logical volumes
backgrounded transformation process will never complete. If
there is an incomplete pvmove or lvconvert (for example, on
rebooting after a crash), use --poll y to restart the
process from its last checkpoint. How- ever, it may not be
appropriate to immediately poll a logical volume when it is
activated, use --poll n to defer and then --poll y to
restart the process.</p>

<p>--sysinit Indicates that vgchange(8) is being invoked
from early system initialisation scripts (e.g. rc.sysinit or
an initrd), before writeable filesystems are available. As
such, some functionality needs to be disabled and this
option acts as a shortcut which selects an appropriate set
of options. Currently this is equiva- lent to using
--ignorelockingfailure, --ignoremonitoring, --poll n and
setting LVM_SUPPRESS_LOCKING_FAILURE_MESSAGES environment
variable.</p>

<p>If --sysinit is used in conjunction with lvmetad(8)
enabled and running, autoactivation is preferred over manual
activation via direct vgchange call. Logical volumes are
autoactivated accord- ing to auto_activation_volume_list set
in lvm.conf(5).</p>

<p>--noudevsync Disable udev synchronisation. The process
will not wait for notification from udev. It will continue
irrespective of any possible udev processing in the
background. You should only use this if udev is not running
or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.</p>

<p>--ignoremonitoring Make no attempt to interact with
dmeventd unless --monitor is specified. Do not use this if
dmeventd is already monitoring a device.</p>

<p>--lock-start Start the lockspace of a shared VG in
lvmlockd. lvmlockd locks becomes available for the VG,
allowing LVM to use the VG. See lvmlockd(8).</p>

<p>--lock-stop Stop the lockspace of a shared VG in
lvmlockd. lvmlockd locks become unavailable for the VG,
preventing LVM from using the VG. See lvmlockd(8).</p>

<p>--lock-type LockType Change the VG lock type to or from
a shared lock type used with lvmlockd. See lvmlockd(8).</p>

<p>-l, --logicalvolume MaxLogicalVolumes Changes the
maximum logical volume number of an existing inac- tive
volume group.</p>

<p>-p, --maxphysicalvolumes MaxPhysicalVolumes Changes the
maximum number of physical volumes that can belong to this
volume group. For volume groups with metadata in lvm1
format, the limit is 255. If the metadata uses lvm2 format,
the value 0 removes this restriction: there is then no
limit. If you have a large number of physical volumes in a
volume group with metadata in lvm2 format, for tool
performance reasons, you should consider some use of
--pvmetadatacopies 0 as described in pvcreate(8), and/or use
--vgmetadatacopies.</p>

<p>--metadataprofile ProfileName Uses and attaches
ProfileName configuration profile to the vol- ume group
metadata. Whenever the volume group is processed next time,
the profile is automatically applied. The profile is
inherited by all logical volumes in the volume group unless
the logical volume itself has its own profile attached. See
lvm.conf(5) for more information about metadata
profiles.</p>

<p>--[vg]metadatacopies NumberOfCopies|unmanaged|all Sets
the desired number of metadata copies in the volume group.
If set to a non-zero value, LVM will automatically manage
the metadataignore flags on the physical volumes (see
pvchange or pvcreate --metadataignore) in order to achieve
NumberOfCopies copies of metadata. If set to unmanaged, LVM
will not automati- cally manage the metadataignore flags. If
set to all, LVM will first clear all of the metadataignore
flags on all meta- data areas in the volume group, then set
the value to unmanaged. The vgmetadatacopies option is
useful for volume groups contain- ing large numbers of
physical volumes with metadata as it may be used to minimize
metadata read and write overhead.</p>

<p>-s, --physicalextentsize
PhysicalExtentSize[BbBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE] Changes the physical
extent size on physical volumes of this volume group. A size
suffix (k for kilobytes up to t for ter- abytes) is
optional, megabytes is the default if no suffix is present.
For LVM2 format, the value must be a power of 2 of at least
1 sector (where the sector size is the largest sector size
of the PVs currently used in the VG) or, if not a power of
2, at least 128KiB. For the older LVM1 format, it must be a
power of 2 of at least 8KiB. The default is 4 MiB.</p>

<p>Before increasing the physical extent size, you might
need to use lvresize, pvresize and/or pvmove so that
everything fits. For example, every contiguous range of
extents used in a logical volume must start and end on an
extent boundary.</p>

<p>If the volume group metadata uses lvm1 format, extents
can vary in size from 8KiB to 16GiB and there is a limit of
65534 extents in each logical volume. The default of 4 MiB
leads to a maximum logical volume size of around 256GiB.</p>

<p>If the volume group metadata uses lvm2 format those
restrictions do not apply, but having a large number of
extents will slow down the tools but have no impact on I/O
performance to the log- ical volume. The smallest PE is
1KiB.</p>

<p>The 2.4 kernel has a limitation of 2TiB per block
device.</p>

<p>--systemid SystemID Changes the system ID of the VG.
Using this option requires caution because the VG may become
foreign to the host running the command, leaving the host
unable to access it. See lvmsys- temid(7).</p>

<p>--refresh If any logical volume in the volume group is
active, reload its metadata. This is not necessary in normal
operation, but may be useful if something has gone wrong or
if youre doing clustering manually without a clustered lock
manager.</p>

<p>-x, --resizeable {y|n} Enables or disables the
extension/reduction of this volume group with/by physical
volumes.</p>

<p>Examples To activate all known volume groups in the
system:</p>

<p>vgchange -a y</p>

<p>To change the maximum number of logical volumes of
inactive volume group vg00 to 128.</p>

<p>vgchange -l 128 /dev/vg00</p>
