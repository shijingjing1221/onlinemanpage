<p>SETSID(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SETSID(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME setsid - create session and set process group
ID</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>pid_t setsid(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The setsid() function shall create a new
session, if the calling pro- cess is not a process group
leader. Upon return the calling process shall be the session
leader of this new session, shall be the process group
leader of a new process group, and shall have no controlling
ter- minal. The process group ID of the calling process
shall be set equal to the process ID of the calling process.
The calling process shall be the only process in the new
process group and the only process in the new session.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, setsid() shall
return the value of the new process group ID of the calling
process. Otherwise, it shall return (pid_t)-1 and set errno
to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The setsid() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EPERM The calling process is already a process group
leader, or the process group ID of a process other than the
calling process matches the process ID of the calling
process.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The setsid() function is similar to the
setpgrp() function of System V. System V, without job
control, groups processes into process groups and creates
new process groups via setpgrp(); only one process group may
be part of a login session.</p>

<p>Job control allows multiple process groups within a
login session. In order to limit job control actions so that
they can only affect pro- cesses in the same login session,
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 adds the concept of a
session that is created via setsid(). The set- sid()
function also creates the initial process group contained in
the session. Additional process groups can be created via
the setpgid() function. A System V process group would
correspond to a POSIX System Interfaces session containing a
single POSIX process group. Note that this function requires
that the calling process not be a process group leader. The
usual way to ensure this is true is to create a new process
with fork() and have it call setsid(). The fork() function
guarantees that the process ID of the new process does not
match any existing pro- cess group ID.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
