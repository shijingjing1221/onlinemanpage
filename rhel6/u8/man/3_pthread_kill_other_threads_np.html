<p>PTHREAD_KILL_OTHER_THREADS_Linux Programmer s
PTHREAD_KILL_OTHER_THREADS_NP(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_kill_other_threads_np - terminate all other
threads in process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>void pthread_kill_other_threads_np(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pthread_kill_other_threads_np() only has an
effect in the LinuxThreads threading implementation. On that
implementation, calling this func- tion causes the immediate
termination of all threads in the applica- tion, except the
calling thread. The cancellation state and cancella- tion
type of the to-be-terminated threads are ignored, and the
cleanup handlers are not called in those threads.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function is a non-standard GNU
extension.</p>

<p>NOTES pthread_kill_other_threads_np() is intended to be
called just before a thread calls execve(2) or a similar
function. This function is designed to address a limitation
in the obsolete LinuxThreads implemen- tation whereby the
other threads of an application are not automati- cally
terminated (as POSIX.1-2001 requires) during execve(2).</p>

<p>In the NPTL threading implementation,
pthread_kill_other_threads_np() exists, but does nothing.
(Nothing needs to be done, because the implementation does
the right thing during an execve(2).)</p>

<p>SEE ALSO execve(2), pthread_setcancelstate(3),
pthread_setcanceltype(3), pthread_cancel(3), pthreads(7)</p>
