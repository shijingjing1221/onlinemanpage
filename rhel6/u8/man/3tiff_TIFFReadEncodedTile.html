<p>NAME TIFFReadEncodedTile - read and decode a tile of
data from an open TIFF file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int TIFFReadEncodedTile(TIFF *tif, ttile_t tile, tdata_t
buf, tsize_t size)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Read the specified tile of data and place up
to size bytes of decom- pressed information in the (user
supplied) data buffer.</p>

<p>NOTES The value of tile is a raw tile number. That is,
the caller must take into account whether or not the data
are organized in separate planes (PlanarConfiguration=2).
TIFFComputeTile automatically does this when converting an
(x,y,z,sample) coordinate quadruple to a tile number. To
read a full tile of data the data buffer should be at least
as large as the value returned by TIFFTileSize.</p>

<p>The library attempts to hide bit- and byte-ordering
differences between the image and the native machine by
converting data to the native machine order. Bit reversal is
done if the FillOrder tag is opposite to the native machine
bit order. 16- and 32-bit samples are automati- cally
byte-swapped if the file was written with a byte order
opposite to the native machine byte order,</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES The actual number of bytes of data that
were placed in buf is returned; TIFFReadEncodedTile returns
-1 if an error was encountered.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error messages are directed to the
TIFFError(3TIFF) routine.</p>
