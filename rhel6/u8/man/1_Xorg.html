<p>NAME Xorg - X11R7 X server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Xorg [:display] [option ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xorg is a full featured X server that was
originally designed for UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems
running on Intel x86 hardware. It now runs on a wider range
of hardware and OS platforms.</p>

<p>This work was derived by the X.Org Foundation from the
XFree86 Projects XFree86 4.4rc2 release. The XFree86 release
was originally derived from X386 1.2 by Thomas Roell which
was contributed to X11R5 by Snitily Graphics Consulting
Service.</p>

<p>PLATFORMS Xorg operates under a wide range of operating
systems and hardware platforms. The Intel x86 (IA32)
architecture is the most widely sup- ported hardware
platform. Other hardware platforms include Compaq Alpha,
Intel IA64, AMD64, SPARC and PowerPC. The most widely
supported operating systems are the free/OpenSource
UNIX-like systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
and Solaris. Commercial UNIX operat- ing systems such as
UnixWare are also supported. Other supported oper- ating
systems include GNU Hurd. Mac OS X is supported with the
Xquartz(1) X server. Win32/Cygwin is supported with the
XWin(1) X server.</p>

<p>NETWORK CONNECTIONS Xorg supports connections made using
the following reliable byte- streams:</p>

<p>Local On most platforms, the &quot;Local&quot;
connection type is a UNIX-domain socket. On some System V
platforms, the &quot;local&quot; connection types also
include STREAMS pipes, named pipes, and some other
mechanisms.</p>

<p>TCP/IP Xorg listens on port 6000+n, where n is the
display number. This connection type can be disabled with
the -nolisten option (see the Xserver(1) man page for
details).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES For operating systems that support
local connections other than Unix Domain sockets (SVR3 and
SVR4), there is a compiled-in list specifying the order in
which local connections should be attempted. This list can
be overridden by the XLOCAL environment variable described
below. If the display name indicates a best-choice
connection should be made (e.g. :0.0), each connection
mechanism is tried until a connection succeeds or no more
mechanisms are available. Note: for these OSs, the Unix
Domain socket connection is treated differently from the
other local connection types. To use it the connection must
be made to unix:0.0.</p>

<p>The XLOCAL environment variable should contain a list of
one more more of the following:</p>

<p>NAMED PTS SCO ISC</p>

<p>which represent SVR4 Named Streams pipe, Old-style USL
Streams pipe, SCO XSight Streams pipe, and ISC Streams pipe,
respectively. You can select a single mechanism (e.g.
XLOCAL=NAMED), or an ordered list (e.g.
XLOCAL=&quot;NAMED:PTS:SCO&quot;). his variable overrides
the compiled-in defaults. For SVR4 it is recommended that
NAMED be the first prefer- ence connection. The default
setting is PTS:NAMED:ISC:SCO.</p>

<p>To globally override the compiled-in defaults, you
should define (and export if using sh or ksh) XLOCAL
globally. If you use startx(1) or xinit(1), the definition
should be at the top of your .xinitrc file. If you use
xdm(1), the definitions should be early on in the
/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession script.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Xorg supports several mechanisms for
supplying/obtaining configuration and run-time parameters:
command line options, environment variables, the
xorg.conf(5) configuration files, auto-detection, and
fallback defaults. When the same information is supplied in
more than one way, the highest precedence mechanism is used.
The list of mechanisms is ordered from highest precedence to
lowest. Note that not all parame- ters can be supplied via
all methods. The available command line options and
environment variables (and some defaults) are described here
and in the Xserver(1) manual page. Most configuration file
param- eters, with their defaults, are described in the
xorg.conf(5) manual page. Driver and module specific
configuration parameters are described in the relevant
driver or module manual page.</p>

<p>In addition to the normal server options described in
the Xserver(1) manual page, Xorg accepts the following
command line switches:</p>

<p>vtXX XX specifies the Virtual Terminal device number
which Xorg will use. Without this option, Xorg will pick the
first available Virtual Terminal that it can locate. This
option applies only to platforms that have virtual terminal
support, such as Linux, BSD, OpenSolaris, SVR3, and
SVR4.</p>

<p>-allowMouseOpenFail Allow the server to start up even if
the mouse device cant be opened or initialised. This is
equivalent to the Allow- MouseOpenFail xorg.conf(5) file
option.</p>

<p>-allowNonLocalXvidtune Make the VidMode extension
available to remote clients. This allows the xvidtune client
to connect from another host. This is equivalent to the
AllowNonLocalXvidtune xorg.conf(5) file option. By default
non-local connections are not allowed.</p>

<p>-bgamma value Set the blue gamma correction. value must
be between 0.1 and 10. The default is 1.0. Not all drivers
support this. See also the -gamma, -rgamma, and -ggamma
options.</p>

<p>-bpp n No longer supported. Use -depth to set the color
depth, and use -fbbpp if you really need to force a
non-default frame- buffer (hardware) pixel format.</p>

<p>-config file Read the server configuration from file.
This option will work for any file when the server is run as
root (i.e, with real-uid 0), or for files relative to a
directory in the config search path for all other users.</p>

<p>-configdir directory Read the server configuration files
from directory. This option will work for any directory when
the server is run as root (i.e, with real-uid 0), or for
directories relative to a directory in the config directory
search path for all other users.</p>

<p>-configure When this option is specified, the Xorg
server loads all video driver modules, probes for available
hardware, and writes out an initial xorg.conf(5) file based
on what was detected. This option currently has some
problems on some platforms, but in most cases it is a good
way to bootstrap the configuration pro- cess. This option is
only available when the server is run as root (i.e, with
real-uid 0).</p>

<p>-crt /dev/ttyXX SCO only. This is the same as the vt
option, and is provided for compatibility with the native
SCO X server.</p>

<p>-depth n Sets the default color depth. Legal values are
1, 4, 8, 15, 16, and 24. Not all drivers support all
values.</p>

<p>-disableVidMode Disable the parts of the VidMode
extension (used by the xvid- tune client) that can be used
to change the video modes. This is equivalent to the
DisableVidModeExtension xorg.conf(5) file option.</p>

<p>-fbbpp n Sets the number of framebuffer bits per pixel.
You should only set this if youre sure its necessary;
normally the server can deduce the correct value from -depth
above. Useful if you want to run a depth 24 configuration
with a 24 bpp framebuffer rather than the (possibly default)
32 bpp framebuffer (or vice versa). Legal values are 1, 8,
16, 24, 32. Not all drivers support all values.</p>

<p>-flipPixels Swap the default values for the black and
white pixels.</p>

<p>-gamma value Set the gamma correction. value must be
between 0.1 and 10. The default is 1.0. This value is
applied equally to the R, G and B values. Those values can
be set independently with the -rgamma, -bgamma, and -ggamma
options. Not all drivers support this.</p>

<p>-ggamma value Set the green gamma correction. value must
be between 0.1 and 10. The default is 1.0. Not all drivers
support this. See also the -gamma, -rgamma, and -bgamma
options.</p>

<p>-ignoreABI The Xorg server checks the ABI revision
levels of each module that it loads. It will normally refuse
to load modules with ABI revisions that are newer than the
servers. This is because such modules might use interfaces
that the server does not have. When this option is
specified, mismatches like this are downgraded from fatal
errors to warnings. This option should be used with
care.</p>

<p>-isolateDevice bus-id Restrict device resets to the
device at bus-id. The bus-id string has the form
bustype:bus:device:function (e.g., PCI:1:0:0). At present,
only isolation of PCI devices is supported; i.e., this
option is ignored if bustype is anything other than PCI.</p>

<p>-keeptty Prevent the server from detaching its initial
controlling ter- minal. This option is only useful when
debugging the server. Not all platforms support (or can use)
this option.</p>

<p>-keyboard keyboard-name Use the xorg.conf(5) file
InputDevice section called keyboard- name as the core
keyboard. This option is ignored when the Layout section
specifies a core keyboard. In the absence of both a Layout
section and this option, the first relevant InputDevice
section is used for the core keyboard.</p>

<p>-layout layout-name Use the xorg.conf(5) file Layout
section called layout-name. By default the first Layout
section is used.</p>

<p>-logfile filename Use the file called filename as the
Xorg server log file. The default log file when running as
root is /var/log/Xorg.n.log and for non root it is
$XDG_DATA_HOME/xorg/Xorg.n.log where n is the display number
of the Xorg server. The default may be in a different
directory on some platforms. This option is only available
when the server is run as root (i.e, with real- uid 0).</p>

<p>-logverbose [n] Sets the verbosity level for information
printed to the Xorg server log file. If the n value isnt
supplied, each occur- rence of this option increments the
log file verbosity level. When the n value is supplied, the
log file verbosity level is set to that value. The default
log file verbosity level is 3.</p>

<p>-modulepath searchpath Set the module search path to
searchpath. searchpath is a comma separated list of
directories to search for Xorg server modules. This option
is only available when the server is run as root (i.e, with
real-uid 0).</p>

<p>-nosilk Disable Silken Mouse support.</p>

<p>-novtswitch Disable the automatic switching on X server
reset and shutdown to the VT that was active when the server
started, if supported by the OS.</p>

<p>-pixmap24 Set the internal pixmap format for depth 24
pixmaps to 24 bits per pixel. The default is usually 32 bits
per pixel. There is normally little reason to use this
option. Some client appli- cations dont like this pixmap
format, even though it is a per- fectly legal format. This
is equivalent to the Pixmap xorg.conf(5) file option.</p>

<p>-pixmap32 Set the internal pixmap format for depth 24
pixmaps to 32 bits per pixel. This is usually the default.
This is equivalent to the Pixmap xorg.conf(5) file
option.</p>

<p>-pointer pointer-name Use the xorg.conf(5) file
InputDevice section called pointer- name as the core
pointer. This option is ignored when the Lay- out section
specifies a core pointer. In the absence of both a Layout
section and this option, the first relevant InputDevice
section is used for the core pointer.</p>

<p>-quiet Suppress most informational messages at startup.
The verbosity level is set to zero.</p>

<p>-rgamma value Set the red gamma correction. value must
be between 0.1 and 10. The default is 1.0. Not all drivers
support this. See also the -gamma, -bgamma, and -ggamma
options.</p>

<p>-sharevts Share virtual terminals with another X server,
if supported by the OS.</p>

<p>-screen screen-name Use the xorg.conf(5) file Screen
section called screen-name. By default the screens
referenced by the default Layout section are used, or the
first Screen section when there are no Layout sections.</p>

<p>-showconfig This is the same as the -version option, and
is included for compatibility reasons. It may be removed in
a future release, so the -version option should be used
instead.</p>

<p>-showDefaultModulePath Print out the default module path
the server was compiled with.</p>

<p>-showDefaultLibPath Print out the path libraries should
be installed to.</p>

<p>-showopts For each driver module installed, print out
the list of options and their argument types.</p>

<p>-weight nnn Set RGB weighting at 16 bpp. The default is
565. This applies only to those drivers which support 16
bpp.</p>

<p>-verbose [n] Sets the verbosity level for information
printed on stderr. If the n value isnt supplied, each
occurrence of this option increments the verbosity level.
When the n value is supplied, the verbosity level is set to
that value. The default ver- bosity level is 0.</p>

<p>-version Print out the server version, patchlevel,
release date, the operating system/platform it was built on,
and whether it includes module loader support.</p>

<p>KEYBOARD The Xorg server is normally configured to
recognize various special combinations of key presses that
instruct the server to perform some action, rather than just
sending the key press event to a client appli- cation. These
actions depend on the XKB keymap loaded by a particular
keyboard device and may or may not be available on a given
configura- tion.</p>

<p>The following key combinations are commonly part of the
default XKEY- BOARD keymap.</p>

<p>Ctrl+Alt+Backspace Immediately kills the server -- no
questions asked. It can be disabled by setting the DontZap
xorg.conf(5) file option to a TRUE value.</p>

<p>It should be noted that zapping is triggered by the
Terminate_Server action in the keyboard map. This action is
not part of the default keymaps but can be enabled with the
XKB option &quot;terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp&quot;.</p>

<p>Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus Change video mode to next one
specified in the configuration file. This can be disabled
with the DontZoom xorg.conf(5) file option.</p>

<p>Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Minus Change video mode to previous one
specified in the configura- tion file. This can be disabled
with the DontZoom xorg.conf(5) file option.</p>

<p>Ctrl+Alt+F1...F12 For systems with virtual terminal
support, these keystroke com- binations are used to switch
to virtual terminals 1 through 12, respectively. This can be
disabled with the DontVTSwitch xorg.conf(5) file option.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION Xorg typically uses a configuration file
called xorg.conf and configu- ration files with the suffix
.conf in a directory called xorg.conf.d for its initial
setup. Refer to the xorg.conf(5) manual page for information
about the format of this file.</p>

<p>Xorg has a mechanism for automatically generating a
built-in configura- tion at run-time when no xorg.conf file
or xorg.conf.d files are present. The current version of
this automatic configuration mechanism works in two
ways.</p>

<p>The first is via enhancements that have made many
components of the xorg.conf file optional. This means that
information that can be probed or reasonably deduced doesnt
need to be specified explicitly, greatly reducing the amount
of built-in configuration information that needs to be
generated at run-time.</p>

<p>The second is to have &quot;safe&quot; fallbacks for
most configuration informa- tion. This maximises the
likelihood that the Xorg server will start up in some usable
configuration even when information about the specific
hardware is not available.</p>

<p>The automatic configuration support for Xorg is work in
progress. It is currently aimed at the most popular hardware
and software platforms supported by Xorg. Enhancements are
planned for future releases.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Xorg has many contributors world wide. The names
of most of them can be found in the documentation, ChangeLog
files in the source tree, and in the actual source code.</p>

<p>Xorg was originally based on XFree86 4.4rc2. That was
originally based on X386 1.2 by Thomas Roell, which was
contributed to the then X Con- sortiums X11R5 distribution
by SGCS.</p>

<p>Xorg is released by the X.Org Foundation.</p>

<p>The project that became XFree86 was originally founded
in 1992 by David Dawes, Glenn Lai, Jim Tsillas and David
Wexelblat.</p>

<p>XFree86 was later integrated in the then X Consortiums
X11R6 release by a group of dedicated XFree86 developers,
including the following:</p>
