<p>orbd(1) Java IDL and RMI-IIOP Tools orbd(1)</p>

<p>NAME orbd - Enables clients to locate and call
persistent objects on servers in the CORBA environment.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS orbd [ options ]</p>

<p>options Command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The orbd command enables clients to
transparently locate and call persistent objects on servers
in the CORBA environment. The Server Manager included with
the orbd tool is used to enable clients to transparently
locate and call persistent objects on servers in the CORBA
environment. The persistent servers, while publishing the
persistent object references in the naming service, include
the port number of the ORBD in the object reference instead
of the port number of the server. The inclusion of an ORBD
port number in the object reference for persistent object
references has the following advantages:</p>

<p>&middot; The object reference in the naming service
remains independent of the server life cycle. For example,
the object reference could be published by the server in the
Naming Service when it is first installed, and then,
independent of how many times the server is started or shut
down, the ORBD returns the correct object reference to the
calling client.</p>

<p>&middot; The client needs to look up the object
reference in the naming service only once, and can keep
reusing this reference independent of the changes introduced
due to server life cycle.</p>

<p>To access the ORBD Server Manager, the server must be
started using servertool, which is a command-line interface
for application programmers to register, unregister, start
up, and shut down a persistent server. For more information
on the Server Manager, see Server Manager.</p>

<p>When orbd starts, it also starts a naming service. For
more information about the naming service. See Start and
Stop the Naming Service.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -ORBInitialPort nameserverport Required.
Specifies the port on which the name server should be
started. After it is started, orbd listens for incoming
requests on this port. On Oracle Solaris software, you must
become the root user to start a process on a port below
1024. For this reason, Oracle recommends that you use a port
number above or equal to 1024.</p>

<p>NONREQUIRED OPTIONS -port port Specifies the activation
port where ORBD should be started, and where ORBD will be
accepting requests for persistent objects. The default value
for this port is 1049. This port number is added to the port
field of the persistent Interoperable Object References
(IOR).</p>

<p>-defaultdb directory Specifies the base where the ORBD
persistent storage directory, orb.db, is created. If this
option is not specified, then the default value is
./orb.db.</p>

<p>-serverPollingTime milliseconds Specifies how often ORBD
checks for the health of persistent servers registered
through servertool. The default value is 1000 ms. The value
specified for milliseconds must be a valid positive
integer.</p>

<p>-serverStartupDelay milliseconds Specifies how long ORBD
waits before sending a location forward exception after a
persistent server that is registered through servertool is
restarted. The default value is 1000 ms. The value specified
for milliseconds must be a valid positive integer.</p>

<p>-Joption Passes option to the Java Virtual Machine,
where option is one of the options described on the
reference page for the Java application launcher. For
example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory to 48 MB. See
java(1).</p>

<p>START AND STOP THE NAMING SERVICE A naming service is a
CORBA service that allows CORBA objects to be named by means
of binding a name to an object reference. The name binding
can be stored in the naming service, and a client can supply
the name to obtain the desired object reference.</p>

<p>Before running a client or a server, you will start
ORBD. ORBD includes a persistent naming service and a
transient naming service, both of which are an
implementation of the COS Naming Service.</p>

<p>The Persistent Naming Service provides persistence for
naming contexts. This means that this information is
persistent across service shutdowns and startups, and is
recoverable in the event of a service failure. If ORBD is
restarted, then the Persistent Naming Service restores the
naming context graph, so that the binding of all clients and
servers names remains intact (persistent).</p>

<p>For backward compatibility, tnameserv, a Transient
Naming Service that shipped with earlier releases of the
JDK, is also included in this release of Java SE. A
transient naming service retains naming contexts as long as
it is running. If there is a service interruption, then the
naming context graph is lost.</p>

<p>The -ORBInitialPort argument is a required command-line
argument for orbd, and is used to set the port number on
which the naming service runs. The following instructions
assume you can use port 1050 for the Java IDL Object Request
Broker Daemon. When using Oracle Solaris software, you must
become a root user to start a process on a port lower than
1024. For this reason, it is recommended that you use a port
number above or equal to 1024. You can substitute a
different port when necessary.</p>

<p>To start orbd from a UNIX command shell, enter:</p>

<p>orbd -ORBInitialPort 1050&amp;</p>

<p>From an MS-DOS system prompt (Windows), enter:</p>

<p>start orbd -ORBInitialPort 1050</p>

<p>Now that ORBD is running, you can run your server and
client applications. When running the client and server
applications, they must be made aware of the port number
(and machine name, when applicable) where the Naming Service
is running. One way to do this is to add the following code
to your application:</p>

<p>Properties props = new Properties();
props.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort&quot;,
&quot;1050&quot;);
props.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialHost&quot;,
&quot;MyHost&quot;); ORB orb = ORB.init(args, props);</p>

<p>In this example, the naming service is running on port
1050 on host MyHost. Another way is to specify the port
number and/or machine name when running the server or client
application from the command line. For example, you would
start your HelloApplication with the following command
line:</p>

<p>java HelloApplication -ORBInitialPort 1050
-ORBInitialHost MyHost</p>

<p>To stop the naming service, use the relevant operating
system command, such as pkillorbd on Oracle Solaris, or
Ctrl+C in the DOS window in which orbd is running. Note that
names registered with the naming service can disappear when
the service is terminated because of a transient naming
service. The Java IDL naming service will run until it is
explicitly stopped.</p>

<p>For more information about the naming service included
with ORBD, see Naming Service at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/idl/jidlNaming.html</p>

<p>SERVER MANAGER To access the ORBD Server Manager and run
a persistent server, the server must be started with
servertool, which is a command-line interface for
application programmers to register, unregister, start up,
and shut down a persistent server. When a server is started
using servertool, it must be started on the same host and
port on which orbd is executing. If the server is run on a
different port, then the information stored in the database
for local contexts will be invalid and the service will not
work properly.</p>

<p>See Java IDL: The &quot;Hello World&quot; Example at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/idl/jidlExample.html</p>

<p>In this example, you run the idlj compiler and javac
compiler as shown in the tutorial. To run the ORBD Server
Manager, follow these steps for running the application:</p>

<p>Start orbd.</p>

<p>UNIX command shell, enter: orbd -ORBInitialPort
1050.</p>

<p>MS-DOS system prompt (Windows), enter: start orbd
-ORBInitialPort 1050.</p>

<p>Port 1050 is the port on which you want the name server
to run. The -ORBInitialPort option is a required
command-line argument. When using Oracle Solaris software,
you must become a root user to start a process on a port
below 1024. For this reason, it is recommended that you use
a port number above or equal to 1024.</p>

<p>Start the servertool: servertool -ORBInitialPort
1050.</p>

<p>Make sure the name server (orbd) port is the same as in
the previous step, for example, -ORBInitialPort 1050. The
servertool must be started on the same port as the name
server.</p>

<p>In the servertool command line interface, start the
Hello server from the servertool prompt:</p>

<p>servertool &gt; register -server HelloServer -classpath
. -applicationName HelloServerApName</p>

<p>The servertool registers the server, assigns it the name
HelloServerApName, and displays its server ID with a listing
of all registered servers.Run the client application from
another terminal window or prompt:</p>

<p>java HelloClient -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost
localhost</p>

<p>For this example, you can omit -ORBInitialHost localhost
because the name server is running on the same host as the
Hello client. If the name server is running on a different
host, then use the -ORBInitialHost nameserverhost option to
specify the host on which the IDL name server is
running.Specify the name server (orbd) port as done in the
previous step, for example, -ORBInitialPort 1050. When you
finish experimenting with the ORBD Server Manager, be sure
to shut down or terminate the name server (orbd) and
servertool. To shut down orbd from am MS-DOS prompt, select
the window that is running the server and enter Ctrl+C to
shut it down.</p>

<p>To shut down orbd from an Oracle Solaris shell, find the
process, and terminate with the kill command. The server
continues to wait for invocations until it is explicitly
stopped. To shut down the servertool, type quit and press
the Enter key.</p>
