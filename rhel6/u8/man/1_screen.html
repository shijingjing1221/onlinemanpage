<p>SCREEN(1) SCREEN(1)</p>

<p>NAME screen - screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal
emulation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS screen [ -options ] [ cmd [ args ] ] screen -r
[[pid.]tty[.host]] screen -r
sessionowner/[[pid.]tty[.host]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Screen is a full-screen window manager that
multiplexes a physical ter- minal between several processes
(typically interactive shells). Each virtual terminal
provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal and, in
addition, several control functions from the ISO 6429 (ECMA
48, ANSI X3.64) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete
line and support for multiple character sets). There is a
scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a
copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text regions
between windows.</p>

<p>When screen is called, it creates a single window with a
shell in it (or the specified command) and then gets out of
your way so that you can use the program as you normally
would. Then, at any time, you can create new (full-screen)
windows with other programs in them (including more shells),
kill existing windows, view a list of windows, turn out- put
logging on and off, copy-and-paste text between windows,
view the scrollback history, switch between windows in
whatever manner you wish, etc. All windows run their
programs completely independent of each other. Programs
continue to run when their window is currently not vis- ible
and even when the whole screen session is detached from the
users terminal. When a program terminates, screen (per
default) kills the window that contained it. If this window
was in the foreground, the display switches to the previous
window; if none are left, screen exits.</p>

<p>Everything you type is sent to the program running in
the current win- dow. The only exception to this is the one
keystroke that is used to initiate a command to the window
manager. By default, each command begins with a control-a
(abbreviated C-a from now on), and is followed by one other
keystroke. The command character and all the key bindings
can be fully customized to be anything you like, though they
are always two characters in length.</p>

<p>Screen does not understand the prefix &quot;C-&quot; to
mean control. Please use the caret notation (&quot;^A&quot;
instead of &quot;C-a&quot;) as arguments to e.g. the escape
command or the -e option. Screen will also print out control
characters in caret notation.</p>

<p>The standard way to create a new window is to type
&quot;C-a c&quot;. This cre- ates a new window running a
shell and switches to that window immedi- ately, regardless
of the state of the process running in the current window.
Similarly, you can create a new window with a custom command
in it by first binding the command to a keystroke (in your
.screenrc file or at the &quot;C-a :&quot; command line) and
then using it just like the &quot;C-a c&quot; command. In
addition, new windows can be created by running a command
like:</p>

<p>screen emacs prog.c</p>

<p>from a shell prompt within a previously created window.
This will not run another copy of screen, but will instead
supply the command name and its arguments to the window
manager (specified in the $STY environ- ment variable) who
will use it to create the new window. The above example
would start the emacs editor (editing prog.c) and switch to
its window.</p>

<p>If &quot;/etc/utmp&quot; is writable by screen, an
appropriate record will be written to this file for each
window, and removed when the window is terminated. This is
useful for working with &quot;talk&quot;,
&quot;script&quot;, &quot;shut- down&quot;,
&quot;rsend&quot;, &quot;sccs&quot; and other similar
programs that use the utmp file to determine who you are. As
long as screen is active on your ter- minal, the terminal s
own record is removed from the utmp file. See also &quot;C-a
L&quot;.</p>

<p>GETTING STARTED Before you begin to use screen youll
need to make sure you have cor- rectly selected your
terminal type, just as you would for any other
termcap/terminfo program. (You can do this by using tset for
example.)</p>

<p>If you re impatient and want to get started without
doing a lot more reading, you should remember this one
command: &quot;C-a ?&quot;. Typing these two characters will
display a list of the available screen commands and their
bindings. Each keystroke is discussed in the section
&quot;DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS&quot;. The manual section
&quot;CUSTOMIZATION&quot; deals with the contents of your
.screenrc.</p>

<p>If your terminal is a &quot;true&quot; auto-margin
terminal (it doesnt allow the last position on the screen to
be updated without scrolling the screen) consider using a
version of your terminal s termcap that has automatic
margins turned off. This will ensure an accurate and optimal
update of the screen in all circumstances. Most terminals
nowadays have &quot;magic&quot; margins (automatic margins
plus usable last column). This is the VT100 style type and
perfectly suited for screen. If all youve got is a
&quot;true&quot; auto-margin terminal screen will be content
to use it, but updating a character put into the last
position on the screen may not be possible until the screen
scrolls or the character is moved into a safe position in
some other way. This delay can be shortened by using a
terminal with insert-character capability.</p>

<p>COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS Screen has the following
command-line options:</p>

<p>-a include all capabilities (with some minor exceptions)
in each win- dows termcap, even if screen must redraw parts
of the display in order to implement a function.</p>

<p>-A Adapt the sizes of all windows to the size of the
current termi- nal. By default, screen tries to restore its
old window sizes when attaching to resizable terminals
(those with &quot;WS&quot; in its description, e.g. suncmd
or some xterm).</p>

<p>-c file override the default configuration file from
&quot;$HOME/.screenrc&quot; to file.</p>

<p>-d|-D [pid.tty.host] does not start screen, but detaches
the elsewhere running screen session. It has the same effect
as typing &quot;C-a d&quot; from screens controlling
terminal. -D is the equivalent to the power detach key. If
no session can be detached, this option is ignored. In
combination with the -r/-R option more powerful effects can
be achieved:</p>

<p>-d -r Reattach a session and if necessary detach it
first.</p>

<p>-d -R Reattach a session and if necessary detach or even
create it first.</p>

<p>-d -RR Reattach a session and if necessary detach or
create it. Use the first session if more than one session is
available.</p>

<p>-D -r Reattach a session. If necessary detach and logout
remotely first.</p>

<p>-D -R Attach here and now. In detail this means: If a
session is run- ning, then reattach. If necessary detach and
logout remotely first. If it was not running create it and
notify the user. This is the authors favorite.</p>

<p>-D -RR Attach here and now. Whatever that means, just do
it.</p>

<p>Note: It is always a good idea to check the status of
your ses- sions by means of &quot;screen -list&quot;.</p>

<p>-e xy specifies the command character to be x and the
character generat- ing a literal command character to y
(when typed after the command character). The default is
&quot;C-a&quot; and a, which can be specified as
&quot;-e^Aa&quot;. When creating a screen session, this
option sets the default command character. In a multiuser
session all users added will start off with this command
character. But when attaching to an already running session,
this option changes only the command character of the
attaching user. This option is equivalent to either the
commands &quot;defescape&quot; or &quot;escape&quot;
respectively.</p>

<p>-f, -fn, and -fa turns flow-control on, off, or
&quot;automatic switching mode&quot;. This can also be
defined through the &quot;defflow&quot; .screenrc
command.</p>

<p>-h num Specifies the history scrollback buffer to be num
lines high.</p>

<p>-i will cause the interrupt key (usually C-c) to
interrupt the dis- play immediately when flow-control is on.
See the &quot;defflow&quot; .screenrc command for details.
The use of this option is discour- aged.</p>

<p>-l and -ln turns login mode on or off (for /etc/utmp
updating). This can also be defined through the
&quot;deflogin&quot; .screenrc command.</p>

<p>-ls and -list does not start screen, but prints a list
of pid.tty.host strings identifying your screen sessions.
Sessions marked detached can be resumed with &quot;screen
-r&quot;. Those marked attached are running and have a
controlling terminal. If the session runs in multiuser mode,
it is marked multi. Sessions marked as unreachable either
live on a different host or are dead. An unreachable session
is considered dead, when its name matches either the name of
the local host, or the specified parameter, if any. See the
-r flag for a description how to construct matches. Sessions
marked as dead should be thoroughly checked and removed. Ask
your sys- tem administrator if you are not sure. Remove
sessions with the -wipe option.</p>

<p>-L tells screen to turn on automatic output logging for
the windows.</p>

<p>-m causes screen to ignore the $STY environment
variable. With &quot;screen -m&quot; creation of a new
session is enforced, regardless whether screen is called
from within another screen session or not. This flag has a
special meaning in connection with the -d option:</p>

<p>-d -m Start screen in &quot;detached&quot; mode. This
creates a new session but doesnt attach to it. This is
useful for system startup scripts.</p>

<p>-D -m This also starts screen in &quot;detached&quot;
mode, but doesnt fork a new process. The command exits if
the session terminates.</p>

<p>-O selects a more optimal output mode for your terminal
rather than true VT100 emulation (only affects auto-margin
terminals without LP ). This can also be set in your
.screenrc by specifying OP in a &quot;termcap&quot;
command.</p>

<p>-p number_or_name Preselect a window. This is usefull
when you want to reattach to a specific windor or you want
to send a command via the &quot;-X&quot; option to a
specific window. As with screens select commant,
&quot;-&quot; selects the blank window. As a special case
for reattach, &quot;=&quot; brings up the windowlist on the
blank window.</p>

<p>-q Suppress printing of error messages. In combination
with &quot;-ls&quot; the exit value is as follows: 9
indicates a directory without ses- sions. 10 indicates a
directory with running but not attachable sessions. 11 (or
more) indicates 1 (or more) usable sessions. In combination
with &quot;-r&quot; the exit value is as follows: 10
indicates that there is no session to resume. 12 (or more)
indicates that there are 2 (or more) sessions to resume and
you should specify which one to choose. In all other cases
&quot;-q&quot; has no effect.</p>

<p>-r [pid.tty.host] -r sessionowner/[pid.tty.host] resumes
a detached screen session. No other options (except com-
binations with -d/-D) may be specified, though an optional
prefix of [pid.]tty.host may be needed to distinguish
between multiple detached screen sessions. The second form
is used to connect to another user s screen session which
runs in multiuser mode. This indicates that screen should
look for sessions in another users directory. This requires
setuid-root.</p>

<p>-R attempts to resume the first detached screen session
it finds. If successful, all other command-line options are
ignored. If no detached session exists, starts a new session
using the specified options, just as if -R had not been
specified. The option is set by default if screen is run as
a login-shell (actually screen uses &quot;-xRR&quot; in that
case). For combinations with the -d/-D option see there.</p>

<p>-s sets the default shell to the program specified,
instead of the value in the environment variable $SHELL (or
&quot;/bin/sh&quot; if not defined). This can also be
defined through the &quot;shell&quot; .screenrc command.</p>

<p>-S sessionname When creating a new session, this option
can be used to specify a meaningful name for the session.
This name identifies the session for &quot;screen
-list&quot; and &quot;screen -r&quot; actions. It
substitutes the default [tty.host] suffix.</p>

<p>-t name sets the title (a.k.a.) for the default shell or
specified pro- gram. See also the &quot;shelltitle&quot;
.screenrc command.</p>

<p>-U Run screen in UTF-8 mode. This option tells screen
that your ter- minal sends and understands UTF-8 encoded
characters. It also sets the default encoding for new
windows to utf8.</p>

<p>-v Print version number.</p>

<p>-wipe [match] does the same as &quot;screen -ls&quot;,
but removes destroyed sessions instead of marking them as
dead . An unreachable session is con- sidered dead, when its
name matches either the name of the local host, or the
explicitly given parameter, if any. See the -r flag for a
description how to construct matches.</p>

<p>-x Attach to a not detached screen session. (Multi
display mode).</p>

<p>-X Send the specified command to a running screen
session. You can use the -d or -r option to tell screen to
look only for attached or detached screen sessions. Note
that this command doesnt work if the session is password
protected.</p>

<p>DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS As mentioned, each screen command
consists of a &quot;C-a&quot; followed by one other
character. For your convenience, all commands that are bound
to lower-case letters are also bound to their control
character counter- parts (with the exception of &quot;C-a
a&quot;; see below), thus, &quot;C-a c&quot; as well as
&quot;C-a C-c&quot; can be used to create a window. See
section &quot;CUSTOMIZA- TION&quot; for a description of the
command.</p>

<p>The following table shows the default key bindings:</p>

<p>C-a (select) Prompt for a window name or number to
switch to.</p>

<p>C-a &quot; (windowlist -b) Present a list of all windows

window.</p>

<p>C-a tab (focus) Switch the input focus to the next
region.</p>

<p>C-a C-a (other) Toggle to the window displayed
previously. Note that this binding defaults to the com- mand
character typed twice, unless overrid- den. For instance, if
you use the option &quot;-e]x&quot;, this command becomes
&quot;]]&quot;.</p>

<p>CUSTOMIZATION The &quot;socket directory&quot; defaults
either to $HOME/.screen or simply to /tmp/screens or
preferably to /usr/local/screens chosen at compile- time. If
screen is installed setuid-root, then the administrator
should compile screen with an adequate (not NFS mounted)
socket directory. If screen is not running setuid-root, the
user can specify any mode 700 directory in the environment
variable $SCREENDIR.</p>

<p>When screen is invoked, it executes initialization
commands from the files &quot;/etc/screenrc&quot; and
&quot;.screenrc&quot; in the user s home directory. These
are the &quot;programmer s defaults&quot; that can be
overridden in the following ways: for the global screenrc
file screen searches for the environment variable
$SYSSCREENRC (this override feature may be dis- abled at
compile-time). The user specific screenrc file is searched
in $SCREENRC, then $HOME/.screenrc. The command line option
-c takes precedence over the above user screenrc files.</p>

<p>Commands in these files are used to set options, bind
functions to keys, and to automatically establish one or
more windows at the begin- ning of your screen session.
Commands are listed one per line, with empty lines being
ignored. A command s arguments are separated by tabs or
spaces, and may be surrounded by single or double quotes. A
# turns the rest of the line into a comment, except in
quotes. Unintel- ligible lines are warned about and ignored.
Commands may contain ref- erences to environment variables.
The syntax is the shell-like &quot;$VAR &quot; or
&quot;${VAR}&quot;. Note that this causes incompatibility
with previous screen versions, as now the $-character has to
be protected with if no variable substitution shall be
performed. A string in single-quotes is also protected from
variable substitution.</p>

<p>Two configuration files are shipped as examples with
your screen dis- tribution: &quot;etc/screenrc&quot; and
&quot;etc/etcscreenrc&quot;. They contain a number of useful
examples for various commands.</p>

<p>Customization can also be done on-line. To enter the
command mode type C-a :. Note that commands starting with
&quot;def&quot; change default values, while others change
current settings.</p>

<p>The following commands are available:</p>

<p>acladd usernames [crypted-pw] addacl usernames</p>

<p>Enable users to fully access this screen session.
Usernames can be one user or a comma separated list of
users. This command enables to attach to the screen session
and performs the equivalent of aclchg usernames +rwx
&quot;#?&quot;. executed. To add a user with restricted
access, use the aclchg command below. If an optional second
parameter is supplied, it should be a crypted password for
the named user(s). Addacl is a synonym to acladd. Multi user
mode only.</p>

<p>aclchg usernames permbits list chacl usernames permbits
list</p>

<p>Change permissions for a comma separated list of users.
Permission bits are represented as r, w and x. Prefixing +
grants the permis- sion, - removes it. The third parameter
is a comma separated list of commands and/or windows
(specified either by number or title). The spe- cial list #
refers to all windows, ? to all commands. if usernames
consists of a single *, all known users are affected. A
command can be executed when the user has the x bit for it.
The user can type input to a window when he has its w bit
set and no other user obtains a writelock for this window.
Other bits are currently ignored. To withdraw the writelock
from another user in window 2: aclchg username -w+w 2. To
allow read-only access to the session: aclchg username -w
&quot;#&quot;. As soon as a users name is known to screen he
can attach to the session and (per default) has full
permissions for all command and win- dows. Execution
permission for the acl commands, at and others should also
be removed or the user may be able to regain write
permission. Rights of the special username nobody cannot be
changed (see the &quot;su&quot; command). Chacl is a synonym
to aclchg. Multi user mode only.</p>

<p>acldel username</p>

<p>Remove a user from screen s access control list. If
currently attached, all the users displays are detached from
the session. He cannot attach again. Multi user mode
only.</p>

<p>aclgrp username [groupname]</p>

<p>Creates groups of users that share common access rights.
The name of the group is the username of the group leader.
Each member of the group inherits the permissions that are
granted to the group leader. That means, if a user fails an
access check, another check is made for the group leader. A
user is removed from all groups the special value
&quot;none&quot; is used for groupname. If the second
parameter is omitted all groups the user is in are
listed.</p>

<p>aclumask [[users]+bits |[users]-bits .... ] umask
[[users]+bits |[users]-bits .... ]</p>

<p>This specifies the access other users have to windows
that will be cre- ated by the caller of the command. Users
may be no, one or a comma separated list of known usernames.
If no users are specified, a list of all currently known
users is assumed. Bits is any combination of access control
bits allowed defined with the &quot;aclchg&quot; command.
The spe- cial username &quot;?&quot; predefines the access
that not yet known users will be granted to any window
initially. The special username &quot;??&quot; prede- fines
the access that not yet known users are granted to any
command. Rights of the special username nobody cannot be
changed (see the &quot;su&quot; command). Umask is a synonym
to aclumask.</p>

<p>activity message</p>

<p>When any activity occurs in a background window that is
being moni- tored, screen displays a notification in the
message line. The notifi- cation message can be re-defined
by means of the &quot;activity&quot; command. Each
occurrence of % in message is replaced by the number of the
win- dow in which activity has occurred, and each occurrence
of ^G is replaced by the definition for bell in your termcap
(usually an audible bell). The default message is</p>

<p>Activity in window %n</p>

<p>Note that monitoring is off for all windows by default,
but can be altered by use of the &quot;monitor&quot; command
(C-a M).</p>

<p>allpartial on|off</p>

<p>If set to on, only the current cursor line is refreshed
on window change. This affects all windows and is useful for
slow terminal lines. The previous setting of full/partial
refresh for each window is restored with &quot;allpartial
off&quot;. This is a global flag that immediately takes
effect on all windows overriding the &quot;partial&quot;
settings. It does not change the default redraw behavior of
newly created windows.</p>

<p>altscreen on|off</p>

<p>If set to on, &quot;alternate screen&quot; support is
enabled in virtual termi- nals, just like in xterm. Initial
setting is off.</p>

<p>at [identifier][#|*|%] command [args ... ]</p>

<p>Execute a command at other displays or windows as if it
had been entered there. &quot;At&quot; changes the context
(the current window or cur- rent display setting) of the
command. If the first parameter describes a non-unique
context, the command will be executed multiple times. If the
first parameter is of the form identifier* then identifier
is matched against user names. The command is executed once
for each dis- play of the selected user(s). If the first
parameter is of the form identifier% identifier is matched
against displays. Displays are named after the ttys they
attach. The prefix /dev/ or /dev/tty may be omitted from the
identifier. If identifier has a # or nothing appended it is
matched against window numbers and titles. Omitting an
identifier in front of the #, * or %-character selects all
users, displays or windows because a prefix-match is
performed. Note that on the affected display(s) a short
message will describe what happened. Permission is checked
for initiator of the &quot;at&quot; command, not for the
owners of the affected display(s). Note that the # character
works as a comment introducer when it is preceded by
whitespace. This can be escaped by prefixing a . Permission
is checked for the initiator of the &quot;at&quot; command,
not for the owners of the affected display(s). Caveat: When
matching against windows, the command is executed at least
once per window. Commands that change the internal
arrangement of win- dows (like &quot;other&quot;) may be
called again. In shared windows the command will be repeated
for each attached display. Beware, when issuing toggle
commands like &quot;login&quot;! Some commands (e.g.
&quot;process&quot;) require that a display is associated
with the target windows. These commands may not work
correctly under &quot;at&quot; looping over windows.</p>

<p>attrcolor attrib [attribute/color-modifier]</p>

<p>This command can be used to highlight attributes by
changing the color of the text. If the attribute attrib is
in use, the specified attribute/color modifier is also
applied. If no modifier is given, the current one is
deleted. See the &quot;STRING ESCAPES&quot; chapter for the
syntax of the modifier. Screen understands two
pseudo-attributes, &quot;i&quot; stands for high-intensity
foreground color and &quot;I&quot; for high-intensity back-
ground color.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>attrcolor b &quot;R&quot;</p>

<p>Change the color to bright red if bold text is to be
printed.</p>

<p>attrcolor u &quot;-u b&quot;</p>

<p>Use blue text instead of underline.</p>

<p>attrcolor b &quot;.I&quot;</p>

<p>Use bright colors for bold text. Most terminal emulators
do this already.</p>

<p>attrcolor i &quot;+b&quot;</p>

<p>Make bright colored text also bold.</p>

<p>autodetach on|off</p>

<p>Sets whether screen will automatically detach upon
hangup, which saves all your running programs until they are
resumed with a screen -r com- mand. When turned off, a
hangup signal will terminate screen and all the processes it
contains. Autodetach is on by default.</p>

<p>autonuke on|off</p>

<p>Sets whether a clear screen sequence should nuke all the
output that has not been written to the terminal. See also
&quot;obuflimit&quot;.</p>

<p>backtick id lifespan autorefresh cmd args... backtick
id</p>

<p>Program the backtick command with the numerical id id.
The output of such a command is used for substitution of the
&quot;%&quot; string escape. The specified lifespan is the
number of seconds the output is considered valid. After this
time, the command is run again if a corresponding string
escape is encountered. The autorefresh parameter triggers an
automatic refresh for caption and hardstatus strings after
the speci- fied number of seconds. Only the last line of
output is used for sub- stitution. If both the lifespan and
the autorefresh parameters are zero, the back- tick program
is expected to stay in the background and generate output
once in a while. In this case, the command is executed right
away and screen stores the last line of output. If a new
line gets printed screen will automatically refresh the
hardstatus or the captions. The second form of the command
deletes the backtick command with the numerical id id.</p>

<p>bce [on|off]</p>

<p>Change background-color-erase setting. If
&quot;bce&quot; is set to on, all char- acters cleared by an
erase/insert/scroll/clear operation will be dis- played in
the current background color. Otherwise the default back-
ground color is used.</p>

<p>bell_msg [message]</p>

<p>When a bell character is sent to a background window,
screen displays a notification in the message line. The
notification message can be re- defined by this command.
Each occurrence of % in message is replaced by the number of
the window to which a bell has been sent, and each
occurrence of ^G is replaced by the definition for bell in
your term- cap (usually an audible bell). The default
message is</p>

<p>Bell in window %n</p>

<p>An empty message can be supplied to the
&quot;bell_msg&quot; command to suppress output of a message
line (bell_msg &quot;&quot;). Without parameter, the current
message is shown.</p>

<p>bind [-c class] key [command [args]]</p>

<p>Bind a command to a key. By default, most of the
commands provided by screen are bound to one or more keys as
indicated in the &quot;DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS&quot; section,
e.g. the command to create a new window is bound to
&quot;C-c&quot; and &quot;c&quot;. The &quot;bind&quot;
command can be used to redefine the key bindings and to
define new bindings. The key argument is either a sin- gle
character, a two-character sequence of the form
&quot;^x&quot; (meaning &quot;C- x&quot;), a backslash
followed by an octal number (specifying the ASCII code of
the character), or a backslash followed by a second
character, such as &quot;&quot; or &quot;\&quot;. The
argument can also be quoted, if you like. If no further
argument is given, any previously established binding for
this key is removed. The command argument can be any command
listed in this section.</p>

<p>If a command class is specified via the &quot;-c&quot;
option, the key is bound for the specified class. Use the
&quot;command&quot; command to activate a class. Command
classes can be used to create multiple command keys or
multi- character bindings.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p>bind windows bind ^k bind k bind K kill bind ^f screen
telnet foobar bind 33 screen -ln -t root -h 1000 9 su</p>

<p>would bind the space key to the command that displays a
list of windows (so that the command usually invoked by
&quot;C-a C-w&quot; would also be avail- able as &quot;C-a
space&quot;). The next three lines remove the default kill
binding from &quot;C-a C-k&quot; and &quot;C-a k&quot;.
&quot;C-a K&quot; is then bound to the kill command. Then it
binds &quot;C-f&quot; to the command &quot;create a window
with a TELNET connection to foobar&quot;, and bind
&quot;escape&quot; to the command that creates an non-login
window with a.k.a. &quot;root&quot; in slot #9, with a supe-
ruser shell and a scrollback buffer of 1000 lines.</p>

<p>bind -c demo1 0 select 10 bind -c demo1 1 select 11 bind
-c demo1 2 select 12 bindkey &quot;^B&quot; command -c
demo1</p>

<p>makes &quot;C-b 0&quot; select window 10, &quot;C-b
1&quot; window 11, etc.</p>

<p>bind -c demo2 0 select 10 bind -c demo2 1 select 11 bind
-c demo2 2 select 12 bind - command -c demo2</p>

<p>makes &quot;C-a - 0&quot; select window 10, &quot;C-a -
1&quot; window 11, etc.</p>

<p>bindkey [-d] [-m] [-a] [[-k|-t] string [cmd args]]</p>

<p>This command manages screen s input translation tables.
Every entry in one of the tables tells screen how to react
if a certain sequence of characters is encountered. There
are three tables: one that should con- tain actions
programmed by the user, one for the default actions used for
terminal emulation and one for screens copy mode to do
cursor movement. See section &quot;INPUT TRANSLATION&quot;
for a list of default key bindings. If the -d option is
given, bindkey modifies the default table, -m changes the
copy mode table and with neither option the user table is
selected. The argument string is the sequence of characters
to which an action is bound. This can either be a fixed
string or a termcap key- board capability name (selectable
with the -k option). Some keys on a VT100 terminal can send
a different string if applica- tion mode is turned on (e.g
the cursor keys). Such keys have two entries in the
translation table. You can select the application mode entry
by specifying the -a option. The -t option tells screen not
to do inter-character timing. One cannot turn off the timing
if a termcap capability is used. Cmd can be any of screen s
commands with an arbitrary number of args. If cmd is omitted
the key-binding is removed from the table. Here are some
examples of keyboard bindings:</p>

<p>bindkey -d Show all of the default key bindings. The
application mode entries are marked with [A].</p>

<p>bindkey -k k1 select 1 Make the &quot;F1&quot; key
switch to window one.</p>

<p>bindkey -t foo stuff barfoo Make &quot;foo&quot; an
abbreviation of the word &quot;barfoo&quot;. Timeout is
disabled so that users can type slowly.</p>

<p>bindkey &quot; 24&quot; mapdefault This key-binding
makes &quot;^T&quot; an escape character for key-bindings.
If you did the above &quot;stuff barfoo&quot; binding, you
can enter the word &quot;foo&quot; by typing
&quot;^Tfoo&quot;. If you want to insert a &quot;^T&quot;
you have to press the key twice (i.e. escape the escape
binding).</p>

<p>bindkey -k F1 command Make the F11 (not F1!) key an
alternative screen escape (besides ^A).</p>

<p>break [duration]</p>

<p>Send a break signal for duration*0.25 seconds to this
window. For non- Posix systems the time interval may be
rounded up to full seconds. Most useful if a character
device is attached to the window rather than a shell process
(See also chapter &quot;WINDOW TYPES&quot;). The maximum
duration of a break signal is limited to 15 seconds.</p>

<p>blanker</p>

<p>Activate the screen blanker. First the screen is
cleared. If no blanker program is defined, the cursor is
turned off, otherwise, the program is started and its output
is written to the screen. The screen blanker is killed with
the first keypress, the read key is discarded. This command
is normally used together with the &quot;idle&quot;
command.</p>

<p>blankerprg [program args]</p>

<p>Defines a blanker program. Disables the blanker program
if no arguments are given.</p>

<p>breaktype [tcsendbreak|TIOCSBRK |TCSBRK]</p>

<p>Choose one of the available methods of generating a
break signal for terminal devices. This command should
affect the current window only. But it still behaves
identical to &quot;defbreaktype&quot;. This will be changed
in the future. Calling &quot;breaktype&quot; with no
parameter displays the break method for the current
window.</p>

<p>bufferfile [exchange-file]</p>

<p>Change the filename used for reading and writing with
the paste buffer. If the optional argument to the
&quot;bufferfile&quot; command is omitted, the default
setting (&quot;/tmp/screen-exchange&quot;) is reactivated.
The following example will paste the systems password file
into the screen window (using the paste buffer, where a copy
remains):</p>

<p>C-a : bufferfile /etc/passwd C-a &lt; C-a ] C-a :
bufferfile</p>

<p>c1 [on|off]</p>

<p>Change c1 code processing. &quot;C1 on&quot; tells
screen to treat the input characters between 128 and 159 as
control functions. Such an 8-bit code is normally the same
as ESC followed by the corresponding 7-bit code. The default
setting is to process c1 codes and can be changed with the
&quot;defc1&quot; command. Users with fonts that have usable
characters in the c1 positions may want to turn this
off.</p>

<p>caption always|splitonly [string] caption string
[string]</p>

<p>This command controls the display of the window
captions. Normally a caption is only used if more than one
window is shown on the display (split screen mode). But if
the type is set to always screen shows a caption even if
only one window is displayed. The default is splitonly.</p>

<p>The second form changes the text used for the caption.
You can use all escapes from the &quot;STRING ESCAPES&quot;
chapter. Screen uses a default of %3n %t.</p>

<p>You can mix both forms by providing a string as an
additional argument.</p>

<p>charset set</p>

<p>Change the current character set slot designation and
charset mapping. The first four character of set are treated
as charset designators while the fifth and sixth character
must be in range 0 to 3 and set the GL/GR charset mapping.
On every position a . may be used to indi- cate that the
corresponding charset/mapping should not be changed (set is
padded to six characters internally by appending . chars).
New windows have &quot;BBBB02&quot; as default charset,
unless a &quot;encoding&quot; command is active. The current
setting can be viewed with the &quot;info&quot; command.</p>

<p>chdir [directory]</p>

<p>Change the current directory of screen to the specified
directory or, if called without an argument, to your home
directory (the value of the environment variable $HOME). All
windows that are created by means of the &quot;screen&quot;
command from within &quot;.screenrc&quot; or by means of
&quot;C-a : screen ...&quot; or &quot;C-a c&quot; use this
as their default directory. Without a chdir command, this
would be the directory from which screen was invoked.
Hardcopy and log files are always written to the windows
default directory, not the current directory of the process
running in the window. You can use this command multiple
times in your .screenrc to start various windows in
different default directories, but the last chdir value will
affect all the windows you create interactively.</p>

<p>clear</p>

<p>Clears the current window and saves its image to the
scrollback buffer.</p>

<p>colon [prefix]</p>

<p>Allows you to enter &quot;.screenrc&quot; command lines.
Useful for on-the-fly modification of key bindings, specific
window creation and changing settings. Note that the
&quot;set&quot; keyword no longer exists! Usually com- mands
affect the current window rather than default settings for
future windows. Change defaults with commands starting with
def....</p>

<p>If you consider this as the Ex command mode of screen,
you may regard &quot;C-a esc&quot; (copy mode) as its Vi
command mode.</p>

<p>command [-c class]</p>

<p>This command has the same effect as typing the screen
escape character (^A). It is probably only useful for key
bindings. If the &quot;-c&quot; option is given, select the
specified command class. See also &quot;bind&quot; and
&quot;bindkey&quot;.</p>

<p>compacthist [on|off]</p>

<p>This tells screen whether to suppress trailing blank
lines when scrolling up text into the history buffer.</p>

<p>console [on|off]</p>

<p>Grabs or un-grabs the machines console output to a
window. Note: Only the owner of /dev/console can grab the
console output. This command is only available if the
machine supports the ioctl TIOCCONS.</p>

<p>copy</p>

<p>Enter copy/scrollback mode. This allows you to copy text
from the cur- rent window and its history into the paste
buffer. In this mode a vi- like full screen editor is
active: Movement keys: h, j, k, l move the cursor line by
line or column by column. 0, ^ and $ move to the leftmost
column, to the first or last non- whitespace character on
the line. H, M and L move the cursor to the leftmost column
of the top, center or bottom line of the window. + and -
positions one line up and down. G moves to the specified
absolute line (default: end of buffer). | moves to the
specified absolute column. w, b, e move the cursor word by
word. B, E move the cursor WORD by WORD (as in vi). C-u and
C-d scroll the display up/down by the specified amount of
lines while preserving the cursor position. (Default: half
screen- full). C-b and C-f scroll the display up/down a full
screen. g moves to the beginning of the buffer. % jumps to
the specified percentage of the buffer.</p>

<p>Note: Emacs style movement keys can be customized by a
.screenrc command. (E.g. markkeys
&quot;h=^B:l=^F:$=^E&quot;) There is no simple method for a
full emacs-style keymap, as this involves multi-character
codes.</p>

<p>Marking: The copy range is specified by setting two
marks. The text between these marks will be highlighted.
Press space to set the first or second mark respectively. Y
and y used to mark one whole line or to mark from start of
line. W marks exactly one word. Repeat count: Any of these
commands can be prefixed with a repeat count number by
pressing digits 0..9 which is taken as a repeat count.
Example: &quot;C-a C-[ H 10 j 5 Y&quot; will copy lines 11
to 15 into the paste buffer. Searching: / Vi-like search
forward. ? Vi-like search backward. C-a s Emacs style
incremental search forward. C-r Emacs style reverse
i-search. Specials: There are however some keys that act
differently than in vi. Vi does not allow one to yank
rectangular blocks of text, but screen does. Press c or C to
set the left or right margin respectively. If no repeat
count is given, both default to the current cursor position.
Example: Try this on a rather full text screen: &quot;C-a [
M 20 l SPACE c 10 l 5 j C SPACE&quot;.</p>

<p>This moves one to the middle line of the screen, moves
in 20 columns left, marks the beginning of the paste buffer,
sets the left column, moves 5 columns down, sets the right
column, and then marks the end of the paste buffer. Now try:
&quot;C-a [ M 20 l SPACE 10 l 5 j SPACE&quot;</p>

<p>and notice the difference in the amount of text copied.
J joins lines. It toggles between 4 modes: lines separated
by a new- line character (012), lines glued seamless, lines
separated by a single whitespace and comma separated lines.
Note that you can prepend the newline character with a
carriage return character, by issuing a &quot;crlf on&quot;.
v is for all the vi users with &quot;:set numbers&quot; - it
toggles the left margin between column 9 and 1. Press a
before the final space key to toggle in append mode. Thus
the con- tents of the paste buffer will not be overwritten,
but is appended to. A toggles in append mode and sets a
(second) mark. &gt; sets the (second) mark and writes the
contents of the paste buffer to the screen-exchange file
(/tmp/screen-exchange per default) once copy-mode is
finished. This example demonstrates how to dump the whole
scrollback buffer to that file: &quot;C-A [ g SPACE G $
&gt;&quot;. C-g gives information about the current line and
column. x exchanges the first mark and the current cursor
position. You can use this to adjust an already placed mark.
@ does nothing. Does not even exit copy mode. All keys not
described here exit copy mode.</p>

<p>copy_reg [key]</p>

<p>No longer exists, use &quot;readreg&quot; instead.</p>

<p>crlf [on|off]</p>

<p>This affects the copying of text regions with the C-a [
command. If it is set to on, lines will be separated by the
two character sequence CR - LF. Otherwise (default) only LF
is used. When no parameter is given, the state is
toggled.</p>

<p>debug on|off</p>

<p>Turns runtime debugging on or off. If screen has been
compiled with option -DDEBUG debugging available and is
turned on per default. Note that this command only affects
debugging output from the main &quot;SCREEN&quot; process
correctly. Debug output from attacher processes can only be
turned off once and forever.</p>

<p>defc1 on|off</p>

<p>Same as the c1 command except that the default setting
for new windows is changed. Initial setting is on.</p>

<p>defautonuke on|off</p>

<p>Same as the autonuke command except that the default
setting for new displays is changed. Initial setting is off.
Note that you can use the special AN terminal capability if
you want to have a dependency on the terminal type.</p>

<p>defbce on|off</p>

<p>Same as the bce command except that the default setting
for new windows is changed. Initial setting is off.</p>

<p>defbreaktype [tcsendbreak|TIOCSBRK |TCSBRK]</p>

<p>Choose one of the available methods of generating a
break signal for terminal devices. The preferred methods are
tcsendbreak and TIOCSBRK. The third, TCSBRK, blocks the
complete screen session for the duration of the break, but
it may be the only way to generate long breaks. Tcsendbreak
and TIOCSBRK may or may not produce long breaks with spikes
(e.g. 4 per second). This is not only system dependant, this
also dif- fers between serial board drivers. Calling
&quot;defbreaktype&quot; with no parameter displays the
current setting.</p>

<p>defcharset [set]</p>

<p>Like the charset command except that the default setting
for new win- dows is changed. Shows current default if
called without argument.</p>

<p>defescape xy</p>

<p>Set the default command characters. This is equivalent
to the &quot;escape&quot; except that it is useful multiuser
sessions only. In a multiuser ses- sion &quot;escape&quot;
changes the command character of the calling user, where
&quot;defescape&quot; changes the default command characters
for users that will be added later.</p>

<p>defflow on|off|auto [interrupt]</p>

<p>Same as the flow command except that the default setting
for new win- dows is changed. Initial setting is auto.
Specifying &quot;defflow auto interrupt&quot; is the same as
the command-line options -fa and -i.</p>

<p>defgr on|off</p>

<p>Same as the gr command except that the default setting
for new windows is changed. Initial setting is off.</p>

<p>defhstatus [status]</p>

<p>The hardstatus line that all new windows will get is set
to status. This command is useful to make the hardstatus of
every window display the window number or title or the like.
Status may contain the same directives as in the window
messages, but the directive escape charac- ter is ^E (octal
005) instead of %. This was done to make a misin-
terpretation of program generated hardstatus lines
impossible. If the parameter status is omitted, the current
default string is displayed. Per default the hardstatus line
of new windows is empty.</p>

<p>defencoding enc</p>

<p>Same as the encoding command except that the default
setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is the
encoding taken from the ter- minal.</p>

<p>deflog on|off</p>

<p>Same as the log command except that the default setting
for new windows is changed. Initial setting is off.</p>

<p>deflogin on|off</p>

<p>Same as the login command except that the default
setting for new win- dows is changed. This is initialized
with on as distributed (see con- fig.h.in).</p>

<p>defmode mode</p>

<p>The mode of each newly allocated pseudo-tty is set to
mode. Mode is an octal number. When no &quot;defmode&quot;
command is given, mode 0622 is used.</p>

<p>defmonitor on|off</p>

<p>Same as the monitor command except that the default
setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is
off.</p>

<p>defnonblock on|off|numsecs</p>

<p>Same as the nonblock command except that the default
setting for dis- plays is changed. Initial setting is
off.</p>

<p>defobuflimit limit</p>

<p>Same as the obuflimit command except that the default
setting for new displays is changed. Initial setting is 256
bytes. Note that you can use the special OL terminal
capability if you want to have a depen- dency on the
terminal type.</p>

<p>defscrollback num</p>

<p>Same as the scrollback command except that the default
setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is
100.</p>

<p>defshell command</p>

<p>Synonym to the shell command. See there.</p>

<p>defsilence on|off</p>

<p>Same as the silence command except that the default
setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is
off.</p>

<p>defslowpaste msec&quot;</p>

<p>Same as the slowpaste command except that the default
setting for new windows is changed. Initial setting is 0
milliseconds, meaning off.</p>

<p>defutf8 on|off</p>

<p>Same as the utf8 command except that the default setting
for new win- dows is changed. Initial setting is on if
screen was started with &quot;-U&quot;, otherwise off.</p>

<p>defwrap on|off</p>

<p>Same as the wrap command except that the default setting
for new win- dows is changed. Initially line-wrap is on and
can be toggled with the &quot;wrap&quot; command (&quot;C-a
r&quot;) or by means of &quot;C-a : wrap on|off&quot;.</p>

<p>defwritelock on|off|auto</p>

<p>Same as the writelock command except that the default
setting for new windows is changed. Initially writelocks
will off.</p>

<p>defzombie [keys]</p>

<p>Synonym to the zombie command. Both currently change the
default. See there.</p>

<p>detach [-h]</p>

<p>Detach the screen session (disconnect it from the
terminal and put it into the background). This returns you
to the shell where you invoked screen. A detached screen can
be resumed by invoking screen with the -r option (see also
section &quot;COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS&quot;). The -h option
tells screen to immediately close the connection to the
terminal (&quot;hangup&quot;).</p>

<p>dinfo</p>

<p>Show what screen thinks about your terminal. Useful if
you want to know why features like color or the alternate
charset don t work.</p>

<p>displays</p>

<p>Shows a tabular listing of all currently connected user
front-ends (displays). This is most useful for multiuser
sessions.</p>

<p>digraph [preset]</p>

<p>This command prompts the user for a digraph sequence.
The next two characters typed are looked up in a builtin
table and the resulting character is inserted in the input
stream. For example, if the user enters a&quot;, an a-umlaut
will be inserted. If the first character entered is a 0
(zero), screen will treat the following characters (up to
three) as an octal number instead. The optional argument
preset is treated as user input, thus one can create an
&quot;umlaut&quot; key. For exam- ple the command
&quot;bindkey ^K digraph &quot;&quot; enables the user to
generate an a-umlaut by typing CTRL-K a.</p>

<p>dumptermcap</p>

<p>Write the termcap entry for the virtual terminal
optimized for the cur- rently active window to the file
&quot;.termcap&quot; in the users &quot;$HOME/.screen&quot;
directory (or wherever screen stores its sockets. See the
&quot;FILES&quot; section below). This termcap entry is
identical to the value of the environment variable $TERMCAP
that is set up by screen for each window. For terminfo based
systems you will need to run a con- verter like captoinfo
and then compile the entry with tic.</p>

<p>echo [-n] message</p>

<p>The echo command may be used to annoy screen users with
a message of the day. Typically installed in a global
/etc/screenrc. The option &quot;-n&quot; may be used to
suppress the line feed. See also &quot;sleep&quot;. Echo is
also useful for online checking of environment
variables.</p>

<p>encoding enc [enc]</p>

<p>Tell screen how to interpret the input/output. The first
argument sets the encoding of the current window. Each
window can emulate a different encoding. The optional second
parameter overwrites the encoding of the connected terminal.
It should never be needed as screen uses the locale setting
to detect the encoding. There is also a way to select a
termi- nal encoding depending on the terminal type by using
the &quot;KJ&quot; termcap entry.</p>

<p>Supported encodings are eucJP, SJIS, eucKR, eucCN, Big5,
GBK, KOI8-R, CP1251, UTF-8, ISO8859-2, ISO8859-3, ISO8859-4,
ISO8859-5, ISO8859-6, ISO8859-7, ISO8859-8, ISO8859-9,
ISO8859-10, ISO8859-15, jis.</p>

<p>See also &quot;defencoding&quot;, which changes the
default setting of a new win- dow.</p>

<p>escape xy</p>

<p>Set the command character to x and the character
generating a literal command character (by triggering the
&quot;meta&quot; command) to y (similar to the -e option).
Each argument is either a single character, a two- character
sequence of the form &quot;^x&quot; (meaning
&quot;C-x&quot;), a backslash fol- lowed by an octal number
(specifying the ASCII code of the character), or a backslash
followed by a second character, such as &quot;&quot; or
&quot;\&quot;. The default is &quot;^Aa&quot;.</p>

<p>eval command1 [command2 ...]</p>

<p>Parses and executes each argument as separate
command.</p>

<p>exec [[fdpat] newcommand [args ...]]</p>

<p>Run a unix subprocess (specified by an executable path
newcommand and its optional arguments) in the current
window. The flow of data between newcommands
stdin/stdout/stderr, the process originally started in the
window (let us call it &quot;application-process&quot;) and
screen itself (win- dow) is controlled by the filedescriptor
pattern fdpat. This pattern is basically a three character
sequence representing stdin, stdout and stderr of
newcommand. A dot (.) connects the file descriptor to
screen. An exclamation mark (!) causes the file descriptor
to be connected to the application-process. A colon (:)
combines both. User input will go to newcommand unless
newcommand receives the application-process out- put (fdpats
first character is ! or :) or a pipe symbol (|) is added (as
a fourth character) to the end of fdpat. Invoking exec
without arguments shows name and arguments of the cur-
rently running subprocess in this window. Only one
subprocess a time can be running in each window. When a
subprocess is running the kill command will affect it
instead of the windows process. Refer to the postscript file
doc/fdpat.ps for a confusing illustra- tion of all 21
possible combinations. Each drawing shows the digits 2,1,0
representing the three file descriptors of newcommand. The
box marked W is the usual pty that has the
application-process on its slave side. The box marked P is
the secondary pty that now has screen at its master
side.</p>

<p>Abbreviations: Whitespace between the word exec and
fdpat and the command can be omitted. Trailing dots and a
fdpat consisting only of dots can be omit- ted. A simple |
is synonymous for the pattern !..| ; the word exec can be
omitted here and can always be replaced by !.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>exec ... /bin/sh exec /bin/sh !/bin/sh</p>

<p>Creates another shell in the same window, while the
original shell is still running. Output of both shells is
displayed and user input is sent to the new /bin/sh.</p>

<p>exec !.. stty 19200 exec ! stty 19200 !!stty 19200</p>

<p>Set the speed of the windows tty. If your stty command
operates on stdout, then add another !.</p>

<p>exec !..| less |less</p>

<p>This adds a pager to the window output. The special
character | is needed to give the user control over the
pager although it gets its input from the windows process.
This works, because less listens on stderr (a behavior that
screen would not expect without the |) when its stdin is not
a tty. Less versions newer than 177 fail miserably here;
good old pg still works.</p>

<p>!:sed -n s/.*Error.*/ 07/p</p>

<p>Sends window output to both, the user and the sed
command. The sed inserts an additional bell character (oct.
007) to the window output seen by screen. This will cause
&quot;Bell in window x&quot; messages, whenever the string
&quot;Error&quot; appears in the window.</p>

<p>fit</p>

<p>Change the window size to the size of the current
region. This command is needed because screen doesn t adapt
the window size automatically if the window is displayed
more than once.</p>

<p>flow [on|off|auto]</p>

<p>Sets the flow-control mode for this window. Without
parameters it cycles the current windows flow-control
setting from &quot;automatic&quot; to &quot;on&quot; to
&quot;off&quot;. See the discussion on
&quot;FLOW-CONTROL&quot; later on in this document for full
details and note, that this is subject to change in future
releases. Default is set by defflow.</p>

<p>focus [up|down|top|bottom]</p>

<p>Move the input focus to the next region. This is done in
a cyclic way so that the top region is selected after the
bottom one. If no subcom- mand is given it defaults to down
. up cycles in the opposite order, top and bottom go to the
top and bottom region respectively. Useful bindings are (j
and k as in vi) bind j focus down bind k focus up bind t
focus top bind b focus bottom</p>

<p>gr [on|off]</p>

<p>Turn GR charset switching on/off. Whenever screen sees
an input charac- ter with the 8th bit set, it will use the
charset stored in the GR slot and print the character with
the 8th bit stripped. The default (see also
&quot;defgr&quot;) is not to process GR switching because
otherwise the ISO88591 charset would not work.</p>

<p>hardcopy [-h] [file]</p>

<p>Writes out the currently displayed image to the file
file, or, if no filename is specified, to hardcopy.n in the
default directory, where n is the number of the current
window. This either appends or overwrites the file if it
exists. See below. If the option -h is specified, dump also
the contents of the scrollback buffer.</p>

<p>hardcopy_append on|off</p>

<p>If set to &quot;on&quot;, screen will append to the
&quot;hardcopy.n&quot; files created by the command
&quot;C-a h&quot;, otherwise these files are overwritten
each time. Default is off.</p>

<p>hardcopydir directory</p>

<p>Defines a directory where hardcopy files will be placed.
If unset, hardcopys are dumped in screens current working
directory.</p>

<p>hardstatus [on|off] hardstatus
[always]lastline|message|ignore [string] hardstatus string
[string]</p>

<p>This command configures the use and emulation of the
terminals hard- status line. The first form toggles whether
screen will use the hard- ware status line to display
messages. If the flag is set to off, these messages are
overlaid in reverse video mode at the display line. The
default setting is on.</p>

<p>The second form tells screen what to do if the terminal
doesnt have a hardstatus line (i.e. the termcap/terminfo
capabilities &quot;hs&quot;, &quot;ts&quot;, &quot;fs&quot;
and &quot;ds&quot; are not set). If the type
&quot;lastline&quot; is used, screen will reserve the last
line of the display for the hardstatus. &quot;message&quot;
uses screens message mechanism and &quot;ignore&quot; tells
screen never to display the hardstatus. If you prepend the
word &quot;always&quot; to the type (e.g.,
&quot;alwayslastline&quot;), screen will use the type even
if the terminal sup- ports a hardstatus.</p>

<p>The third form specifies the contents of the hardstatus
line. %h is used as default string, i.e. the stored
hardstatus of the current win- dow (settable via
&quot;ESC]0;&lt;string&gt;^G&quot; or
&quot;ESC_&lt;string&gt;ESC played. You can customize this
to any string you like including the escapes from the
&quot;STRING ESCAPES&quot; chapter. If you leave out the
argu- ment string, the current string is displayed.</p>

<p>You can mix the second and third form by providing the
string as addi- tional argument.</p>

<p>height [-w|-d] [lines [cols]]</p>

<p>Set the display height to a specified number of lines.
When no argument is given it toggles between 24 and 42 lines
display. You can also spec- ify a width if you want to
change both values. The -w option tells screen to leave the
display size unchanged and just set the window size, -d vice
versa.</p>

<p>help [-c class]</p>

<p>Not really a online help, but displays a help screen
showing you all the key bindings. The first pages list all
the internal commands fol- lowed by their current bindings.
Subsequent pages will display the custom commands, one
command per key. Press space when youre done reading each
page, or return to exit early. All other characters are
ignored. If the &quot;-c&quot; option is given, display all
bound commands for the specified command class. See also
&quot;DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS&quot; section.</p>

<p>history</p>

<p>Usually users work with a shell that allows easy access
to previous commands. For example csh has the command
&quot;!!&quot; to repeat the last com- mand executed. Screen
allows you to have a primitive way of re-calling &quot;the
command that started ...&quot;: You just type the first
letter of that command, then hit C-a { and screen tries to
find a previous line that matches with the prompt character
to the left of the cursor. This line is pasted into this
windows input queue. Thus you have a crude command history
(made up by the visible window and its scrollback
buffer).</p>

<p>hstatus status</p>

<p>Change the windows hardstatus line to the string
status.</p>

<p>idle [timeout [cmd args]]</p>

<p>Sets a command that is run after the specified number of
seconds inac- tivity is reached. This command will normally
be the &quot;blanker&quot; command to create a screen
blanker, but it can be any screen command. If no command is
specified, only the timeout is set. A timeout of zero (ot
the special timeout off) disables the timer. If no arguments
are given, the current settings are displayed.</p>

<p>ignorecase [on|off]</p>

<p>Tell screen to ignore the case of characters in
searches. Default is off.</p>

<p>info</p>

<p>Uses the message line to display some information about
the current window: the cursor position in the form
&quot;(column,row)&quot; starting with &quot;(1,1)&quot;,
the terminal width and height plus the size of the
scrollback buffer in lines, like in &quot;(80,24)+50&quot;,
the current state of window XON/XOFF flow control is shown
like this (See also section FLOW CON- TROL):</p>

<p>+flow automatic flow control, currently on. -flow
automatic flow control, currently off. +(+)flow flow control
enabled. Agrees with automatic control. -(+)flow flow
control disabled. Disagrees with automatic control. +(-)flow
flow control enabled. Disagrees with automatic control.
-(-)flow flow control disabled. Agrees with automatic
control.</p>

<p>The current line wrap setting (+wrap indicates enabled,
-wrap not) is also shown. The flags ins, org, app, log , mon
or nored are displayed when the window is in insert mode,
origin mode, applica- tion-keypad mode, has output logging,
activity monitoring or partial redraw enabled.</p>

<p>The currently active character set (G0, G1, G2, or G3)
and in square brackets the terminal character sets that are
currently designated as G0 through G3 is shown. If the
window is in UTF-8 mode, the string &quot;UTF-8&quot; is
shown instead.</p>

<p>Additional modes depending on the type of the window are
displayed at the end of the status line (See also chapter
&quot;WINDOW TYPES&quot;). If the state machine of the
terminal emulator is in a non-default state, the info line
is started with a string identifying the current state. For
system information use the &quot;time&quot; command.</p>

<p>ins_reg [key]</p>

<p>No longer exists, use &quot;paste&quot; instead.</p>

<p>kill</p>

<p>Kill current window. If there is an exec command running
then it is killed. Otherwise the process (shell) running in
the window receives a HANGUP condition, the window structure
is removed and screen (your display) switches to another
window. When the last window is destroyed, screen exits.
After a kill screen switches to the previously displayed
window. Note: Emacs users should keep this command in mind,
when killing a line. It is recommended not to use
&quot;C-a&quot; as the screen escape key or to rebind kill
to &quot;C-a K&quot;.</p>

<p>lastmsg</p>

<p>Redisplay the last contents of the message/status line.
Useful if youre typing when a message appears, because the
message goes away when you press a key (unless your terminal
has a hardware status line). Refer to the commands
&quot;msgwait&quot; and &quot;msgminwait&quot; for fine
tuning.</p>

<p>license</p>

<p>Display the disclaimer page. This is done whenever
screen is started without options, which should be often
enough. See also the &quot;startup_message&quot;
command.</p>

<p>lockscreen</p>

<p>Lock this display. Call a screenlock program
(/local/bin/lck or /usr/bin/lock or a builtin if no other is
available). Screen does not accept any command keys until
this program terminates. Meanwhile pro- cesses in the
windows may continue, as the windows are in the detached
state. The screenlock program may be changed through the
environment variable $LOCKPRG (which must be set in the
shell from which screen is started) and is executed with the
users uid and gid. Warning: When you leave other shells
unlocked and you have no password set on screen, the lock is
void: One could easily re-attach from an unlocked shell.
This feature should rather be called lockterminal.</p>

<p>log [on|off]</p>

<p>Start/stop writing output of the current window to a
file &quot;screenlog.n&quot; in the windows default
directory, where n is the number of the current window. This
filename can be changed with the logfile command. If no
parameter is given, the state of logging is toggled. The
session log is appended to the previous contents of the file
if it already exists. The current contents and the contents
of the scrollback history are not included in the session
log. Default is off.</p>

<p>logfile filename logfile flush secs</p>

<p>Defines the name the logfiles will get. The default is
&quot;screenlog.%n&quot;. The second form changes the number
of seconds screen will wait before flushing the logfile
buffer to the file-system. The default value is 10
seconds.</p>

<p>login [on|off]</p>

<p>Adds or removes the entry in the utmp database file for
the current window. This controls if the window is logged
in. When no parameter is given, the login state of the
window is toggled. Additionally to that toggle, it is
convenient having a log in and a log out key. E.g. bind I
login on and bind O login off will map these keys to be C-a
I and C-a O. The default setting (in config.h.in) should be
&quot;on&quot; for a screen that runs under suid-root. Use
the &quot;deflogin&quot; command to change the default login
state for new windows. Both commands are only present when
screen has been compiled with utmp support.</p>

<p>logtstamp [on|off] logtstamp after [secs] logtstamp
string [string]</p>

<p>This command controls logfile time-stamp mechanism of
screen. If time- stamps are turned &quot;on&quot;, screen
adds a string containing the current time to the logfile
after two minutes of inactivity. When output con- tinues and
more than another two minutes have passed, a second time-
stamp is added to document the restart of the output. You
can change this timeout with the second form of the command.
The third form is used for customizing the time-stamp string
( -- %n:%t -- time-stamp -- by default). %M/%d/%y %c:%s --0
mapdefault</p>

<p>Tell screen that the next input character should only be
looked up in the default bindkey table. See also
&quot;bindkey&quot;.</p>

<p>mapnotnext</p>

<p>Like mapdefault, but dont even look in the default
bindkey table.</p>

<p>maptimeout [timo]</p>

<p>Set the inter-character timer for input sequence
detection to a timeout of timo ms. The default timeout is
300ms. Maptimeout with no arguments shows the current
setting. See also &quot;bindkey&quot;.</p>

<p>markkeys string</p>

<p>This is a method of changing the keymap used for
copy/history mode. The string is made up of oldchar=newchar
pairs which are separated by : . Example: The string
&quot;B=^B:F=^F&quot; will change the keys C-b and C- f to
the vi style binding (scroll up/down fill page). This
happens to be the default binding for B and F. The command
&quot;markkeys h=^B:l=^F:$=^E&quot; would set the mode for
an emacs-style binding. If your terminal sends characters,
that cause you to abort copy mode, then this command may
help by binding these characters to do nothing. The no-op
character is @ and is used like this: &quot;markkeys
@=L=H&quot; if you do not want to use the H or L commands
any longer. As shown in this exam- ple, multiple keys can be
assigned to one function in a single state- ment.</p>

<p>maxwin num</p>

<p>Set the maximum window number screen will create. Doesnt
affect already existing windows. The number may only be
decreased.</p>

<p>meta</p>

<p>Insert the command character (C-a) in the current
windows input stream.</p>

<p>monitor [on|off]</p>

<p>Toggles activity monitoring of windows. When monitoring
is turned on and an affected window is switched into the
background, you will receive the activity notification
message in the status line at the first sign of output and
the window will also be marked with an @ in the
window-status display. Monitoring is initially off for all
win- dows.</p>

<p>msgminwait sec</p>

<p>Defines the time screen delays a new message when one
message is cur- rently displayed. The default is 1
second.</p>

<p>msgwait sec</p>

<p>Defines the time a message is displayed if screen is not
disturbed by other activity. The default is 5 seconds.</p>

<p>multiuser on|off</p>

<p>Switch between singleuser and multiuser mode. Standard
screen operation is singleuser. In multiuser mode the
commands acladd , aclchg, aclgrp and acldel can be used to
enable (and disable) other users accessing this screen
session.</p>

<p>nethack on|off</p>

<p>Changes the kind of error messages used by screen. When
you are famil- iar with the game &quot;nethack&quot;, you
may enjoy the nethack-style messages which will often blur
the facts a little, but are much funnier to read. Anyway,
standard messages often tend to be unclear as well. This
option is only available if screen was compiled with the
NETHACK flag defined. The default setting is then determined
by the presence of the environment variable
$NETHACKOPTIONS.</p>

<p>next</p>

<p>Switch to the next window. This command can be used
repeatedly to cycle through the list of windows.</p>

<p>nonblock [on|off|numsecs]</p>

<p>Tell screen how to deal with user interfaces (displays)
that cease to accept output. This can happen if a user
presses ^S or a TCP/modem con- nection gets cut but no
hangup is received. If nonblock is off (this is the default)
screen waits until the display restarts to accept the out-
put. If nonblock is on, screen waits until the timeout is
reached (on is treated as 1s). If the display still doesnt
receive characters, screen will consider it
&quot;blocked&quot; and stop sending characters to it. If at
some time it restarts to accept characters, screen will
unblock the display and redisplay the updated window
contents.</p>

<p>number [n]</p>

<p>Change the current windows number. If the given number n
is already used by another window, both windows exchange
their numbers. If no argument is specified, the current
window number (and title) is shown.</p>

<p>obuflimit [limit]</p>

<p>If the output buffer contains more bytes than the
specified limit, no more data will be read from the windows.
The default value is 256. If you have a fast display (like
xterm), you can set it to some higher value. If no argument
is specified, the current setting is displayed.</p>

<p>only</p>

<p>Kill all regions but the current one.</p>

<p>other</p>

<p>Switch to the window displayed previously. If this
window does no longer exist, other has the same effect as
next.</p>

<p>partial on|off</p>

<p>Defines whether the display should be refreshed (as with
redisplay) after switching to the current window. This
command only affects the current window. To immediately
affect all windows use the allpartial command. Default is
off , of course. This default is fixed, as there is
currently no defpartial command.</p>

<p>password [crypted_pw]</p>

<p>Present a crypted password in your &quot;.screenrc&quot;
file and screen will ask for it, whenever someone attempts
to resume a detached. This is useful if you have privileged
programs running under screen and you want to protect your
session from reattach attempts by another user masquerad-
ing as your uid (i.e. any superuser.) If no crypted password
is speci- fied, screen prompts twice for typing a password
and places its encryp- tion in the paste buffer. Default is
none , this disables password checking.</p>

<p>paste [registers [dest_reg]]</p>

<p>Write the (concatenated) contents of the specified
registers to the stdin queue of the current window. The
register . is treated as the paste buffer. If no parameter
is given the user is prompted for a sin- gle register to
paste. The paste buffer can be filled with the copy, history
and readbuf commands. Other registers can be filled with the
register, readreg and paste commands. If paste is called
with a second argument, the contents of the specified
registers is pasted into the named destination register
rather than the window. If . is used as the second argument,
the displays paste buffer is the destination. Note, that
&quot;paste&quot; uses a wide variety of resources: Whenever
a second argument is specified no current window is needed.
When the source specification only contains registers (not
the paste buffer) then there need not be a current display
(terminal attached), as the registers are a global resource.
The paste buffer exists once for every user.</p>

<p>pastefont [on|off]</p>

<p>Tell screen to include font information in the paste
buffer. The default is not to do so. This command is
especially useful for multi character fonts like kanji.</p>

<p>pow_break</p>

<p>Reopen the window s terminal line and send a break
condition. See break.</p>

<p>pow_detach</p>

<p>Power detach. Mainly the same as detach, but also sends
a HANGUP sig- nal to the parent process of screen. CAUTION:
This will result in a logout, when screen was started from
your login shell.</p>

<p>pow_detach_msg [message]</p>

<p>The message specified here is output whenever a Power
detach was per- formed. It may be used as a replacement for
a logout message or to reset baud rate, etc. Without
parameter, the current message is shown.</p>

<p>prev</p>

<p>Switch to the window with the next lower number. This
command can be used repeatedly to cycle through the list of
windows.</p>

<p>printcmd [cmd]</p>

<p>If cmd is not an empty string, screen will not use the
terminal capa- bilities &quot;po/pf&quot; if it detects an
ansi print sequence ESC [ 5 i, but pipe the output into cmd.
This should normally be a command like &quot;lpr&quot; or
&quot; cat &gt; /tmp/scrprint&quot;. printcmd without a
command displays the current setting. The ansi sequence ESC
ends printing and closes the pipe. Warning: Be careful with
this command! If other user have write access to your
terminal, they will be able to fire off print commands.</p>

<p>process [key]</p>

<p>Stuff the contents of the specified register into
screens input queue. If no argument is given you are
prompted for a register name. The text is parsed as if it
had been typed in from the users keyboard. This command can
be used to bind multiple actions to a single key.</p>

<p>quit</p>

<p>Kill all windows and terminate screen. Note that on
VT100-style termi- nals the keys C-4 and C- are identical.
This makes the default bind- ings dangerous: Be careful not
to type C-a C-4 when selecting window no. 4. Use the empty
bind command (as in &quot;bind ^ &quot;) to remove a key
binding.</p>

<p>readbuf [-e encoding] [filename]</p>

<p>Reads the contents of the specified file into the paste
buffer. You can tell screen the encoding of the file via the
-e option. If no file is specified, the screen-exchange
filename is used. See also &quot;buffer- file&quot;
command.</p>

<p>readreg [-e encoding] [register [filename]]</p>

<p>Does one of two things, dependent on number of
arguments: with zero or one arguments it it duplicates the
paste buffer contents into the reg- ister specified or
entered at the prompt. With two arguments it reads the
contents of the named file into the register, just as
readbuf reads the screen-exchange file into the paste
buffer. You can tell screen the encoding of the file via the
-e option. The following example will paste the systems
password file into the screen window (using register p,
where a copy remains):</p>

<p>C-a : readreg p /etc/passwd C-a : paste p</p>

<p>redisplay</p>

<p>Redisplay the current window. Needed to get a full
redisplay when in partial redraw mode.</p>

<p>register [-e encoding] key string</p>

<p>Save the specified string to the register key. The
encoding of the string can be specified via the -e option.
See also the &quot;paste&quot; com- mand.</p>

<p>remove</p>

<p>Kill the current region. This is a no-op if there is
only one region.</p>

<p>removebuf</p>

<p>Unlinks the screen-exchange file used by the commands
&quot;writebuf&quot; and &quot;readbuf&quot;.</p>

<p>reset</p>

<p>Reset the virtual terminal to its &quot;power-on&quot;
values. Useful when strange settings (like scroll regions or
graphics character set) are left over from an
application.</p>

<p>resize</p>

<p>Resize the current region. The space will be removed
from or added to the region below or if theres not enough
space from the region above.</p>

<p>resize +N increase current region height by N</p>

<p>resize -N decrease current region height by N</p>

<p>resize N set current region height to N</p>

<p>resize = make all windows equally high</p>

<p>resize max maximize current region height</p>

<p>resize min minimize current region height</p>

<p>screen [-opts] [n] [cmd [args]]</p>

<p>Establish a new window. The flow-control options (-f,
-fn and -fa), title (a.k.a.) option (-t), login options (-l
and -ln) , terminal type option (-T &lt;term&gt;), the
all-capability-flag (-a) and scrollback option (-h
&lt;num&gt;) may be specified with each command. The option
(-M) turns monitoring on for this window. The option (-L)
turns output logging on for this window. If an optional
number n in the range 0..9 is given, the window number n is
assigned to the newly created window (or, if this number is
already in-use, the next available number). If a com- mand
is specified after &quot;screen&quot;, this command (with
the given argu- ments) is started in the window; otherwise,
a shell is created. Thus, if your &quot;.screenrc&quot;
contains the lines</p>

<p># example for .screenrc: screen 1 screen -fn -t foobar
-L 2 telnet foobar</p>

<p>screen creates a shell window (in window #1) and a
window with a TELNET connection to the machine foobar (with
no flow-control using the title &quot;foobar&quot; in window
#2) and will write a logfile (&quot;screenlog.2&quot;) of
the telnet session. Note, that unlike previous versions of
screen no addi- tional default window is created when
&quot;screen&quot; commands are included in your
&quot;.screenrc&quot; file. When the initialization is
completed, screen switches to the last window specified in
your .screenrc file or, if none, opens a default window #0.
Screen has built in some functionality of &quot;cu&quot; and
&quot;telnet&quot;. See also chapter &quot;WINDOW
TYPES&quot;.</p>

<p>scrollback num</p>

<p>Set the size of the scrollback buffer for the current
windows to num lines. The default scrollback is 100 lines.
See also the &quot;defscroll- back&quot; command and use
&quot;C-a i&quot; to view the current setting.</p>

<p>select [WindowID]</p>

<p>Switch to the window identified by WindowID. This can be
a prefix of a window title (alphanumeric window name) or a
window number. The param- eter is optional and if omitted,
you get prompted for an identifier. When a new window is
established, the first available number is assigned to this
window. Thus, the first window can be activated by
&quot;select 0&quot;. The number of windows is limited at
compile-time by the MAXWIN configuration parameter. There
are two special WindowIDs, &quot;-&quot; selects the
internal blank window and &quot;.&quot; selects the current
window. The latter is useful if used with screens
&quot;-X&quot; option.</p>

<p>sessionname [name]</p>

<p>Rename the current session. Note, that for &quot;screen
-list&quot; the name shows up with the process-id prepended.
If the argument &quot;name&quot; is omit- ted, the name of
this session is displayed. Caution: The $STY environ- ment
variables still reflects the old name. This may result in
confu- sion. The default is constructed from the tty and
host names.</p>

<p>setenv [var [string]]</p>

<p>Set the environment variable var to value string. If
only var is spec- ified, the user will be prompted to enter
a value. If no parameters are specified, the user will be
prompted for both variable and value. The environment is
inherited by all subsequently forked shells.</p>

<p>setsid [on|off]</p>

<p>Normally screen uses different sessions and process
groups for the win- dows. If setsid is turned off, this is
not done anymore and all windows will be in the same process
group as the screen backend process. This also breaks
job-control, so be careful. The default is on, of course.
This command is probably useful only in rare
circumstances.</p>

<p>shell command</p>

<p>Set the command to be used to create a new shell. This
overrides the value of the environment variable $SHELL. This
is useful if youd like to run a tty-enhancer which is
expecting to execute the program speci- fied in $SHELL. If
the command begins with a - character, the shell will be
started as a login-shell.</p>

<p>shelltitle title</p>

<p>Set the title for all shells created during startup or
by the C-A C-c command. For details about what a title is,
see the discussion enti- tled &quot;TITLES (naming
windows)&quot;.</p>

<p>silence [on|off|sec]</p>

<p>Toggles silence monitoring of windows. When silence is
turned on and an affected window is switched into the
background, you will receive the silence notification
message in the status line after a specified period of
inactivity (silence). The default timeout can be changed
with the silencewait command or by specifying a number of
seconds instead of on or off. Silence is initially off for
all windows.</p>

<p>silencewait sec</p>

<p>Define the time that all windows monitored for silence
should wait before displaying a message. Default 30
seconds.</p>

<p>sleep num</p>

<p>This command will pause the execution of a .screenrc
file for num sec- onds. Keyboard activity will end the
sleep. It may be used to give users a chance to read the
messages output by &quot;echo&quot;.</p>

<p>slowpaste msec</p>

<p>Define the speed at which text is inserted into the
current window by the paste (&quot;C-a ]&quot;) command. If
the slowpaste value is nonzero text is written character by
character. screen will make a pause of msec mil- liseconds
after each single character write to allow the application
to process its input. Only use slowpaste if your underlying
system exposes flow control problems while pasting large
amounts of text.</p>

<p>source file</p>

<p>Read and execute commands from file file. Source
commands may be nested to a maximum recursion level of ten.
If file is not an absolute path and screen is already
processing a source command, the parent directory of the
running source command file is used to search for the new
com- mand file before screens current directory.</p>

<p>Note that termcap/terminfo/termcapinfo commands only
work at startup and reattach time, so they must be reached
via the default screenrc files to have an effect.</p>

<p>sorendition [attr [color]]</p>

<p>Change the way screen does highlighting for text marking
and printing messages. See the &quot;STRING ESCAPES&quot;
chapter for the syntax of the modi- fiers. The default is
currently &quot;=s dd&quot; (standout, default colors).</p>

<p>split</p>

<p>Split the current region into two new ones. All regions
on the display are resized to make room for the new region.
The blank window is dis- played on the new region. Use the
&quot;remove&quot; or the &quot;only&quot; command to delete
regions.</p>

<p>startup_message on|off</p>

<p>Select whether you want to see the copyright notice
during startup. Default is on, as you probably noticed.</p>

<p>stuff string</p>

<p>Stuff the string string in the input buffer of the
current window. This is like the &quot;paste&quot; command
but with much less overhead. You can- not paste large
buffers with the &quot;stuff&quot; command. It is most
useful for key bindings. See also &quot;bindkey&quot;.</p>

<p>su [username [password [password2]]</p>

<p>Substitute the user of a display. The command prompts
for all parame- ters that are omitted. If passwords are
specified as parameters, they have to be specified
un-crypted. The first password is matched against the
systems passwd database, the second password is matched
against the screen password as set with the commands
&quot;acladd&quot; or &quot;password&quot;. &quot;Su&quot;
may be useful for the screen administrator to test multiuser
setups. When the identification fails, the user has access
to the commands available for user nobody. These are
&quot;detach&quot;, &quot;license&quot;,
&quot;version&quot;, &quot;help&quot; and
&quot;displays&quot;.</p>

<p>suspend</p>

<p>Suspend screen. The windows are in the detached state,
while screen is suspended. This feature relies on the shell
being able to do job control.</p>

<p>term term</p>

<p>In each window s environment screen opens, the $TERM
variable is set to &quot;screen&quot; by default. But when
no description for &quot;screen&quot; is installed in the
local termcap or terminfo data base, you set $TERM to - say
- &quot;vt100&quot;. This wont do much harm, as screen is
VT100/ANSI compatible. The use of the &quot;term&quot;
command is discouraged for non-default purpose. That is, one
may want to specify special $TERM settings (e.g. vt100) for
the next &quot;screen rlogin othermachine&quot; command. Use
the command &quot;screen -T vt100 rlogin othermachine&quot;
rather than setting and resetting the default.</p>

<p>termcap term terminal-tweaks [window-tweaks] terminfo
term terminal-tweaks [window-tweaks] termcapinfo term
terminal-tweaks [window-tweaks]</p>

<p>Use this command to modify your terminals termcap entry
without going through all the hassles involved in creating a
custom termcap entry. Plus, you can optionally customize the
termcap generated for the win- dows. You have to place these
commands in one of the screenrc startup files, as they are
meaningless once the terminal emulator is booted. If your
system works uses the terminfo database rather than termcap,
screen will understand the terminfo command, which has the
same effects as the termcap command. Two separate commands
are provided, as there are subtle syntactic differences,
e.g. when parameter interpo- lation (using %) is required.
Note that termcap names of the capabil- ities have to be
used with the terminfo command. In many cases, where the
arguments are valid in both terminfo and term- cap syntax,
you can use the command termcapinfo , which is just a
shorthand for a pair of termcap and terminfo commands with
identi- cal arguments.</p>

<p>The first argument specifies which terminal(s) should be
affected by this definition. You can specify multiple
terminal names by separating them with |s. Use * to match
all terminals and vt* to match all terminals that begin with
&quot;vt&quot;.</p>

<p>Each tweak argument contains one or more termcap defines
(separated by :s) to be inserted at the start of the
appropriate termcap entry, enhancing it or overriding
existing values. The first tweak modifies your terminals
termcap, and contains definitions that your terminal uses to
perform certain functions. Specify a null string to leave
this unchanged (e.g. ). The second (optional) tweak modifies
all the win- dow termcaps, and should contain definitions
that screen understands (see the &quot;VIRTUAL
TERMINAL&quot; section).</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p>termcap xterm* LP:hs@</p>

<p>Informs screen that all terminals that begin with xterm
have firm auto-margins that allow the last position on the
screen to be updated (LP), but they dont really have a
status line (no hs - append @ to turn entries off). Note
that we assume LP for all terminal names that start with
&quot;vt&quot;, but only if you don t specify a termcap
command for that terminal.</p>

<p>termcap vt* LP termcap vt102|vt220 Z0=</p>

<p>Specifies the firm-margined LP capability for all
terminals that begin with vt, and the second line will also
add the escape-sequences to switch into (Z0) and back out of
(Z1) 132-character-per-line mode if this is a VT102 or
VT220. (You must specify Z0 and Z1 in your termcap to use
the width-changing commands.)</p>

<p>termcap vt100 &quot;&quot;
l0=PF1:l1=PF2:l2=PF3:l3=PF4</p>

<p>This leaves your vt100 termcap alone and adds the
function key labels to each windows termcap entry.</p>

<p>termcap h19|z19 am@:im=@:ei= dc=</p>

<p>Takes a h19 or z19 termcap and turns off auto-margins
(am@) and enables the insert mode (im) and end-insert (ei)
capabilities (the @ in the im string is after the =, so it
is part of the string). Having the im and ei definitions put
into your terminals termcap will cause screen to
automatically advertise the character-insert capability in
each window s termcap. Each window will also get the
delete-character capability (dc) added to its termcap, which
screen will translate into a line-update for the terminal
(we re pretending it doesnt support character deletion).</p>

<p>If you would like to fully specify each window s termcap
entry, you should instead set the $SCREENCAP variable prior
to running screen. See the discussion on the &quot;VIRTUAL
TERMINAL&quot; in this manual, and the termcap(5) man page
for more information on termcap definitions.</p>

<p>time [string]</p>

<p>Uses the message line to display the time of day, the
host name, and the load averages over 1, 5, and 15 minutes
(if this is available on your system). For window specific
information use &quot;info&quot;.</p>

<p>If a string is specified, it changes the format of the
time report like it is described in the &quot;STRING
ESCAPES&quot; chapter. Screen uses a default of &quot;%c:%s
%M %d %H%? %l%?&quot;.</p>

<p>title [windowtitle]</p>

<p>Set the name of the current window to windowtitle. If no
name is speci- fied, screen prompts for one. This command
was known as aka in previ- ous releases.</p>

<p>unsetenv var</p>

<p>Unset an environment variable.</p>

<p>utf8 [on|off [on|off]]</p>

<p>Change the encoding used in the current window. If utf8
is enabled, the strings sent to the window will be UTF-8
encoded and vice versa. Omit- ting the parameter toggles the
setting. If a second parameter is given, the displays
encoding is also changed (this should rather be done with
screen s &quot;-U&quot; option). See also
&quot;defutf8&quot;, which changes the default setting of a
new window.</p>

<p>vbell [on|off]</p>

<p>Sets the visual bell setting for this window. Omitting
the parameter toggles the setting. If vbell is switched on,
but your terminal does not support a visual bell, a
vbell-message is displayed in the status line when the bell
character (^G) is received. Visual bell support of a
terminal is defined by the termcap variable vb (terminfo:
flash). Per default, vbell is off, thus the audible bell is
used. See also bell_msg.</p>

<p>vbell_msg [message]</p>

<p>Sets the visual bell message. message is printed to the
status line if the window receives a bell character (^G),
vbell is set to &quot;on&quot;, but the terminal does not
support a visual bell. The default message is &quot;Wuff,
Wuff!!&quot;. Without parameter, the current message is
shown.</p>

<p>vbellwait sec</p>

<p>Define a delay in seconds after each display of screen s
visual bell message. The default is 1 second.</p>

<p>verbose [on|off]</p>

<p>If verbose is switched on, the command name is echoed,
whenever a win- dow is created (or resurrected from zombie
state). Default is off. Without parameter, the current
setting is shown.</p>

<p>version</p>

<p>Print the current version and the compile date in the
status line.</p>

<p>wall message</p>

<p>Write a message to all displays. The message will appear
in the termi- nals status line.</p>

<p>width [-w|-d] [cols [lines]]</p>

<p>Toggle the window width between 80 and 132 columns or
set it to cols columns if an argument is specified. This
requires a capable terminal and the termcap entries
&quot;Z0&quot; and &quot;Z1&quot;. See the
&quot;termcap&quot; command for more information. You can
also specify a new height if you want to change both values.
The -w option tells screen to leave the display size
unchanged and just set the window size, -d vice versa.</p>

<p>windowlist [-b] [-m] windowlist string [string]
windowlist title [title]</p>

<p>Display all windows in a table for visual window
selection. The desired window can be selected via the
standard movement keys (see the &quot;copy&quot; command)
and activated via the return key. If the -b option is given,
screen will switch to the blank window before presenting the
list, so that the current window is also selectable. The -m
option changes the order of the windows, instead of sorting
by window numbers screen uses its internal
most-recently-used list.</p>

<p>The table format can be changed with the string and
title option, the title is displayed as table heading, while
the lines are made by using the string setting. The default
setting is &quot;Num Name%=Flags&quot; for the title and
&quot;%3n %t%=%f&quot; for the lines. See the &quot;STRING
ESCAPES&quot; chapter for more codes (e.g. color
settings).</p>

<p>windows</p>

<p>Uses the message line to display a list of all the
windows. Each win- dow is listed by number with the name of
process that has been started in the window (or its title);
the current window is marked with a *; the previous window
is marked with a -; all the windows that are &quot;logged
in&quot; are marked with a $; a background window that has
received a bell is marked with a !; a background window that
is being monitored and has had activity occur is marked with
an @; a window which has output logging turned on is marked
with (L) ; windows occu- pied by other users are marked with
&amp;; windows in the zombie state are marked with Z. If
this list is too long to fit on the terminals status line
only the portion around the current window is displayed.</p>

<p>wrap [on|off]</p>

<p>Sets the line-wrap setting for the current window. When
line-wrap is on, the second consecutive printable character
output at the last col- umn of a line will wrap to the start
of the following line. As an added feature, backspace (^H)
will also wrap through the left margin to the previous line.
Default is on.</p>

<p>writebuf [-e encoding] [filename]</p>

<p>Writes the contents of the paste buffer to the specified
file, or the public accessible screen-exchange file if no
filename is given. This is thought of as a primitive means
of communication between screen users on the same host. If
an encoding is specified the paste buffer is recoded on the
fly to match the encoding. The filename can be set with the
bufferfile command and defaults to
&quot;/tmp/screen-exchange&quot;.</p>

<p>writelock [on|off|auto]</p>

<p>In addition to access control lists, not all users may
be able to write to the same window at once. Per default,
writelock is in auto mode and grants exclusive input
permission to the user who is the first to switch to the
particular window. When he leaves the window, other users
may obtain the writelock (automatically). The writelock of
the current window is disabled by the command
&quot;writelock off&quot;. If the user issues the command
&quot;writelock on&quot; he keeps the exclusive write
permission while switching to other windows.</p>

<p>xoff xon</p>

<p>Insert a CTRL-s / CTRL-q character to the stdin queue of
the current window.</p>

<p>zmodem [off|auto|catch|pass] zmodem sendcmd [string]
zmodem recvcmd [string]</p>

<p>Define zmodem support for screen. Screen understands two
different modes when it detects a zmodem request:
&quot;pass&quot; and &quot;catch&quot;. If the mode is set
to &quot;pass&quot;, screen will relay all data to the
attacher until the end of the transmission is reached. In
&quot;catch&quot; mode screen acts as a zmodem endpoint and
starts the corresponding rz/sz commands. If the mode is set
to &quot;auto&quot;, screen will use &quot;catch&quot; if
the window is a tty (e.g. a serial line), otherwise it will
use &quot;pass&quot;. You can define the templates screen
uses in &quot;catch&quot; mode via the second and the third
form. Note also that this is an experimental feature.</p>

<p>zombie [keys] defzombie [keys]</p>

<p>Per default screen windows are removed from the window
list as soon as the windows process (e.g. shell) exits. When
a string of two keys is specified to the zombie command,
dead windows will remain in the list. The kill command may
be used to remove such a window. Pressing the first key in
the dead window has the same effect. When pressing the
second key, screen will attempt to resurrect the window. The
process that was initially running in the window will be
launched again. Call- ing zombie without parameters will
clear the zombie setting, thus mak- ing windows disappear
when their process exits.</p>

<p>As the zombie-setting is manipulated globally for all
windows, this command should only be called defzombie. Until
we need this as a per window setting, the commands zombie
and defzombie are synonymous.</p>

<p>THE MESSAGE LINE Screen displays informational messages
and other diagnostics in a mes- sage line. While this line
is distributed to appear at the bottom of the screen, it can
be defined to appear at the top of the screen during
compilation. If your terminal has a status line defined in
its term- cap, screen will use this for displaying its
messages, otherwise a line of the current screen will be
temporarily overwritten and output will be momentarily
interrupted. The message line is automatically removed after
a few seconds delay, but it can also be removed early (on
termi- nals without a status line) by beginning to type.</p>

<p>The message line facility can be used by an application
running in the current window by means of the ANSI Privacy
message control sequence. For instance, from within the
shell, try something like:</p>

<p>echo &lt;esc&gt;^Hello world from window
$WINDOW&lt;esc&gt;\</p>

<p>where &lt;esc&gt; is an escape, ^ is a literal up-arrow,
and \ turns into a single backslash.</p>

<p>WINDOW TYPES Screen provides three different window
types. New windows are created with screens screen command
(see also the entry in chapter &quot;CUSTOMIZA- TION&quot;).
The first parameter to the screen command defines which type
of window is created. The different window types are all
special cases of the normal type. They have been added in
order to allow screen to be used efficiently as a console
multiplexer with 100 or more windows.</p>

<p>&middot; The normal window contains a shell (default, if
no parameter is given) or any other system command that
could be executed from a shell (e.g. slogin, etc...)</p>

<p>&middot; If a tty (character special device) name (e.g.
&quot;/dev/ttya&quot;) is spec- ified as the first
parameter, then the window is directly connected to this
device. This window type is similar to &quot;screen cu -l
/dev/ttya&quot;. Read and write access is required on the
device node, an exclusive open is attempted on the node to
mark the connection line as busy. An optional parameter is
allowed consisting of a comma separated list of flags in the
notation used by stty(1):</p>

<p>&lt;baud_rate&gt; Usually 300, 1200, 9600 or 19200. This
affects transmission as well as receive speed.</p>

<p>cs8 or cs7 Specify the transmission of eight (or seven)
bits per byte.</p>

<p>ixon or -ixon Enables (or disables) software
flow-control (CTRL-S/CTRL-Q) for sending data.</p>

<p>ixoff or -ixon Enables (or disables) software
flow-control for receiving data.</p>

<p>istrip or -istrip Clear (or keep) the eight bit in each
received byte.</p>

<p>You may want to specify as many of these options as
applicable. Unspecified options cause the terminal driver to
make up the parame- ter values of the connection. These
values are system dependant and may be in defaults or values
saved from a previous connection.</p>

<p>For tty windows, the info command shows some of the
modem control lines in the status line. These may include
RTS, CTS , DTR, DSR , CD and more. This depends on the
available ioctl()s and system header files as well as the on
the physical capabilities of the serial board. Signals that
are logical low (inactive) have their name preceded by an
exclamation mark (!), otherwise the signal is logical high
(active). Signals not supported by the hardware but
available to the ioctl() interface are usually shown low.
When the CLOCAL status bit is true, the whole set of modem
signals is placed inside curly braces ({ and }). When the
CRTSCTS or TIOC- SOFTCAR bit is set, the signals CTS or CD
are shown in parenthe- sis, respectively.</p>

<p>For tty windows, the command break causes the Data
transmission line (TxD) to go low for a specified period of
time. This is expected to be interpreted as break signal on
the other side. No data is sent and no modem control line is
changed when a break is issued.</p>

<p>&middot; If the first parameter is &quot;//telnet&quot;,
the second parameter is expected to be a host name, and an
optional third parameter may specify a TCP port number
(default decimal 23). Screen will connect to a server
listening on the remote host and use the telnet protocol to
communicate with that server. For telnet windows, the
command info shows details about the connec- tion in square
brackets ([ and ]) at the end of the status line.</p>

<p>b BINARY. The connection is in binary mode.</p>

<p>e ECHO. Local echo is disabled.</p>

<p>c SGA. The connection is in character mode (default:
line mode).</p>

<p>t TTYPE. The terminal type has been requested by the
remote host. Screen sends the name &quot;screen&quot; unless
instructed oth- erwise (see also the command term).</p>

<p>w NAWS. The remote site is notified about window size
changes.</p>

<p>f LFLOW. The remote host will send flow control
information. (Ignored at the moment.)</p>

<p>Additional flags for debugging are x, t and n (XDISPLOC,
TSPEED and NEWENV).</p>

<p>For telnet windows, the command break sends the telnet
code IAC BREAK (decimal 243) to the remote host.</p>

<p>This window type is only available if screen was
compiled with the BUILTIN_TELNET option defined.</p>

<p>STRING ESCAPES Screen provides an escape mechanism to
insert information like the cur- rent time into messages or
file names. The escape character is % with one exception:
inside of a windows hardstatus ^% (^E) is used instead.</p>

<p>Here is the full list of supported escapes:</p>

<p>% the escape character itself</p>

<p>a either am or pm</p>

<p>A either AM or PM</p>

<p>c current time HH:MM in 24h format</p>

<p>C current time HH:MM in 12h format</p>

<p>d day number</p>

<p>D weekday name</p>

<p>f flags of the window</p>

<p>F sets %? to true if the window has the focus</p>

<p>h hardstatus of the window</p>

<p>H hostname of the system</p>

<p>l current load of the system</p>

<p>m month number</p>

<p>M month name</p>

<p>n window number</p>

<p>s seconds</p>

<p>t window title</p>

<p>u all other users on this window</p>

<p>w all window numbers and names. With - quailifier: up to
the current window; with + qualifier: starting with the
window after the current one.</p>

<p>W all window numbers and names except the current
one</p>

<p>y last two digits of the year number</p>

<p>Y full year number</p>

<p>? the part to the next %? is displayed only if a %
escape inside the part expands to a non-empty string</p>

<p>: else part of %?</p>

<p>= pad the string to the displays width (like TeXs
hfill). If a number is specified, pad to the percentage of
the windows width. A 0 qualifier tells screen to treat the
number as absolute position. You can specify to pad relative
to the last absolute pad position by adding a + qualifier or
to pad rela- tive to the right margin by using - . The
padding truncates the string if the specified position lies
before the current posi- tion. Add the L qualifier to change
this.</p>

<p>&lt; same as %= but just do truncation, do not fill with
spaces</p>

<p>&gt; mark the current text position for the next
truncation. When screen needs to do truncation, it tries to
do it in a way that the marked position gets moved to the
specified percentage of the output area. (The area starts
from the last absolute pad position and ends with the
position specified by the truncation operator.) The L
qualifier tells screen to mark the truncated parts with
....</p>

<p>{ attribute/color modifier string terminated by the next
&quot;}&quot;</p>

<p>Substitute with the output of a backtick command. The
length qualifier is misused to identify one of the
commands.</p>

<p>The c and C escape may be qualified with a 0 to make
screen use zero instead of space as fill character. The 0
qualifier also makes the = escape use absolute positions.
The n and = escapes under- stand a length qualifier (e.g.
%3n ), D and M can be prefixed with L to generate long
names, w and W also show the window flags if L is given.</p>

<p>An attribute/color modifier is is used to change the
attributes or the color settings. Its format is
&quot;[attribute modifier] [color descrip- tion]&quot;. The
attribute modifier must be prefixed by a change type indi-
cator if it can be confused with a color desciption. The
following change types are known:</p>

<p>+ add the specified set to the current attributes</p>

<p>- remove the set from the current attributes</p>

<p>! invert the set in the current attributes</p>

<p>= change the current attributes to the specified set</p>

<p>The attribute set can either be specified as a
hexadecimal number or a combination of the following
letters:</p>

<p>d dim u underline b bold r reverse s standout B
blinking</p>

<p>Colors are coded either as a hexadecimal number or two
letters specify- ing the desired background and foreground
color (in that order). The following colors are known:</p>

<p>k black r red g green y yellow b blue m magenta c cyan w
white d default color . leave color unchanged</p>

<p>The capitalized versions of the letter specify bright
colors. You can also use the pseudo-color i to set just the
brightness and leave the color unchanged. A one digit/letter
color description is treated as foreground or back- ground
color dependant on the current attributes: if reverse mode
is set, the background color is changed instead of the
foreground color. If you don t like this, prefix the color
with a &quot;.&quot;. If you want the same behaviour for
two-letter color descriptions, also prefix them with a
&quot;.&quot;. As a special case, &quot;%{-}&quot; restores
the attributes and colors that were set before the last
change was made (i.e. pops one level of the color- change
stack).</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>&quot;G&quot; set color to bright green</p>

<p>&quot;+b r&quot; use bold red</p>

<p>&quot;= yd&quot; clear all attributes, write in default
color on yellow back- ground.</p>

<p>%-Lw%{= BW}%50&gt;%n%f* %t%{-}%+Lw%&lt; The available
windows centered at the current window and trun- cated to
the available width. The current window is displayed white
on blue. This can be used with &quot;hardstatus alwayslast-
line&quot;.</p>

<p>%?%F%{.R.}%?%3n %t%? [%h]%? The window number and title
and the window s hardstatus, if one is set. Also use a red
background if this is the active focus. Useful for
&quot;caption string&quot;.</p>

<p>FLOW-CONTROL Each window has a flow-control setting that
determines how screen deals with the XON and XOFF characters
(and perhaps the interrupt character). When flow-control is
turned off, screen ignores the XON and XOFF char- acters,
which allows the user to send them to the current program by
simply typing them (useful for the emacs editor, for
instance). The trade-off is that it will take longer for
output from a &quot;normal&quot; pro- gram to pause in
response to an XOFF. With flow-control turned on, XON and
XOFF characters are used to immediately pause the output of
the current window. You can still send these characters to
the current program, but you must use the appropriate
two-character screen commands (typically &quot;C-a q&quot;
(xon) and &quot;C-a s&quot; (xoff)). The xon/xoff commands
are also useful for typing C-s and C-q past a terminal that
intercepts these characters.</p>

<p>Each window has an initial flow-control value set with
either the -f option or the &quot;defflow&quot; .screenrc
command. Per default the windows are set to automatic
flow-switching. It can then be toggled between the three
states fixed on , fixed off and automatic interactively with
the &quot;flow&quot; command bound to &quot;C-a f&quot;.</p>

<p>The automatic flow-switching mode deals with flow
control using the TIOCPKT mode (like &quot;rlogin&quot;
does). If the tty driver does not support TIOCPKT, screen
tries to find out the right mode based on the current
setting of the application keypad - when it is enabled,
flow-control is turned off and visa versa. Of course, you
can still manipulate flow- control manually when needed.</p>

<p>If youre running with flow-control enabled and find that
pressing the interrupt key (usually C-c) does not interrupt
the display until another 6-8 lines have scrolled by, try
running screen with the &quot;inter- rupt&quot; option (add
the &quot;interrupt&quot; flag to the &quot;flow&quot;
command in your .screenrc, or use the -i command-line
option). This causes the output that screen has accumulated
from the interrupted program to be flushed. One disadvantage
is that the virtual terminals memory contains the
non-flushed version of the output, which in rare cases can
cause minor inaccuracies in the output. For example, if you
switch screens and return, or update the screen with
&quot;C-a l&quot; you would see the version of the output
you would have gotten without &quot;interrupt&quot; being
on. Also, you might need to turn off flow-control (or use
auto-flow mode to turn it off automatically) when running a
program that expects you to type the interrupt character as
input, as it is possible to interrupt the output of the
virtual terminal to your physical terminal when flow-con-
trol is enabled. If this happens, a simple refresh of the
screen with &quot;C-a l&quot; will restore it. Give each
mode a try, and use whichever mode you find more
comfortable.</p>

<p>TITLES (naming windows) You can customize each windows
name in the window display (viewed with the
&quot;windows&quot; command (C-a w)) by setting it with one
of the title com- mands. Normally the name displayed is the
actual command name of the program created in the window.
However, it is sometimes useful to dis- tinguish various
programs of the same name or to change the name on- the-fly
to reflect the current state of the window.</p>

<p>The default name for all shell windows can be set with
the &quot;shelltitle&quot; command in the .screenrc file,
while all other windows are created with a
&quot;screen&quot; command and thus can have their name set
with the -t option. Interactively, there is the title-string
escape-sequence (&lt;esc&gt;kname&lt;esc&gt; and the
&quot;title&quot; command (C-a A). The former can be output
from an application to control the windows name under
software control, and the latter will prompt for a name when
typed. You can also bind pre-defined names to keys with the
&quot;title&quot; command to set things quickly without
prompting.</p>

<p>Finally, screen has a shell-specific heuristic that is
enabled by set- ting the window s name to
&quot;search|name&quot; and arranging to have a null title
escape-sequence output as a part of your prompt. The search
por- tion specifies an end-of-prompt search string, while
the name portion specifies the default shell name for the
window. If the name ends in a : screen will add what it
believes to be the current command running in the window to
the end of the windows shell name (e.g.
&quot;name:cmd&quot;). Otherwise the current command name
supersedes the shell name while it is running.</p>

<p>Heres how it works: you must modify your shell prompt to
output a null title-escape-sequence (&lt;esc&gt;k&lt;esc&gt;
as a part of your prompt. The last part of your prompt must
be the same as the string you speci- fied for the search
portion of the title. Once this is set up, screen will use
the title-escape-sequence to clear the previous command name
and get ready for the next command. Then, when a newline is
received from the shell, a search is made for the end of the
prompt. If found, it will grab the first word after the
matched string and use it as the command name. If the
command name begins with either ! , %, or ^ screen will use
the first word on the following line (if found) in
preference to the just-found name. This helps csh users get
better command names when using job control or history
recall commands.</p>

<p>Heres some .screenrc examples:</p>

<p>screen -t top 2 nice top</p>

<p>Adding this line to your .screenrc would start a nice-d
version of the &quot;top&quot; command in window 2 named
&quot;top&quot; rather than &quot;nice&quot;.</p>

<p>shelltitle &gt; |csh screen 1</p>

<p>These commands would start a shell with the given
shelltitle. The title specified is an auto-title that would
expect the prompt and the typed command to look something
like the following:</p>

<p>/usr/joe/src/dir&gt; trn</p>

<p>(it looks after the &gt; for the command name). The
window status would show the name &quot;trn&quot; while the
command was running, and revert to &quot;csh&quot; upon
completion.</p>

<p>bind R screen -t % |root: su</p>

<p>Having this command in your .screenrc would bind the key
sequence &quot;C-a R&quot; to the &quot;su&quot; command and
give it an auto-title name of &quot;root:&quot;. For this
auto-title to work, the screen could look something like
this:</p>

<p>% !em emacs file.c</p>

<p>Here the user typed the csh history command
&quot;!em&quot; which ran the previ- ously entered
&quot;emacs&quot; command. The window status would show
&quot;root:emacs&quot; during the execution of the command,
and revert to simply &quot;root:&quot; at its
completion.</p>

<p>bind o title bind E title &quot;&quot; bind u title
(unknown)</p>

<p>The first binding doesnt have any arguments, so it would
prompt you for a title. when you type &quot;C-a o&quot;. The
second binding would clear an auto-titles current setting
(C-a E). The third binding would set the current windows
title to &quot;(unknown)&quot; (C-a u).</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind when adding a null
title-escape-sequence to your prompt is that some shells
(like the csh) count all the non-con- trol characters as
part of the prompts length. If these invisible characters
arent a multiple of 8 then backspacing over a tab will
result in an incorrect display. One way to get around this
is to use a prompt like this:</p>

<p>set prompt=^[[0000m^[k^[</p>

<p>The escape-sequence &quot;&lt;esc&gt;[0000m&quot; not
only normalizes the character attributes, but all the zeros
round the length of the invisible charac- ters up to 8. Bash
users will probably want to echo the escape sequence in the
PROMPT_COMMAND:</p>

<p>PROMPT_COMMAND=echo -n -e &quot; 33k 33134&quot;</p>

<p>(I used &quot;134&quot; to output a because of a bug in
bash v1.04).</p>

<p>THE VIRTUAL TERMINAL Each window in a screen session
emulates a VT100 terminal, with some extra functions added.
The VT100 emulator is hard-coded, no other ter- minal types
can be emulated. Usually screen tries to emulate as much of
the VT100/ANSI standard as possible. But if your terminal
lacks certain capabilities, the emula- tion may not be
complete. In these cases screen has to tell the appli-
cations that some of the features are missing. This is no
problem on machines using termcap, because screen can use
the $TERMCAP variable to customize the standard screen
termcap.</p>

<p>But if you do a rlogin on another machine or your
machine supports only terminfo this method fails. Because of
this, screen offers a way to deal with these cases. Here is
how it works:</p>

<p>When screen tries to figure out a terminal name for
itself, it first looks for an entry named
&quot;screen.&lt;term&gt;&quot;, where &lt;term&gt; is the
contents of your $TERM variable. If no such entry exists,
screen tries &quot;screen&quot; (or &quot;screen-w&quot; if
the terminal is wide (132 cols or more)). If even this entry
cannot be found, &quot;vt100&quot; is used as a
substitute.</p>

<p>The idea is that if you have a terminal which doesn t
support an impor- tant feature (e.g. delete char or clear to
EOS) you can build a new termcap/terminfo entry for screen
(named &quot;screen.&lt;dumbterm&gt;&quot;) in which this
capability has been disabled. If this entry is installed on
your machines you are able to do a rlogin and still keep the
correct term- cap/terminfo entry. The terminal name is put
in the $TERM variable of all new windows. Screen also sets
the $TERMCAP variable reflecting the capabilities of the
virtual terminal emulated. Notice that, however, on machines
using the terminfo database this variable has no effect.
Fur- thermore, the variable $WINDOW is set to the window
number of each win- dow.</p>

<p>The actual set of capabilities supported by the virtual
terminal depends on the capabilities supported by the
physical terminal. If, for instance, the physical terminal
does not support underscore mode, screen does not put the us
and ue capabilities into the windows $TERMCAP variable,
accordingly. However, a minimum number of capabili- ties
must be supported by a terminal in order to run screen;
namely scrolling, clear screen, and direct cursor addressing
(in addition, screen does not run on hardcopy terminals or
on terminals that over- strike).</p>

<p>Also, you can customize the $TERMCAP value used by
screen by using the &quot;termcap&quot; .screenrc command,
or by defining the variable $SCREENCAP prior to startup.
When the is latter defined, its value will be copied
verbatim into each windows $TERMCAP variable. This can
either be the full terminal definition, or a filename where
the terminal &quot;screen&quot; (and/or
&quot;screen-w&quot;) is defined.</p>

<p>Note that screen honors the &quot;terminfo&quot;
.screenrc command if the system uses the terminfo database
rather than termcap.</p>

<p>When the boolean G0 capability is present in the termcap
entry for the terminal on which screen has been called, the
terminal emulation of screen supports multiple character
sets. This allows an application to make use of, for
instance, the VT100 graphics character set or national
character sets. The following control functions from ISO
2022 are sup- ported: lock shift G0 (SI), lock shift G1
(SO), lock shift G2, lock shift G3, single shift G2, and
single shift G3. When a virtual termi- nal is created or
reset, the ASCII character set is designated as G0 through
G3. When the G0 capability is present, screen evaluates the
capabilities S0 , E0 , and C0 if present. S0 is the sequence
the terminal uses to enable and start the graphics character
set rather than SI. E0 is the corresponding replacement for
SO. C0 gives a character by character translation string
that is used during semi- graphics mode. This string is
built like the acsc terminfo capabil- ity.</p>

<p>When the po and pf capabilities are present in the
terminals term- cap entry, applications running in a screen
window can send output to the printer port of the terminal.
This allows a user to have an appli- cation in one window
sending output to a printer connected to the ter- minal,
while all other windows are still active (the printer port
is enabled and disabled again for each chunk of output). As
a side- effect, programs running in different windows can
send output to the printer simultaneously. Data sent to the
printer is not displayed in the window. The info command
displays a line starting PRIN while the printer is
active.</p>

<p>Screen maintains a hardstatus line for every window. If
a window gets selected, the display s hardstatus will be
updated to match the win- dow s hardstatus line. If the
display has no hardstatus the line will be displayed as a
standard screen message. The hardstatus line can be changed
with the ANSI Application Program Command (APC):
&quot;ESC_&lt;string&gt;ESC
&quot;ESC]0..2;&lt;string&gt;^G&quot; is also accepted.</p>

<p>Some capabilities are only put into the $TERMCAP
variable of the vir- tual terminal if they can be
efficiently implemented by the physical terminal. For
instance, dl (delete line) is only put into the $TERM- CAP
variable if the terminal supports either delete line itself
or scrolling regions. Note that this may provoke confusion,
when the ses- sion is reattached on a different terminal, as
the value of $TERMCAP cannot be modified by parent
processes.</p>

<p>The &quot;alternate screen&quot; capability is not
enabled by default. Set the altscreen .screenrc command to
enable it.</p>

<p>INPUT TRANSLATION In order to do a full VT100 emulation
screen has to detect that a sequence of characters in the
input stream was generated by a keypress on the user s
keyboard and insert the VT100 style escape sequence. Screen
has a very flexible way of doing this by making it possible
to map arbitrary commands on arbitrary sequences of
characters. For stan- dard VT100 emulation the command will
always insert a string in the input buffer of the window
(see also command stuff in the command ta- ble). Because the
sequences generated by a keypress can change after a
reattach from a different terminal type, it is possible to
bind com- mands to the termcap name of the keys. Screen will
insert the correct binding after each reattach. See the
bindkey command for further details on the syntax and
examples.</p>

<p>Here is the table of the default key bindings. (A) means
that the com- mand is executed if the keyboard is switched
into application mode.</p>

<p>SPECIAL TERMINAL CAPABILITIES The following table
describes all terminal capabilities that are recog- nized by
screen and are not in the termcap(5) manual. You can place
these capabilities in your termcap entries (in /etc/termcap)
or use them with the commands termcap, terminfo and
termcapinfo in your screenrc files. It is often not possible
to place these capabilities in the terminfo database.</p>

<p>LP (bool) Terminal has VT100 style margins (magic
margins). Note that this capability is obsolete because
screen uses the standard xn instead.</p>

<p>Z0 (str) Change width to 132 columns.</p>

<p>Z1 (str) Change width to 80 columns.</p>

<p>WS (str) Resize display. This capability has the desired
width and height as arguments. SunView(tm) example:</p>

<p>NF (bool) Terminal doesnt need flow control. Send ^S and
^Q direct to the application. Same as flow off. The opposite
of this capability is nx.</p>

<p>G0 (bool) Terminal can deal with ISO 2022 font selection
sequences.</p>

<p>S0 (str) Switch charset G0 to the specified charset.
Default is .</p>

<p>E0 (str) Switch charset G0 back to standard charset.
Default is . C0 (str) Use the string as a conversion table
for font 0. See the ac capability for more details.</p>

<p>CS (str) Switch cursor-keys to application mode.</p>

<p>CE (str) Switch cursor-keys back to normal mode.</p>

<p>AN (bool) Turn on autonuke. See the autonuke command for
more details.</p>

<p>OL (num) Set the output buffer limit. See the obuflimit
command for more details.</p>

<p>KJ (str) Set the encoding of the terminal. See the
encoding com- mand for valid encodings.</p>

<p>AF (str) Change character foreground color in an ANSI
conform way. This capability will almost always be set to
(on terminfo machines).</p>

<p>AB (str) Same as AF, but change background color.</p>

<p>AX (bool) Does understand ANSI set default fg/bg color
(/</p>

<p>XC (str) Describe a translation of characters to strings
depending on the current font. More details follow in the
next sec- tion.</p>

<p>XT (bool) Terminal understands special xterm sequences
(OSC, mouse tracking).</p>

<p>C8 (bool) Terminal needs bold to display high-intensity
colors (e.g. Eterm).</p>

<p>TF (bool) Add missing capabilities to the termcap/info
entry. (Set by default).</p>

<p>CHARACTER TRANSLATION Screen has a powerful mechanism to
translate characters to arbitrary strings depending on the
current font and terminal type. Use this fea- ture if you
want to work with a common standard character set (say
ISO8851-latin1) even on terminals that scatter the more
unusual charac- ters over several national language font
pages.</p>

<p>Syntax:
XC=&lt;charset-mapping&gt;{,,&lt;charset-mapping&gt;}
&lt;charset-mapping&gt; :=
&lt;designator&gt;&lt;template&gt;{,&lt;mapping&gt;}
&lt;mapping&gt; :=
&lt;char-to-be-mapped&gt;&lt;template-arg&gt;</p>

<p>The things in braces may be repeated any number of
times.</p>

<p>A &lt;charset-mapping&gt; tells screen how to map
characters in font &lt;desig- nator&gt; (B: Ascii, A: UK, K:
german, etc.) to strings. Every &lt;mapping&gt; describes to
what string a single character will be trans- lated. A
template mechanism is used, as most of the time the codes
have a lot in common (for example strings to switch to and
from another charset). Each occurrence of % in
&lt;template&gt; gets substituted with the
&lt;template-arg&gt; specified together with the character.
If your strings are not similar at all, then use % as a
template and place the full string in &lt;template-arg&gt;.
A quoting mechanism was added to make it possible to use a
real %. The character quotes the spe- cial characters , %,
and ,.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<p>termcap hp700 XC=B304[,326\\,334]</p>

<p>This tells screen how to translate ISOlatin1 (charset B)
upper case umlaut characters on a hp700 terminal that has a
german charset. 304 and so on. Note that this line gets gets
translated to parsed *three* times before the internal
lookup table is built, there- fore a lot of quoting is
needed to create a single .</p>

<p>Another extension was added to allow more emulation: If
a mapping translates the unquoted % char, it will be sent to
the terminal when- ever screen switches to the corresponding
&lt;designator&gt;. In this special case the template is
assumed to be just % because the charset switch sequence and
the character mappings normally haven t much in common.</p>

<p>This example shows one use of the extension:</p>

<p>termcap xterm XC=K%,%[304,\\326,]334</p>

<p>Here, a part of the german (K) charset is emulated on an
xterm. If will be sent to the screen has to change to the K
charset, terminal, i.e. the ASCII charset is used instead.
The template is just %, so the mapping is straightforward: [
to 304, to 326, and ] to 334.</p>

<p>VERSION This is version 4.0.2. Its roots are a merge of
a custom version 2.3PR7 by Wayne Davison and several
enhancements to Oliver Laumanns version 2.0. Note that all
versions numbered 2.x are copyright by Oliver Lau- mann.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The latest official release of screen
available via anonymous ftp from gnudist.gnu.org,
nic.funet.fi or any other GNU distribution site. The home
site of screen is ftp.uni-erlangen.de, in the directory
pub/utili- ties/screen. The subdirectory private contains
the latest beta test- ing release. If you want to help, send
a note to screen@uni-erlan- gen.de.</p>

<p>BUGS &middot; dm (delete mode) and xs are not handled
correctly (they are ignored). xn is treated as a
magic-margin indicator.</p>

<p>&middot; Screen has no clue about double-high or
double-wide characters. But this is the only area where
vttest is allowed to fail.</p>

<p>&middot; It is not possible to change the environment
variable $TERMCAP when reattaching under a different
terminal type.</p>

<p>&middot; The support of terminfo based systems is very
limited. Adding extra capabilities to $TERMCAP may not have
any effects.</p>

<p>&middot; Screen does not make use of hardware tabs.</p>

<p>&middot; Screen must be installed as set-uid with owner
root on most systems in order to be able to correctly change
the owner of the tty device file for each window. Special
permission may also be required to write the file
&quot;/etc/utmp&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; Entries in &quot;/etc/utmp&quot; are not
removed when screen is killed with SIGKILL. This will cause
some programs (like &quot;w&quot; or &quot;rwho&quot;) to
advertise that a user is logged on who really isnt.</p>

<p>&middot; Screen may give a strange warning when your tty
has no utmp entry.</p>

<p>&middot; When the modem line was hung up, screen may not
automatically detach (or quit) unless the device driver is
configured to send a HANGUP signal. To detach a screen
session use the -D or -d command line option.</p>

<p>&middot; If a password is set, the command line options
-d and -D still detach a session without asking.</p>

<p>&middot; Both &quot;breaktype&quot; and
&quot;defbreaktype&quot; change the break generating method
used by all terminal devices. The first should change a win-
dow specific setting, where the latter should change only
the default for new windows.</p>

<p>&middot; When attaching to a multiuser session, the
users .screenrc file is not sourced. Each users personal
settings have to be included in the .screenrc file from
which the session is booted, or have to be changed
manually.</p>

<p>&middot; A weird imagination is most useful to gain full
advantage of all the features.</p>

<p>&middot; Send bug-reports, fixes, enhancements,
t-shirts, money, beer &amp; pizza to
screen@uni-erlangen.de.</p>
