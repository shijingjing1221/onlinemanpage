<p>NAME amanda-auth - Communication/Authentication methods
between Amanda server and client</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Amanda offers 7 methods of communication
between Amanda server (sometimes also called the tape
server) and clients, each with its own authentication
method. The desired communication method is specified by the
auth parameter in the amanda.conf file (amanda.conf(5))
commonly as a dumptype. Valid values to the auth parameter
are bsd, bsdudp, bsdtcp, krb4, krb5, local, rsh, and ssh.
Please note that krb4 will be removed in the next release.
The authentication and communication method is used during
the backup process amdump (amdump(8)) as well as the
recovery process amrecover (amrecover(8)). For detailed
information, please see
http://wiki.zmanda.com/index.php/Server/Client_authentication.</p>

<p>COMPILATION AND GENERAL INFORMATION The communication
method and thus type of authentication that will be used by
the Amanda server is specified by the auth parameter in the
dumptype for each disklist entry (DLE). The auth parameter
thus may be easily and globally specified in the
&quot;global&quot; dumptype. If auth is not specified, the
bsd communication method is used. See amanda.conf(5) for
more information on Amanda configuration and dumptypes, and
disklist(5) for more information on disklists.</p>

<p>On the client side, the Amanda daemon amandad validates
the connection depending on the value of the auth argument
passed to it (see Amanda(8)). Also, when it comes to
recovery, the auth parameter can be specified in the
amanda-client.conf(5) file to specify the communication
method to be used by the client to the server.</p>

<p>When Amanda is being built from source code, desired
communication and thus authentication methods (shown as
&quot;Authentication&quot;) must be specified as configure
options at compilation time.</p>

<p>Authentication Configure option(s) bsd
--with-bsd-security --with-amandahosts (pre-2.6) bsdtcp
--with-bsdtcp-security --with-amandahosts (pre-2.6) bsdudp
--with-bsdudp-security --with-amandahosts (pre-2.6) krb5
--with-krb5-security local (always included) rsh
--with-rsh-security ssh --with-ssh-security</p>

<p>There are additional configure options for bsd, bsdudp,
and bsdtcp to allow for specifying explicit UDP and TCP port
ranges.</p>

<p>--with-udpportrange --with-tcpportrange
--with-low-tcpportrange</p>

<p>See PORT USAGE below for more information.</p>

<p>There are additional configure options for Kerberos if
you so desire. All but the last option are for Kerberos 4.
Defaults shown in square brackets.</p>

<p>--with-server-principal=ARG server host principal
[amanda] --with-server-instance=ARG server host instance []
--with-server-keyfile=ARG server host key file [/.amanda]
--with-client-principal=ARG client host principal [rcmd]
--with-client-instance=ARG client host instance
[HOSTNAME_INSTANCE] --with-client-keyfile=ARG client host
key file [KEYFILE] --with-ticket-lifetime=ARG ticket
lifetime [128] --with-krb4-security=DIR where libkrb.a lives
[see below] --with-krb5-security=DIR where libkrb.a lives
[see below]</p>

<p>If configuring with --with-krb4-security and/or
--with-krb5-security, the configure script will search under
/usr/kerberos/lib, /usr/cygnus/lib, /usr/lib, and
/opt/kerberos/lib for the kerberos bits, libkrb.a, in this
order. Kerberos support will not be added if it does not
find them. If the kerberos bits are found under some other
hierarchy, you can specify this via --with-krb5-security=DIR
and/or --with-krb4-security=DIR, where DIR is where the
kerberos bits live. The configure script will then look in
the &acute;lib&acute; directory under this hierarchy for
libkrb.a.</p>

<p>The auth parameter selects a
communication/authentication method to use between the
client and the backup server. These methods are described
each in their own section below.</p>

<p>BSD, BSDUDP, AND BSDTCP COMMUNICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
For more detail, see
http://wiki.zmanda.com/index.php/Configuring_bsd/bsdudp/bsdtcp_authentication.</p>

<p>The bsd, bsdudp, and bsdtcp communication methods use
either UDP, TCP, or both protocols operating as a network
service to authenticate and exchange data between server and
clients.</p>

<p>In addition to compilation and general configuration
(see COMPILATION AND GENERAL INFORMATION above), the
authentication method that the client is configured to
receive is specified by the auth parameter in the network
service configuration for Amanda. The authentication method
used by an Amanda client to reach the server during recovery
is the authentication method specified by the auth parameter
in the client&acute;s Amanda network service configuration
or in its amanda-client.conf file (see
amanda-client.conf(5)).</p>

<p>.amandahosts file Servers and clients using the bsd,
bsdudp, and bsdtcp authentication methods refer to the
.amandahosts file to control access. Amanda should be
compiled for this access control if one of these methods
will be used and is the default compilation option for
Amanda 2.6 (use --with-amandahosts when compiling pre-2.6
versions of Amanda).</p>

<p>Amanda looks for the .amandahosts file in the Amanda
user&acute;s home directory, commonly /var/lib/amanda.</p>

<p>Each authorization is on its own line in the following
format</p>

<p>hostname [ username [ service... ] ]</p>

<p>If username is ommitted, it defaults to the user running
amandad, i.e. the user listed in the inetd or xinetd
configuration file.</p>

<p>service... is a space-delimited list of services the
client is authorized to execute: noop, selfcheck, sendsize,
sendbackup, amdump (a shortcut for the previous four
services which are required on clients), amindexd, and
amidxtaped. The last two services are required on a server
for clients to connect to it using amrecover.</p>

<p>Example of the .amandahosts file on an Amanda client</p>

<p>amandaserver.example.com amandabackup amdump</p>

<p>Example of the .amandahosts file on an Amanda server</p>

<p>amandaclient1.example.com root amindexd amidxtaped</p>

<p>bsd communication and authentication The authentication
is done using .amandahosts file in the Amanda user&acute;s
home directory. The protocol between Amanda server and
client is UDP. The number of disk list entries
(DLEs)--number of Amanda clients--is limited by the UDP
packet size. This authentication protocol will use a
different port for each data stream (see PORT USAGE
below)</p>

<p>bsdudp communication and authentication The
authentication is done using .amandahosts files in the
Amanda user&acute;s home directory. It uses UDP protocol
between Amanda server and client for data and hence the
number of DLEs is limited by the UDP packet size. It uses
one TCP port to establish the connection and multiplexes all
data streams using one port on the server (see PORT USAGE
below).</p>

<p>bsdtcp communication and authentication The
authentication is done using .amandahosts files in the
backup user&acute;s (for example: amandabackup) home
directory. It uses TCP protocol between Amanda server and
client. On the client, two reserved ports are used. On the
server, all data streams are multiplexed to one port (see
PORT USAGE below).</p>

<p>USING INETD SERVER Template for Amanda client inetd
service entry</p>

<p>service_name socket_type protocol wait/nowait
amanda_backup_user absolute_path_to_amandad amandad
server_args</p>

<p>Client example of using bsd authorization for inetd
server given Amanda user is &quot;amandabackup&quot;:</p>

<p>amanda dgram udp wait amandabackup /path/to/amandad
amandad -auth=bsd amdump</p>

<p>The same could be used for bsdudp if specifying
-auth=bsdudp instead of -auth=bsd.</p>

<p>Client example of using bsdtcp authorization for inetd
server given Amanda user is &quot;amandabackup&quot;:</p>

<p>amanda stream tcp nowait amanda /path/to/amandad amandad
-auth=bsdtcp amdump</p>

<p>amindexd and amidxtaped would typically be added at the
end of the line as amandad server arguments for an Amanda
server.</p>

<p>Server example of using bsdtcp authorization for inetd
server given Amanda user is &quot;amandabackup&quot;:</p>

<p>amanda stream tcp nowait amanda /path/to/amandad amandad
-auth=bsdtcp amdump amindexd amidxtaped</p>

<p>For Amanda version 2.5.0 and earlier, remember that
neither bsdudp nor bsdtcp are supported and the Amanda
daemon amandad accepts no arguments. Because of the latter,
amrecover as of Amanda version 2.5.1 is not compatible with
2.5.0 and earlier servers. Thus, servers that are 2.5.0 or
earlier must, in addition to the amanda service, run
amindexd and amidxtaped Amanda services as their own network
services, amandaidx and amidxtape, respectively (see
below).</p>

<p>There are no compatibility issues if server and clients
are all 2.5.0 or earlier. If your server is 2.5.1 or later,
you can still have clients that are 2.5.0 and earlier
although you must then use bsd communication/authentication
with these clients and must also run amindexd and amidxtaped
Amanda services on the server as their own network services,
amandaidx and amidxtape, respectively (see below). If you
have a server that is 2.5.0 and earlier, clients of a later
version on which you wish to run amrecover must use
amoldrecover instead and, again, the server must be running
the amandaidx and amidxtape network services.</p>

<p>Example of amindexd and amidxtaped Amanda daemon
services configured as their own network services for a
2.5.0 or earlier server or a newer server having 2.5.0 or
earlier clients</p>

<p>amandaidx stream tcp nowait amanda
/usr/local/libexec/amanda/current/amindexd amindexd
amidxtape stream tcp nowait amanda
/usr/local/libexec/amanda/current/amidxtaped amidxtaped</p>

<p>USING XINETD SERVER Template for Amanda client xinetd
service file</p>

<p>service amanda { only_from = Amanda server socket_type =
socket type protocol = protocol wait = yes/no user = amanda
backup user group = amanda backup user group id groups = yes
server = absolute path to amandad server_args = amandad
server arguments disable = no }</p>

<p>The only_from parameter can be used with xinetd but is
usually in addition to the primary form of access control
via the .amandahosts file.</p>

<p>Client example of using bsd authorization for xinetd
server and for Amanda user &quot;amandabackup&quot;:</p>

<p>service amanda { only_from = amandaserver.example.com
socket_type = dgram protocol = udp wait = yes user =
amandabackup group = disk groups = yes server =
/path/to/amandad server_args = -auth=bsd amdump disable = no
}</p>

<p>The same could be used for bsdudp if specifying
-auth=bsdudp instead of -auth=bsd.</p>

<p>Client example of using bsdtcp authorization for xinetd
server and for Amanda user &quot;amandabackup&quot;:</p>

<p>service amanda { only_from = amandaserver.example.com
amandaclient.example.com socket_type = stream protocol = tcp
wait = no user = amandabackup group = disk groups = yes
server = /path/to/amandad server_args = -auth=bsdtcp amdump
disable = no }</p>

<p>amindexd and amidxtaped would typically be added as
additional amandad server_args for an Amanda server.</p>

<p>For Amanda version 2.5.0 and earlier, remember that
neither bsdudp nor bsdtcp are supported and the Amanda
daemon amandad accepts no arguments. Because of the latter,
amrecover as of Amanda version 2.5.1 is not compatible with
2.5.0 and earlier servers. Thus, servers that are 2.5.0 or
earlier must, in addition to the amanda service, run
amindexd and amidxtaped Amanda services as their own network
services, amandaidx and amidxtape, respectively (see
below).</p>

<p>There are no compatibility issues if server and clients
are all 2.5.0 or earlier. If your server is 2.5.1 or later,
you can still have clients that are 2.5.0 and earlier
although you must then use bsd communication/authentication
with these clients and must also run amindexd and amidxtaped
Amanda services on the server as their own network services,
amandaidx and amidxtape, respectively (see below). If you
have a server that is 2.5.0 and earlier, clients of a later
version on which you wish to run amrecover must use
amoldrecover instead and, again, the server must be running
the amandaidx and amidxtape network services.</p>

<p>Example of amindexd and amidxtaped Amanda daemon
services configured as their own network services for a
2.5.0 or earlier server or a newer server having 2.5.0 or
earlier clients</p>

<p>service amandaidx { socket_type = stream protocol = tcp
wait = no user = amanda group = disk server =
/usr/local/libexec/amanda/amindexd disable = no }</p>

<p>service amidxtape { socket_type = stream protocol = tcp
wait = no user = amanda group = disk server =
/usr/local/libexec/amanda/amidxtaped disable = no }</p>

<p>PORT USAGE List of TCP/UDP ports used by network service
communication methods for Amanda server and client.</p>

<p>Key: UP = Unreserved Port RPpAP = Reserved Port per
Amanda Process UPpDLE = Unreserved Port per DLE [..] =
Configure options that can be used at compile time to define
port ranges</p>

<p>Authentication Protocol Amanda server Amanda client bsd
udp 1 RPpAP [--with-udpportrange] 10080 tcp 1 UP
[--with-tcpportrange] 3 UPpDLE [--with-tcpportrange] bsdudp
udp 1 RPpAP [--with-udpportrange] 10080 tcp 1 UP
[-with-tcpportrange] 1 UPpDLE [--with-tcpportrange] bsdtcp
tcp 1 RPpAP [--with-low-tcpportrange] 10080</p>

<p>Amanda server also uses two ports (dumper process) to
communicate with the chunker/taper processes. These ports
are in the range set by --with-tcpportrange.</p>

<p>You can override the default port ranges that Amanda was
compiled with in each configuration using the
reserved-udp-port, reserved-tcp-port, and
unreserved-tcp-port parameters in amanda.conf and
amanda-client.conf configuration files (see amanda.conf(5)
and amanda- client.conf(5)).</p>

<p>KERBEROS COMMUNICATION AND AUTHENTICATION For more
detail, see
http://wiki.zmanda.com/index.php/Kerberos_authentication.</p>

<p>Amanda supports Kerberos 4 and 5 communication methods
between Amanda server and client. Please note, however, that
support for Kerberos 4 will be removed in the next
release.</p>

<p>General information including compilation are given
above (see COMPILATION AND GENERAL INFORMATION above). Below
sections give specific Kerberos 4 and 5 information.</p>

<p>KERBEROS v4 Please note that support for Kerberos 4 will
be removed in the next release.</p>

<p>Kerberos 4 uses UDP protocol and the number of DLEs is
limited by UDP packet size.</p>

<p>The kerberized AMANDA service uses a different port on
the client hosts. The /etc/services line is:</p>

<p>kamanda 10081/udp</p>

<p>And the /etc/inetd.conf line is:</p>

<p>kamanda dgram udp wait root
/usr/local/libexec/amanda/amandad amandad -auth=krb4</p>

<p>Note that you&acute;re running this as root, rather than
as your dump user. AMANDA will set its uid down to the dump
user at times it doesn&acute;t need to read the srvtab file,
and give up root permissions entirely before it goes off and
runs dump. Alternately you can change your srvtab files to
be readable by user amanda.</p>

<p>The following dumptype options apply to krb4:</p>

<p>auth &quot;krb4&quot; # use krb4 auth for this host #
(you can mingle krb hosts and bsd .rhosts in one conf)
kencrypt # encrypt this filesystem over the net using the
krb4 # session key. About 2x slower. Good for those root #
partitions containing your keyfiles. Don&acute;t want to #
give away the keys to an ethernet sniffer! # This is
currently always enabled. There is no # way to disable it.
This is a bug.</p>

<p>KERBEROS v5 Kerberos 5 uses TCP and the server uses only
one TCP port and data streams are multiplexed to this
port.</p>

<p>The krb5 driver script defaults to:</p>

<p>/* * The lifetime of our tickets in minutes. */ #define
AMANDA_TKT_LIFETIME (12*60)</p>

<p>/* * The name of the service in /etc/services. */
#define AMANDA_KRB5_SERVICE_NAME &quot;k5amanda&quot;</p>

<p>You can currently only override these by editing the
source code.</p>

<p>The kerberized AMANDA service uses a different port on
the client hosts. The /etc/services line is:</p>

<p>k5amanda 10082/tcp</p>

<p>And the /etc/inetd.conf line is:</p>

<p>k5amanda stream tcp nowait root
/usr/local/libexec/amanda/amandad amandad -auth=krb5</p>

<p>Note that you&acute;re running this as root, rather than
as your dump user. AMANDA will set its UID down to the dump
user at times it doesn&acute;t need to read the keytab file,
and give up root permissions entirely before it goes off and
runs dump. Alternately you can change your keytab files to
be readable by user amanda. You should understand the
security implications of this before changing the
permissions on the keytab.</p>

<p>The following dumptype options apply to krb5:</p>

<p>auth &quot;krb5&quot; # use krb5 auth for this host #
(you can mingle krb hosts and bsd .rhosts in one conf)</p>

<p>The principal and keytab files that Amanda uses must be
set in the amanda.conf file for kerberos 5 dumps to work.
You can hardcode this in the source code if you really want
to (common-src/krb5-security.c)</p>

<p>krb5keytab krb5principal</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>krb5keytab &quot;/etc/krb5.keytab-amanda&quot;
krb5principal &quot;amanda/saidin.omniscient.com&quot;</p>

<p>The principal in the second option must be contained in
the first. The keytab should be readable by the amanda user
(and definitely not world readable!) and is (obviously) on
the server. In MIT&acute;s kadmin, the following:</p>

<p>addprinc -randkey amanda/saidin.omniscient.com ktadd -k
/etc/krb5.keytab-amanda amanda/saidin.omniscient.com</p>

<p>will do the trick. You will obviously want to change the
principal name to reflect something appropriate for the
conventions at your site.</p>

<p>You must also configure each client to allow the amanda
principal in for dumps.</p>

<p>There are several ways to go about authorizing a server
to connect to a client.</p>

<p>The normal way is via a .k5amandausers file or a
.k5login file in the client user&acute;s home directory. The
determination of which file to use is based on the way you
ran configure on AMANDA. By default, AMANDA will use
.k5amandahosts, but if you configured with
--without-amandahosts, AMANDA will use .k5login. (similar to
the default for .rhosts/.amandahosts-style security). The
.k5login file syntax is a superset of the default krb5
.k5login. The routines to check it are implemented in amanda
rather than using krb5_kuserok because the connections are
actually gssapi based.</p>

<p>This .k5amandahosts/.k5login is a hybrid of the
.amandahosts and a .k5login file. You can just list
principal names, as in a .k5login file and the principal
will be permitted in from any host. If you do NOT specify a
realm, then there is no attempt to validate the realm (this
is only really a concern if you have cross-realm
authentication set up with another realm or something else
that allows you multiple realms in your kdc. If you do
specify a realm, only that principal@realm will be permitted
to connect.</p>

<p>You may prepend this with a hostname and whitespace, and
only that principal (with optional realm as above) will be
permitted to access from that hostname.</p>

<p>Here are examples of valid entries in the
.k5amandahosts:</p>

<p>service/amanda service/amanda@TEST.COM
dumpmaster.test.com service/amanda dumpmaster.test.com
service/amanda@TEST.COM</p>

<p>Rather than using a .k5amandahosts or .k5login file, the
easiest way is to use a principal named after the
destination user, (such as amanda@TEST.COM in our example)
and not have either a .k5amandahosts or .k5login file in the
destination user&acute;s home directory.</p>

<p>There is no attempt to verify the realm in this case
(only a concern if you have cross-realm authentication
setup).</p>

<p>LOCAL COMMUNICATION The Amanda server communicates with
the client internally versus over the network, ie. the
client is also the server.</p>

<p>This is the only method that requires no authentication
as it is clearly not needed.</p>

<p>RSH COMMUNICATION AND AUTHENTICATION For more detail,
see
http://wiki.zmanda.com/index.php/Configuring_rsh_authentication.</p>

<p>The Amanda server communicates with its client as the
Amanda user via the RSH protocol.</p>

<p>Please note that RSH protocol itself is insecure and
should be used with caution especially on any servers and
clients with public IPs.</p>

<p>Each Amanda client communicates with the server using
one TCP port and all data streams from the client are
multiplexed over one port. The number of Amanda clients is
limited by the number of reserved ports available on the
Amanda server. Some versions of RSH do not use reserved
ports and, thus, this restriction is not valid.</p>

<p>General information including compilation is given above
(see COMPILATION AND GENERAL INFORMATION above).</p>

<p>In addition to specifying the auth field in dumptype
definition, it might be required to specify client_username
and amandad fields. If the backup user name is different on
the Amanda client, the user name is specified as
client_username. If the location of the Amanda daemon
amandad is different on the Amanda client, the location is
specified as amandad_path field value.</p>

<p>For example: define dumptype rsh_example { ... auth
&quot;rsh&quot; client_username &quot;amandabackup&quot;
amandad_path &quot;/usr/lib/exec/amandad&quot; ... }</p>

<p>SSH COMMUNICATION AND AUTHENTICATION For more detail,
see
http://wiki.zmanda.com/index.php/How_To:Set_up_transport_encryption_with_SSH.</p>

<p>Amanda client sends data to the server using SSH. SSH
keys have to be set up so that Amanda server can communicate
with its clients using SSH.</p>

<p>General information including compilation is given above
(see COMPILATION AND GENERAL INFORMATION above).</p>

<p>SSH provides transport encryption and authentication. To
set up an SSH authentication session, Amanda will run the
equivalent of the following to start the backup process.</p>

<p>/path/to/ssh -l user_name client.zmanda.com
$libexecdir/amandad</p>

<p>To use SSH, you need to set up SSH keys either by
storing the passphrase in cleartext, using ssh-agent, or
using no passphrase at all. All of these options have
security implications which should be carefully considered
before adoption.</p>

<p>When you use a public key on the client to do data
encryption (see
http://wiki.zmanda.com/index.php/How_To:Set_up_data_encryption),
you can lock away the private key in a secure place. Both,
transport and storage will be encrypted with such a setup.
See http://wiki.zmanda.com/index.php/Encryption for an
overview of encryption options.</p>

<p>Enable SSH authentication and set the ssh_keys option in
all DLEs for that host by adding the following to the DLE
itself or to the corresponding dumptype in amanda.conf:</p>

<p>auth &quot;ssh&quot; ssh_keys
&quot;/home/amandabackup/.ssh/id_rsa_amdump&quot;</p>

<p>ssh_keys is the path to the private key on the client.
If the username to which Amanda should connect is different
from the default, then you should also add</p>

<p>client_username &quot;otherusername&quot;</p>

<p>If your server amandad path and client amandad path are
different, you should also add</p>

<p>amandad_path &quot;/client/amandad/path&quot;</p>

<p>For a marginal increase in security, prepend the keys
used for AMANDA in the clients&acute; authorized_keys file
with the following:</p>


<p>from=&quot;amanda_server.your.domain.com&quot;,no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,command=&quot;/absolute/path/to/amandad
-auth=ssh amdump&quot;</p>

<p>This will limit that key to connect only from Amanda
server and only be able to execute amandad(8).</p>

<p>In the same way, prepend the key used for AMANDA in the
server&acute;s authorized_keys file with:</p>


<p>from=&quot;amanda_client.your.domain.com&quot;,no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,command=&quot;/absolute/path/to/amandad
-auth=ssh amindexd amidxtaped&quot;</p>

<p>You can omit the from=.. option if you have too many
clients to list, although this has obvious security
implications.</p>

<p>Set ssh_keys and any other necessary options in
/etc/amanda/amanda_client.conf:</p>

<p>auth &quot;ssh&quot; ssh_keys
&quot;/root/.ssh/id_rsa_amrecover&quot; client_username
&quot;amanda&quot; amandad_path
&quot;/server/amandad/path&quot;</p>

<p>Besides user keys, SSH uses host keys to uniquely
identify each host, to prevent one host from impersonating
another. Unfortunately, the only easy way to set up these
host keys is to make a connection and tell SSH that you
trust the identity:</p>

<p>$ ssh client1.zmanda.com The authenticity of host
&acute;client1.zmanda.com (192.168.10.1)&acute; can&acute;t
be established. RSA key fingerprint is
26:4e:df:a2:be:c8:cb:20:1c:68:8b:cc:c0:3b:8e:9d. Are you
sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?yes</p>

<p>As Amanda will not answer this question itself, you must
manually make every connection (server to client and client
to server) that you expect Amanda to make. Note that you
must use the same username that Amanda will use (that is,
ssh client and ssh client.domain.com are distinct).</p>
