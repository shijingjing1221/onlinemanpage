<p>FREOPEN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FREOPEN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME freopen - open a stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>FILE *freopen(const char *restrict filename, const char
*restrict mode, FILE *restrict stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The freopen() function shall first attempt
to flush the stream and close any file descriptor associated
with stream. Failure to flush or close the file descriptor
successfully shall be ignored. The error and end-of-file
indicators for the stream shall be cleared.</p>

<p>The freopen() function shall open the file whose
pathname is the string pointed to by filename and associate
the stream pointed to by stream with it. The mode argument
shall be used just as in fopen().</p>

<p>The original stream shall be closed regardless of
whether the subse- quent open succeeds.</p>

<p>If filename is a null pointer, the freopen() function
shall attempt to change the mode of the stream to that
specified by mode, as if the name of the file currently
associated with the stream had been used. It is
implementation-defined which changes of mode are permitted
(if any), and under what circumstances.</p>

<p>After a successful call to the freopen() function, the
orientation of the stream shall be cleared, the encoding
rule shall be cleared, and the associated mbstate_t object
shall be set to describe an initial conversion state.</p>

<p>The largest value that can be represented correctly in
an object of type off_t shall be established as the offset
maximum in the open file description.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, freopen() shall
return the value of stream. Otherwise, a null pointer shall
be returned, and errno shall be set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The freopen() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the
path prefix, or the file exists and the permissions
specified by mode are denied, or the file does not exist and
write permission is denied for the parent directory of the
file to be created.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught during freopen().</p>

<p>EISDIR The named file is a directory and mode requires
write access.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>EMFILE {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in
the calling process.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG</p>

<p>The length of the filename argument exceeds {PATH_MAX}
or a pathname component is longer than {NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENFILE The maximum allowable number of files is
currently open in the system.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of filename does not name an existing
file or file- name is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The directory or file system that would contain
the new file cannot be expanded, the file does not exist,
and it was to be created.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>ENXIO The named file is a character special or block
special file, and the device associated with this special
file does not exist.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW The named file is a regular file and the size
of the file cannot be represented correctly in an object of
type off_t.</p>

<p>EROFS The named file resides on a read-only file system
and mode requires write access.</p>

<p>The freopen() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the mode argument is not valid.</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG</p>

<p>Pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an
intermediate result whose length exceeds {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.</p>

<p>ENXIO A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the
request was outside the capabilities of the device.</p>

<p>ETXTBSY The file is a pure procedure (shared text) file
that is being executed and mode requires write access.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Directing Standard Output to a File The
following example logs all standard output to the
/tmp/logfile file.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; ... FILE *fp; ... fp = freopen
(&quot;/tmp/logfile&quot;, &quot;a+&quot;, stdout); ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The freopen() function is typically
used to attach the preopened streams associated with stdin,
stdout, and stderr to other files.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
