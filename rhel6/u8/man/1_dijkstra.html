<p>NAME dijkstra - single-source distance filter</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dijkstra [ -ap? ] [ sourcenode file ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dijkstra reads a stream of graphs and for
each computes the distance of every node from sourcenode.
Edge length is given in the len attribute, and the default
is 1. The dist attribute of every node is set to its
distance from sourcenode. If the -p flag is used, the prev
attribute of each node reachable from sourcenode is set to
the name of the previ- ous node on a shortest path. The
graph attribute maxdist is set to the maximum dist of all
nodes in the graph.</p>

<p>By default, if the graph is disconnected, the dist
attribute of nodes unreachable from sourcenode are left
untouched, and maxdist is set to the maximum of any previous
value and the largest distance recorded in this run. On the
other hand, if the -a flag is used, the dist attribute of an
unreachable node is assigned a very large value, and maxdist
records the maximum distance found in the component
containing sourcenode.</p>

<p>Any number of sourcenode file pairs may be given. If the
last file is missing, stdin is used. All output is written
to stdout.</p>

<p>In a typical application, dist and maxdist can drive a
downstream cal- culation of color or some other
attribute.</p>
