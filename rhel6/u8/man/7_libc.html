<p>NAME libc - Overview of standard C libraries on
Linux</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The term &quot;libc&quot; is commonly used
as a shorthand for the &quot;standard C library&quot;, a
library of standard functions that can be used by all C
programs (and sometimes by programs in other languages).
Because of some history (see below), use of the term
&quot;libc&quot; to refer to the stan- dard C library is
somewhat ambiguous on Linux.</p>

<p>glibc By far the most widely used C library on Linux is
the GNU C Library (http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/), often
referred to as glibc. This is the C library that is nowadays
used in all major Linux distribu- tions. It is also the C
library whose details are documented in the relevant pages
of the man-pages project (primarily in Section 3 of the
manual). Documentation of glibc is also available in the
glibc manual, available via the command info libc. Release
1.0 of glibc was made in September 1992. (There were earlier
0.x releases.) The next major release of glibc was 2.0, at
the beginning of 1997.</p>

<p>The pathname /lib/libc.so.6 (or something similar) is
normally a sym- bolic link that points to the location of
the glibc library, and exe- cuting this pathname will cause
glibc to display various information about the version
installed on your system.</p>

<p>Linux libc In the early to mid 1990s, there was for a
while Linux libc, a fork of glibc 1.x created by Linux
developers who felt that glibc development at the time was
not sufficing for the needs of Linux. Often, this library
was referred to (ambiguously) as just &quot;libc&quot;.
Linux libc released major versions 2, 3, 4, and 5 (as well
as many minor versions of those releases). For a while,
Linux libc was the standard C library in many Linux
distributions. However, notwithstanding the original
motivations of the Linux libc effort, by the time glibc 2.0
was released, it was clearly superior to Linux libc, and all
major Linux distributions that had been using Linux libc
soon switched back to glibc. (Since this switch occurred
over a decade ago, man-pages no longer takes care to
document Linux libc details. Nevertheless, the history is
visible in vestiges of information about Linux libc that
remain in some manual pages, in particular, references to
libc4 and libc5.)</p>

<p>Other C libraries There are various other less widely
used C libraries for Linux. These libraries are generally
smaller than glibc, both in terms of features and memory
footprint, and often intended for building small binaries,
perhaps targeted at development for embedded Linux systems.
Among such libraries are uClibc (http://www.uclibc.org/) and
dietlibc (http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/). Details of these
libraries are gener- ally not covered by the man-pages
project.</p>
