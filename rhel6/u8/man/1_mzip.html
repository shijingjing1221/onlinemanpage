<p>Name mzip - change protection mode and eject disk on
Zip/Jaz drive</p>

<p>Note of warning This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation, and may not be
entirely accurate or complete. See the end of this man page
for details.</p>

<p>Description The mzip command is used to issue ZIP disk
specific commands on Linux, Solaris or HPUX. Its syntax
is:</p>

<p>mzip [-epqrwx]</p>

<p>Mzip allows the following command line options:</p>

<p>e Ejects the disk.</p>

<p>f Force eject even if the disk is mounted (must be given
in addi- tion to -e).</p>

<p>r Write protect the disk.</p>

<p>w Remove write protection.</p>

<p>p Password write protect.</p>

<p>x Password protect</p>

<p>u Temporarily unprotect the disk until it is ejected.
The disk becomes writable, and reverts back to its old state
when ejected.</p>

<p>q Queries the status</p>

<p>To remove the password, set it to one of the
passwordless modes -r or -w: mzip will then ask you for the
password, and unlock the disk. If you have forgotten the
password, you can get rid of it by low-level formatting the
disk (using your SCSI adaptors BIOS setup).</p>

<p>The ZipTools disk shipped with the drive is also
password protected. On Dos or on a Mac, this password is
automatically removed once the ZipTools have been installed.
From various articles posted to Usenet, I learned that the
password for the tools disk is APlaceForYourStuff. Mzip
knows about this password, and tries it first, before
prompting you for a password. Thus mzip -w z: unlocks the
tools disk. The tools disk is formatted in a special way so
as to be usable both in a PC and in a Mac. On a PC, the Mac
filesystem appears as a hidden file named partishn.mac . You
may erase it to reclaim the 50 Megs of space taken up by the
Mac filesystem.</p>

<p>Bugs This command is a big kludge. A proper
implementation would take a rework of significant parts of
mtools, but unfortunately I dont have the time for this
right now. The main downside of this implementation is that
it is inefficient on some architectures (several successive
calls to mtools, which defeats mtools caching).</p>

<p>Viewing the texi doc This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation. However, this
process is only approximative, and some items, such as
crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate
represen- tation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all
information has been translated into the manpage version.
Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.
See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the
texinfo doc.</p>

<p>* To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run
the fol- lowing commands:</p>

<p>./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi</p>

<p>* To generate a html copy, run:</p>

<p>./configure; make html</p>

<p>A premade html can be found at http://www.gnu.org/soft-
ware/mtools/manual/mtools.html</p>

<p>* To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs info
mode), run:</p>

<p>./configure; make info</p>

<p>The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as
html. Indeed, in the info version certain examples are
difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in
info.</p>
