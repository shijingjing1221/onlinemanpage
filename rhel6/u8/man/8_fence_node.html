<p>FENCE_NODE(8) cluster FENCE_NODE(8)</p>

<p>NAME fence_node - a utility to run fence agents</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fence_node [OPTIONS] nodename</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This utility runs a fence agent against
nodename. The agent and args are taken from the running
cluster configuration based on clus- ter.conf(5).</p>

<p>fence_node is a wrapper around the libfence functions:
fence_node() and unfence_node(). These libfence functions
use libccs to read the node fencing configuration, which
means that corosync (with cman and ccs) must be running to
use fence_node(8).</p>

<p>The fenced(8) daemon is the main user of
libfence:fence_node(), and the configuration details for
that function are given in the fenced(8) man page.</p>

<p>Fencing vs. Unfencing The main use for unfencing is with
storage/SAN (non-power) agents.</p>

<p>When using power-based fencing agents, the fencing
action itself is supposed to turn a node back on after first
turning the power off (this happens automatically with a
&quot;reboot&quot; action, and needs to be config- ured
explicitly as &quot;off&quot; + &quot;on&quot;
otherwise.)</p>

<p>When using storage-based fencing agents, the fencing
action is not allowed to re-enable a node after disabling
it. Re-enabling a fenced node is only safe once the node has
been rebooted. A natural way to re-enable a fenced nodes
access to storage, is for that node to re- enable the access
itself during its startup process. The cman init script
calls fence_node -U (nodename defaults to local nodename
when unfencing). Unfencing a node without an &lt;unfence&gt;
configuration (see below) is a no-op.</p>

<p>The basic differences between fencing and unfencing:</p>

<p>Fencing</p>

<p>1. libfence: fence_node(), command line: fence_node
nodename</p>

<p>2. Turns off or disables a node.</p>

<p>3. Agents run with the default action of
&quot;off&quot;, &quot;disable&quot; or
&quot;reboot&quot;.</p>

<p>4. Performed by a cluster node against another node that
fails (by the fenced daemon).</p>

<p>Unfencing</p>

<p>1. libfence: unfence_node(), command line: fence_node -U
nodename</p>

<p>2. Turns on or enables a node.</p>

<p>3. Agents run with the explicit action of &quot;on&quot;
or &quot;enable&quot;.</p>

<p>4. Performed by a cluster node &quot;against&quot;
itself during startup (by the cman init script).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -U Unfence the node, default local node
name.</p>

<p>-S Run status on node name.</p>

<p>-m num Method number, starting from 1 (use with -S).</p>

<p>-e 0|1 Enable/disable fenced_external notification.</p>

<p>-v Show fence agent results, -vv to also show agent
args.</p>

<p>-h Print a help message describing available options,
then exit.</p>

<p>-V Print program version information, then exit.</p>

<p>FILES The Unfencing/unfence_node() configuration is very
similar to the Fenc- ing/fence_node() configuration shown in
fenced(8). Unfencing is only performed for a node with an
&lt;unfence&gt; section:</p>

<p>&lt;clusternode name=&quot;node1&quot;
nodeid=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;fence&gt; &lt;/fence&gt;
&lt;unfence&gt; &lt;/unfence&gt; &lt;/clusternode&gt;</p>

<p>The &lt;unfence&gt; section does not contain
&lt;method&gt; sections like the &lt;fence&gt; section does.
It contains &lt;device&gt; references directly, which mirror
the corresponding device sections for &lt;fence&gt;, with
the notable addition of the explicit action of
&quot;on&quot; or &quot;enable&quot;. The same
&lt;fencedevice&gt; is referenced by both fence and unfence
&lt;device&gt; lines, and the same per-node args should be
repeated.</p>

<p>&lt;clusternode name=&quot;node1&quot;
nodeid=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;fence&gt; &lt;method
name=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;device name=&quot;myswitch&quot;
foo=&quot;x&quot;/&gt; &lt;/method&gt; &lt;/fence&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;unfence&gt; &lt;device name=&quot;myswitch&quot;
foo=&quot;x&quot; action=&quot;on&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/unfence&gt; &lt;/clusternode&gt;</p>
