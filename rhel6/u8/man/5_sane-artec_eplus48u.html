<p>NAME sane-artec_eplus48u - SANE backend for the scanner
Artec E+ 48U and re- badged models</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-artec_eplus48u library implements a
SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access
to several USB flatbed scanners using the GT6816 chipset
like the Artec E+ 48U. These scanners have a contact image
sensor (CIS) and an USB interface.</p>

<p>A complete list of supported devices can be found on
http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html.</p>

<p>This is ALPHA software. Especially if you test new or
untested scan- ners, keep your hand at the scanners plug and
unplug it, if the head bumps at the end of the scan
area.</p>

<p>If you own a scanner other than the ones mentioned on
the list that works with this backend, please let us know
this by sending the scan- ner s exact model name and the USB
vendor and product ids (e.g. from /proc/bus/usb/devices,
sane-find-scanner or syslog) to me. Even if the scanner s
name is only slightly different from the models mentioned
above, please let me know.</p>

<p>KERNEL ISSUES If libusb-0.1.6 or later is installed,
this section can be skipped. The scanner should be found by
sane-find-scanner without further actions. For setting
permissions and general USB information look at
sane-usb(5).</p>

<p>When you are using the scanner module, a Linux kernel
2.4.12 or newer is required.</p>

<p>FIRMWARE FILE You need a firmware file for your scanner.
Thats a small file contain- ing software that will be
uploaded to the scanners memory. For the scanners mentioned
above, its usually named Artec48.usb or 1200.usb. You can
find it on the installation CD that was provided by the
manu- facturer, normally in the directory Win98, WinMe or
similar. If the Windows-driver is installed on your
computer, then you can also find the firmware file under
c:264vers.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the artec_eplus48u.conf
file is a list of usb lines containing vendor and product
ids that correspond to USB scanners. The file can also
contain option lines. Empty lines and lines starting with a
hash mark (#) are ignored. The scanners are autodetected by
usb vendor_id product_id statements which are already
included into artec_eplus48u.conf . &quot;vendor_id&quot;
and &quot;product_id&quot; are hexadecimal numbers that
identify the scanner.</p>

<p>Every usb section can have additional options</p>

<p>artecFirmwareFile
/usr/share/sane/artec_eplus48u/Artec48.usb The path to the
firmware file. This option is required.</p>

<p>redGamma 1.0</p>

<p>greenGamma 1.0</p>

<p>blueGamma 1.0</p>

<p>masterGamma 1.9 These are the default gamma values. If
you set the &quot;Defaults&quot; option with a frontend,
then the gamma options are reset to the values specified
here.</p>

<p>redOffset 0x28</p>

<p>greenOffset 0x2f</p>

<p>blueOffset 0x2f</p>

<p>redExposure 0xa7</p>

<p>greenExposure 0x116</p>

<p>blueExposure 0xdc These are the default values for
offset and exposure time. You can e.g. change them to speed
up calibration, if you dont want to save the calibration
data to disk.</p>

<p>vendorString Artec</p>

<p>modelString E+ 48U By default, the scanner is reported
as &quot;Artec E+ 48U&quot;. If you dont like this, e.g.
because you have an Tevion MD 9693, then change the options
accordingly.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/local/etc/sane.d/artec_eplus48u.conf The
backend configuration file (see also description of
SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/local/lib/sane/libsane-artec_eplus48u.a The static
library implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/local/lib/sane/libsane-artec_eplus48u.so The shared
library implementing this backend (present on systems that
support dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/usr/local/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment
variable ends with the directory separator character, then
the default directories are searched after the explicitly
specified directo- ries. For example, setting
SANE_CONFIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in
directories &quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/usr/local/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this
order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC_EPLUS48U If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. Higher debug
levels increase the verbosity of the output.</p>

<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC_EPLUS48U=3</p>

<p>AUTHOR Michael Herder This backend is based on the
gt68xx test-program written by Sergey Vlasov, Andreas
Nowack, and David Stevenson. Thanks to everyone who tested
the backend or reported bugs. This man page is based on man
sane-gt68xx, written by Henning Meier- Geinitz.</p>

<p>BUGS This backend has been tested on Linux only. If you
are using it on a different platform, please contact us.</p>

<p>Interpolation with 1200 dpi is weak.</p>

<p>Support for buttons is missing due to missing support in
SANE.</p>

<p>Please contact us if you find a bug:
