<p>NAME pamfile - describe a Netpbm (PAM or PNM) file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamfile</p>

<p>[-allimages] [-count] [-comments]</p>

<p>[file ...]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviations of options are acceptable.
You may use double hyphens instead of single hyphen to
denote options. You may use white space in place of the
equals sign to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamfile reads one or more Netpbm files as input and
writes out short descriptions of the image type, size, etc.
This is partly for use in shell scripts, so the format is
not particularly pretty.</p>

<p>By default, pamfile reads only the header of the input
file. If that file is a pipe, that might cause problems for
the process that is feed- ing the pipe. In that case, see
the -allimages option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -allimages This option causes pamfile to
describe every image in each input file. Without this
option, pamfile describes only the first image in each input
file.</p>

<p>This option also causes pamfile to read all the images
from the input stream, whereas without it, pamfile reads
only the header of the first one. If the input stream is
from a pipe, the pro- cess that is feeding the pipe might
require the entire stream to be consumed. In that case, use
this option even if the stream contains only one image.</p>

<p>This option has no effect if you also specify
-count.</p>

<p>Note that before July 2000, a file could not contain
more than one image and many programs ignore all but the
first.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 9.5 (July 2000).</p>

<p>-comments This option causes pamfile to include for each
PAM image a report of the comments from the header of the
image.</p>

<p>For a PBM, PGM, or PPM image, pamfile reports there are
no com- ments, even if there are.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.35 (August 2006).</p>

<p>-count This option causes pamfile to display only a
count of how many images are in each input file.</p>

<p>As with -allimages, this causes pamfile to read all the
images.</p>

<p>This option was new with Netpbm 10.31 (December
2005).</p>
