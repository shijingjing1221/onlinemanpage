<p>KOBJECT_INIT(9) Driver Basics KOBJECT_INIT(9)</p>

<p>NAME kobject_init - initialize a kobject structure</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void kobject_init(struct kobject * kobj, struct
kobj_type * ktype);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS kobj pointer to the kobject to initialize</p>

<p>ktype pointer to the ktype for this kobject.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function will properly initialize a
kobject such that it can then be passed to the kobject_add
call.</p>

<p>After this function is called, the kobject MUST be
cleaned up by a call to kobject_put, not by a call to kfree
directly to ensure that all of the memory is cleaned up
properly.</p>
