<p>XMapWindow(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XMapWindow(3)</p>

<p>NAME XMapWindow, XMapRaised, XMapSubwindows - map
windows</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XMapWindow(Display *display, Window w);</p>

<p>int XMapRaised(Display *display, Window w);</p>

<p>int XMapSubwindows(Display *display, Window w);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XMapWindow function maps the window and
all of its subwindows that have had map requests. Mapping a
window that has an unmapped ancestor does not display the
window but marks it as eligible for display when the
ancestor becomes mapped. Such a window is called unviewable.
When all its ancestors are mapped, the window becomes
viewable and will be visible on the screen if it is not
obscured by another window. This function has no effect if
the window is already mapped.</p>

<p>If the override-redirect of the window is False and if
some other client has selected SubstructureRedirectMask on
the parent window, then the X server generates a MapRequest
event, and the XMapWindow function does not map the window.
Otherwise, the window is mapped, and the X server generates
a MapNotify event.</p>

<p>If the window becomes viewable and no earlier contents
for it are remembered, the X server tiles the window with
its background. If the windows background is undefined, the
existing screen contents are not altered, and the X server
generates zero or more Expose events. If backing-store was
maintained while the window was unmapped, no Expose events
are generated. If backing-store will now be maintained, a
full- window exposure is always generated. Otherwise, only
visible regions may be reported. Similar tiling and exposure
take place for any newly viewable inferiors.</p>

<p>If the window is an InputOutput window, XMapWindow
generates Expose events on each InputOutput window that it
causes to be displayed. If the client maps and paints the
window and if the client begins process- ing events, the
window is painted twice. To avoid this, first ask for Expose
events and then map the window, so the client processes
input events as usual. The event list will include Expose
for each window that has appeared on the screen. The client
s normal response to an Expose event should be to repaint
the window. This method usually leads to simpler programs
and to proper interaction with window man- agers.</p>

<p>XMapWindow can generate a BadWindow error.</p>

<p>The XMapRaised function essentially is similar to
XMapWindow in that it maps the window and all of its
subwindows that have had map requests. However, it also
raises the specified window to the top of the stack.</p>

<p>XMapRaised can generate a BadWindow error.</p>

<p>The XMapSubwindows function maps all subwindows for a
specified window in top-to-bottom stacking order. The X
server generates Expose events on each newly displayed
window. This may be much more efficient than mapping many
windows one at a time because the server needs to perform
much of the work only once, for all of the windows, rather
than for each window.</p>

<p>XMapSubwindows can generate a BadWindow error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadWindow A value for a Window argument does
not name a defined Window.</p>
