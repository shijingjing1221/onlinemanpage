<p>NAME pvscan scan all disks for physical volumes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pvscan [--commandprofile ProfileName]
[-d|--debug] [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [--version]
[--ignorelockingfailure] [-e|--exported]
[-n|--novolumegroup] [-s|--short] [-u|--uuid]</p>

<p>pvscan [-d|--debug] [-h|--help] --cache [-a|--activate
ay] [-b|--back- ground] [--major major --minor minor |
DevicePath | major:minor]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pvscan scans all supported LVM block devices
in the system for physical volumes.</p>

<p>Scanning with lvmetad pvscan operates differently when
used with the lvmetad(8) daemon.</p>

<p>Scanning disks is required to read LVM metadata and
identify LVM PVs. Once read, lvmetad caches the metadata so
that LVM commands can read it without repeatedly scanning
disks. This is helpful because scanning disks is time
consuming, and frequent scanning may interfere with the
normal work of the system and disks.</p>

<p>When lvmetad is not used, LVM commands revert to
scanning disks to read metadata. Any LVM command that needs
metadata will scan disks for it; running the pvscan command
is not necessary for the sake of other LVM commands.</p>

<p>When lvmetad is used, LVM commands avoid scanning disks
by reading metadata from lvmetad. When new disks appear,
they must be scanned so their metadata can be cached in
lvmetad. This is done by the command pvscan --cache, which
scans disks and passes the metadata to lvmetad.</p>

<p>The pvscan --cache command is typically run
automatically by system services when a new device appears.
Users do not generally need to run this command if the
system and lvmetad are running properly.</p>

<p>Many scripts contain unnecessary pvscan (or vgscan)
commands for his- torical reasons. To avoid disrupting the
system with extraneous disk scanning, an ordinary pvscan
(without --cache) will simply read meta- data from lvmetad
like other LVM commands. It does not do anything beyond
displaying the current state of the cache.</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>&middot; When given specific device name arguments,
pvscan --cache will only read the named devices.</p>

<p>&middot; LVM udev rules and systemd services are used to
intiate automatic device scanning.</p>

<p>&middot; To prevent devices from being scanned by pvscan
--cache, add them to lvm.conf(5) devices/global_filter. The
devices/filter setting does not apply to system level
scanning. For more information, see: lvmconfig
--withcomments devices/global_filter</p>

<p>&middot; If lvmetad is started or restarted after
devices are visible, or if the global_filter has changed,
then all devices must be rescanned for metadata with the
command pvscan --cache.</p>

<p>&middot; lvmetad ignores older metadata formats, e.g.
lvm1, and should not be used if they exist.</p>

<p>&middot; To notify lvmetad about a device that is no
longer present, the major and minor numbers must be given,
not the path.</p>

<p>Automatic activation When event-driven system services
detect a new LVM device, the first step is to automatically
scan and cache the metadata from the device. This is done by
pvscan --cache. A second step is to automatically activate
LVs that are present on the new device. This auto-activation
is done by the same pvscan --cache command when the option
-a|--acti- vate ay is included.</p>

<p>Auto-activation of VGs or LVs can be enabled/disabled
using: lvm.conf(5)
activation/auto_activation_volume_list</p>

<p>For more information, see: lvmconfig --withcomments
activation/auto_activation_volume_list</p>

<p>When this setting is undefined, all LVs are
auto-activated (when lvm is fully integrated with the
event-driven system services.)</p>

<p>When a VG or LV is not auto-activated, traditional
activation using vgchange or lvchange -a|--activate is
needed.</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>&middot; pvscan auto-activation can be only done in
combination with --cache.</p>

<p>&middot; Auto-activation is designated by the
&quot;a&quot; argument in -a|--activate ay. This is meant to
distinguish system generated commands from explicit user
commands, although it can be used in any activation command.
Whenever it is used, the auto_activation_volume_list is
applied.</p>

<p>&middot; Auto-activation is not yet supported for LVs
that are part of partial or clustered volume groups.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm(8) for common options.</p>

<p>-e, --exported Only show physical volumes belonging to
exported volume groups.</p>

<p>-n, --novolumegroup Only show physical volumes not
belonging to any volume group.</p>

<p>-s, --short Short listing format.</p>

<p>-u, --uuid Show UUIDs in addition to device names.</p>

<p>-a, --activate ay Automatically activate any logical
volumes that are possible to activate with the addition of
the new devices.</p>

<p>-b, --background Run the command in the background.</p>

<p>--cache [--major major --minor minor | DevicePath |
major:minor ]... Scan one or more devices and send the
metadata to lvmetad.</p>
