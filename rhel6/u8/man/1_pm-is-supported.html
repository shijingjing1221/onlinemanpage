<p>NAME pm-is-supported - Test whether suspend or hibernate
is supported.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pm-is-supported [{--suspend | --hibernate |
--suspend-hybrid}]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents briefly the
pm-is-supported command.</p>

<p>The intended purpose of pm-is-supported is to find out
which power management modes are supported by the system.
hald(8) will call it to do just that.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --suspend Is suspend supported? Suspend is a
state where most devices are shutdown, except for RAM. This
state still draws power.</p>

<p>--hibernate Is hibernate supported? During hibernate the
state of the system is saved to disk, the system is fully
powered off.</p>

<p>--suspend-hybrid Is hybrid-suspend supported?
Hybrid-suspend is the process where first the state of the
system is saved to disk -- just like with hibernate -- but
instead of poweroff, the system goes in suspend state, which
means it can wakeup quicker than for normal hibernation. The
advantage over suspend is that you can resume even if you
run out of power. s2both is a hybrid-suspend
implementation.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The result of the test for a certain
powermanagement state is defined by the following exit
codes.</p>

<p>Code Diagnostic 0 State available. 1 State NOT
available.</p>
