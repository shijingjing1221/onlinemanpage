<p>NAME ipa-upgradeconfig - Upgrade the IPA Apache
configuration</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipa-upgradeconfig</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A tool to update the IPA Apache
configuration during an upgrade.</p>

<p>It examines the VERSION value in the head of
/etc/httpd/conf.d/ipa.conf and
/etc/httpd/conf.d/ipa-rewrite.conf and compares this with
the tem- plates. If an update is needed then new files are
written.</p>

<p>It also will convert a CA configured to be accessible
via ports 9443, 9444, 9445 and 9446 to be proxied by the IPA
web server on ports 80 and 443.</p>

<p>This is not intended to be run by an end-user. It is
executed when the IPA rpms are upgraded. This must be run as
the root user.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d, --debug Enable debug logging when more
verbose output is needed</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Output only errors</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 if the update was successful or there was
nothing to do</p>

<p>1 if an error occurred</p>
