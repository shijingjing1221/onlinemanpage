<p>LSCPU(1) User Commands LSCPU(1)</p>

<p>NAME lscpu - display information about the CPU
architecture</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lscpu [-a|-b|-c] [-x] [-s directory] [-e
[=list]|-p [=list]] lscpu -h|-V</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lscpu gathers CPU architecture information
from sysfs and /proc/cpuinfo. The command output can be
optimized for parsing or for easy readability by humans. The
information includes, for example, the number of CPUs,
threads, cores, sockets, and Non-Uniform Memory Access
(NUMA) nodes. There is also information about the CPU caches
and cache sharing, family, model, bogoMIPS, byte order, and
stepping.</p>

<p>Options that result in an output table have a list
argument. Use this argument to customize the command output.
Specify a comma-separated list of column labels to limit the
output table to only the specified columns, arranged in the
specified order. See COLUMNS for a list of valid column
labels. The column labels are not case sensitive.</p>

<p>Not all columns are supported on all architectures. If
an unsupported column is specified, lscpu prints the column
but does not provide any data for it.</p>

<p>COLUMNS CPU The logical CPU number of a CPU as used by
the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>CORE The logical core number. A core can contain several
CPUs.</p>

<p>SOCKET The logical socket number. A socket can contain
several cores.</p>

<p>BOOK The logical book number. A book can contain several
sockets.</p>

<p>NODE The logical NUMA node number. A node may contain
several books.</p>

<p>CACHE Information about how caches are shared between
CPUs.</p>

<p>ADDRESS The physical address of a CPU.</p>

<p>ONLINE Indicator that shows whether the Linux instance
currently makes use of the CPU.</p>

<p>CONFIGURED Indicator that shows if the hypervisor has
allocated the CPU to the virtual hardware on which the Linux
instance runs. CPUs that are configured can be set online by
the Linux instance. This column contains data only if your
hardware system and hypervisor support dynamic CPU resource
allocation.</p>

<p>POLARIZATION This column contains data for Linux
instances that run on vir- tual hardware with a hypervisor
that can switch the CPU dis- patching mode (polarization).
The polarization can be:</p>

<p>horizontal The workload is spread across all available
CPUs.</p>

<p>vertical The workload is concentrated on few CPUs.</p>

<p>For vertical polarization, the column also shows the
degree of concentration, high, medium, or low. This column
contains data only if your hardware system and hypervisor
support CPU polar- ization.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a, --all Include lines for online and offline
CPUs in the output (default for -e). This option may only
specified together with option -e or -p.</p>

<p>-b, --online Limit the output to online CPUs (default
for -p). This option may only be specified together with
option -e or -p.</p>

<p>-c, --offline Limit the output to offline CPUs. This
option may only be speci- fied together with option -e or
-p.</p>

<p>-e, --extended [=list] Display the CPU information in
human readable format.</p>

<p>If the list argument is omitted, all columns for which
data is available are included in the command output.</p>

<p>When specifying the list argument, the string of option,
equal sign (=), and list must not contain any blanks or
other white space. Examples: -e=cpu,node or
--extended=cpu,node.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display help information and exit.</p>

<p>-p, --parse [=list] Optimize the command output for easy
parsing.</p>

<p>If the list argument is omitted, the command output is
compati- ble with earlier versions of lscpu. In this
compatible format, two commas are used to separate CPU cache
columns. If no CPU caches are identified the cache column is
omitted. If the list argument is used, cache columns are
separated with a colon (:).</p>

<p>When specifying the list argument, the string of option,
equal sign (=), and list must not contain any blanks or
other white space. Examples: -p=cpu,node or
--parse=cpu,node.</p>

<p>-s, --sysroot directory Gather CPU data for a Linux
instance other than the instance from which the lscpu
command is issued. The specified directory is the system
root of the Linux instance to be inspected.</p>

<p>-x, --hex Use hexadecimal masks for CPU sets (for
example 0x3). The default is to print the sets in list
format (for example 0,1).</p>

<p>-V, --version Display version information and exit.</p>

<p>BUGS The basic overview about CPU family, model, etc. is
always based on the first CPU only.</p>

<p>Sometimes in Xen Dom0 the kernel reports wrong data.</p>

<p>On virtual hardware the number of cores per socket, etc.
can be wrong.</p>
