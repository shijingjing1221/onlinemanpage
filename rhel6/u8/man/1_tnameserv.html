<p>tnameserv(1) Java IDL and RMI-IIOP Tools
tnameserv(1)</p>

<p>NAME tnameserv - Interface Definition Language
(IDL).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tnameserve -ORBInitialPort [ nameserverport
]</p>

<p>-ORBInitialPort nameserverport The initial port where
the naming service listens for the bootstrap protocol used
to implement the ORB resolve_initial_references and
list_initial_references methods.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Java IDL includes the Object Request Broker
Daemon (ORBD). ORBD is a daemon process that contains a
Bootstrap Service, a Transient Naming Service, a Persistent
Naming Service, and a Server Manager. The Java IDL tutorials
all use ORBD, but you can substitute the tnameserv command
for the orbd command in any of the examples that use a
Transient Naming Service.</p>

<p>See orbd(1) or Naming Service at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/idl/jidlNaming.html</p>

<p>The CORBA Common Object Services (COS) Naming Service
provides a tree- structure directory for object references
similar to a file system that provides a directory structure
for files. The Transient Naming Service provided with Java
IDL, tnameserv, is a simple implementation of the COS Naming
Service specification.</p>

<p>Object references are stored in the name space by name
and each object reference-name pair is called a name
binding. Name bindings can be organized under naming
contexts. Naming contexts are name bindings and serve the
same organizational function as a file system subdirectory.
All bindings are stored under the initial naming context.
The initial naming context is the only persistent binding in
the name space. The rest of the name space is lost when the
Java IDL naming service process stops and restarts.</p>

<p>For an applet or application to use COS naming, its ORB
must know the port of a host running a naming service or
have access to an initial naming context string for that
naming service. The naming service can either be the Java
IDL naming service or another COS-compliant naming
service.</p>

<p>START THE NAMING SERVICE You must start the Java IDL
naming service before an application or applet that uses its
naming service. Installation of the Java IDL product creates
a script (Oracle Solaris: tnameserv) or executable file
(Windows: tnameserv.exe) that starts the Java IDL naming
service. Start the naming service so it runs in the
background.</p>

<p>If you do not specify otherwise, then the Java IDL
naming service listens on port 900 for the bootstrap
protocol used to implement the ORB
resolve_initial_references and list_initial_references
methods, as follows:</p>

<p>tnameserv -ORBInitialPort nameserverport&amp;</p>

<p>If you do not specify the name server port, then port
900 is used by default. When running Oracle Solaris
software, you must become the root user to start a process
on a port below 1024. For this reason, it is recommended
that you use a port number greater than or equal to 1024. To
specify a different port, for example, 1050, and to run the
naming service in the background, from a UNIX command shell,
enter:</p>

<p>tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 1050&amp;</p>

<p>From an MS-DOS system prompt (Windows), enter:</p>

<p>start tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 1050</p>

<p>Clients of the name server must be made aware of the new
port number. Do this by setting the
org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort property to the new port number
when you create the ORB object.</p>

<p>RUN THE SERVER AND CLIENT ON DIFFERENT HOSTS In most of
the Java IDL and RMI-IIOP tutorials, the naming service,
server, and client are all running on the development
machine. In real- world deployment, the client and server
probably run on different host machines from the Naming
Service.</p>

<p>For the client and server to find the Naming Service,
they must be made aware of the port number and host on which
the naming service is running. Do this by setting the
org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort and
org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialHost properties in the client and
server files to the machine name and port number on which
the Naming Service is running. An example of this is shown
in Getting Started Using RMI-IIOP at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/rmi-
iiop/rmiiiopexample.html</p>

<p>You could also use the command-line options
-ORBInitialPort nameserverport# and -ORBInitialHost
nameserverhostname to tell the client and server where to
find the naming service. For one example of doing this using
the command-line option, see Java IDL: The Hello World
Example on Two Machines at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/idl/tutorial/jidl2machines.html</p>

<p>For example, suppose the Transient Naming Service,
tnameserv is running on port 1050 on host nameserverhost.
The client is running on host clienthost, and the server is
running on host serverhost.</p>

<p>Start tnameserv on the host nameserverhost:</p>

<p>tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 1050</p>

<p>Start the server on the serverhost:</p>

<p>java Server -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost
nameserverhost</p>

<p>Start the client on the clienthost:</p>

<p>java Client -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost
nameserverhost</p>

<p>STOP THE NAMING SERVICE To stop the Java IDL naming
service, use the relevant operating system command, such as
kill for a Unix process or Ctrl+C for a Windows process. The
naming service continues to wait for invocations until it is
explicitly shut down. Note that names registered with the
Java IDL naming service disappear when the service is
terminated.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -Joption Passes option to the Java Virtual
Machine, where option is one of the options described on the
reference page for the Java application launcher. For
example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory to 48 MB. See
java(1).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES ADD OBJECTS TO THE NAME SPACE The following
example shows how to add names to the name space. It is a
self-contained Transient Naming Service client that creates
the following simple tree.</p>

<p>Initial Naming Context plans Personal calendar
schedule</p>

<p>In this example, plans is an object reference and
Personal is a naming context that contains two object
references: calendar and schedule.</p>

<p>import java.util.Properties; import org.omg.CORBA.*;
import org.omg.CosNaming.*;</p>

<p>public class NameClient {</p>

<p>public static void main(String args[]) {</p>

<p>try {</p>

<p>In Start the Naming Service, the nameserver was started
on port 1050. The following code ensures that the client
program is aware of this port number.</p>

<p>Properties props = new Properties();
props.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort&quot;,
&quot;1050&quot;); ORB orb = ORB.init(args, props);</p>

<p>This code obtains the initial naming context and assigns
it to ctx. The second line copies ctx into a dummy object
reference objref that is attached to various names and added
into the name space.</p>

<p>NamingContext ctx = NamingContextHelper.narrow(
orb.resolve_initial_references(&quot;NameService&quot;));
NamingContext objref = ctx;</p>

<p>This code creates a name plans of type text and binds it
to the dummy object reference. plans is then added under the
initial naming context using the rebind method. The rebind
method enables you to run this program over and over again
without getting the exceptions from using the bind
method.</p>

<p>NameComponent nc1 = new NameComponent(&quot;plans&quot;,
&quot;text&quot;); NameComponent[] name1 = {nc1};
ctx.rebind(name1, objref); System.out.println(&quot;plans
rebind successful!&quot;);</p>

<p>This code creates a naming context called Personal of
type directory. The resulting object reference, ctx2, is
bound to the name and added under the initial naming
context.</p>

<p>NameComponent nc2 = new
NameComponent(&quot;Personal&quot;, &quot;directory&quot;);
NameComponent[] name2 = {nc2}; NamingContext ctx2 =
ctx.bind_new_context(name2); System.out.println(&quot;new
naming context added..&quot;);</p>

<p>The remainder of the code binds the dummy object
reference using the names schedule and calendar under the
Personal naming context (ctx2).</p>

<p>NameComponent nc3 = new
NameComponent(&quot;schedule&quot;, &quot;text&quot;);
NameComponent[] name3 = {nc3}; ctx2.rebind(name3, objref);
System.out.println(&quot;schedule rebind
successful!&quot;);</p>

<p>NameComponent nc4 = new
NameComponent(&quot;calender&quot;, &quot;text&quot;);
NameComponent[] name4 = {nc4}; ctx2.rebind(name4, objref);
System.out.println(&quot;calender rebind successful!&quot;);
} catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(System.err); } }
}</p>

<p>BROWSING THE NAME SPACE The following sample program
shoes how to browse the name space.</p>

<p>import java.util.Properties; import org.omg.CORBA.*;
import org.omg.CosNaming.*;</p>

<p>public class NameClientList {</p>

<p>public static void main(String args[]) {</p>

<p>try {</p>

<p>In Start the Naming Service, the nameserver was started
on port 1050. The following code ensures that the client
program is aware of this port number.</p>

<p>Properties props = new Properties();
props.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort&quot;,
&quot;1050&quot;); ORB orb = ORB.init(args, props);</p>

<p>The following code obtains the initial naming
context.</p>

<p>NamingContext nc = NamingContextHelper.narrow(
orb.resolve_initial_references(&quot;NameService&quot;));</p>

<p>The list method lists the bindings in the naming
context. In this case, up to 1000 bindings from the initial
naming context will be returned in the BindingListHolder;
any remaining bindings are returned in the
BindingIteratorHolder.</p>

<p>BindingListHolder bl = new BindingListHolder();
BindingIteratorHolder blIt= new BindingIteratorHolder();
nc.list(1000, bl, blIt);</p>

<p>This code gets the array of bindings out of the returned
BindingListHolder. If there are no bindings, then the
program ends.</p>

<p>Binding bindings[] = bl.value; if (bindings.length == 0)
return;</p>

<p>The remainder of the code loops through the bindings and
prints outs the names.</p>

<p>for (int i=0; i &lt; bindings.length; i++) {</p>

<p>// get the object reference for each binding
org.omg.CORBA.Object obj =
nc.resolve(bindings[i].binding_name); String objStr =
orb.object_to_string(obj); int lastIx =
bindings[i].binding_name.length-1;</p>

<p>// check to see if this is a naming context if
(bindings[i].binding_type == BindingType.ncontext) {
System.out.println(&quot;Context: &quot; +
bindings[i].binding_name[lastIx].id); } else {
System.out.println(&quot;Object: &quot; +
bindings[i].binding_name[lastIx].id); } } } catch (Exception
e) { e.printStackTrace(System.err) } } }</p>
