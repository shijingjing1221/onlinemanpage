<p>NAME dhcpd.leases - DHCP client lease database</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server
keeps a persistent database of leases that it has assigned.
This database is a free-form ASCII file containing a series
of lease declarations. Every time a lease is acquired,
renewed or released, its new value is recorded at the end of
the lease file. So if more than one declaration appears for
a given lease, the last one in the file is the current
one.</p>

<p>When dhcpd is first installed, there is no lease
database. However, dhcpd requires that a lease database be
present before it will start. To make the initial lease
database, just create an empty file called
/var/lib/dhcpd/dhcpd.leases. You can do this with:</p>

<p>touch /var/lib/dhcpd/dhcpd.leases</p>

<p>In order to prevent the lease database from growing
without bound, the file is rewritten from time to time.
First, a temporary lease database is created and all known
leases are dumped to it. Then, the old lease database is
renamed /var/lib/dhcpd/dhcpd.leases~. Finally, the newly
written lease database is moved into place.</p>

<p>FORMAT Lease descriptions are stored in a format that is
parsed by the same recursive descent parser used to read the
dhcpd.conf(5) and dhclient.conf(5) files. Lease files can
contain lease declarations, and also group and subgroup
declarations, host declarations and failover state
declarations. Group, subgroup and host declarations are used
to record objects created using the OMAPI protocol.</p>

<p>The lease file is a log-structured file - whenever a
lease changes, the contents of that lease are written to the
end of the file. This means that it is entirely possible and
quite reasonable for there to be two or more declarations of
the same lease in the lease file at the same time. In that
case, the instance of that particular lease that appears
last in the file is the one that is in effect.</p>

<p>Group, subgroup and host declarations in the lease file
are handled in the same manner, except that if any of these
objects are deleted, a rubout is written to the lease file.
This is just the same declara- tion, with { deleted; } in
the scope of the declaration. When the lease file is
rewritten, any such rubouts that can be eliminated are
eliminated. It is possible to delete a declaration in the
dhcpd.conf file; in this case, the rubout can never be
eliminated from the dhcpd.leases file.</p>

<p>THE LEASE DECLARATION lease ip-address { statements...
}</p>

<p>Each lease declaration includes the single IP address
that has been leased to the client. The statements within
the braces define the duration of the lease and to whom it
is assigned.</p>

<p>starts date; ends date; tstp date; tsfp date; atsfp
date; cltt date;</p>

<p>The start and end time of a lease are recorded using the
starts and ends statements. The tstp statement is specified
if the failover pro- tocol is being used, and indicates what
time the peer has been told the lease expires. The tsfp
statement is also specified if the failover protocol is
being used, and indicates the lease expiry time that the
peer has acknowledged. The atsfp statement is the actual
time sent from the failover partner. The cltt statement is
the clients last transaction time.</p>

<p>The date is specified in two ways, depending on the
configuration value for the db-time-format parameter. If it
was set to default, then the date fields appear as
follows:</p>

<p>weekday year/month/day hour:minute:second</p>

<p>The weekday is present to make it easy for a human to
tell when a lease expires - its specified as a number from
zero to six, with zero being Sunday. The day of week is
ignored on input. The year is specified with the century, so
it should generally be four digits except for really long
leases. The month is specified as a number starting with 1
for January. The day of the month is likewise specified
starting with 1. The hour is a number between 0 and 23, the
minute a number between 0 and 59, and the second also a
number between 0 and 59.</p>

<p>Lease times are specified in Universal Coordinated Time
(UTC), not in the local time zone. There is probably nowhere
in the world where the times recorded on a lease are always
the same as wall clock times. On most unix machines, you can
display the current time in UTC by typing date -u.</p>

<p>If the db-time-format was configured to local, then the
date fields appear as follows:</p>

<p>epoch &lt;seconds-since-epoch&gt;; # &lt;day-name&gt;
&lt;month-name&gt; &lt;day-number&gt;
&lt;hours&gt;:&lt;minutes&gt;:&lt;seconds&gt;
&lt;year&gt;</p>

<p>The seconds-since-epoch is as according to the systems
local clock (often referred to as &quot;unix time&quot;).
The # symbol supplies a comment that describes what actual
time this is as according to the systems configured
timezone, at the time the value was written. It is provided
only for human inspection.</p>

<p>If a lease will never expire, date is never instead of
an actual date.</p>

<p>hardware hardware-type mac-address;</p>

<p>The hardware statement records the MAC address of the
network interface on which the lease will be used. It is
specified as a series of hex- adecimal octets, separated by
colons.</p>

<p>uid client-identifier;</p>

<p>The uid statement records the client identifier used by
the client to acquire the lease. Clients are not required to
send client identi- fiers, and this statement only appears
if the client did in fact send one. Client identifiers are
normally an ARP type (1 for ethernet) followed by the MAC
address, just like in the hardware statement, but this is
not required.</p>

<p>The client identifier is recorded as a colon-separated
hexadecimal list or as a quoted string. If it is recorded as
a quoted string and it contains one or more non-printable
characters, those characters are represented as octal
escapes - a backslash character followed by three octal
digits.</p>

<p>client-hostname hostname ;</p>

<p>Most DHCP clients will send their hostname in the
host-name option. If a client sends its hostname in this
way, the hostname is recorded on the lease with a
client-hostname statement. This is not required by the
protocol, however, so many specialized DHCP clients do not
send a host-name option.</p>

<p>abandoned;</p>

<p>The abandoned statement indicates that the DHCP server
has abandoned the lease. In that case, the abandoned
statement will be used to indicate that the lease should not
be reassigned. Please see the dhcpd.conf(5) manual page for
information about abandoned leases.</p>

<p>binding state state; next binding state state;</p>

<p>The binding state statement declares the leases binding
state. When the DHCP server is not configured to use the
failover protocol, a lease s binding state will be either
active or free. The failover protocol adds some additional
transitional states, as well as the backup state, which
indicates that the lease is available for alloca- tion by
the failover secondary.</p>

<p>The next binding state statement indicates what state
the lease will move to when the current state expires. The
time when the current state expires is specified in the ends
statement.</p>

<p>option agent.circuit-id string; option agent.remote-id
string;</p>

<p>The option agent.circuit-id and option agent.remote-id
statements are used to record the circuit ID and remote ID
options send by the relay agent, if the relay agent uses the
relay agent information option. This allows these options to
be used consistently in conditional evalu- ations even when
the client is contacting the server directly rather than
through its relay agent.</p>

<p>set variable = value;</p>

<p>The set statement sets the value of a variable on the
lease. For gen- eral information on variables, see the
dhcp-eval(5) manual page.</p>

<p>The ddns-text variable</p>

<p>The ddns-text variable is used to record the value of
the clients TXT identification record when the interim ddns
update style has been used to update the DNS for a
particular lease.</p>

<p>The ddns-fwd-name variable</p>

<p>The ddns-fwd-name variable records the value of the name
used in updat- ing the client s A record if a DDNS update
has been successfully done by the server. The server may
also have used this name to update the cliens PTR
record.</p>

<p>The ddns-client-fqdn variable</p>

<p>If the server is configured to use the interim ddns
update style, and is also configured to allow clients to
update their own fqdns, and the client did in fact update
its own fqdn, then the ddns-client-fqdn vari- able records
the name that the client has indicated it is using. This is
the name that the server will have used to update the
clients PTR record in this case.</p>

<p>The ddns-rev-name variable</p>

<p>If the server successfully updates the client s PTR
record, this variable will record the name that the DHCP
server used for the PTR record. The name to which the PTR
record points will be either the ddns-fwd-name or the
ddns-client-fqdn.</p>

<p>on events { statements... } The on statement records a
list of state- ments to execute if a certain event occurs.
The possible events that can occur for an active lease are
release and expiry. More than one event can be specified -
if so, the events are separated by | charac- ters.</p>

<p>bootp; reserved; These two statements are effectively
flags. If present, they indicate that the BOOTP and RESERVED
failover flags, respectively, should be set. BOOTP and
RESERVED dynamic leases are treated differently than normal
dynamic leases, as they may only be used by the client to
which they are currently allocated.</p>

<p>THE FAILOVER PEER STATE DECLARATION The state of any
failover peering arrangements is also recorded in the lease
file, using the failover peer statement:</p>

<p>failover peer name state { my state state at date; peer
state state at date; }</p>

<p>The states of the peer named name is being recorded.
Both the state of the running server (my state) and the
other failover partner (peer state) are recorded. The
following states are possible: unknown- state, partner-down,
normal, communications-interrupted, resolution- interrupted,
potential-conflict, recover, recover-done, shutdown, paused,
and startup. /var/lib/dhcpd/dhcpd.leases</p>
