<p>NAME cyr_expire - expire messages and duplicate delivery
database entries</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cyr_expire [ -C config-file ] [ -D delete-days
] -E expire-days [ -X expunge-days ] [ -p mailbox-prefix ] [
-v ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Cyr_expire is used to expire messages and
duplicate delivery database entries. Cyr_expire also
cleanses mailboxes of partially expunged mes- sages (when
using the &quot;delayed&quot; expunge mode). The expiration
of mes- sages is controlled by the
/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire mailbox anno- tation which
specifies the age (in days) of messages in the given mail-
box that should be deleted. Any duplicate delivery database
entries which correspond to the mailbox are also deleted at
the same frequency.</p>

<p>The value of the /vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire
annotation is inherited by all children of the given
mailbox, so an entire mailbox tree can be expired by seting
a single annotation on the root of that tree. If a mailbox
does not have a /vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire annotation
set on it (or does not inherit one), then no messages are
expired from the mailbox.</p>

<p>Cyr_expire reads its configuration options out of the
imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by -C.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C config-file Read configuration options from
config-file.</p>

<p>-D delete-days Remove previously deleted mailboxes older
than delete-days (when using the &quot;delayed&quot; delete
mode).</p>

<p>-E expire-days Prune the duplicate database of entries
older than expire-days. This value is only used for entries
which do not have a corre- sponding
/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire mailbox annotation.</p>

<p>-X expunge-days Expunge previously deleted messages
older than expunge-days (when using the &quot;delayed&quot;
expunge mode).</p>

<p>-x Do not expunge messages even if using delayed expunge
mode (reduces the IO hit considerably, allowing you to run
cyr_expire frequently to clean up the duplicate database
without overload- ing your server)</p>

<p>-p mailbox-prefix Only find mailboxes starting with this
prefix. e.g. &quot;user.justgotspammedlots&quot;</p>

<p>-v Enable verbose output.</p>

<p>-a Skip the annotation lookup, so all /vendor/cmu/cyrus-
imapd/expire annotations are ignored entirely. It behaves as
if they were not set, so only expire-days is considered for
all mailboxes.</p>
