<p>NAME pilot-hinotes - Syncronize your Hi-Notes database
with your desktop machine.</p>

<p>SECTION pilot-link: Userland conduits</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pilot-hinotes [-p|--port &lt;port&gt;]
[--version] [-q|--quiet] [-?|--help] [--usage] [-d|--dirname
dir]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Hi-Notes must be installed on your Palm
handheld (and at least one entry must exist within
Hi-Notes).</p>

<p>By default, the contents of your Palm s Hi-Notes
database (Hi-Not- eDB.pdb) will be written to STDOUT as a
standard Unix mailbox (in mbox-format) file, with each memo
as a separate message. The subject of each message will be
set as the category.</p>

<p>The memos will be written to STDOUT unless the -d option
is specified. Using -d will be save the memos in
subdirectories of dir. Each subdi- rectory will contain the
name of a category on the Palm where the record was stored,
and will contain the memos found in that category.</p>

<p>Each memos filename will be the first line (up to the
first 40 charac- ters) of the memo. Control characters,
slashes, and equal signs that would otherwise appear in
filenames are converted using the correct MIMEs
quoted-printable encoding.</p>

<p>Please see http://www.cyclos.com/ for more information
on Hi-Note.</p>

<p>WARNING Note that if you have two memos in the same
category whose first lines are identical, one of them will
be OVERWRITTEN! This is unavoidable at the present time, but
may be fixed in a future release. Also, please note that
syncronizing Hi-Note images is not supported at this time,
only text.</p>

<p>OPTIONS pilot-hinotes option -d dir</p>

<p>Stores the Hi-Note entries in subdirectories of dir.
Each subdirectory will contain the name of a category on the
Palm where the record was stored, and will contain the memos
found in that category.</p>

<p>Each memo s filename will be the first line (up to the
first 40 charac- ters) of the memo. Control characters,
slashes, and equal signs (=) that would otherwise appear in
filenames are converted using the cor- rect MIMEs
quoted&minus;printable encoding methods.</p>

<p>Conduit Options -p, --port &lt;port&gt;</p>

<p>Use device file &lt;port&gt; to communicate with the
Palm handheld. If this is not specified, pilot-hinotes will

information.</p>
