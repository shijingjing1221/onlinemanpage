<p>NAME sane-mustek_pp - SANE backend for Mustek parallel
port flatbed scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-mustek_pp library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
Mustek parallel port flatbed scanners and OEM versions.</p>

<p>There are 2 classes of Mustek parallel port scanners:
regular CCD (cold cathode device) scanners and CIS (contact
image sensor) scanners.</p>

<p>The current version of this backend supports both CCD
type scanners and CIS type scanners.</p>

<p>The following scanners might work with this backend:</p>

<p>CCD scanners Model: ASIC ID: CCD Type: works:
--------------------------------------------------------------
SE 6000 P 1013 00 yes SM 4800 P 1013/1015 04/01 yes SE 1200

CP &amp; 96 CP 1015 yes (*) Mustek 1200 CP 1015 yes Mustek
1200 CP+ 1015 yes</p>

<p>OEM versions Original works
--------------------------------------------------
Medion/LifeTec/Tevion MD/LT 9350/9351 1200 CP yes MD/LT
9850/9851 1200 CP maybe (**) MD/LT 9858 1200 CP probably
MD/LT 9890/9891 1200 CP yes Targa Funline TS12EP 1200 CP yes
Funline TS6EP 600 CP yes Trust Easy Connect 9600+ 600 CP yes
Cybercom 9352 1200 CP yes (***)</p>

<p>(*) Calibration problems existed with earlier version of
this driver. They seem to be solved now.</p>

<p>(**) Problems have been reported in the past for the
MD/LT9850 type (striped scans, head moving in wrong
direction at some resolutions). It is not known whether the
current version of the driver still has these problems.</p>

<p>IF YOU HEAR LOUD CLICKING NOISES, IMMEDIATELY UNPLUG THE
SCANNER ! (This holds for any type of scanner).</p>

<p>(***) Possibly, the engine_delay parameter has to be set
to 1 ms for accurate engine movements.</p>

<p>Please note that this backend is still under
construction. Certain mod- els are currently not supported
and some may never be because the com- munication protocol
is still unknown (eg., SE 12000 P).</p>

<p>Some scanners work faster when EPP/ECP is enabled in the
BIOS. EPP mode however may lead to hard-locks on some Linux
systems. If that is the case for you, you can either disable
ECP/EPP in your BIOS or disable it in the backend itself
(see GLOBAL OPTIONS).</p>

<p>Note that the backend needs to run as root or has to
have appropriate access rights to /dev/parport* if
libieee1284 support is compiled in. To allow user access to
the scanner run the backend through the network interface
(See saned(8) and sane-net(5)). Note also that the backend
does not support parport sharing, i.e. if you try printing
while scan- ning, your computer may crash. To enable parport
sharing, you have to enable libieee1284 at compile time.
This backend also conflicts with the sane-musteka4s2
backend. You can only enable one of them in your dll.conf.
However, you have to enable the backend explicitly in your
dll.conf, just remove the hash mark in the line
&quot;mustek_pp&quot;.</p>

<p>DEVICE DEFINITION This backend allows multiple devices
being defined and configured via the mustek_pp.conf file
(even simultaneously, provided that they are connected to
different parallel ports). Please make sure to edit this
file before you use the backend.</p>

<p>A device can be defined as follows:</p>

<p>scanner &lt;name&gt; &lt;port name&gt;
&lt;driver&gt;</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>&lt;name&gt; is an arbitrary name for the device,
optionally enclosed by dou- ble quotes, for instance
&quot;LifeTec 9350&quot;.</p>

<p>&lt;port name&gt; is the name of the parallel port to
which the device is connected. In case libieee1284 is used
for communication with the port (default setup), valid port
names are parport0, par- port1, and parport2.</p>

<p>In case the backend is configured for raw IO (old
setup), port addresses have to be used instead of port
names: 0x378, 0x278, or 0x3BC. The mapping of parallel ports
(lp0, lp1, and lp2) to these addresses can be different for
different Linux kernel versions. For instance, if you are
using a Kernel 2.2.x or better and you have only one
parallel port, this port is named lp0 regardless of the base
address. However, this backend requires the base address of
your port. If you are not sure which port your scanner is
connected to, have a look at your /etc/conf.modules,
/etc/modules.conf and/or /proc/ioports.</p>

<p>If you are unsure which port to use, you can use the
magic value * to probe for your scanner.</p>

<p>&lt;driver&gt; is the driver to use for this device.
Currently available drivers are:</p>

<p>cis600 : for 600 CP, 96 CP &amp; OEM versions cis1200 :
for 1200 CP &amp; OEM versions cis1200+ : for 1200 CP+ &amp;
OEM versions ccd300 : for 600 IIIE P &amp; OEM version</p>

<p>Choosing the wrong driver can damage your scanner!
Especially, using the 1200CP settings on a 600CP can be
harmful. If the scanner starts making a loud noise, turn it
off immedi- ately !!!</p>

<p>Using the cis600 driver on a 1200CP or a 1200CP+ is
probably not dan- gerous. The cis1200+ driver also works for
the 1200CP, and using the cis1200 driver on a 1200CP+ will
typically result in scans that cover only half of the width
of the scan area (also not dangerous).</p>

<p>If unsure about the exact model of your OEM version,
check the optical resolution in the manual or on the box:
the 600CP has a maximum optical resolution of 300x600 DPI,
whereas the 1200CP and 1200CP+ have a maxi- mum optical
resolution of 600x1200 DPI.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>scanner &quot;LifeTec 9350&quot; 0x378 cis1200</p>

<p>scanner Mustek_600CP 0x378 cis600</p>

<p>scanner Mustek_600IIIEP * ccd300</p>

<p>If in doubt which port you have to use, or whether your
scanner is detected at all, you can use sane-find-scanner -p
to probe all config- ured ports.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the mustek_pp.conf file is
a list of device definitions and device options that
correspond to Mustek scanners. Empty lines and lines
starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. Options have the
fol- lowing format:</p>

<p>option &lt;name&gt; [&lt;value&gt;]</p>

<p>Depending on the nature of the option, a value may or
may not be present. Options always apply to the scanner
definition that precedes them. There are no global options.
Options are also driver-specific: not all drivers support
all possible options.</p>

<p>Common options bw &lt;value&gt; Black/white
discrimination value to be used during lineart scan- ning.
Pixel values below this value are assumed to be black,
values above are assumed to be white. Default value: 127
Minimum: 0 Maximum: 255</p>

<p>Example: option bw 150</p>

<p>CIS driver options top_adjust &lt;value&gt; Vertical
adjustment of the origin, expressed in millimeter (floating
point). This option can be used to calibrate the position of
the origin, within certain limits. Note that CIS scanners
are probably temperature sensitive, and that a certain
inaccuracy may be hard to avoid. Differences in offset
between runs in the order of 1 to 2 mm are not unusual.
Default value: 0.0 Minimum: -5.0 Maximum: 5.0</p>

<p>Example: option top_adjust -2.5</p>

<p>slow_skip Turns fast skipping to the start of the scan
region off. When the region to scan does not start at the
origin, the driver will try to move the scanhead to the
start of the scan area at the fastest possible speed. On
some models, this may not work, resulting in large
inaccuracies (up to centimeters). By setting this option,
the driver is forced to use normal speed during skipping,
which can circumvent the accuracy problems. Currently, there
are no models for which these inaccuracy problems are known
to occur.</p>

<p>By default, fast skipping is used.</p>

<p>Example: option slow_skip</p>

<p>engine_delay &lt;value&gt; Under normal circumstances,
it is sufficient for the driver to wait for the scanner
signaling that the engine is stable, before a new engine
command can be transmitted. In rare cases, certain scanners
and/or parallel port chipsets appear to prevent reli- able
detection of the engine state. As a result, engine commands
are transmitted too soon and the movement of the scanner
head becomes unreliable. Inaccuracies ranging up to 10 cm
over the whole vertical scan range have been reported. To
work around this problem, the engine_delay option can be
set. If it is set, the driver waits an additional amount of
time after every engine command, equal to the engine_delay
parameter, expressed in mil- liseconds. It practice an
engine_delay of 1 ms is usually suffi- cient. The maximum
delay is 100 ms.</p>

<p>Note that every additional ms of delay can add up to 14
seconds to the total scanning time (highest resolution), so
an as small as possible value is preferred.</p>

<p>Default value: 0 Minimum: 0 Maximum: 100</p>

<p>Example: option engine_delay 1</p>

<p>CCD driver options top &lt;value&gt; Number of scanlines
to skip to the start of the scan area. The number can be any
positive integer. Values known to me are 47 and 56.</p>

<p>Default value: 47 Minimum: 0 Maximum: none</p>

<p>Example: option top 56</p>

<p>waitbank &lt;value&gt; The number of usecs to wait for a
bank change. You should not touch this value actually. May
be any positive integer</p>

<p>Default value: 700 Minimum: 0 Maximum: none</p>

<p>Example: option waitbank 700</p>

<p>A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>

<p># # LifeTec/Medion 9350 on port 0x378 # scanner
&quot;LifeTec 9350&quot; 0x378 cis1200</p>

<p># Some calibration options (examples!). option bw 127
option top_skip -0.8</p>

<p># # A Mustek 600CP on port 0x3BC # scanner &quot;Mustek
600CP&quot; 0x3BC cis600</p>

<p># Some calibration options (examples!). option bw 120
option top_skip 1.2</p>

<p># # A Mustek 1200CP+ on port 0x278 # scanner
&quot;Mustek 1200CP plus&quot; 0x278 cis1200+</p>

<p># Some calibration options (examples!). option bw 130
option top_skip 0.2</p>

<p># # A Mustek 600 III EPP on port parport0 # scanner
&quot;Mustek 600 III EPP&quot; parport0 ccd300</p>

<p># Some calibration options (examples!). option bw 130
option top 56</p>

<p>GLOBAL OPTIONS You can control the overall behaviour of
the mustek_pp backend by global options which precede any
scanner definition in the mustek_pp.conf file.</p>

<p>Currently, there is only one global option:</p>

<p>Global options no_epp Disable parallel port mode EPP:
works around a known bug in the Linux parport code. Enable
this option, if the backend hangs when trying to access the
parallel port in EPP mode.</p>

<p>Default value: use EPP</p>

<p>Example: option no_epp</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/mustek_pp.conf The backend
configuration file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR
below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-mustek_pp.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-mustek_pp.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_PP If the library was compiled with
debug support enabled, this environment variable controls
the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128
requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>level debug output
-------------------------------------- 0 nothing 1 errors 2
warnings &amp; minor errors 3 additional information 4 debug
information 5 code flow (not supported yet) 6 special debug
information</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_PA4S2 This variable sets the debug
level for the SANE interface for the Mustek chipset A4S2.
Note that enabling this will spam your terminal with some
million lines of debug output.</p>

<p>level debug output ---------------------------- 0
nothing 1 errors 2 warnings 3 things nice to know 4 code
flow 5 detailed code flow 6 everything</p>

<p>BUGS Too many... please send bug reports to
sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org (note that you have to
subscribe first to the list before you can send emails...
see http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html)</p>

<p>BUG REPORTS If something doesnt work, please contact us
(Jochen for the CCD scan- ners, Eddy for the CIS scanners).
But we need some information about your scanner to be able
to help you...</p>

<p>SANE version run &quot;scanimage -V&quot; to determine
this</p>

<p>the backend version and your scanner hardware run
&quot;SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_PP=128 scanimage -L&quot; as root.
If you don t get any output from the mustek_pp backend, make
sure a line &quot;mustek_pp&quot; is included into your
/etc/sane.d/dll.conf. If your scanner isnt detected, make
sure youve defined the right port address in your
mustek_pp.conf.</p>

<p>the name of your scanner/vendor also a worthy
information. Please also include the optical reso- lution
and lamp type of your scanner, both can be found in the
manual of your scanner.</p>

<p>any further comments if you have comments about the
documentation (what could be done better), or you think I
should know something, please include it.</p>

<p>some nice greetings</p>
