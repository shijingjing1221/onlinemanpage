<p>NAME cmakevars - Reference of CMake variables.</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION variables defined by
cmake, that give information about the project, and
cmake</p>

<p>CMAKE_AR Name of archiving tool for static
libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies the name of the program that creates
archive or static libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_ARGC Number of command line arguments passed to
CMake in script mode.</p>

<p>When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to
the num- ber of command line arguments. See also
CMAKE_ARGV0, 1, 2 ...</p>

<p>CMAKE_ARGV0 Command line argument passed to CMake in
script mode.</p>

<p>When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to
the first command line argument. It then also sets
CMAKE_ARGV1, CMAKE_ARGV2, ... and so on, up to the number of
command line arguments given. See also CMAKE_ARGC.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR The path to the top level of the build
tree.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the top level of the current
CMake build tree. For an in-source build, this would be the
same as CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL Tool used for the actual build
process.</p>

<p>This variable is set to the program that will be needed
to build the output of CMake. If the generator selected was
Visual Stu- dio 6, the CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL will be set to
msdev, for Unix Make- files it will be set to make or gmake,
and for Visual Studio 7 it set to devenv. For NMake
Makefiles the value is nmake. This can be useful for adding
special flags and commands based on the final build
environment.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR The directory with the
CMakeCache.txt file.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the directory that has the
CMake- Cache.txt file in it. This is the same as
CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION Major version of CMake used to
create the CMakeCache.txt file</p>

<p>This stores the major version of CMake used to write a
CMake cache file. It is only different when a different
version of CMake is run on a previously created cache
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION Minor version of CMake used to
create the CMakeCache.txt file</p>

<p>This stores the minor version of CMake used to write a
CMake cache file. It is only different when a different
version of CMake is run on a previously created cache
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION Patch version of CMake used to
create the CMakeCache.txt file</p>

<p>This stores the patch version of CMake used to write a
CMake cache file. It is only different when a different
version of CMake is run on a previously created cache
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR Build-time reference to
per-configuration output subdirectory.</p>

<p>For native build systems supporting multiple
configurations in the build tree (such as Visual Studio and
Xcode), the value is a reference to a build-time variable
specifying the name of the per-configuration output
subdirectory. On Makefile generators this evaluates to
&quot;.&quot; because there is only one configuration in a
build tree. Example values:</p>

<p>$(IntDir) = Visual Studio 6 $(OutDir) = Visual Studio 7,
8, 9 $(Configuration) = Visual Studio 10 $(CONFIGURATION) =
Xcode . = Make-based tools</p>

<p>Since these values are evaluated by the native build
system, this variable is suitable only for use in command
lines that will be evaluated at build time. Example of
intended usage:</p>

<p>add_executable(mytool mytool.c) add_custom_command(
OUTPUT out.txt COMMAND
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool
${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt DEPENDS mytool
in.txt ) add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)</p>

<p>Note that CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR is no longer necessary for
this pur- pose but has been left for compatibility with
existing projects. Instead add_custom_command() recognizes
executable target names in its COMMAND option, so
&quot;${CMAKE_CUR-
RENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool&quot; can be
replaced by just &quot;mytool&quot;.</p>

<p>This variable is read-only. Setting it is undefined
behavior. In multi-configuration build systems the value of
this variable is passed as the value of preprocessor symbol
&quot;CMAKE_INTDIR&quot; to the compilation of all source
files.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COMMAND The full path to the cmake executable.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the CMake executable cmake
which is useful from custom commands that want to use the
cmake -E option for portable system commands. (e.g.
/usr/local/bin/cmake</p>

<p>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING Is CMake currently cross
compiling.</p>

<p>This variable will be set to true by CMake if CMake is
cross compiling. Specifically if the build platform is
different from the target platform.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND Full path to ctest command installed
with cmake.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the CTest executable ctest
which is useful from custom commands that want to use the
cmake -E option for portable system commands.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR The path to the binary
directory currently being processed.</p>

<p>This the full path to the build directory that is
currently being processed by cmake. Each directory added by
add_subdirec- tory will create a binary directory in the
build tree, and as it is being processed this variable will
be set. For in-source builds this is the current source
directory being processed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR Full directory of the listfile
currently being processed.</p>

<p>As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this
variable will always be set to the directory where the
listfile which is currently being processed
(CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE) is located. The value has dynamic
scope. When CMake starts processing com- mands in a source
file it sets this variable to the directory where this file
is located. When CMake finishes processing com- mands from
the file it restores the previous value. Therefore the value
of the variable inside a macro or function is the directory
of the file invoking the bottom-most entry on the call
stack, not the directory of the file containing the macro or
function definition.</p>

<p>See also CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE Full path to the listfile
currently being processed.</p>

<p>As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this
variable will always be set to the one currently being
processed. The value has dynamic scope. When CMake starts
processing commands in a source file it sets this variable
to the location of the file. When CMake finishes processing
commands from the file it restores the previous value.
Therefore the value of the vari- able inside a macro or
function is the file invoking the bot- tom-most entry on the
call stack, not the file containing the macro or function
definition.</p>

<p>See also CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_LINE The line number of the current
file being processed.</p>

<p>This is the line number of the file currently being
processed by cmake.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR The path to the source
directory currently being processed.</p>

<p>This the full path to the source directory that is
currently being processed by cmake.</p>

<p>CMAKE_DL_LIBS Name of library containing dlopen and
dlcose.</p>

<p>The name of the library that has dlopen and dlclose in
it, usu- ally -ldl on most UNIX machines.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EDIT_COMMAND Full path to cmake-gui or ccmake.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the CMake executable that can
graphi- cally edit the cache. For example, cmake-gui,
ccmake, or cmake -i.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX The suffix for executables on
this platform.</p>

<p>The suffix to use for the end of an executable filename
if any, .exe on Windows.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt; overrides this for
language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR The extra generator used to build
the project.</p>

<p>When using the Eclipse, CodeBlocks or KDevelop
generators, CMake generates Makefiles (CMAKE_GENERATOR) and
additionally project files for the respective IDE. This IDE
project file generator is stored in CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR
(e.g. &quot;Eclipse CDT4&quot;).</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXTRA_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES Additional suffixes
for shared libraries.</p>

<p>Extensions for shared libraries other than that
specified by CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX, if any. CMake uses
this to recog- nize external shared library files during
analysis of libraries linked by a target.</p>

<p>CMAKE_GENERATOR The generator used to build the
project.</p>

<p>The name of the generator that is being used to generate
the build files. (e.g. &quot;Unix Makefiles&quot;,
&quot;Visual Studio 6&quot;, etc.)</p>

<p>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET Native build system toolset name
specified by user.</p>

<p>Some CMake generators support a toolset name to be given
to the native build system to choose a compiler. If the user
specifies a toolset name (e.g. via the cmake -T option) the
value will be available in this variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY Path to top of source tree.</p>

<p>This is the path to the top level of the source
tree.</p>

the cmake_minimum_required command.</p>

<p>CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION The Minor version of cmake (i.e. the
4 in X.4.X).</p>

<p>This specifies the minor version of the CMake executable
being run.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE Full path to the CMake file that
included the current one.</p>

<p>While processing a CMake file loaded by include() or
find_pack- age() this variable contains the full path to the
file including it. The top of the include stack is always
the CMakeLists.txt for the current directory. See also
CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION The patch version of cmake (i.e. the
3 in X.X.3).</p>

<p>This specifies the patch version of the CMake executable
being run.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME The name of the current project.</p>

<p>This specifies name of the current project from the
closest inherited PROJECT command.</p>

<p>CMAKE_RANLIB Name of randomizing tool for static
libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies name of the program that randomizes
libraries on UNIX, not used on Windows, but may be
present.</p>

<p>CMAKE_ROOT Install directory for running cmake.</p>

<p>This is the install root for the running CMake and the
Modules directory can be found here. This is commonly used
in this for- mat: ${CMAKE_ROOT}/Modules</p>

<p>CMAKE_SCRIPT_MODE_FILE Full path to the -P script file
currently being processed.</p>

<p>When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to
the full path of the script file. When run to configure a
CMakeLists.txt file, this variable is not set.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX The prefix for shared
libraries that you link to.</p>

<p>The prefix to use for the name of a shared library, lib
on UNIX.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX_&lt;LANG&gt; overrides this

<p>CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt; overrides this
for language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P Size of a void pointer.</p>

<p>This is set to the size of a pointer on the machine, and
is determined by a try compile. If a 64 bit size is found,
then the library search path is modified to look for 64 bit
libraries first.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH If true, do not add run time path
information.</p>

<p>If this is set to TRUE, then the rpath information is
not added to compiled executables. The default is to add
rpath informa- tion if the platform supports it. This allows
for easy running from the build tree. To omit RPATH in the
install step, but not the build step, use
CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH instead.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR The path to the top level of the source
tree.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the top level of the current
CMake source tree. For an in-source build, this would be the
same as CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.</p>

<p>CMAKE_STANDARD_LIBRARIES Libraries linked into every
executable and shared library.</p>

<p>This is the list of libraries that are linked into all
executa- bles and libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX The prefix for static
libraries that you link to.</p>

<p>The prefix to use for the name of a static library, lib
on UNIX.</p>

<p>CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX_&lt;LANG&gt; overrides this
for language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX The suffix for static
libraries that you link to.</p>

<p>The suffix to use for the end of a static library
filename, .lib on Windows.</p>

<p>CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt; overrides this
for language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION The tweak version of cmake (i.e. the
1 in X.X.X.1).</p>

<p>This specifies the tweak version of the CMake executable
being run. Releases use tweak &lt; 20000000 and development
versions use the date format CCYYMMDD for the tweak
level.</p>

<p>CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE Create verbose makefiles if
on.</p>

<p>This variable defaults to false. You can set this
variable to true to make CMake produce verbose makefiles
that show each com- mand line as it is used.</p>

<p>CMAKE_VERSION The full version of cmake in
major.minor.patch[.tweak[-id]] for- mat.</p>

<p>This specifies the full version of the CMake executable
being run. This variable is defined by versions 2.6.3 and
higher. See variables CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION,
CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION, CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION, and
CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION for individual ver- sion components. The
[-id] component appears in non-release versions and may be
arbitrary text.</p>

<p>CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET Visual Studio Platform Toolset
name.</p>

<p>VS 10 and above use MSBuild under the hood and support
multiple compiler toolchains. CMake may specify a toolset
explicitly, such as &quot;v110&quot; for VS 11 or
&quot;Windows7.1SDK&quot; for 64-bit support in VS 10
Express. CMake provides the name of the chosen toolset in
this variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_XCODE_PLATFORM_TOOLSET Xcode compiler
selection.</p>

<p>Xcode supports selection of a compiler from one of the
installed toolsets. CMake provides the name of the chosen
toolset in this variable, if any is explicitly selected
(e.g. via the cmake -T option).</p>

<p>PROJECT_BINARY_DIR Full path to build directory for
project.</p>

<p>This is the binary directory of the most recent PROJECT
command.</p>

<p>PROJECT_NAME Name of the project given to the project
command.</p>

<p>This is the name given to the most recent PROJECT
command.</p>

<p>PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR Top level source directory for the
current project.</p>

<p>This is the source directory of the most recent PROJECT
command.</p>

<p>[Project name]_BINARY_DIR Top level binary directory for
the named project.</p>

<p>A variable is created with the name used in the PROJECT
command, and is the binary directory for the project. This
can be use- ful when SUBDIR is used to connect several
projects.</p>

<p>[Project name]_SOURCE_DIR Top level source directory for
the named project.</p>

<p>A variable is created with the name used in the PROJECT
command, and is the source directory for the project. This
can be use- ful when add_subdirectory is used to connect
several projects.</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT CHANGE BEHAVIOR BUILD_SHARED_LIBS Global
flag to cause add_library to create shared libraries if
on.</p>

<p>If present and true, this will cause all libraries to be
built shared unless the library was explicitly added as a
static library. This variable is often added to projects as
an OPTION so that each user of a project can decide if they
want to build the project using shared or static
libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES List of files which
have been installed using an ABSOLUTE DES- TINATION
path.</p>

<p>This variable is defined by CMake-generated
cmake_install.cmake scripts. It can be used (read-only) by
programs or scripts that source those install scripts. This
is used by some CPack genera- tors (e.g. RPM).</p>

<p>CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE Switch between strict and
relaxed automoc mode.</p>

<p>By default, automoc behaves exactly as described in the
documen- tation of the AUTOMOC target property. When set to
TRUE, it accepts more input and tries to find the correct
input file for moc even if it differs from the documented
behaviour. In this mode it e.g. also checks whether a header
file is intended to be processed by moc when a
&quot;foo.moc&quot; file has been included.</p>

<p>Relaxed mode has to be enabled for KDE4
compatibility.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY Version of cmake required
to build project</p>

<p>From the point of view of backwards compatibility, this
speci- fies what version of CMake should be supported. By
default this value is the version number of CMake that you
are running. You can set this to an older version of CMake
to support deprecated commands of CMake in projects that
were written to use older versions of CMake. This can be set
by the user or set at the beginning of a CMakeLists
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Specifies the build type on
single-configuration generators.</p>

<p>This statically specifies what build type
(configuration) will be built in this build tree. Possible
values are empty, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and
MinSizeRel. This variable is only meaningful to
single-configuration generators (such as make and Ninja)
i.e. those which choose a single configuration when CMake
runs to generate a build tree as opposed to
multi-configuration generators which offer selection of the
build configuration within the generated build environment.
There are many per-con- fig properties and variables
(usually following clean SOME_VAR_&lt;CONFIG&gt; order
conventions), such as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;,
specified as uppercase:
CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[DEBUG|RELEASE|RELWITHDEBINFO|MINSIZEREL]. For
example, in a build tree configured to build type Debug,
CMake will see to having CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG settings get
added to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS settings. See also
CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE Enables color output when using the
Makefile generator.</p>

<p>When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce
colored out- put. Default is ON.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES Specifies the available build
types on multi-config generators.</p>

<p>This specifies what build types (configurations) will be
avail- able such as Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo etc. This
has rea- sonable defaults on most platforms, but can be
extended to pro- vide other build types. See also
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE for details of managing configuration data,
and CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR.</p>

<p>CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES Enables tracing output for
target properties.</p>

<p>This variable can be populated with a list of properties
to gen- erate debug output for when evaluating target
properties. Cur- rently it can only be used when evaluating
the INCLUDE_DIRECTO- RIES, COMPILE_DEFINITIONS and
COMPILE_OPTIONS target properties. In that case, it outputs
a backtrace for each entry in the tar- get property. Default
is unset.</p>

<p>CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt; Variable
for disabling find_package() calls.</p>

<p>Every non-REQUIRED find_package() call in a project can
be dis- abled by setting the variable
CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;Packa- geName&gt; to TRUE.
This can be used to build a project without an optional
package, although that package is installed.</p>

<p>This switch should be used during the initial CMake run.
Other- wise if the package has already been found in a
previous CMake run, the variables which have been stored in
the cache will still be there. In that case it is
recommended to remove the cache variables for this package
from the cache using the cache editor or cmake -U</p>

<p>CMAKE_ERROR_DEPRECATED Whether to issue deprecation
errors for macros and functions.</p>

<p>If TRUE, this can be used by macros and functions to
issue fatal errors when deprecated macros or functions are
used. This vari- able is FALSE by default.</p>

<p>CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION Ask
cmake_install.cmake script to error out as soon as a file
with absolute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.</p>

<p>The fatal error is emitted before the installation of
the offending file takes place. This variable is used by
CMake-gen- erated cmake_install.cmake scripts. If one sets
this variable to ON while running the script, it may get
fatal error messages from the script.</p>

<p>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES Prefixes to prepend when
looking for libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies what prefixes to add to library names
when the find_library command looks for libraries. On UNIX
systems this is typically lib, meaning that when trying to
find the foo library it will look for libfoo.</p>

<p>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES Suffixes to append when
looking for libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies what suffixes to add to library names
when the find_library command looks for libraries. On
Windows systems this is typically .lib and .dll, meaning
that when trying to find the foo library it will look for
foo.dll etc.</p>

<p>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE Tell find_package to
warn if called without an explicit mode.</p>

<p>If find_package is called without an explicit mode
option (MOD- ULE, CONFIG or NO_MODULE) and no
Find&lt;pkg&gt;.cmake module is in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH then
CMake implicitly assumes that the caller intends to search
for a package configuration file. If no pack- age
configuration file is found then the wording of the failure
message must account for both the case that the package is
really missing and the case that the project has a bug and
failed to provide the intended Find module. If instead the
caller specifies an explicit mode option then the failure
mes- sage can be more specific.</p>

<p>Set CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE to TRUE to tell
find_pack- age to warn when it implicitly assumes Config
mode. This helps developers enforce use of an explicit mode
in all calls to find_package within a project.</p>

<p>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX()
commands.</p>

<p>Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in
FIND_XXX() commands. This is useful in cross-compiled
environments where some system directories contain
incompatible but possibly linkable libraries. For example,
on cross-compiled cluster envi- ronments, this allows a user
to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the
front-end machine that modules like FindX11 (and others)
would normally search. By default this is empty; it is
intended to be set by the project. Note that
CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH takes a list of directory names, NOT a
list of prefixes. If you want to ignore paths under prefixes
(bin, include, lib, etc.), youll need to specify them
explicitly. See also CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE()
and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the
contained directories for the existence of the file which is
currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended
to be set by the project. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PRE- FIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME Default component
used in install() commands.</p>

<p>If an install() command is used without the COMPONENT
argument, these files will be grouped into a default
component. The name of this default install component will
be taken from this vari- able. It defaults to
&quot;Unspecified&quot;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX Install directory used by
install.</p>

<p>If &quot;make install&quot; is invoked or INSTALL is
built, this directory is prepended onto all install
directories. This variable defaults to /usr/local on UNIX
and c:/Program Files on Windows.</p>

<p>On UNIX one can use the DESTDIR mechanism in order to
relocate the whole installation. DESTDIR means DESTination
DIRectory. It is commonly used by makefile users in order to
install software at non-default location. It is usually
invoked like this:</p>

<p>make DESTDIR=/home/john install</p>

<p>which will install the concerned software using the
installation prefix, e.g. &quot;/usr/local&quot; prepended
with the DESTDIR value which finally gives
&quot;/home/john/usr/local&quot;.</p>

<p>WARNING: DESTDIR may not be used on Windows because
installation prefix usually contains a drive letter like in
&quot;C:/Program Files&quot; which cannot be prepended with
some other prefix.</p>

<p>The installation prefix is also added to
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PRE- FIX_PATH so that find_package,
find_program, find_library, find_path, and find_file will
search the prefix for other soft- ware.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_LIBRARY().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY().
FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the contained directories
for the existence of the library which is currently
searched. By default it is empty, it is intended to be set
by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_MFC_FLAG Tell cmake to use MFC for an executable
or dll.</p>

<p>This can be set in a CMakeLists.txt file and will enable
MFC in the application. It should be set to 1 for the static
MFC library, and 2 for the shared MFC library. This is used
in Visual Studio 6 and 7 project files. The CMakeSetup
dialog used MFC and the CMakeLists.txt looks like this:</p>

<p>add_definitions(-D_AFXDLL) set(CMAKE_MFC_FLAG 2)
add_executable(CMakeSetup WIN32 ${SRCS})</p>

<p>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH List of directories to search for
CMake modules.</p>

<p>Commands like include() and find_package() search for
files in directories listed by this variable before checking
the default modules that come with CMake.</p>

<p>CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS Skip _BUILD_TYPE flags if
true.</p>

<p>This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake
to tell CMake to skip the _BUILD_TYPE flags.</p>

<p>CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; Default for CMake
Policy CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; when it is otherwise left unset.</p>

<p>Commands cmake_minimum_required(VERSION) and
cmake_policy(VER- SION) by default leave policies introduced
after the given ver- sion unset. Set
CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; to OLD or NEW to
specify the default for policy CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;, where
&lt;NNNN&gt; is the policy number.</p>

<p>This variable should not be set by a project in CMake
code; use cmake_policy(SET) instead. Users running CMake may
set this variable in the cache (e.g. -DCMAKE_POL-
ICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;=&lt;OLD|NEW&gt;) to set a policy
not otherwise set by the project. Set to OLD to quiet a
policy warning while using old behavior or to NEW to try
building the project with new behavior.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(),
with appropriate suffixes added.</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX()
commands. It contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the
FIND_XXX() commands append appropriate subdirectories to the
base directories. So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each of the
directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each
of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append
/include . By default it is empty, it is intended to be set
by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH,
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_PROGRAM().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM().
FIND_PRO- GRAM() will check each of the contained
directories for the existence of the program which is
currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended
to be set by the project. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY Dont make the install
target depend on the all target.</p>

<p>By default, the &quot;install&quot; target depends on
the &quot;all&quot; target. This has the effect, that when
&quot;make install&quot; is invoked or INSTALL is built,
first the &quot;all&quot; target is built, then the
installation starts. If CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY is
set to TRUE, this dependency is not created, so the
installation process will start immediately, independent
from whether the project has been completely built or
not.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH Path to be ignored by
FIND_XXX() commands.</p>

<p>Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in
FIND_XXX() commands. This is useful in cross-compiled
environments where some system directories contain
incompatible but possibly link- able libraries. For example,
on cross-compiled cluster environ- ments, this allows a user
to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the
front-end machine that modules like FindX11 (and others)
would normally search. By default this contains a list of
directories containing incompatible binaries for the host
system. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH,
CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, and
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE()
and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the
contained directories for the existence of the file which is
currently searched. By default it contains the standard
directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be
modified by the project, use CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH for this.
See also CMAKE_SYS- TEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_LIBRARY().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY().
FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the contained directories
for the existence of the library which is currently
searched. By default it contains the standard directories
for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by
the project, use CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH for this. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_XXX(), with appropriate suffixes added.</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX()
commands. It contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the
FIND_XXX() commands append appropriate subdirectories to the
base directories. So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each of the
directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each
of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append
/include . By default this contains the standard directories
for the current system and the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. It is
NOT intended to be modified by the project, use
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYS-
TEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PRO- GRAM_PATH, and
CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_PROGRAM().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM().
FIND_PRO- GRAM() will check each of the contained
directories for the existence of the program which is
currently searched. By default it contains the standard
directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be
modified by the project, use CMAKE_PRO- GRAM_PATH for this.
See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE Specify a CMake file that
overrides platform information.</p>

<p>CMake loads the specified file while enabling support
for each language from either the project() or
enable_language() com- mands. It is loaded after CMakes
builtin compiler and platform information modules have been
loaded but before the information is used. The file may set
platform information variables to override CMakes
defaults.</p>

<p>This feature is intended for use only in overriding
information variables that must be set before CMake builds
its first test project to check that the compiler for a
language works. It should not be used to load a file in
cases that a normal include() will work. Use it only as a
last resort for behavior that cannot be achieved any other
way. For example, one may set CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT to change
the default value used to initial- ize CMAKE_C_FLAGS before
it is cached. The override file should NOT be used to set
anything that could be set after languages are enabled, such
as variables like CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIREC- TORY that
affect the placement of binaries. Information set in the
file will be used for try_compile and try_run builds
too.</p>

<p>CMAKE_WARN_DEPRECATED Whether to issue deprecation
warnings for macros and functions.</p>

<p>If TRUE, this can be used by macros and functions to
issue dep- recation warnings. This variable is FALSE by
default.</p>

<p>CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION Ask
cmake_install.cmake script to warn each time a file with
absolute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.</p>

<p>This variable is used by CMake-generated
cmake_install.cmake scripts. If one sets this variable to ON
while running the script, it may get warning messages from
the script.</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT DESCRIBE THE SYSTEM APPLE True if running
on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>Set to true on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>BORLAND True if the Borland compiler is being used.</p>

<p>This is set to true if the Borland compiler is being
used.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CL_64 Using the 64 bit compiler from Microsoft</p>

<p>Set to true when using the 64 bit cl compiler from
Microsoft.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COMPILER_2005 Using the Visual Studio 2005

on.</p>

<p>The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME but for the host system
instead of the target system when cross compiling.</p>

running on.</p>

<p>The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR but for the host
system instead of the target system when cross
compiling.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION OS version CMake is running
on.</p>

<p>The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION but for the host system
instead of the target system when cross compiling.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_UNIX True for UNIX and UNIX like operating
systems.</p>

<p>Set to true when the host system is UNIX or UNIX like
(i.e. APPLE and CYGWIN).</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_WIN32 True on windows systems, including
win64.</p>

<p>Set to true when the host system is Windows and on
Cygwin.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE Target architecture library
directory name, if detected.</p>

<p>This is the value of
CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE as detected for one
of the enabled languages.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE_REGEX Regex matching possible
target architecture library directory names.</p>

<p>This is used to detect
CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE from the implicit
linker search path by matching the &lt;arch&gt; name.</p>

<p>CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX Maximum object file full-path
length allowed by native build tools.</p>

<p>CMake computes for every source file an object file name
that is unique to the source file and deterministic with
respect to the full path to the source file. This allows
multiple source files in a target to share the same name if
they lie in different directories without rebuilding when
one is added or removed. However, it can produce long full
paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path using a
hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds
a limit. CMake has a built-in limit for each platform that
is sufficient for common tools, but some native tools may
have a lower limit. This variable may be set to specify the
limit explicitly. The value must be an integer no less than
128.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM Name of system cmake is compiling for.</p>

<p>This variable is the composite of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME and
CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION, like this ${CMAKE_SYS-
TEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION}. If CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
is not set, then CMAKE_SYSTEM is the same as
CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Name of the OS CMake is building
for.</p>

<p>This is the name of the operating system on which CMake
is tar- geting. On systems that have the uname command, this
variable is set to the output of uname -s. Linux, Windows,
and Darwin for Mac OS X are the values found on the big
three operating systems.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR The name of the CPU CMake is
building for.</p>

<p>On systems that support uname, this variable is set to
the out- put of uname -p, on windows it is set to the value
of the envi- ronment variable PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION OS version CMake is building
for.</p>

<p>A numeric version string for the system, on systems that
support uname, this variable is set to the output of uname
-r. On other systems this is set to major-minor version
numbers.</p>

<p>CYGWIN True for Cygwin.</p>

<p>Set to true when using Cygwin.</p>

Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>MSVC80 True when using Microsoft Visual C 8.0</p>

<p>Set to true when the compiler is version 8.0 of
Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>MSVC90 True when using Microsoft Visual C 9.0</p>

<p>Set to true when the compiler is version 9.0 of
Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>MSVC_IDE True when using the Microsoft Visual C IDE</p>

<p>Set to true when the target platform is the Microsoft
Visual C IDE, as opposed to the command line compiler.</p>

<p>MSVC_VERSION The version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ being
used if any.</p>

<p>Known version numbers are:</p>

<p>1200 = VS 6.0 1300 = VS 7.0 1310 = VS 7.1 1400 = VS 8.0

<p>XCODE_VERSION Version of Xcode (Xcode generator
only).</p>

<p>Under the Xcode generator, this is the version of Xcode
as spec- ified in
&quot;Xcode.app/Contents/version.plist&quot; (such as
&quot;3.1.2&quot;).</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE BUILD
CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX Default filename postfix for
libraries under configuration &lt;CON- FIG&gt;.</p>

<p>When a non-executable target is created its
&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX target property is initialized with
the value of this variable if it is set.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET Default value for
&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET of targets.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the

when using automoc (see CMAKE_AUTO- MOC).</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS property on all the targets. See that
target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH Use the install path for
the RPATH</p>

<p>Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when
building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the
software is installed the executables etc are relinked by
CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to
true then the software is always built with the install path
for the RPATH and does not need to be relinked when
installed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX See variable
CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.</p>

<p>This variable is a special case of the more-general
CMAKE_&lt;CON- FIG&gt;_POSTFIX variable for the DEBUG
configuration.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS Linker flags to be used to create
executables.</p>

<p>These flags will be used by the linker when creating an
exe- cutable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Flags to be used
when linking an executable.</p>

<p>Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when
creating executables.</p>

<p>CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate
the Fortran source layout.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the Fortran_FORMAT
property on all the targets. See that target property for
additional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY Fortran module output
directory.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the

that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_GNUtoMS Convert GNU import libraries (.dll.a) to
MS format (.lib).</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the GNUtoMS property
on tar- gets when they are created. See that target property
for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR Automatically add the current
source- and build directories to the include path.</p>

<p>If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds in
each directory ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} and ${CMAKE_CUR-
RENT_BINARY_DIR} to the include path for this directory.
These additional include directories do not propagate down
to subdi- rectories. This is useful mainly for out-of-source
builds, where files generated into the build tree are
included by files located in the source tree.</p>

<p>By default CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR is OFF.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE Automatically add
the current source- and build directories to the
INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.</p>

<p>If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds
for each shared library target, static library target,
module target and executable target,
${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} and ${CMAKE_CUR-
RENT_BINARY_DIR} to the INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.By
default CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE is OFF.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR Mac OS X directory name for
installed targets.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR is used to initialize the
INSTALL_NAME_DIR property on all targets. See that target
prop- erty for more information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH The rpath to use for installed
targets.</p>

<p>A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use
in installed targets (for platforms that support it). This
is used to initialize the target property INSTALL_RPATH for
all targets.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH Add paths to linker
search and installed rpath.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if
set to true will append directories in the linker search
path and out- side the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. This is
used to initial- ize the target property
INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH for all tar- gets.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the
LIBRARY targets when built.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH_FLAG The flag to be used to add a
library search path to a compiler.</p>

<p>The flag will be used to specify a library directory to
the com- piler. On most compilers this is
&quot;-L&quot;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LINK_DEF_FILE_FLAG Linker flag to be used to
specify a .def file for dll creation.</p>

<p>The flag will be used to add a .def file when creating a
dll on Windows; this is only defined on Windows.</p>

LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG Flag to be used to link a
library specified by a path to its file.</p>

<p>The flag will be used before a library file path is
given to the linker. This is needed only on very few
platforms.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FLAG Flag to be used to link a
library into an executable.</p>

<p>The flag will be used to specify a library to link to an
exe- cutable. On most compilers this is &quot;-l&quot;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE Default value for MACOSX_BUNDLE of
targets.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the MACOSX_BUNDLE
property on all the targets. See that target property for
additional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS Linker flags to be used to
create modules.</p>

<p>These flags will be used by the linker when creating a
module.</p>

<p>CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Flags to be
used when linking a module.</p>

<p>Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when
creating modules.</p>

<p>CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH Do not use the builtin ELF
editor to fix RPATHs on installation.</p>

<p>When an ELF binary needs to have a different RPATH after
instal- lation than it does in the build tree, CMake uses a
builtin edi- tor to change the RPATH in the installed copy.
If this variable is set to true then CMake will relink the
binary before instal- lation instead of using its builtin
editor.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the MS debug
symbol files from linker.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See that
target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE Default value for
POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE of targets.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
POSITION_INDEPEN- DENT_CODE property on all the targets. See
that target property for additional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the
RUNTIME targets when built.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS Linker flags to be used to
create shared libraries.</p>

<p>These flags will be used by the linker when creating a
shared library.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Flags to be
used when linking a shared library.</p>

<p>Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when
creating shared libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH Do not include RPATHs in the
build tree.</p>

<p>Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when
building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the
software is installed the executables etc are relinked by
CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to
true then the software is always built with no RPATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH Do not include RPATHs in the
install tree.</p>

<p>Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when
building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the
software is installed the executables etc are relinked by
CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to
true then the software is always installed without RPATH,
even if RPATH is enabled when building. This can be useful
for example to allow running tests from the build directory
with RPATH enabled before the installa- tion step. To omit
RPATH in both the build and install steps, use
CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH instead.</p>

<p>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS Linker flags to be used to
create static libraries.</p>

<p>These flags will be used by the linker when creating a
static library.</p>

<p>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Flags to be
used when linking a static library.</p>

<p>Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when
creating static libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION Build configuration used
for try_compile and try_run projects.</p>

<p>Projects built by try_compile and try_run are built syn-
chronously during the CMake configuration step. Therefore a
specific build configuration must be chosen even if the
gener- ated build system supports multiple
configurations.</p>

<p>CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS Use relative paths (May not
work!).</p>

<p>If this is set to TRUE, then CMake will use relative
paths between the source and binary tree. This option does
not work for more complicated projects, and relative paths
are used when possible. In general, it is not possible to
move CMake gener- ated makefiles to a different location
regardless of the value of this variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN Default value for
VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN of targets.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
VISIBILITY_INLINES_HID- DEN property on all the targets. See
that target property for additional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE Default value for
WIN32_EXECUTABLE of targets.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the WIN32_EXECUTABLE
prop- erty on all the targets. See that target property for
addi- tional information.</p>

<p>EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH Old executable location
variable.</p>

<p>The target property RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercedes
this variable for a target if it is set. Executable targets
are oth- erwise placed in this directory.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH Old library location variable.</p>

<p>The target properties ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
supercede this variable for a target if they are set.
Library targets are otherwise placed in this directory.</p>

<p>VARIABLES FOR LANGUAGES
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_APPEND Rule variable to append to
a static archive.</p>

<p>This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to append
to a static archive. It is used in place of

<p>This variable is not guaranteed to be defined for all
compilers or languages.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LOADED Defined to true if
the language is enabled.</p>

<p>When language &lt;LANG&gt; is enabled by project() or
enable_lan- guage() this variable is defined to 1.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION Compiler version
string.</p>

<p>Compiler version in major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]
format. This variable is not guaranteed to be defined for
all compilers or languages.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILE_OBJECT Rule variable to
compile a single object file.</p>

<p>This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to compile
a single object file for the language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY Rule variable
to create a shared library.</p>

<p>This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a
shared library for the language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CREATE_SHARED_MODULE Rule variable to
create a shared module.</p>

shared library for the language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CREATE_STATIC_LIBRARY Rule variable
to create a static library.</p>

<p>This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to create a
static library for the language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS Flags for all build types.</p>

<p>&lt;LANG&gt; flags used regardless of the value of
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_DEBUG Flags for Debug build
type or configuration.</p>

<p>&lt;LANG&gt; flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is
Debug.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_MINSIZEREL Flags for MinSizeRel
build type or configuration.</p>

<p>&lt;LANG&gt; flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is
MinSizeRel.Short for minimum size release.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_RELEASE Flags for Release build
type or configuration.</p>

<p>&lt;LANG&gt; flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is
Release</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO Flags for
RelWithDebInfo type or configuration.</p>

<p>&lt;LANG&gt; flags used when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is
RelWithDebInfo. Short for Release With Debug
Information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IGNORE_EXTENSIONS File extensions
that should be ignored by the build.</p>

<p>This is a list of file extensions that may be part of a
project for a given language but are not compiled.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header
files.</p>

<p>CMake does not explicitly specify these directories on
compiler command lines for language &lt;LANG&gt;. This
prevents system include directories from being treated as
user include directories on some compilers.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES Implicit
linker search path detected for language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>Compilers typically pass directories containing language
runtime libraries and default library search paths when they
invoke a linker. These paths are implicit linker search
directories for the compiler s language. CMake automatically
detects these directories for each language and reports the
results in this variable.</p>

<p>When a library in one of these directories is given by
full path to target_link_libraries() CMake will generate the
-l&lt;name&gt; form on link lines to ensure the linker
searches its implicit direc- tories for the library. Note
that some toolchains read implicit directories from an
environment variable such as LIBRARY_PATH so keep its value
consistent when operating in a given build tree.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_FRAMEWORK_DIRECTORIES
Implicit linker framework search path detected for language
&lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>These paths are implicit linker framework search
directories for the compiler s language. CMake automatically
detects these directories for each language and reports the
results in this variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES Implicit link
libraries and flags detected for language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>Compilers typically pass language runtime library names
and other flags when they invoke a linker. These flags are
implicit link options for the compiler s language. CMake
automatically detects these libraries and flags for each
language and reports the results in this variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE Target
architecture library directory name detected for
&lt;lang&gt;.</p>

<p>If the &lt;lang&gt; compiler passes to the linker an
architecture-spe- cific system library search directory such
as &lt;pre- fix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; this variable contains
the &lt;arch&gt; name if/as detected by CMake.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE Preference value
for linker language selection.</p>

<p>The &quot;linker language&quot; for executable, shared
library, and module targets is the language whose compiler
will invoke the linker. The LINKER_LANGUAGE target property
sets the language explic- itly. Otherwise, the linker
language is that whose linker preference value is highest
among languages compiled and linked into the target. See
also the CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFER- ENCE_PROPAGATES
variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES True if
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE propagates across tar-
gets.</p>

<p>This is used when CMake selects a linker language for a
target. Languages compiled directly into the target are
always consid- ered. A language compiled into static
libraries linked by the target is considered if this
variable is true.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_EXECUTABLE Rule variable to link
an executable.</p>

<p>Rule variable to link an executable for the given
language.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_OUTPUT_EXTENSION Extension for the
output of a compile for a single file.</p>

<p>This is the extension for an object file for the given
&lt;LANG&gt;. For example .obj for C on Windows.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_PLATFORM_ID An internal variable
subject to change.</p>

<p>This is used in determining the platform and is subject
to change.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SIZEOF_DATA_PTR Size of
pointer-to-data types for language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>This holds the size (in bytes) of pointer-to-data types
in the target platform ABI. It is defined for languages C
and CXX (C++).</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS Extensions of
source files for the given language.</p>

<p>This is the list of extensions for a given languages
source files.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNU&lt;LANG&gt; True if the compiler
is GNU.</p>

<p>If the selected &lt;LANG&gt; compiler is the GNU
compiler then this is TRUE, if not it is FALSE. Unlike the
other per-language vari- ables, this uses the GNU syntax for
identifying languages instead of the CMake syntax.
Recognized values of the &lt;LANG&gt; suffix are:</p>

<p>CC = C compiler CXX = C++ compiler G77 = Fortran
compiler</p>

<p>CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_DEFAULT Fortran default module
output directory.</p>

<p>Most Fortran compilers write .mod files to the current
working directory. For those that do not, this is set to
&quot;.&quot; and used when the Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
target property is not set.</p>

<p>CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_FLAG Fortran flag for module output
directory.</p>

<p>This stores the flag needed to pass the value of the
For- tran_MODULE_DIRECTORY target property to the
compiler.</p>

<p>CMAKE_Fortran_MODOUT_FLAG Fortran flag to enable module
output.</p>

<p>Most Fortran compilers write .mod files out by default.
For others, this stores the flag needed to enable module
output.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INTERNAL_PLATFORM_ABI An internal variable subject
to change.</p>

<p>This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is
subject to change.</p>

<p>CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_&lt;LANG&gt; Specify a
CMake file that overrides platform information for
&lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>This is a language-specific version of
CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE loaded only when enabling
lan- guage &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>
