<p>RDMA_GET_CM_EVENT(3) Librdmacm Programmer s Manual
RDMA_GET_CM_EVENT(3)</p>

<p>NAME rdma_get_cm_event - Retrieves the next pending
communication event.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;rdma/rdma_cma.h&gt;</p>

<p>int rdma_get_cm_event (struct rdma_event_channel
*channel, struct rdma_cm_event **event);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS channel Event channel to check for events.</p>

<p>event Allocated information about the next communication
event.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Retrieves a communication event. If no
events are pending, by default, the call will block until an
event is received.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error. If an
error occurs, errno will be set to indicate the failure
reason.</p>

<p>NOTES The default synchronous behavior of this routine
can be changed by mod- ifying the file descriptor associated
with the given channel. All events that are reported must be
acknowledged by calling rdma_ack_cm_event. Destruction of an
rdma_cm_id will block until related events have been
acknowledged.</p>

<p>EVENT DATA Communication event details are returned in
the rdma_cm_event struc- ture. This structure is allocated
by the rdma_cm and released by the rdma_ack_cm_event
routine. Details of the rdma_cm_event structure are given
below.</p>

<p>id The rdma_cm identifier associated with the event. If
the event type is RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST, then this
ref- erences a new id for that communication.</p>

<p>listen_id For RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST event types,
this refer- ences the corresponding listening request
identifier.</p>

<p>event Specifies the type of communication event which
occurred. See EVENT TYPES below.</p>

<p>status Returns any asynchronous error information
associated with an event. The status is zero if the
operation was success- ful, otherwise the status value is
non-zero and is either set to an errno or a transport
specific value. For details on transport specific status
values, see the event type information below.</p>

<p>param Provides additional details based on the type of
event. Users should select the conn or ud subfields based on
the rdma_port_space of the rdma_cm_id associated with the
event. See UD EVENT DATA and CONN EVENT DATA below.</p>

<p>UD EVENT DATA Event parameters related to unreliable
datagram (UD) services: RDMA_PS_UDP and RDMA_PS_IPOIB. The
UD event data is valid for RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED and
RDMA_CM_EVENT_MULTICAST_JOIN events, unless stated
otherwise.</p>

<p>private_data References any user-specified data
associated with RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST or
RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED events. The data referenced by
this field matches that specified by the remote side when
calling rdma_connect or rdma_accept. This field is NULL if
the event does not include private data. The buffer
referenced by this pointer is deallocated when calling
rdma_ack_cm_event.</p>

<p>private_data_len The size of the private data buffer.
Users should note that the size of the private data buffer
may be larger than the amount of private data sent by the
remote side. Any additional space in the buffer will be
zeroed out.</p>

<p>ah_attr Address information needed to send data to the
remote end- point(s). Users should use this structure when
allocating their address handle.</p>

<p>qp_num QP number of the remote endpoint or multicast
group.</p>

<p>qkey QKey needed to send data to the remote
endpoint(s).</p>

<p>CONN EVENT DATA Event parameters related to connected QP
services: RDMA_PS_TCP. The connection related event data is
valid for RDMA_CM_EVENT_CON- NECT_REQUEST and
RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED events, unless stated other-
wise.</p>

<p>private_data References any user-specified data
associated with the event. The data referenced by this field
matches that specified by the remote side when calling
rdma_connect or rdma_accept. This field is NULL if the event
does not include private data. The buffer referenced by this
pointer is deallocated when calling rdma_ack_cm_event.</p>

<p>private_data_len The size of the private data buffer.
Users should note that the size of the private data buffer
may be larger than the amount of private data sent by the
remote side. Any additional space in the buffer will be
zeroed out.</p>

<p>responder_resources The number of responder resources
requested of the recipi- ent. This field matches the
initiator depth specified by the remote node when calling
rdma_connect and rdma_accept.</p>

<p>initiator_depth The maximum number of outstanding RDMA
read/atomic opera- tions that the recipient may have
outstanding. This field matches the responder resources
specified by the remote node when calling rdma_connect and
rdma_accept.</p>

<p>flow_control Indicates if hardware level flow control is
provided by the sender.</p>

<p>retry_count For RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST events
only, indicates the number of times that the recipient
should retry send operations.</p>

<p>rnr_retry_count The number of times that the recipient
should retry receiver not ready (RNR) NACK errors.</p>

<p>srq Specifies if the sender is using a shared-receive
queue.</p>

<p>qp_num Indicates the remote QP number for the
connection.</p>

<p>EVENT TYPES The following types of communication events
may be reported.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_ADDR_RESOLVED Address resolution
(rdma_resolve_addr) completed successfully.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_ADDR_ERROR Address resolution
(rdma_resolve_addr) failed.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_ROUTE_RESOLVED Route resolution
(rdma_resolve_route) completed successfully.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_ROUTE_ERROR Route resolution
(rdma_resolve_route) failed.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST Generated on the passive
side to notify the user of a new con- nection request.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_RESPONSE Generated on the active
side to notify the user of a successful response to a
connection request. It is only generated on rdma_cm_ids that
do not have a QP associated with them.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_ERROR Indicates that an error has
occurred trying to establish or a connection. May be
generated on the active or passive side of a connection.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_UNREACHABLE Generated on the active side
to notify the user that the remote server is not reachable
or unable to respond to a connection request. If this event
is generated in response to a UD QP res- olution request
over InfiniBand, the event status field will contain an
errno, if negative, or the status result carried in the IB
CM SIDR REP message.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_REJECTED Indicates that a connection
request or response was rejected by the remote end point.
The event status field will contain the transport specific
reject reason if available. Under Infini- Band, this is the
reject reason carried in the IB CM REJ mes- sage.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED Indicates that a connection
has been established with the remote end point.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_DISCONNECTED The connection has been
disconnected.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_DEVICE_REMOVAL The local RDMA device
associated with the rdma_cm_id has been removed. Upon
receiving this event, the user must destroy the related
rdma_cm_id.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_MULTICAST_JOIN The multicast join
operation (rdma_join_multicast) completed successfully.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_MULTICAST_ERROR An error either occurred
joining a multicast group, or, if the group had already been
joined, on an existing group. The specified multicast group
is no longer accessible and should be rejoined, if
desired.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_ADDR_CHANGE The network device associated
with this ID through address reso- lution changed its HW
address, eg following of bonding failover. This event can
serve as a hint for applications who want the links used for
their RDMA sessions to align with the network stack.</p>

<p>RDMA_CM_EVENT_TIMEWAIT_EXIT The QP associated with a
connection has exited its timewait state and is now ready to
be re-used. After a QP has been dis- connected, it is
maintained in a timewait state to allow any in flight
packets to exit the network. After the timewait state has
completed, the rdma_cm will report this event.</p>
