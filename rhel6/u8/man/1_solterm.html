<p>solterm(1) IPMI Serial over LAN program solterm(1)</p>

<p>NAME solterm - An IPMI Serial over LAN program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS solterm</p>

<p>&lt;connection parms&gt; [-e escape_char]
[-notencrypted] [-notauthenticated] [-bitrate
(9600|19200|38400|57600|115200)] [-alerts (suc-
ceed|defer|fail)] [-holdoff] [-ack-retries n] [-ack-timeout
microsec- onds] [-v] [-q]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The solterm program allows a user to make a
remote serial connection over IPMI. The requires that the
remote system support IPMI 2.0 Serial Over LAN.</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;connection parms&gt; The parameters for the
connection depend on the connection type. These are all
described in openipmi_conparms (7)</p>

<p>-e escape_char The character to use to escape, or exit,
the program. Entering this chatacter right after a newline
is entered causes the pro- gram to go into command mode. A
single character after this performs a command. The default
escape character is &quot;~&quot; as shown below. Suppported
commands are:</p>

<p>~. Terminate the program</p>

<p>~B Send a serial BREAK over the connection</p>

<p>~F Flush all buffers</p>

<p>~R Assert the Ring Indicator (RI) line</p>

<p>~r Deassert the Ring Indicator (RI) line</p>

<p>~D Assert DCD and DSR lines</p>

<p>~d Deassert DCD and DSR lines</p>

<p>~C Pause the output using CTS</p>

<p>~c Put CTS under BMC control</p>

<p>~? Help on escape commands</p>

<p>~~ Enter the escape character twice to send it.</p>

<p>-notencrypted Do not encrypt the SOL data going over the
connection.</p>

<p>-notauthenticated Do not do integrity checks on the SOL
data going over the con- nection.</p>

<p>-bitrate Set the bitrate to the given value. The default
is whatever the BMC has set it to.</p>

<p>-alerts This specifies what to do if a alert that
requires a callout occurs on the line.</p>

<p>succeed specifies that serial/modem alerts are to
succeed while SoL is active.</p>

<p>deferred specifies that serial/modem alerts are to be
deferred for the duration of the SoL session.</p>

<p>fail specifies that serial/modem alerts automatically
fail during the SoL session. This is the default.</p>

<p>-holdoff Specifies that CTS, DTR, and DSR are to be
deasserted at the start of the SoL session so that the
configuration may be mod- ifeid before the handshake is
released.</p>

<p>-v Be more verbose. Maybe specified multiple time for
more output.</p>

<p>-q Be less verbose. Maybe specified multiple time for
less output.</p>

<p>KNOWN PROBLEMS None</p>
