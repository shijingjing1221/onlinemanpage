<p>NAME cpan2dist - The CPANPLUS distribution creator</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This script will create distributions of
&quot;CPAN&quot; modules of the format you specify,
including its prerequisites. These packages can then be
installed using the corresponding package manager for the
format.</p>

<p>Note, you can also do this interactively from the
default shell, &quot;CPANPLUS::Shell::Default&quot;. See the
&quot;CPANPLUS::Dist&quot; documentation, as well as the
documentation of your format of choice for any format
specific documentation.</p>

<p>USAGE Usage: cpan2dist [--format FMT] [OPTS] Mod::Name
[Mod::Name, ...] cpan2dist [--format FMT] [OPTS]
--modulelist /tmp/mods.list cpan2dist [--format FMT] [OPTS]
--archive /tmp/dist [/tmp/dist2]</p>

<p>Will create a distribution of type FMT of the modules
specified on the command line, and all their
prerequisites.</p>

<p>Can also create a distribution of type FMT from a local
archive and all of its prerequisites.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>### take no argument: --help Show this help message
--install Install this package (and any prerequisites you
built) after building it. --skiptest Skip tests. Can be
negated using --noskiptest --force Force operation. Can be
negated using --noforce --verbose Be verbose. Can be negated
using --noverbose --keepsource Keep sources after building
distribution. Can be negated by --nokeepsource. May not be
supported by all formats --makefile Prefer Makefile.PL over
Build.PL. Can be negated using --nomakefile. Defaults to
your config setting --buildprereq Build packages of any
prerequisites, even if they are already uptodate on the
local system. Can be negated using --nobuildprereq. Defaults
to false. --archive Indicate that all modules listed are
actually archives --flushcache Update CPANPLUS&rsquo; cache
before commencing any operation --defaults Instruct
ExtUtils::MakeMaker and Module::Build to use default answers
during &rsquo;perl Makefile.PL&rsquo; or &rsquo;perl
Build.PL&rsquo; calls where possible --edit-metafile Edit
the distributions metafile(s) before the distribution is
built. Requires a configured editor.</p>

<p>### take argument: --format Installer format to use
(defaults to config setting) --ban Patterns of module names
to skip during installation, case-insensitive (affects
prerequisites too) May be given multiple times --banlist
File containing patterns that could be given to --ban Are
appended to the ban list built up by --ban May be given
multiple times. --ignore Patterns of modules to exclude from
prereq list. Useful for when a prereq listed by a CPAN
module is resolved in another way than from its
corresponding CPAN package (Match is done on both module
name, and package name of the package the module is in,
case-insensitive) --ignorelist File containing patterns that
may be given to --ignore. Are appended to the ban list built
up by --ignore. May be given multiple times. --modulelist
File containing a list of modules that should be built. Are
appended to the list of command line modules. May be given
multiple times. --logfile File to log all output to. By
default, all output goes to the console. --timeout The
allowed time for buliding a distribution before aborting.
This is useful to terminate any build that hang or happen to
be interactive despite being told not to be. Defaults to 300
seconds. To turn off, you can set it to 0. --set-config
Change any options as specified in your config for this
invocation only. See CPANPLUS::Config for a list of
supported options. --set-program Change any programs as
specified in your config for this invocation only. See
CPANPLUS::Config for a list of supported programs.
--dist-opts Arbitrary options passed along to the chosen
installer format&rsquo;s prepare()/create() routine. Please
see the documentation of the installer of your choice for
options it accepts.</p>

<p>### builtin lists --default-banlist Use our builtin
banlist. Works just like --ban and --banlist, but with
pre-set lists. See the &quot;Builtin Lists&quot; section for
details. --default-ignorelist Use our builtin ignorelist.
Works just like --ignore and --ignorelist but with pre-set
lists. See the &quot;Builtin Lists&quot; section for
details.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>### build a debian package of DBI and its prerequisites,
### don&rsquo;t bother running tests cpan2dist --format
CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb --buildprereq --skiptest DBI</p>

<p>### build a debian package of DBI and its prerequisites
and install them cpan2dist --format CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb
--buildprereq --install DBI</p>

<p>### Build a package, whose format is determined by your
config, of ### the local tarball, reloading cpanplus&rsquo;
indices first and using ### the tarballs Makefile.PL if it
has one. cpan2dist --makefile --flushcache --archive
/path/to/Cwd-1.0.tgz</p>

<p>### build a package from Net::FTP, but dont build any
packages or ### dependencies whose name match
&rsquo;Foo&rsquo;, &rsquo;Bar&rsquo; or any of the ###
patterns mentioned in /tmp/ban cpan2dist --ban Foo --ban Bar
--banlist /tmp/ban Net::FTP</p>

<p>### build a package from Net::FTP, but ignore its listed
dependency ### on IO::Socket, as it&rsquo;s shipped per
default with the OS we&rsquo;re on cpan2dist --ignore
IO::Socket Net::FTP</p>

<p>### building all modules listed, plus their
prerequisites cpan2dist --ignorelist /tmp/modules.ignore
--banlist /tmp/modules.ban --modulelist /tmp/modules.list
--buildprereq --flushcache --makefile --defaults</p>

<p>### pass arbitrary options to the format&rsquo;s
prepare()/create() routine cpan2dist --dist-opts
deb_version=3 --dist-opts prefix=corp</p>

<p>Built-In Filter Lists Some modules you d rather not
package. Some because they are part of core-perl and you
dont want a new package. Some because they wont build on
your system. Some because your package manager of choice
already packages them for you.</p>

<p>There may be a myriad of reasons. You can use the
&quot;--ignore&quot; and &quot;--ban&quot; options for this,
but we provide some built-in lists that catch common cases.
You can use these built-in lists if you like, or supply your
own if need be.</p>

<p>Built-In Ignore List You can use this list of regexes to
ignore modules matching to be listed as prerequisites of a
package. Particulaly useful if they are bundled with
core-perl anyway and they have known issues building.</p>

<p>Toggle it by supplying the
&quot;--default-ignorelist&quot; option.</p>

<p>^IO$ # Provided with core anyway ^Cwd$ # Provided with
core anyway ^File::Spec # Provided with core anyway ^Config$
# Perl&rsquo;s own config, not shipped separately
^ExtUtils::MakeMaker$ # Shipped with perl, recent versions #
have bug 14721 (see rt.cpan.org) ^ExtUtils::Install$ # Part
of of EU::MM, same reason</p>

<p>Built-In Ban list You can use this list of regexes to
disable building of these modules altogether.</p>

<p>Toggle it by supplying the &quot;--default-banlist&quot;
option.</p>

<p>^GD$ # Needs c libaries ^Berk.*DB # DB packages require
specific options &amp; linking ^DBD:: # DBD drives require
database files/headers ^XML:: # XML modules usually require
