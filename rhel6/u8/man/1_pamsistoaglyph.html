<p>NAME pamsistoaglyph - convert a single-image stereogram
to a red/cyan anaglyphic image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamsistoaglyph [--invert] [--sep=number]
[--minsep=number] [--gray=num- ber] [in_netpbmfile</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use either white space or an equals sign
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamsistoaglyph reads a Netpbm image as input and
produces a Netpbm image as output.</p>

<p>pamsistoaglyph takes a single-image stereogram (SIS)
such as those pro- duced by &lt;a href=
&quot;http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pamstere-
ogram.html&quot;&gt;pamstereogram&lt;/a&gt; and converts it
to a red/cyan anaglyphic image such as those produced by
ppm3d(1). Many people have trouble tricking their eyes into
focusing beyond the image in front of them and are therefore
unable to perceive the 3-D shape hidden within a single-
image stereogram. Anaglyphic stereograms are easier to
perceive in 3-D but require a pair of red/cyan glasses such
as those often used to watch 3-D movies. The goal of
pamsistoaglyph is to help people who have trouble viewing
single-image stereograms see the intriguing 3-D effect.</p>

<p>pamsistoaglyph can convert single-image random-dot
stereograms (SIRDS), wallpaper stereograms, and even
dual-image stereograms to anaglyphic images.</p>

<p>OPTIONS For most images, no command-line options need to
be specified. The fol- lowing options are available,
however, for unusual circumstances:</p>

<p>--invert Swap the left- and right-eye images.
pamsistoaglyph assumes that its input represents a wall-eyed
stereogram and generates the anaglyphic image accordingly.
If the generated image appears to recede into the page where
it should pop out of the page (and vice versa), this
typically implies that the input image represents a
cross-eyed stereogram. Use --invert to correct the image
depth.</p>

<p>--sep=number Specify the distance in pixels between the
left- and right-eye images. Essentially, this corresponds to
the distance between repetitions of the background pattern.
The --sep option should rarely be necessary as
pamsistoaglyph is fairly good at determining automatically
the eye-separation distance.</p>

<p>--minsep=number This option is similar to --sep but
constrains pamsistoaglyph only to a minimum eye-separation
distance. Any distance larger than number is acceptable. The
--minsep option should rarely be necessary as pamsistoaglyph
is fairly good at determining automatically the
eye-separation distance. The default value for the minimum
eye-separation distance is 10% of the image width; this
value seems to work well in practice.</p>

<p>--gray=number Limit the number of gray levels to use
when searching for the optimal eye-separation distance.
Because pamsistoaglyph looks for repeated patterns, it is
vulnerable to being confused by slight variations in color.
By reducing the input image to grayscale and capping the
number of gray levels, pamsistoaglyph ameliorates the
effects of unintentional color variations (such as those
caused by con- version from a low-quality JPEG image, for
example). The default of 63 seems to work well so the --gray
option should rarely be necessary.</p>

<p>NOTES The registration algorithm used by pamsistoaglyph
was developed specif- ically for this program. As far as the
author knows, there are no existing algorithms for
converting stereograms to anaglyphs. The algo- rithm works
as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; Convert the image to grayscale to increase the
ability to iden- tify matches.</p>

<p>&middot; Count the number of pixels that match N pixels
ahead in the image for all N in [1, width/2].</p>

<p>&middot; Maintain a running mean (&amp;mu;) and standard
deviation (&amp;sigma;) of the number of matched pixels.</p>

<p>&middot; Store the N corresponding to each spike in the
number of matched pixels. A spike is defined as a tally that
exceeds the mean plus one, two, or three standard
deviations. Only the first spike of a given
standard-deviation multiplier is stored.</p>

<p>&middot; If a tally greater than &amp;mu;+3&amp;sigma;
was encountered, return the corresponding N. If not, then if
a tally greater than &amp;mu;+2&amp;sigma; was encountered,
return the corresponding N. If not, then if a tally greater
than &amp;mu;+&amp;sigma; was encountered, return the
corresponding N. If not, then return the N that produces the
minimum average distance between matched pixels (i.e.,
#matches divided by #pixels). If no such N exceeds the
minimum allowable eye-separation value, return zero to
indicate failure.</p>

<p>&middot; If the algorithm returned zero, rerun the
algorithm indepen- dently on each row of the input image and
return the median of all N that exceed the minimum allowable
eye-separation value. If no such N exists, abort with an
error message.</p>
