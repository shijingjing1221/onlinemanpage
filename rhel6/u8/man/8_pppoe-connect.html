<p>NAME pppoe-connect - Shell script to manage a PPPoE
link</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pppoe-connect [config_file]</p>

<p>pppoe-connect interface user [config_file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pppoe-connect is a shell script which
manages a PPPoE connection using the Roaring Penguin
user-space PPPoE client. If you omit config_file, the
default file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ppp0 is
used. If you supply interface and user, then they override
the Ethernet inter- face and user-name settings in the
configuration file.</p>

<p>Note that normally, you should not invoke pppoe-connect
directly. Instead, use pppoe-start to bring up the PPPoE
connection.</p>

<p>pppoe-connect first reads a configuration file. It then
brings up a PPPoE connection. If the connection ever drops,
a message is logged to syslog, and pppoe-connect
re-establishes the connection. In addition, each time the
connection is dropped or cannot be established, pppoe-
connect executes the script /etc/ppp/pppoe-lost if it exists
and is executable.</p>

<p>The shell script pppoe-stop causes pppoe-connect to
break out of its loop, bring the connection down, and
exit.</p>

<p>TECHNICAL DETAILS pppoe-connect uses the following shell
variables from the configuration file:</p>

<p>ETH The Ethernet interface connected to the DSL modem
(for example, eth0).</p>

<p>USER The PPPoE user-id (for example,
b1xxnxnx@sympatico.ca).</p>

<p>PIDFILE A file in which to write the process-ID of the
pppoe-connect process (for example, /var/run/pppoe.pid). Two
additional files ($PIDFILE.pppd and $PIDFILE.pppoe) hold the
process-IDs of the pppd and pppoe processes,
respectively.</p>

<p>By using different configuration files with different
PIDFILE settings, you can manage multiple PPPoE connections.
Just specify the configura- tion file as an argument to
pppoe-start and pppoe-stop.</p>
