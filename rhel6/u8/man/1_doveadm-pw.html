<p>NAME doveadm-pw - Dovecot&rsquo;s password hash
generator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS doveadm [-Dv] pw -l doveadm [-Dv] pw [-p
password] [-r rounds] [-s scheme] [-u user] [-V]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION doveadm pw is used to generate password
hashes for different password schemes and optionally verify
the generated hash.</p>

<p>All generated password hashes have a {scheme} prefix,
for example {SHA512-CRYPT.HEX}. All passdbs have a default
scheme for passwords stored without the {scheme} prefix. The
default scheme can be overrid- den by storing the password
with the scheme prefix.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Global doveadm(1) options:</p>

<p>-D Enables verbosity and debug messages.</p>

<p>-v Enables verbosity, including progress counter.</p>

<p>Command specific options:</p>

<p>-l List all supported password schemes and exit
successfully. There are up to three optional password
schemes: BLF-CRYPT (Blowfish crypt), SHA256-CRYPT and
SHA512-CRYPT. Their avail- ability depends on the
system&rsquo;s currently used libc.</p>

<p>-p password The plain text password for which the hash
should be generated. If no password was given doveadm(1)
will prompt interactively for one.</p>

<p>-r rounds The password schemes BLF-CRYPT, SHA256-CRYPT
and SHA512-CRYPT supports a variable number of encryption
rounds. The following table shows the minimum/maximum number
of encryption rounds per scheme. When the -r option was
omitted the default number of encryption rounds will be
applied.</p>

<p>Scheme | Minimum | Maximum | Default
---------------------------------------------- BLF-CRYPT | 4
| 31 | 5 SHA256-CRYPT | 1000 | 999999999 | 5000 SHA512-CRYPT
| 1000 | 999999999 | 5000</p>

<p>-s scheme The password scheme which should be used to
generate the hashed password. By default the CRAM-MD5 scheme
will be used. It is also possible to append an encoding
suffix to the scheme. Sup- ported encoding suffixes are:
.b64, .base64 and .hex. See also
http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Authentication/PasswordSchemes for
more details about password schemes.</p>

<p>-u user When the DIGEST-MD5 scheme is used, also the
user name must be given, because the user name is a part of
the generated hash. For more information about Digest-MD5
please read also:
http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Authentication/Mechanisms/DigestMD5</p>

<p>-V When this option is given, the hashed password will
be inter- nally verified. The result of the verification
will be shown after the hashed password, enclosed in
parenthesis.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The first password hash is a DIGEST-MD5 hash for
jane.roe@example.com. The second password hash is a CRAM-MD5
hash for john.doe@example.com.</p>

<p>doveadm pw -s digest-md5 -u jane.roe@example.com Enter
new password: Retype new password:
{DIGEST-MD5}9b9dcb4466233a9307bbc33708dffda0 doveadm pw
Enter new password: Retype new password:
{CRAM-MD5}913331d8782236a8ecba7764a63aa27b26437fd40ca878d887f11d81245c2c6b</p>
