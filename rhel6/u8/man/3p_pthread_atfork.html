<p>PTHREAD_ATFORK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_ATFORK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_atfork - register fork handlers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_atfork(void (*prepare)(void), void
(*parent)(void), void (*child)(void));</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_atfork() function shall declare
fork handlers to be called before and after fork(), in the
context of the thread that called fork(). The prepare fork
handler shall be called before fork() process- ing
commences. The parent fork handle shall be called after
fork() pro- cessing completes in the parent process. The
child fork handler shall be called after fork() processing
completes in the child process. If no handling is desired at
one or more of these three points, the corre- sponding fork
handler address(es) may be set to NULL.</p>

<p>The order of calls to pthread_atfork() is significant.
The parent and child fork handlers shall be called in the
order in which they were established by calls to
pthread_atfork(). The prepare fork handlers shall be called
in the opposite order.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion,
pthread_atfork() shall return a value of zero; otherwise, an
error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_atfork() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient table space exists to record the
fork handler addresses.</p>

<p>The pthread_atfork() function shall not return an error
code of [EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE There are at least two serious problems with
the semantics of fork() in a multi-threaded program. One
problem has to do with state (for exam- ple, memory) covered
by mutexes. Consider the case where one thread has a mutex
locked and the state covered by that mutex is inconsistent
while another thread calls fork(). In the child, the mutex
is in the locked state (locked by a nonexistent thread and
thus can never be unlocked). Having the child simply
reinitialize the mutex is unsatisfactory since this approach
does not resolve the question about how to correct or
otherwise deal with the inconsistent state in the child.</p>

<p>It is suggested that programs that use fork() call an
exec function very soon afterwards in the child process,
thus resetting all states. In the meantime, only a short
list of async-signal-safe library rou- tines are promised to
be available.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this solution does not address the needs
of multi- threaded libraries. Application programs may not
be aware that a multi- threaded library is in use, and they
feel free to call any number of library routines between the
fork() and exec calls, just as they always have. Indeed,
they may be extant single-threaded programs and cannot,
therefore, be expected to obey new restrictions imposed by
the threads library.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the multi-threaded library needs a
way to protect its internal state during fork() in case it
is re-entered later in the child process. The problem arises
especially in multi-threaded I/O libraries, which are almost
sure to be invoked between the fork() and exec calls to
effect I/O redirection. The solution may require locking
mutex variables during fork(), or it may entail simply
resetting the state in the child after the fork() processing
completes.</p>

<p>The pthread_atfork() function provides multi-threaded
libraries with a means to protect themselves from innocent
application programs that call fork(), and it provides
multi-threaded application programs with a standard
mechanism for protecting themselves from fork() calls in a
library routine or the application itself.</p>

<p>The expected usage is that the prepare handler acquires
all mutex locks and the other two fork handlers release
them.</p>

<p>For example, an application can supply a prepare routine
that acquires the necessary mutexes the library maintains
and supply child and parent routines that release those
mutexes, thus ensuring that the child gets a consistent
snapshot of the state of the library (and that no mutexes
are left stranded). Alternatively, some libraries might be
able to supply just a child routine that reinitializes the
mutexes in the library and all associated states to some
known value (for example, what it was when the image was
originally executed).</p>

<p>When fork() is called, only the calling thread is
duplicated in the child process. Synchronization variables
remain in the same state in the child as they were in the
parent at the time fork() was called. Thus, for example,
mutex locks may be held by threads that no longer exist in
the child process, and any associated states may be
inconsis- tent. The parent process may avoid this by
explicit code that acquires and releases locks critical to
the child via pthread_atfork(). In addition, any critical
threads need to be recreated and reinitialized to the proper
state in the child (also via pthread_atfork()).</p>

<p>A higher-level package may acquire locks on its own data
structures before invoking lower-level packages. Under this
scenario, the order specified for fork handler calls allows
a simple rule of initialization for avoiding package
deadlock: a package initializes all packages on which it
depends before it calls the pthread_atfork() function for
itself.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
