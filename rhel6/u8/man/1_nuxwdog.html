<p>NUXWDOG(1) PKI Tools NUXWDOG(1)</p>

<p>NAME nuxwdog - Provides a simple watchdog process that
can be used to start, stop, monitor, or reconfigure a server
process.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nuxwdog -f configuration_file [-i]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION nuxwdog is a watchdog daemon that builds on
the uxwdog service that is part of the Netscape Enterprise
Server (NES). nuxwdog can start, stop, monitor, and
reconfigure server programs, depending on the parameters
passed to it in its configuration file. nuxwdog opens a Unix
domain socket to accept requests from any server process it
is managing. Optionally, nuxwdog can be configured to
communicate only with clients that are descendants of the
nuxwdog process, limiting an avenue of potential access to
any servers managed by the watchdog.</p>

<p>Some servers require a high-level of security to protect
their data or operations, which means (for example) that
they cannot store plaintext passwords in a password file to
allow the server to be started automatically. nuxwdog can be
configured to prompt for server passwords when a server
first starts and then caches those passwords so that nuxwdog
can restart the server without intervention if the server
crashes.</p>

<p>To make it easy for clients to communicate with nuxwdog,
a C/C++ shared library is provided with the nuxwdog source
code (libnuxwdog.so). Additionally, nuxwdog provides JNI
interfaces and Perl bindings to the libnuxwdog.so library,
so that calls can be made from Java and Perl programs. For
more information on this library and the client interfaces,
see https://fedorahosted.org/nuxwdog/wiki/HOWTO.</p>

<p>nuxwdog is used by Dogtag PKI to monitor and manage the
subsystem server processes for Java, Tomcat, and Apache
servers.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f configuration_file Passes the configuration
file for the service which runs the subsystem. With Dogtag
PKI. For the CA, OCSP, TKS, and DRM, this is for the Java
process. For the TPS, this is for the Apache process.</p>

<p>-i Runs the nuxwdog process in interactive mode and
keeps nuxwdog open in the foreground instead of running it
as a daemon in the background.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE PARAMETERS AND EXAMPLES ExeFile Gives
the full path to the executable to be started.</p>

<p>ExeArgs Passes any arguments to the executable. The
first argument must be the full path to the executable (the
same as the value in ExeFile).</p>

<p>TmpDir Gives the full path to the executable to be
started.</p>

<p>ChildSecurity Sets whether the child server process
should only allow requests from a parent (where nuxwdog is
the parent). nuxwdog checks the process ID for any client
which sends a request to the Unix domain socket and drops
any message where the client is not a descendant of the
nuxwdog process. To allow any request, set this to 0; to
allow only parent or ancestor requests, sets this to 1.</p>

<p>ExeOut Gives the file to write stdout for the server to
be started.</p>

<p>ExeErr Gives the file to write stderr for the server to
be started.</p>

<p>ExeBackground Sets whether to run the server and the
nuxwdog processes in the background in daemon mode after the
watchdog is initialized. Setting this to 1 enables daemon
mode, while 0 keeps this in the foreground.</p>

<p>PidFile Gives the PID file to use to store the nuxwdog
PID.</p>

<p>ChildPidFile Gives the PID file to use to store the PID
of the server process managed by nuxwdog.</p>

<p>ExeContext Sets the SELinux context in which to start
the server process.</p>

<p>nuxwdog can be used to manage many types of server
processes. For Dogtag PKI, it manages Java, Tomcat, and
Apache servers. For the Dogtag PKI Certificate Authority, a
Java-based subsystem with a Tomcat web service, the
configuration file identifies the appropriate JRE and class
paths, along with setting the output, error, and PID files.
(The ExeArgs argument should be all on one line.)</p>

<p>For Dogtag PKI, the Token (smart card) Processing System
uses an Apache-based server. This example also sets the
SELinux context, pki_tps_t, used by the TPS subsystem
processes.</p>
