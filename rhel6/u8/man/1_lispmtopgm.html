<p>NAME lispmtopgm - convert a Lisp Machine bitmap file to
PGM</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lispmtopgm [lispmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>listpmfile reads a Lisp Machine bitmap as input and
produces a PGM image as output.</p>

<p>This is the file format written by the
tv:write-bit-array-file function on TI Explorer and
Symbolics lisp machines.</p>

<p>Multi-plane bitmaps on lisp machines are color; but the
Lispm image file format does not include a color map, so we
must treat it as a monochrome instead and produce PGM. This
is unfortunate.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pgmtolispm(1), pgm(1)</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The Lispm bitmap file format is a bit
quirky; Usually the image in the file has its width rounded
up to the next higher multiple of 32, but not always. If the
width is not a multiple of 32, we dont deal with it
properly, but because of the Lispm microcode, such arrays
are proba- bly not image data anyway.</p>

<p>Also, the Lispm code for saving bitmaps has a bug, in
that if you are writing a bitmap which is not mod32 across,
the file may be up to 7 bits too short! They round down
instead of up, and we dont handle this bug gracefully.</p>
