<p>BIO_ALLOC(9) The Linux VFS BIO_ALLOC(9)</p>

<p>NAME bio_alloc - allocate a new bio, memory pool
backed</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct bio * bio_alloc(gfp_t gfp_mask, int
nr_iovecs);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gfp_mask allocation mask to use</p>

<p>nr_iovecs number of iovecs</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION bio_alloc will allocate a bio and associated
bio_vec array that can hold at least nr_iovecs entries.
Allocations will be done from the fs_bio_set. Also see
bio_alloc_bioset and bio_kmalloc.</p>

<p>If __GFP_WAIT is set, then bio_alloc will always be able
to allocate a bio. This is due to the mempool guarantees. To
make this work, callers must never allocate more than 1 bio
at a time from this pool. Callers that need to allocate more
than 1 bio must always submit the previously allocated bio
for IO before attempting to allocate a new one. Failure to
do so can cause livelocks under memory pressure.</p>

<p>RETURNS Pointer to new bio on success, NULL on
failure.</p>
