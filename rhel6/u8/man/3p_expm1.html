<p>EXPM1(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual EXPM1(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME expm1, expm1f, expm1l - compute exponential
functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double expm1(double x); float expm1f(float x); long
double expm1l(long double x);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall compute e**x-1.0.</p>

<p>An application wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to zero and call
feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an
error has occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
return e**x-1.0.</p>

<p>If the correct value would cause overflow, a range error
shall occur and expm1(), expm1f(), and expm1l() shall return
the value of the macro HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, and HUGE_VALL,
respectively.</p>

<p>If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.</p>

<p>If x is &plusmn;0, &plusmn;0 shall be returned.</p>

<p>If x is -Inf, -1 shall be returned.</p>

<p>If x is +Inf, x shall be returned.</p>

<p>If x is subnormal, a range error may occur and x should
be returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>Range Error The result overflows.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
[ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the overflow
floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>These functions may fail if:</p>

<p>Range Error The value of x is subnormal.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
[ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the underflow
floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The value of expm1(x) may be more
accurate than exp(x)-1.0 for small values of x.</p>

<p>The expm1() and log1p() functions are useful for
financial calculations of ((1+x)**n-1)/x, namely:</p>

<p>expm1(n * log1p(x))/x</p>

<p>when x is very small (for example, when calculating
small daily inter- est rates). These functions also simplify
writing accurate inverse hyperbolic functions.</p>

<p>For IEEE Std 754-1985 double, 709.8 &lt; x implies
expm1( x) has over- flowed.</p>

<p>On error, the expressions (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) are
independent of each other, but at least one of them must be
non-zero.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
