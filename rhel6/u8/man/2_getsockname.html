<p>GETSOCKNAME(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
GETSOCKNAME(2)</p>

<p>NAME getsockname - get socket name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getsockname(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr,
socklen_t *addrlen);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION getsockname() returns the current address to
which the socket sockfd is bound, in the buffer pointed to
by addr. The addrlen argument should be initialized to
indicate the amount of space (in bytes) pointed to by addr.
On return it contains the actual size of the socket
address.</p>

<p>The returned address is truncated if the buffer provided
is too small; in this case, addrlen will return a value
greater than was supplied to the call.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF The argument sockfd is not a valid
descriptor.</p>

<p>EFAULT The addr argument points to memory not in a valid
part of the process address space.</p>

<p>EINVAL addrlen is invalid (e.g., is negative).</p>

<p>ENOBUFS Insufficient resources were available in the
system to perform the operation.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The argument sockfd is a file, not a
socket.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.4BSD (the getsockname() function
call appeared in 4.2BSD), POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES The third argument of getsockname() is in reality
an int * (and this is what 4.x BSD and libc4 and libc5
have). Some POSIX confusion resulted in the present
socklen_t, also used by glibc. See also accept(2).</p>
