libtalloc_bestpractices(3)</p>

<p>NAME libtalloc_bestpractices - Chapter 7: Best practises
The following sections contain several best practices and
good manners that were found by the Samba and SSSD
developers over the years.</p>

<p>These will help you to write code which is better,
easier to debug and with as few (hopefully none) memory
leaks as possible.</p>

<p>Keep the context hierarchy steady The talloc is a
hierarchy memory allocator. The hierarchy nature is what
makes the programming more error proof. It makes the memory
easier to manage and to free. Therefore, the first thing we
should have on our mind is: always project your data
structures into the talloc context hierarchy.</p>

<p>That means if we have a structure, we should always use
it as a parent context for its elements. This way we will
not encounter any troubles when freeing the structure or
when changing its parent. The same rule applies for
arrays.</p>

<p>For example, the structure user from section Hierarchy
of talloc context should be created with the context
hierarchy illustrated on the next image.</p>

<p>Every function should use its own context It is a good
practice to create a temporary talloc context at the
function beginning and free the context just before the
return statement. All the data must be allocated on this
context or on its children. This ensures that no memory
leaks are created as long as we do not forget to free the
temporary context.</p>

<p>This pattern applies to both situations - when a
function does not return any dynamically allocated value and
when it does. However, it needs a little extension for the
latter case.</p>

<p>Functions that do not return any dynamically allocated
value</p>

<p>If the function does not return any value created on the
heap, we will just obey the aforementioned pattern.</p>

<p>int bar() { int ret; TALLOC_CTX *tmp_ctx =
talloc_new(NULL); if (tmp_ctx == NULL) { ret = ENOMEM; goto
done; } /* allocate data on tmp_ctx or on its descendants */
ret = EOK; done: talloc_free(tmp_ctx); return ret; }</p>

<p>Functions returning dynamically allocated values If our
function returns any dynamically allocated data, its first
parameter should always be the destination talloc context.
This context serves as a parent for the output values. But
again, we will create the output values as the descendants
of the temporary context. If everything goes well, we will
change the parent of the output values from the temporary to
the destination talloc context.</p>

<p>This pattern ensures that if an error occurs (e.g. I/O
error or insufficient amount of the memory), all allocated
data is freed and no garbage appears on the destination
context.</p>

<p>int struct_foo_init(TALLOC_CTX *mem_ctx, struct foo
**_foo) { int ret; struct foo *foo = NULL; TALLOC_CTX
*tmp_ctx = talloc_new(NULL); if (tmp_ctx == NULL) { ret =
ENOMEM; goto done; } foo = talloc_zero(tmp_ctx, struct foo);
/* ... */ *_foo = talloc_steal(mem_ctx, foo); ret = EOK;
done: talloc_free(tmp_ctx); return ret; }</p>

<p>Allocate temporary contexts on NULL As it can be seen on
the previous listing, instead of allocating the temporary
context directly on mem_ctx, we created a new top level
context using NULL as the parameter for talloc_new()
function. Take a look at the following example:</p>

<p>char *create_user_filter(TALLOC_CTX *mem_ctx, uid_t uid,
const char *username) { char *filter = NULL; char
*sanitized_username = NULL; /* tmp_ctx is a child of mem_ctx
*/ TALLOC_CTX *tmp_ctx = talloc_new(mem_ctx); if (tmp_ctx ==
NULL) { return NULL; }</p>

<p>sanitized_username = sanitize_string(tmp_ctx, username);
if (sanitized_username == NULL) { talloc_free(tmp_ctx);
return NULL; }</p>

<p>filter = talloc_aprintf(tmp_ctx,(|(uid=%llu)(uname=%s)),
uid, sanitized_username); if (filter == NULL) { return NULL;
/* tmp_ctx is not freed */ (*@el{lst:tmp-ctx-3:leak}@*)
}</p>

<p>/* filter becomes a child of mem_ctx */ filter =
talloc_steal(mem_ctx, filter); talloc_free(tmp_ctx); return
filter; }</p>

<p>We forgot to free tmp_ctx before the return statement in
the filter == NULL condition. However, it is created as a
child of mem_ctx context and as such it will be freed as
soon as the mem_ctx is freed. Therefore, no detectable
memory leak is created.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we do not have any way to access the
allocated data and for all we know mem_ctx may exist for the
lifetime of our application. For these reasons this should
be considered as a memory leak. How can we detect if it is
unreferenced but still attached to its parent context? The
only way is to notice the mistake in the source code.</p>

<p>But if we create the temporary context as a top level
context, it will not be freed and memory diagnostic tools
(e.g. valgrind) are able to do their job.</p>

<p>Temporary contexts and the talloc pool If we want to
take the advantage of the talloc pool but also keep to the
pattern introduced in the previous section, we are unable to
do it directly. The best thing to do is to create a
conditional build where we can decide how do we want to
create the temporary context. For example, we can create the
following macros:</p>

<p>#ifdef USE_POOL_CONTEXT #define CREATE_POOL_CTX(ctx,
size) talloc_pool(ctx, size) #define CREATE_TMP_CTX(ctx)
talloc_new(ctx) #else #define CREATE_POOL_CTX(ctx, size)
talloc_new(ctx) #define CREATE_TMP_CTX(ctx) talloc_new(NULL)
#endif</p>

<p>Now if our application is under development, we will
build it with macro USE_POOL_CONTEXT undefined. This way, we
can use memory diagnostic utilities to detect memory
leaks.</p>

<p>The release version will be compiled with the macro
defined. This will enable pool contexts and therefore reduce
the malloc() calls, which will end up in a little bit faster
processing.</p>

<p>int struct_foo_init(TALLOC_CTX *mem_ctx, struct foo
**_foo) { int ret; struct foo *foo = NULL; TALLOC_CTX
*tmp_ctx = CREATE_TMP_CTX(mem_ctx); /* ... */ }</p>

<p>errno_t handle_request(TALLOC_CTX mem_ctx) { int ret;
struct foo *foo = NULL; TALLOC_CTX *pool_ctx =
CREATE_POOL_CTX(NULL, 1024); ret = struct_foo_init(mem_ctx,
&amp;foo); /* ... */ }</p>
