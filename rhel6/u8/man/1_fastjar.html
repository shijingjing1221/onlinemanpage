<p>NAME fastjar - archive tool for Java archives</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fastjar -ctxu [OPTIONS] [jar-file]
[manifest-file] [-C dir] files...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;fastjar&quot; is an implementation of
Suns jar utility that comes with the JDK, written entirely
in C, and runs in a fraction of the time while being feature
compatible.</p>

<p>If any file is a directory then it is processed
recursively. The manifest file name and the archive file
name needs to be specified in the same order the -m and -f
flags are specified.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Exactly one of the following actions must be
specified:</p>

<p>-c Create new archive.</p>

<p>-t List table of contents for archive.</p>

<p>-x Extract named (or all) files from archive.</p>

<p>-u Update existing archive.</p>

<p>The following parameters are optional:</p>

<p>-@ Read the names of the files to add to the archive
from stdin. This option is supported only in combination
with -c or -u. Non standard option added in the GCC
version.</p>

<p>-C directory Change to the directory and include the
following file.</p>

<p>-E Prevent fastjar from reading the content of a
directory when specifying one (and instead relying on the
provided list of files to populate the archive with regard
to the directory entry). Non standard option added in the
GCC version.</p>

<p>-M Do not create a manifest file for the entries.</p>

<p>-i Generate an index of the packages in this jar and its
Class-Path.</p>

<p>-J All options starting with -J are ignored.</p>

<p>-0 Store only; use no ZIP compression.</p>

<p>-V --version Display version information.</p>

<p>-f archive Specify archive file name.</p>

<p>-m manifest Include manifest information from specified
manifest file.</p>

<p>-v Generate verbose output on standard output.</p>

<p>Parameters of the form @option{@}FILE are considered to
be names of files, and are expanded with the contents of the
file.</p>

<p>All remaining options are considered to be names of
files.</p>
