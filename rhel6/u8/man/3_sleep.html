<p>SLEEP(3) Linux Programmer s Manual SLEEP(3)</p>

<p>NAME sleep - Sleep for the specified number of
seconds</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>unsigned int sleep(unsigned int seconds);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sleep() makes the calling process sleep
until seconds seconds have elapsed or a signal arrives which
is not ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Zero if the requested time has elapsed, or
the number of seconds left to sleep, if the call was
interrupted by a signal handler.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>BUGS sleep() may be implemented using SIGALRM; mixing
calls to alarm(2) and sleep() is a bad idea.</p>

<p>Using longjmp(3) from a signal handler or modifying the
handling of SIGALRM while sleeping will cause undefined
results.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO alarm(2), signal(2), signal(7)</p>
