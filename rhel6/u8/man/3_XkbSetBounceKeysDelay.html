<p>XkbSetBounceKeysDelay(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbSetBounceKeysDelay(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbSetBounceKeysDelay - Sets the BounceKeys delay
for a keyboard device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Bool XkbSetBounceKeysDelay (Display *display,
unsigned int device_spec, unsigned int *delay);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - display connection to X server</p>

<p>- device_spec device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd</p>

<p>- delay backfilled with bounce keys delay, ms</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The server can generate XkbAccessXNotify
events for some of the global keyboard controls. The detail
field describes what AccessX event just occurred and can be
any of the values in Table 1.</p>

<p>Table 1 AccessXNotify Events
-------------------------------------------------------------
detail Reason
-------------------------------------------------------------
XkbAXN_SKPress A key was pressed when SlowKeys was enabled.
XkbAXN_SKAccept A key was accepted (held longer than the
SlowKeys delay). XkbAXN_SKRelease An accepted SlowKeys key
was released. XkbAXN_SKReject A key was rejected (released
before the SlowKeys delay expired). XkbAXN_BKAccept A key
was accepted by BounceKeys. XkbAXN_BKReject A key was
rejected (pressed before the BounceKeys delay expired).
XkbAXN_AXKWarning AccessXKeys is about to turn on/off
StickyKeys or BounceKeys.</p>

<p>The keycode field reports the keycode of the key for
which the event occurred. If the action is related to
SlowKeys, the slowKeysDelay field contains the current
SlowKeys acceptance delay. If the action is related to
BounceKeys, the debounceDelay field contains the current
BounceKeys debounce delay.</p>

<p>Selecting for AccessX Events</p>

<p>To receive XkbAccessXNotify events under all possible
conditions, use XkbSelectEvents and pass XkbAccesXNotifyMask
in both bits_to_change and values_for_bits.</p>

<p>To receive XkbStateNotify events only under certain
conditions, use XkbSelectEventDetails using XkbAccessXNotify
as the event_type and specifying the desired state changes
in bits_to_change and val- ues_for_bits using mask bits from
Table 2.</p>

<p>Table 2 AccessXNotify Event Details
-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>XkbAccessXNotify Event Details Value Circumstances
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
XkbAXN_SKPressMask (1&lt;&lt;0) Slow key press notification
wanted XkbAXN_SKAcceptMask (1&lt;&lt;1) Slow key accept
notification wanted XkbAXN_SKRejectMask (1&lt;&lt;2) Slow
key reject notification wanted XkbAXN_SKReleaseMask
(1&lt;&lt;3) Slow key release notification wanted
XkbAXN_BKAcceptMask (1&lt;&lt;4) Bounce key accept
notification wanted XkbAXN_BKRejectMask (1&lt;&lt;5) Bounce
key reject notification wanted XkbAXN_AXKWarningMask
(1&lt;&lt;6) AccessX warning notification wanted
XkbAllAccessXEventsMask (0x7f) All AccessX features
notifica- tions wanted</p>

<p>Some users may accidentally &quot;bounce&quot; on a key
when they release it. They press it once, then accidentally
press it again after they release it. The BounceKeys control
temporarily disables a key after it has been pressed,
effectively &quot;debouncing&quot; the keyboard. The period
of time the key is disabled after it is released is known as
the BounceKeys delay. BounceKeys is a boolean control.</p>

<p>When the BounceKeys control is active, the server
reports acceptance or rejection of any key to interested
clients by sending an appropriate AccessXNotify event.</p>

<p>XkbSetBounceKeysDelay sends a request to configure the
BounceKeys con- trol to the server. It does not wait for a
reply and normally returns True. Specifying a value of zero
for the delay parameter causes XkbSet- BounceKeysDelay to
generate a BadValue protocol error. If a compatible version
of the Xkb extension is not available in the server, XkbSet-
BounceKeysDelay returns False.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES True The XkbSetBounceKeysDelay function
returns True when it sends a request to configure the
BounceKeys control to the server.</p>

<p>False The XkbSetBounceKeysDelay function returns False
if a compatible version of the Xkb extension is not
available in the server.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structure for the XkbAccessXNotify event
type is as follows:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; / Xkb extension base event
code */ unsigned long serial; / X server serial number for
event */ Bool send_event; / True =&gt; synthetically
generated */ Display * display; / server connection where
event generated */ Time time; / server time when event
generated */ int xkb_type; / XkbAccessXNotify */ int device;
/ Xkb device ID, will not be XkbUseCoreKbd */ int detail; /
XkbAXN_* */ KeyCode keycode; / key of event */ int
slowKeysDelay; / current SlowKeys delay */ int
debounceDelay; / current debounce delay */ }
XkbAccessXNotifyEvent;</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadValue An argument is out of range</p>
