<p>STANDARDS(7) Linux Programmer s Manual STANDARDS(7)</p>

<p>NAME standards - C and UNIX Standards</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The CONFORMING TO section that appears in
many manual pages identifies various standards to which the
documented interface conforms. The fol- lowing list briefly
describes these standards.</p>

<p>V7 Version 7, the ancestral UNIX from Bell Labs.</p>

<p>4.2BSD This is an implementation standard defined by the
4.2 release of the Berkeley Software Distribution, released
by the University of California at Berkeley. This was the
first Berkeley release that contained a TCP/IP stack and the
sockets API. 4.2BSD was released in 1983.</p>

<p>Earlier major BSD releases included 3BSD (1980), 4BSD
(1980), and 4.1BSD (1981).</p>

<p>4.3BSD The successor to 4.2BSD, released in 1986.</p>

<p>4.4BSD The successor to 4.3BSD, released in 1993. This
was the last major Berkeley release.</p>

<p>System V This is an implementation standard defined by
AT&amp;Ts milestone 1983 release of its commercial System V
(five) release. The previous major AT&amp;T release was
System III, released in 1981.</p>

<p>System V release 2 (SVr2) This was the next System V
release, made in 1985. The SVr2 was formally described in
the System V Interface Definition version 1 (SVID 1)
published in 1985.</p>

<p>System V release 3 (SVr3) This was the successor to
SVr2, released in 1986. This release was formally described
in the System V Interface Definition ver- sion 2 (SVID
2).</p>

<p>System V release 4 (SVr4) This was the successor to
SVr3, released in 1989. This version of System V is
described in the &quot;Programmer s Reference Manual:
Operating System API (Intel processors)&quot; (Prentice-Hall
1992, ISBN 0-13-951294-2) This release was formally
described in the System V Interface Definition version 3
(SVID 3), and is consid- ered the definitive System V
release.</p>

<p>SVID 4 System V Interface Definition version 4, issued
in 1995. Avail- able online at
http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/ .</p>

<p>C89 This was the first C language standard, ratified by
ANSI (Ameri- can National Standards Institute) in 1989
(X3.159-1989). Some- times this is known as ANSI C, but
since C99 is also an ANSI standard, this term is ambiguous.
This standard was also rati- fied by ISO (International
Standards Organization) in 1990 (ISO/IEC 9899:1990), and is
thus occasionally referred to as ISO C90.</p>

<p>C99 This revision of the C language standard was
ratified by ISO in 1999 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999). Available
online at http://www.open-
std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-1990 &quot;Portable Operating System Interface
for Computing Environ- ments&quot;. IEEE 1003.1-1990 part 1,
ratified by ISO in 1990 (ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990). The term
&quot;POSIX&quot; was coined by Richard Stallman.</p>

<p>POSIX.2 IEEE Std 1003.2-1992, describing commands and
utilities, rati- fied by ISO in 1993 (ISO/IEC
9945-2:1993).</p>

<p>POSIX.1b (formerly known as POSIX.4) IEEE Std
1003.1b-1993 describing real-time facilities for portable
operating systems, ratified by ISO in 1996 (ISO/IEC
9945-1:1996).</p>

<p>POSIX.1c IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995 describing the POSIX
threads interfaces.</p>

<p>POSIX.1d IEEE Std 1003.1c-1999 describing additional
real-time exten- sions.</p>

<p>POSIX.1g IEEE Std 1003.1g-2000 describing networking
APIs (including sockets).</p>

<p>POSIX.1j IEEE Std 1003.1j-2000 describing advanced
real-time extensions.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-1996 A 1996 revision of POSIX.1 which
incorporated POSIX.1b and POSIX.1c.</p>

<p>XPG3 Released in 1989, this was the first significant
release of the X/Open Portability Guide, produced by the
X/Open Company, a multi-vendor consortium. This multi-volume
guide was based on the POSIX standards.</p>

<p>XPG4 A revision of the X/Open Portability Guide,
released in 1992.</p>

<p>XPG4v2 A 1994 revision of XPG4. This is also referred to
as Spec 1170, where 1170 referred to the number of
interfaces defined by this standard.</p>

<p>SUS (SUSv1) Single UNIX Specification. This was a
repackaging of XPG4v2 and other X/Open standards (X/Open
Curses Issue 4 version 2, X/Open Networking Service (XNS)
Issue 4). Systems conforming to this standard can be branded
UNIX 95.</p>

<p>SUSv2 Single UNIX Specification version 2. Sometimes
also referred to as XPG5. This standard appeared in 1997.
Systems conforming to this standard can be branded UNIX 98.
See also http://www.UNIX- systems.org/version2/ .)</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001, SUSv3 This was a 2001 revision and
consolidation of the POSIX.1, POSIX.2, and SUS standards
into a single document, conducted under the auspices of the
Austin group (http://www.open- group.org/austin/ .) The
standard is available online at
http://www.unix-systems.org/version3/ , and the interfaces
that it describes are also available in the Linux manual
pages pack- age under sections 1p and 3p (e.g., &quot;man 3p
open&quot;).</p>

<p>The standard defines two levels of conformance: POSIX
confor- mance, which is a baseline set of interfaces
required of a conforming system; and XSI Conformance, which
additionally man- dates a set of interfaces (the &quot;XSI
extension&quot;) which are only optional for POSIX
conformance. XSI-conformant systems can be branded UNIX 03.
(XSI conformance constitutes the Single UNIX Specification
version 3 (SUSv3).)</p>

<p>The POSIX.1-2001 document is broken into four parts:</p>

<p>XBD: Definitions, terms and concepts, header file
specifica- tions.</p>

<p>XSH: Specifications of functions (i.e., system calls and
library functions in actual implementations).</p>

<p>XCU: Specifications of commands and utilities (i.e., the
area formerly described by POSIX.2).</p>

<p>XRAT: Informative text on the other parts of the
standard.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 is aligned with C99, so that all of the
library functions standardized in C99 are also standardized
in POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>Two Technical Corrigenda (minor fixes and improvements)
of the original 2001 standard have occurred: TC1 in 2003
(referred to as POSIX.1-2003), and TC2 in 2004 (referred to
as POSIX.1-2004).</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2008, SUSv4 Work on the next revision of
POSIX.1/SUS was completed and rati- fied in 2008.</p>

<p>The changes in this revision are not as large as those
that occurred for POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3, but a number of new
interfaces are added and various details of existing
specifications are modified. Many of the interfaces that
were optional in POSIX.1-2001 become mandatory in the 2008
revision of the stan- dard. A few interfaces that are
present in POSIX.1-2001 are marked as obsolete in
POSIX.1-2008, or removed from the standard altogether.</p>

<p>The revised standard is broken into the same four parts
as POSIX.1-2001, and again there are two levels of
conformance: the baseline POSIX Conformance, and XSI
Conformance, which mandates an additional set of interfaces
beyond those in the base speci- fication.</p>

<p>In general, where the CONFORMING TO section of a manual
page lists POSIX.1-2001, it can be assumed that the
interface also conforms to POSIX.1-2008, unless otherwise
noted.</p>
