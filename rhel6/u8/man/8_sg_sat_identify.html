<p>NAME sg_sat_identify - sends a ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET)
DEVICE command via a SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) layer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_sat_identify [--ck_cond] [--extend] [--help]
[--hex] [--len=16|12] [--packet] [--raw] [--verbose]
[--version] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This utility sends either an ATA IDENTIFY
DEVICE command or an ATA IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE command to
DEVICE and outputs the response. The devices that respond to
these commands are ATA disks and ATAPI devices respectively.
Rather than send these commands directly to the device they
are sent via a SCSI transport which is assumed to contain a
SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) Layer (SATL). The SAT standard
(SAT ANSI INCITS 431-2007, prior draft: sat-r09.pdf at
www.t10.org) defines two SCSI &quot;ATA PASS-THROUGH&quot;
commands: one using a 16 byte &quot;cdb&quot; and the other
with a 12 byte cdb. This utility defaults to using the 16
byte cdb variant.</p>

<p>The SATL may be in an operating system driver, in host
bus adapter firmware or in some external enclosure.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-c, --ck_cond sets the CK_COND bit in the ATA
PASS-THROUGH SCSI cdb. The default setting is clear (i.e.
0). When set the SATL should yield a sense buffer containing
a ATA Result descriptor irre- spective of whether the
command succeeded or failed. When clear the SATL should only
yield a sense buffer containing a ATA Result descriptor if
the command failed.</p>

<p>-e, --extend sets the EXTEND bit in the ATA PASS-THROUGH
SCSI cdb. The default setting is clear (i.e. 0). When set a
48 bit LBA command is sent to the device. This option has no
effect when --len=12.</p>

<p>-h, --help outputs the usage message summarizing command
line options then exits. Ignores DEVICE if given.</p>

<p>-H, --hex outputs the ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE
response in hex. The default action (i.e. without any -H
options) is to output the response in hex, grouped in 16 bit
words (i.e. the ATA stan- dard s preference). When given
once, the response is output in ASCII hex bytes (i.e. the
SCSI standard s preference). When given twice (i.e. -HH )
the output is in hex, grouped in 16 bit words, the same as
the default but without a header. When given thrice (i.e.
-HHH ) the output is in hex, grouped in 16 bit words, in a
format that is acceptable for hdparm --Istdin to
process.</p>

<p>-l, --len=16 | 12 this is the length of the SCSI cdb
used for the ATA PASS-THROUGH commands. The argument can
either be 16 or 12. The default is 16. The larger cdb size
is needed for 48 bit LBA addressing of ATA devices. On the
other hand some SCSI transports cannot con- vey SCSI
commands longer than 12 bytes.</p>

<p>-p, --packet send an ATA IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE command
(via the SATL). The default action is to send an ATA
IDENTIFY DEVICE command.</p>

<p>-r, --raw output the ATA IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE
response in binary. The output should be piped to a file or
another utility when this option is used. The binary is sent
to stdout, and errors are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increases the level or verbosity.</p>

<p>-V, --version print out version string</p>

<p>NOTES Since the response to the IDENTIFY (PACKET) DEVICE
command is very important for the correct use of an ATA(PI)
device (and is typically the first command sent), a SATL
should provide an ATA Information VPD page which contains
the similar information.</p>

<p>The SCSI ATA PASS-THROUGH (12) commands opcode is 0xa1
and it clashes with the MMC sets BLANK command used by
cd/dvd writers. So a SATL in front of an ATAPI device that
uses MMC (i.e. has peripheral device type 5) probably should
treat opcode 0xa1 as a BLANK command and send it through to
the cd/dvd drive. The ATA PASS-THROUGH (16) commands opcode
(0x85) does not clash with anything so it is a better
choice.</p>

<p>In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the DEVICE must be a
SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block devices
(e.g. disks and ATAPI DVDs) can also be specified. For
example &quot;sg_inq /dev/sda&quot; will work in the 2.6
series kernels. From lk 2.6.6 other SCSI &quot;char&quot;
device names may be used as well (e.g.
&quot;/dev/st0m&quot;).</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_sat_identify is 0 when
it is successful. Other- wise see the sg3_utils(8) man
page.</p>
