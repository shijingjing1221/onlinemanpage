<p>NAME pam_succeed_if - test account characteristics</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_succeed_if.so [flag...] [condition...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pam_succeed_if.so is designed to succeed or
fail authentication based on characteristics of the account
belonging to the user being authenticated. One use is to
select whether to load other modules based on this test.</p>

<p>The module should be given one or more conditions as
module arguments, and authentication will succeed only if
all of the conditions are met.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following flags are supported:</p>

<p>debug Turns on debugging messages sent to syslog.</p>

<p>use_uid Evaluate conditions using the account of the
user whose UID the application is running under instead of
the user being authenticated.</p>

<p>quiet Don&acute;t log failure or success to the system
log.</p>

<p>quiet_fail Don&acute;t log failure to the system
log.</p>

<p>quiet_success Don&acute;t log success to the system
log.</p>

<p>Conditions are three words: a field, a test, and a value
to test for.</p>

<p>Available fields are user, uid, gid, shell, home and
service:</p>

<p>field &lt; number Field has a value numerically less
than number.</p>

<p>field &lt;= number Field has a value numerically less
than or equal to number.</p>

<p>field eq number Field has a value numerically equal to
number.</p>

<p>field &gt;= number Field has a value numerically greater
than or equal to number.</p>

<p>field &gt; number Field has a value numerically greater
than number.</p>

<p>field ne number Field has a value numerically different
from number.</p>

<p>field = string Field exactly matches the given
string.</p>

<p>field != string Field does not match the given
string.</p>

<p>field =~ glob Field matches the given glob.</p>

<p>field !~ glob Field does not match the given glob.</p>

<p>field in item:item:... Field is contained in the list of
items separated by colons.</p>

<p>field notin item:item:... Field is not contained in the
list of items separated by colons.</p>

<p>user ingroup group User is in given group.</p>

<p>user notingroup group User is not in given group.</p>

<p>user innetgr netgroup (user,host) is in given
netgroup.</p>

<p>user notinnetgr group (user,host) is not in given
netgroup.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED All module types (account, auth,
password and session) are provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_SUCCESS The condition was true.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTH_ERR The condition was false.</p>

<p>PAM_SERVICE_ERR A service error occurred or the
arguments can&acute;t be parsed correctly.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To emulate the behaviour of pam_wheel, except
there is no fallback to group 0:</p>

<p>auth required pam_succeed_if.so quiet user ingroup
wheel</p>

<p>Given that the type matches, only loads the othermodule
rule if the UID is over 500. Adjust the number after default
to skip several rules.</p>

<p>type [default=1 success=ignore] pam_succeed_if.so quiet
uid &gt; 500 type required othermodule.so arguments...</p>
