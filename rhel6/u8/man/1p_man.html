<p>MAN(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MAN(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME man - display system documentation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS man [-k] name...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The man utility shall write information
about each of the name operands. If name is the name of a
standard utility, man at a minimum shall write a message
describing the syntax used by the standard util- ity, its
options, and operands. If more information is available, the
man utility shall provide it in an implementation-defined
manner.</p>

<p>An implementation may provide information for values of
name other than the standard utilities. Standard utilities
that are listed as optional and that are not supported by
the implementation either shall cause a brief message
indicating that fact to be displayed or shall cause a full
display of information as described previously.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The man utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-k Interpret name operands as keywords to be used in
searching a utilities summary database that contains a brief
purpose entry for each standard utility and write lines from
the summary database that match any of the keywords. The
keyword search shall produce results that are the equivalent
of the output of the following command:</p>

<p>grep -Ei name name...</p>

<p>This assumes that the summary-database is a text file
with a single entry per line; this organization is not
required and the example using grep -Ei is merely
illustrative of the type of search intended. The purpose
entry to be included in the database shall consist of a
terse description of the purpose of the utility.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>name A keyword or the name of a standard utility. When
-k is not specified and name does not represent one of the
standard utili- ties, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of man:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and in the summary database). The value of LC_CTYPE need not
affect the format of the information written about the name
operands.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>PAGER Determine an output filtering command for writing
the output to a terminal. Any string acceptable as a
command_string operand to the sh -c command shall be valid.
When standard output is a ter- minal device, the reference
page output shall be piped through the command. If the PAGER
variable is null or not set, the com- mand shall be either
more or another paginator utility docu- mented in the system
documentation.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The man utility shall write text describing the
syntax of the utility name, its options and its operands,
or, when -k is specified, lines from the summary database.
The format of this text is implementation- defined.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE It is recognized that the man utility is only
of minimal usefulness as specified. The opinion of the
standard developers was strongly divided as to how much or
how little information man should be required to pro- vide.
They considered, however, that the provision of some
portable way of accessing documentation would aid user
portability. The arguments against a fuller specification
were:</p>

<p>* Large quantities of documentation should not be
required on a system that does not have excess disk
space.</p>

<p>* The current manual system does not present information
in a manner that greatly aids user portability.</p>

<p>* A &quot;better help system&quot; is currently an area
in which vendors feel that they can add value to their POSIX
implementations.</p>

<p>The -f option was considered, but due to implementation
differences, it was not included in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>The description was changed to be more specific about
what has to be displayed for a utility. The standard
developers considered it insuffi- cient to allow a display
of only the synopsis without giving a short description of
what each option and operand does.</p>

<p>The &quot;purpose&quot; entry to be included in the
database can be similar to the section title (less the
numeric prefix) from this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 for
each utility. These titles are similar to those used in
historical systems for this purpose.</p>

<p>See mailx for rationale concerning the default
paginator.</p>

<p>The caveat in the LC_CTYPE description was added because
it is not a requirement that an implementation provide
reference pages for all of its supported locales on each
system; changing LC_CTYPE does not neces- sarily translate
the reference page into another language. This is equivalent
to the current state of LC_MESSAGES in IEEE Std
1003.1-2001-locale-specific messages are not yet a require-
ment.</p>

<p>The historical MANPATH variable is not included in POSIX
because no attempt is made to specify naming conventions for
reference page files, nor even to mandate that they are
files at all. On some implementa- tions they could be a true
database, a hypertext file, or even fixed strings within the
man executable. The standard developers considered the
portability of reference pages to be outside their scope of
work. However, users should be aware that MANPATH is
implemented on a number of historical systems and that it
can be used to tailor the search pat- tern for reference
pages from the various categories (utilities, func- tions,
file formats, and so on) when the system administrator
reveals the location and conventions for reference pages on
the system.</p>

<p>The keyword search can rely on at least the text of the
section titles from these utility descriptions, and the
implementation may add more keywords. The term &quot;section
titles&quot; refers to the strings such as:</p>

<p>man - Display system documentation ps - Report process
status</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
