<p>NAME rmcpping - send RMCP Ping to network hosts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rmcpping [OPTION...] destination</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rmcpping uses the RMCP Ping request datagram
to elicit an RMCP Pong response from a remote host. The
utility can be used to verify if a remote host supports RMCP
or IPMI. The initial starting sequence number will be
randomized.</p>

<p>rmcpping will return 0 to the environment if it receives
atleast 1 response from the remote host. Otherwise, it exits
with a value of 1.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are available</p>

<p>-h Output help menu.</p>

<p>-V Output version.</p>

<p>-c count Stop after sending count packets.</p>

<p>-i interval Wait interval seconds between sending each
packet. The default is to wait for one second between each
packet.</p>

<p>-I interface address Set source address to specified
interface address. Argument may be numeric IP address or
name of device.</p>

<p>-t timeout Time to wait for a response, in seconds.
Default is five sec- onds.</p>

<p>-v Verbose output.</p>

<p>-s num Specify an initial starting sequence number. The
default is to use a random initial sequence number.</p>

<p>-d Turn on debugging.</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES It has been observed that some remote BMCs
can get &quot;confused&quot; and delay packet responses if
duplicate packets (with duplicate sequence numbers) are sent
in succession very quickly. There is no known way to cleanly
deal with a &quot;confused&quot; BMC other than the wait
awhile.</p>

<p>Unlike ping(8), local network devicess (e.g. 127.0.0.1)
cannot be &quot;pinged&quot;.</p>
