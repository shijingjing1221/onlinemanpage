<p>Tk_Main(3) Tk Library Procedures Tk_Main(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_Main - main program for Tk-based
applications</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_Main(argc, argv, appInitProc)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS int argc (in) Number of elements in argv.</p>

<p>char *argv[] (in) Array of strings containing
command-line arguments.</p>

<p>Tcl_AppInitProc *appInitProc (in) Address of an
application- specific initialization pro- cedure. The value
for this argument is usually Tcl_AppInit.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_Main acts as the main program for most
Tk-based applications. Starting with Tk 4.0 it is not called
main anymore because it is part of the Tk library and having
a function main in a library (particularly a shared library)
causes problems on many systems. Having main in the Tk
library would also make it hard to use Tk in C++ programs,
since C++ programs must have special C++ main functions.</p>

<p>Normally each application contains a small main function
that does nothing but invoke Tk_Main. Tk_Main then does all
the work of creating and running a wish-like
application.</p>

<p>When it is has finished its own initialization, but
before it processes commands, Tk_Main calls the procedure
given by the appInitProc argu- ment. This procedure provides
a hook for the application to perform its own
initialization, such as defining application-specific
commands. The procedure must have an interface that matches
the type Tcl_AppInit- Proc: typedef int
Tcl_AppInitProc(Tcl_Interp *interp); AppInitProc is almost
always a pointer to Tcl_AppInit; for more details on this
procedure, see the documentation for Tcl_AppInit.</p>
