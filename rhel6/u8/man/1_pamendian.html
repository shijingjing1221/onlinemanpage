<p>NAME pamendian - reverse endianness of a Netpbm
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamendian</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>All Netpbm formats that have samples in pure binary
format with multi- ple bytes are defined to have them in big
endian (most significant byte first) order. However, there
exist variations on these formats, pri- marily developed
before official multibyte Netpbm formats existed, that are
identical to Netpbm formats in every respect except that
samples are in little endian (least signficant byte first)
order.</p>

<p>pamendian reverses the byte order of the sample to
convert between the two formats. If the input is true PAM,
PGM, or PPM, the output is the little endian variation on
that format, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The X Window System viewer xv expects the little endian
variation of PGM and PPM.</p>

<p>Programs that come with the Independent Jpeg Groups JPEG
library are known to use the little endian variation of PGM
and PPM.</p>

<p>The reason some programs use this variant is that at one
time during Netpbm s darkage(1),there was a version of
Netpbm around that used it. But it was never formally
specified.</p>

<p>This program takes input only on Standard Input. Its
output is always on Standard Output.</p>

<p>You should never have to use this program with images
generated by pro- grams in the Netpbm package or programs
that use the Netpbm libraries. If you do, that probably
means something needs to be fixed in those programs. The
Netpbm converter for any graphics format that represents
numbers in little endian form should properly reverse the
bytes to cre- ate correct Netpbm output.</p>

<p>If you create a Netpbm image from a generic stream of
samples, using rawtopgm or rawtoppm, use options on those
programs to declare the endianness of your input, thus
creating correct endianness in your PGM or PPM output.</p>
