<p>Tcl_RecordAndEval(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_RecordAndEval(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_RecordAndEval - save command on history list
before evaluating</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tcl_RecordAndEval(interp, cmd, flags)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Tcl interpreter in
which to evaluate command.</p>

<p>const char *cmd (in) Command (or sequence of commands)
to execute.</p>

<p>int flags (in) An ORed combination of flag bits.
TCL_NO_EVAL means record the command but do not evaluate it.
TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL means evaluate the command at global level
instead of the current stack level.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_RecordAndEval is invoked to record a
command as an event on the history list and then execute it
using Tcl_Eval (or Tcl_GlobalEval if the TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL bit
is set in flags). It returns a completion code such as
TCL_OK just like Tcl_Eval and it leaves information in the
interpreter s result. If you do not want the command
recorded on the history list then you should invoke Tcl_Eval
instead of Tcl_RecordAndE- val. Normally Tcl_RecordAndEval
is only called with top-level commands typed by the user,
since the purpose of history is to allow the user to
re-issue recently-invoked commands. If the flags argument
contains the TCL_NO_EVAL bit then the command is recorded
without being evaluated.</p>

<p>Note that Tcl_RecordAndEval has been largely replaced by
the object- based procedure Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj. That
object-based procedure records and optionally executes a
command held in a Tcl object instead of a string.</p>
