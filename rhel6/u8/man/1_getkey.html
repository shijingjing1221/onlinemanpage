<p>NAME getkey - wait until a key is pressed</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS getkey [OPTION]... [KEYS]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION getkey waits until one of KEYS is pressed.
If KEYS are not specified, any key is accepted. KEYS are
matched case-insensitive.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS getkey exits with status 0 if one of the
expected keys is pressed. If invalid arguments are
specified, getkey exits with status 255. If getkey is
interrupted or the wait times out, getkey exits with other
non-zero status.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c, --wait SECONDS Wait only for SECONDS
seconds. The default is 0, which means to wait without a
time limit.</p>

<p>-i, --ignore-control-chars Dont treat Ctrl+C and Ctrl+D
specially. When this option is not specified, these
characters interrupt getkey.</p>

<p>-m, --message MESSAGE Display MESSAGE while waiting. The
message is used as a format string in sprintf(3), with a
single argument, the number of sec- onds left. Typical usage
is therefore &quot;Press a key within %d seconds to
...&quot;. If MESSAGE contains other format string direc-
tives, the behavior is undefined and getkey may crash.</p>

<p>If there is no time limit specified, the number of
seconds left is reported as 0.</p>
