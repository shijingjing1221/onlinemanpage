<p>REMOTE-VIEWER(1) Virtualization Support
REMOTE-VIEWER(1)</p>

<p>NAME remote-viewer - a simple remote desktop client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS remote-viewer [OPTIONS] -- [URI]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION remote-viewer is a simple remote display
client. The supported protocols are SPICE and VNC.</p>

<p>Starting remote-viewer without URI will open a simple
dialog with an entry and a list of previously successfully
accessed URI.</p>

<p>The URI can also point to a connection settings file,
see the CONNECTION FILE section for a description of the
format.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are accepted when running
&quot;remote-viewer&quot;:</p>

<p>-h, --help Display command line help summary</p>

<p>-V, --version Display program version number</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Display information about the
connection</p>

<p>-z PCT, --zoom=PCT Zoom level of the display window in
percentage. Range 10-400.</p>

<p>-f, --full-screen Start with the windows maximized to
fullscreen.</p>

<p>If supported, the remote display will be reconfigured to
match the physical client monitor configuration, by enabling
or disabling extra monitors as necessary. This is currently
implemented by the Spice backend only.</p>

<p>To specify which client monitors are used in fullscreen
mode, see the CONFIGURATION section below.</p>

<p>-t TITLE, --title TITLE Set the window title to
TITLE</p>

<p>--spice-controller Use the SPICE controller to
initialize the connection with the SPICE server. This option
is used by the SPICE browser addons to allow web page to
start a client.</p>

<p>--debug Print debugging information</p>

<p>-H HOTKEYS, --hotkeys HOTKEYS Set global hotkey
bindings. By default, keyboard shortcuts only work when the
guest display widget does not have focus. Any actions
specified in HOTKEYS will be effective even when the guest
display widget has input focus. The format for HOTKEYS is
&lt;action1&gt;=&lt;key1&gt;[+&lt;key2&gt;][,&lt;action2&gt;=&lt;key3&gt;[+&lt;key4&gt;]].
Key-names are case-insensitive. Valid actions are:
toggle-fullscreen, release-cursor, secure-attention,
smartcard-insert and smartcard- remove. The
&quot;secure-attention&quot; action sends a secure attention
sequence (Ctrl+Alt+Del) to the guest. Examples:</p>


<p>--hotkeys=toggle-fullscreen=shift+f11,release-cursor=shift+f12</p>

<p>--hotkeys=release-cursor=ctrl+alt</p>

<p>Note that hotkeys for which no binding is given are
disabled. Although the hotkeys specified here are handled by
the client, it is still possible to send these key
combinations to the guest via a menu item.</p>

<p>-k, --kiosk Start in kiosk mode. In this mode, the
application will start in fullscreen with minimal UI. It
will prevent the user from quitting or performing any
interaction outside of usage of the remote desktop
session.</p>

<p>Note that it cant offer a complete secure solution by
itself. Your kiosk system must have additional configuration
and security settings to lock down the OS. In particular,
you must configure or disable the window manager, limit the
session capabilities, use some restart/watchdog mechanism,
disable VT switching etc.</p>

<p>--kiosk-quit &lt;never|on-disconnect&gt; By default,
when kiosk mode is enabled, virt-viewer will remain open
when the connection to the remote server is terminated. By
setting kiosk-quit option to &quot;on-disconnect&quot;
value, virt-viewer will quit instead.</p>

<p>HOTKEY A key binding combination is described by a
series of key strings separated by + that must be pressed
together in order to activate the associated action.</p>

<p>It must be composed of modifiers (shift, ctrl or alt)
and a non- modifier key. For example,
&quot;shift+f11&quot;.</p>

<p>CONNECTION FILE remote-viewer connection file is of INI
file format, with a mandatory [virt-viewer] group and
&quot;type&quot; key.</p>

<p>Example Opening a file with the following content will
start remote-viewer in fullscreen and connect to the host
&quot;betsiboka&quot; using the SPICE protocol:</p>

<p>[virt-viewer] type=spice host=betsiboka port=5900
fullscreen=1</p>

<p>Key list &quot;version&quot; (string) If remote-viewer
version number isnt greater or equal to the required
version, an error is raised with the expected version.</p>

<p>The version format accepted is a list of integers
separated by .. It can be followed by a dash - and an
additional build number with the same format.</p>

<p>Version comparison is done by comparing each integer
from the list one by one. If any of the component is not a
number, the version comparison will fail and consider that
the 2 versions are considered to be the same.</p>

<p>&quot;versions&quot; (osid:version list) This is a list
of osid:version couples separated by ;. osid is an arbitrary
string, version is a version number in the same format as in
the version field. A given couple indicates that
remote-viewer builds matching the given osid (fedora22,
debian7, ...) must be at least version version . For
consistency, it s recommended to use libosinfo OS shortids
as the osid.</p>

<p>&quot;newer-version-url&quot; (string) If specified,
this field is an URL which will be displayed to the user
when a version check fails.</p>

<p>&quot;type&quot; (string, mandatory) The session type,
either &quot;spice&quot;, &quot;vnc&quot; or
&quot;ovirt&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;host&quot; (string, mandatory) The server host to

to connect to.</p>

<p>&quot;username&quot; (string) The username for the
session authentication.</p>

<p>&quot;password&quot; (string) The password for the
session authentication.</p>

<p>&quot;disable-channels&quot; (string list) The list of
session channels to disable.</p>

<p>The current SPICE channels are: main, display, inputs,
cursor, playback, record, smartcard, usbredir.</p>

<p>&quot;tls-ciphers&quot; (string) Set the cipher list to
use for the secure connection, in textual OpenSSL cipher
list format. (see ciphers(1))</p>

<p>&quot;title&quot; (string) String to present in the
window title.</p>

<p>&quot;fullscreen&quot; (boolean) Opens the client
windows in fullscreen.</p>

<p>&quot;ca&quot; (string) CA certificate in PEM format
(using &quot;0 to separate the lines). This will be used to
verify the SSL certificate used for SPICE TLS sessions.</p>

<p>&quot;host-subject&quot; (string) Verify the certificate
subject matches with the given subject.</p>

<p>&quot;toggle-fullscreen&quot; (hotkey string) Key
binding for entering and leaving fullscreen mode. (see
HOTKEY for description of expected string)</p>

<p>&quot;release-cursor&quot; (hotkey string) Key binding
for releasing cursor grab. (see HOTKEY for description of
expected string)</p>

wallpaper, font- smooth, animation or all.</p>

<p>&quot;enable-smartcard&quot; (boolean) Set to 1 to
enable client smartcard redirection.</p>

<p>&quot;enable-usbredir&quot; (boolean) Set to 1 to enable
client USB device redirection.</p>

<p>&quot;enable-usb-autoshare&quot; (boolean) Set to 1 to
enable client USB devices auto-sharing.</p>

<p>&quot;usb-filter&quot; (string) Set a string specifying
a filter to use to determine which USB devices to
autoconnect when plugged in, a filter consists of one or
more rules. Where each rule has the form of:</p>

<p>&quot;class,vendor,product,version,allow&quot;</p>

<p>Use -1 for class/vendor/product/version to accept any
value.</p>

<p>And the rules themselves are concatenated like this:</p>

<p>&quot;rule1|rule2|rule3&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;secure-channels&quot; (string list) The list of

client to remove this connection file (if it cant, it will
fail silently)</p>

<p>&quot;proxy&quot; (string) A proxy URL to tunnel the
connection through.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this documentation, the only
supported proxy method with Spice is HTTP CONNECT.</p>

<p>For example, to tunnel connection through foobar host
HTTP proxy on port 8080, use the value
&quot;http://foobar:8080&quot;.</p>

<p>oVirt Support The connection file can also carry some
oVirt-specific options when oVirt support is compiled in.
These options are used to interact with oVirt REST API. This
is currently only used in order to show a menu allowing to
change the CD image being used by the virtual machine from
remote-viewer user interface. These options go in an
optional [ovirt] group.</p>

<p>&quot;host&quot; (string, mandatory) The oVirt instance
to connect to. This corresponds to the hostname one would
connect to access the oVirt user or admin portal.</p>

<p>&quot;vm-guid&quot; (string, mandatory) GUID of the
oVirt virtual machine to connect to.</p>

<p>&quot;jsessionid&quot; (string) Value to set the
jsessionid cookie to. Setting this authentication cookie to
a valid value will allow to interact with the oVirt REST API
without being asked for credentials.</p>

<p>&quot;ca&quot; (string) CA certificate in PEM format
(using &quot;0 to separate the lines). This will be used to
validate the certificate used for the oVirt REST https
session remote-viewer will establish.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION A small number of configuration options
can be controlled by editing the settings file located in
the user configuration directory:</p>

<p>&lt;USER-CONFIG-DIR&gt;/virt-viewer/settings</p>

<p>This file is a text file in INI format, with application
options in the [virt-viewer] group and per-guest options in
a group identified by the guest s UUID. The application
options should not be edited manually. There is also a
special [fallback] group which specifies options for all
guests that dont have an explicit group.</p>

<p>For each guest, the initial fullscreen monitor
configuration can be specified by using the monitor-mapping
key. This configuration only takes effect when the
-f/--full-screen option is specified.</p>

<p>The value of this key is a list of mappings between a
guest display and a client monitor. Each mapping is
separated by a semicolon character, and the mappings have
the format
&lt;GUEST-DISPLAY-ID&gt;:&lt;CLIENT-MONITOR-ID&gt;.</p>

<p>For example, to map guest displays 1 and 2 to client
monitors 2 and 3 for the guest with a UUID of
e4591275-d9d3-4a44-a18b-ef2fbc8ac3e2, use:</p>

<p>[e4591275-d9d3-4a44-a18b-ef2fbc8ac3e2]
monitor-mapping=1:2;2:3</p>
