<p>sane-p5(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy sane-p5(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-p5 - SANE backend for the Primax
PagePartner</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-p5 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
the Primax PagePartner parallel port sheet fed scanner.</p>

<p>This backend handles 100, 150, 200, 300 and 600 dpi scan
resolutions, in color and gray modes. The 600 dpi is
actually 300x600 with lines enlarged to match the vertical
resolution.</p>

<p>EPP/ECP MODES ONLY The current version of the backend
uses only EPP or ECP mode to communicate with the scanner.
It is recommended that you set your parallel port to EPP in
BIOS with the current version of this backend. ECPEPP will
only work if you use a 2.4 or 2.6 kernel with ppdev
character device support.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>port value</p>

<p>Where value is :</p>

<p>auto autodetect all parallel ports and probe them for
scanner</p>

<p>/dev/parport0 uses linux ppdev device, depending on the
number of available parallel port, you have to use
/dev/parport1, /dev/parport2, ...</p>

<p>You can rename any device using the</p>

<p>option name my_name</p>

<p>option. This option apply to the last port option.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION Please make sure to edit dll.conf before
you use the backend, since this backend isnt enabled by
default.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/p5.conf The backend configuration file
(see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-p5.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-p5.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_P5 If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 255 requests
all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels reduce
verbosity.</p>

<p>level debug output -------
------------------------------ 0 critical errors 1 errors 2
warnings &amp; minor errors 4 information messages 8
start/stop of functions 16 tracing messages 32 I/O functions
64 I/O functions with traces 128 scanned/calibration
data</p>

<p>CREDITS Support for the Prima PagePartner has been made
possible thank to an hardware donation by S&eacute;bastien
Lange.</p>

<p>BUG REPORTS If something doesn t work mail
sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org or use the bug tracker at
https://alioth.debian.org/tracker/?atid=410366&amp;group_id=30186
. Please give as much information as you can.</p>

<p>SANE version run &quot;scanimage -V&quot; to determine
this</p>

<p>the backend version and your scanner hardware run
&quot;SANE_DEBUG_P5=255 scanimage -L 2&gt;log&quot; as root.
If you dont get any output from the p5 backend, make sure a
line &quot;p5&quot; is included into your
/etc/sane.d/dll.conf. If your scanner isnt detected, make
sure youve defined the right port address, or the correct
device in your p5.conf.</p>

<p>the name of your scanner/vendor also a worthy
information. Please also include the optical reso- lution
and lamp type of your scanner, both can be found in the
manual of your scanner.</p>

<p>any further comments if you have comments about the
documentation (what could be done better), or you think I
should know something, please include it.</p>
