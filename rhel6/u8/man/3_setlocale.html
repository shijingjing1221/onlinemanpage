<p>SETLOCALE(3) Linux Programmer s Manual SETLOCALE(3)</p>

<p>NAME setlocale - set the current locale</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;locale.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *setlocale(int category, const char *locale);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The setlocale() function is used to set or
query the programs current locale.</p>

<p>If locale is not NULL, the programs current locale is
modified accord- ing to the arguments. The argument category
determines which parts of the programs current locale should
be modified.</p>

<p>LC_ALL for all of the locale.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE for regular expression matching (it
determines the meaning of range expressions and equivalence
classes) and string collation.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE for regular expression matching, character
classification, con- version, case-sensitive comparison, and
wide character func- tions.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES for localizable natural-language
messages.</p>

<p>LC_MONETARY for monetary formatting.</p>

<p>LC_NUMERIC for number formatting (such as the decimal
point and the thou- sands separator).</p>

<p>LC_TIME for time and date formatting.</p>

<p>The argument locale is a pointer to a character string
containing the required setting of category. Such a string
is either a well-known constant like &quot;C&quot; or
&quot;da_DK&quot; (see below), or an opaque string that was
returned by another call of setlocale().</p>

<p>If locale is &quot;&quot;, each part of the locale that
should be modified is set according to the environment
variables. The details are implementa- tion-dependent. For
glibc, first (regardless of category), the envi- ronment
variable LC_ALL is inspected, next the environment variable
with the same name as the category (LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE,
LC_MESSAGES, LC_MONETARY, LC_NUMERIC, LC_TIME) and finally
the environment variable LANG. The first existing
environment variable is used. If its value is not a valid
locale specification, the locale is unchanged, and set-
locale() returns NULL.</p>

<p>The locale &quot;C&quot; or &quot;POSIX&quot; is a
portable locale; its LC_CTYPE part cor- responds to the
7-bit ASCII character set.</p>

<p>A locale name is typically of the form
language[_territory][.code- set][@modifier], where language
is an ISO 639 language code, territory is an ISO 3166
country code, and codeset is a character set or encoding
identifier like ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8. For a list of all
supported locales, try &quot;locale -a&quot;, cf.
locale(1).</p>

<p>If locale is NULL, the current locale is only queried,
not modified.</p>

<p>On startup of the main program, the portable
&quot;C&quot; locale is selected as default. A program may
be made portable to all locales by calling:</p>

<p>setlocale(LC_ALL, &quot;&quot;);</p>

<p>after program initialization, by using the values
returned from a localeconv(3) call for locale-dependent
information, by using the multi-byte and wide character
functions for text processing if MB_CUR_MAX &gt; 1, and by
using strcoll(3), wcscoll(3) or strxfrm(3), wcsxfrm(3) to
compare strings.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE A successful call to setlocale() returns an
opaque string that corre- sponds to the locale set. This
string may be allocated in static stor- age. The string
returned is such that a subsequent call with that string and
its associated category will restore that part of the pro-
cess s locale. The return value is NULL if the request
cannot be hon- ored.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Linux (that is, glibc) supports the portable
locales &quot;C&quot; and &quot;POSIX&quot;. In the good old
days there used to be support for the European Latin-1
&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; locale (e.g., in libc-4.5.21 and
libc-4.6.27), and the Russian &quot;KOI-8&quot; (more
precisely, &quot;koi-8r&quot;) locale (e.g., in
libc-4.6.27), so that having an environment variable
LC_CTYPE=ISO-8859-1 sufficed to make isprint(3) return the
right answer. These days non-English speaking Europeans have
to work a bit harder, and must install actual locale
files.</p>
