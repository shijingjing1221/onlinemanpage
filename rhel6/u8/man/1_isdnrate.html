NUMBER ...</p>

<p>All options are optional.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The isdnrate program prints various
information from rate-files(5). Its main purpose is the
calculation of telefon rates from your loca- tion to an
arbitrary destination at a certain time and of a certain
length for all the providers in a rate-file.</p>

<p>NUMBER A telefon number may be</p>

<p>1234 a local area number</p>

<p>01234 a different area in your country</p>

<p>+12345 a foreign country</p>

<p>China text for a foreign country</p>

<p>Paris a town</p>

<p>US a code as defined in country.dat.</p>

<p>Internet a Service name (if option -s is also
given).</p>

<p>Note that currently only city names in AT, DE, NL are
supported plus some international capitals. Note also,
spaces in country- or service names may be given as under-
scores.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -bbest Print only best providers. Default is
all.</p>

<p>-crateconf Use rateconf as provider selection file and
ignore setting in isdn.conf.</p>

<p>-dday Calc rates for day. day can be one of</p>

<p>dd day of current month dd.mm day month dd.mm.yy[yy]
day, month, year W Weekday N Weekday - night E Weekend</p>

<p>Default is now.</p>

<p>-ffrom Callers location. Default ist from isdn.conf.</p>

<p>-hhour Time hh[:mm[:ss]] of call. Default is now.</p>

<p>-iratefile Use ratefile (usually rate-CC.dat) as source
for telephone fees and ignore setting in isdn.conf.</p>

<p>-llen Length of call in second. Default value is 153
secs.</p>

<p>-o Show only booked providers. These are providers,
which are listed in rate.conf.</p>

<p>-p provider[,provider...] Print only info for given
provider(s). provider is the provider number, without the
leading VBN, or provider_variant if there are more
variations, or B for business providers.</p>

<p>-rvNN Show only providers whose vbn begins with NN. The
vbn is also known as provider prefix consisting of VBN and
provider number.</p>

<p>-s Consider NUMBER as the name of a service and print
all numbers / providers, which supply this service.</p>

<p>-ttakt Print only providers, which have calculation
impulses smaller or equal to takt. Default is 9999.</p>

<p>-vverbose Set verbose level.</p>

<p>-x provider[,provider...] Exclude these provider(s).</p>

<p>DISPLAY AND RUN OPTIONS -C Connect to a running isdnrate
daemon. This avoids long startup times.</p>

<p>-D Start as a daemon, waiting for connections from a
client. The socket /tmp/isdnrate is created, which clients
can connect to.</p>

<p>-D2 Start as a daemon and go background.</p>

<p>-CD3 Stop a running daemon.</p>

<p>-Gn Print raw data for connection. n may be currently
97,98,99.</p>

<p>-H Print a header.</p>

<p>-L Print a semicolon separated list of</p>

<p>vbn ; providername ; zone ; day ; time ; currency ;
charge ; basicprice ; price ; duration ; charge/min ; takt ;
minimum price</p>

<p>-N Show info about following numbers. If no provider is
given, the pre- selected provider is used.</p>

<p>-Osocketfile Write socket to given filename on start of
daemon. Default is tmp/isdnrate.</p>

<p>-Ppiddir Write own PID to piddir/isdnrate.pid on start
of daemon.</p>

<p>-Ssort Sort output by sort, which may be</p>

<p>v vbn or n provider name. Default is by charge.</p>

<p>-T Print a table of charges for daytimes
weekday/weekend.</p>

<p>-V Print version info and exit.</p>

<p>-Xexplain Print additional information for charge or
from rate-file. explain may be</p>

<p>1 (zone) 2 (charge/min, zone, day, time) 50
International areas 51 National zones 52 Services COMMENT
Print C:COMMENT: info from rate files.</p>

<p>If -s is given, the number of the service is also listed
with -X1 or -X2.</p>

<p>-Z Print info for LCR e.g. isdnrate -p1 -ZX 19430 shows
the rate for provider 1 and the cheapest rate to this
service.</p>

<p>Note: Various output options may not be used together.
If you gave con- flicting options youll see a warning. Note
also: Sort by name or providernumber and -bbest will bring
you the first best providers in sorting order, not the
cheapest. And finally: Some options like -X50, -X51, -X52,
-D, -V dont require a telefon NUMBER.</p>

<p>FILES rate-CC.dat, holiday-CC.dat, dest.gdbm,
zone-CC-PPP.gdbm, isdn.conf, telrate.cgi and more. Note: The
extension of zone- and dest data files depends on configura-
tion. Recently .cdb is used.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES isdnrate -D2 Start the isdnrate daemon.</p>

<p>isdnrate -D2 -P /var/run -O /tmp/isdnr_socket Start the
isdnrate daemon, write isdnrate.pid to /var/run and create
the given socket.</p>

<p>isdnrate -CH -b5 -f01 -l120 Attersee Connect to running
daemon, print a header and the best 5 rates from Vienna (01)
to destination Attersee for a connection length of 2 Min-
utes.</p>

<p>isdnrate -CX -p1_2,24 +1 Show rates and zones for
destination USA for providers 1_2 and 24.</p>

<p>isdnrate -C -l60 -rv010 HAM Show rates for a one minute
call to Hamburg (HAM: airport code) and use only providers
whose vbn begins with 010. So provider A with vbn 01030 is
displayed, provider B with vbn 0190023 is not.</p>

<p>isdnrate -CX -H -dW -b5 US CA Show a header, rates and
zones for destinations USA and Canada for best 5 providers
during workday.</p>

<p>isdnrate -CHoX US Show header, rate and zone for
destination USA for booked providers only.</p>

<p>isdnrate -CsX -l60 Internet Show rates and numbers for
service Internet for a 1 minutes call.</p>

<p>isdnrate -CZ 19430 Show rates and the best provider for
this (service-)number.</p>

<p>isdnrate -CD3 Stop the running isdnrate daemon.</p>

<p>SIGNALS A isdnrate daemon restarts (and therefore
rereads its configuration) on getting a SIGHUP signal.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO rate-files(5), isdnlog(8), isdn.conf(5)</p>

<p>BUGS Definitely yes. Sometimes more then one daemon can
be started, some- times the socket is not removed, when the
daemon terminates. if this happens (socket in use), do a rm
/tmp/isdnrate and try again.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Andreas Kool &lt;akool@isdn4linux.de&gt; started
this program. Leopold Toetsch &lt;lt@toetsch.at&gt;
continued the work and brought this man page to you. Michael
Reinelt &lt;reinelt@eunet.at&gt; did the calculation engine
and various tools for it.</p>
