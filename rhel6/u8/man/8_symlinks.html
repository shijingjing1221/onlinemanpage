<p>NAME symlinks - symbolic link maintenance utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS symlinks [ -cdorstv ] dirlist</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION symlinks is a useful utility for maintainers
of FTP sites, CDROMs, and Linux software distributions. It
scans directories for symbolic links and lists them on
stdout, often revealing flaws in the filesystem tree.</p>

<p>Each link is output with a classification of relative,
absolute, dan- gling, messy, lengthy, or other_fs.</p>

<p>relative links are those expressed as paths relative to
the directory in which the links reside, usually independent
of the mount point of the filesystem.</p>

<p>absolute links are those given as an absolute path from
the root direc- tory as indicated by a leading slash
(/).</p>

<p>dangling links are those for which the target of the
link does not cur- rently exist. This commonly occurs for
absolute links when a filesys- tem is mounted at other than
its customary mount point (such as when the normal root
filesystem is mounted at /mnt after booting from alter-
native media).</p>

<p>messy links are links which contain unnecessary slashes
or dots in the path. These are cleaned up as well when -c is
specified.</p>

<p>lengthy links are links which use &quot;../&quot; more
than necessary in the path (eg. /bin/vi -&gt; ../bin/vim)
These are only detected when -s is speci- fied, and are only
cleaned up when -c is also specified.</p>

<p>other_fs are those links whose target currently resides
on a different filesystem from where symlinks was run (most
useful with -r ).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c convert absolute links (within the same
filesystem) to relative links. This permits links to
maintain their validity regardless of the mount point used
for the filesystem -- a desirable setup in most cases. This
option also causes any messy links to be cleaned up, and, if
-s was also specified, then lengthy links are also
shortened. Links affected by -c are prefixed with changed in
the output.</p>

<p>-d causes dangling links to be removed.</p>

<p>-o fix links on other filesystems encountered while
recursing. Normally, other filesystems encountered are not
modified by sym- links.</p>

<p>-r recursively operate on subdirectories within the same
filesys- tem.</p>

<p>-s causes lengthy links to be detected.</p>

<p>-t is used to test for what symlinks would do if -c were
specified, but without really changing anything.</p>

<p>-v show all symbolic links. By default, relative links
are not shown unless -v is specified.</p>

<p>BUGS symlinks does not recurse or change links across
filesystems.</p>
