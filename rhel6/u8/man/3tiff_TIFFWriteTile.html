<p>NAME TIFFWriteTile - encode and write a tile of data to
an open TIFF file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</p>

<p>tsize_t TIFFWriteTile(TIFF *tif, tdata_t buf, uint32 x,
uint32 y, uint32 z, tsample_t sample)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Write the data for the tile containing the
specified coordinates. The data in buf are is (potentially)
compressed, and written to the indi- cated file, normally
being appended to the end of the file. The buffer must be
contain an entire tile of data. Applications should call the
routine TIFFTileSize to find out the size (in bytes) of a
tile buffer. The x and y parameters are always used by
TIFFWriteTile. The z parame- ter is used if the image is
deeper than 1 slice (ImageDepth&gt;1). The sample parameter
is used only if data are organized in separate planes
(PlanarConfiguration=2).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES TIFFWriteTile returns -1 if it detects an
error; otherwise the number of bytes in the tile is
returned.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error messages are directed to the
TIFFError(3TIFF) routine.</p>
