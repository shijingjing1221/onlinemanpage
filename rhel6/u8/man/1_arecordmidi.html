<p>NAME arecordmidi - record Standard MIDI Files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS arecordmidi -p client:port[,...] [options]
midifile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION arecordmidi is a command-line utility that
records a Standard MIDI File from one or more ALSA sequencer
ports.</p>

<p>To stop recording, press Ctrl+C.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h,--help Prints a list of options.</p>

<p>-V,--version Prints the current version.</p>

<p>-l,--list Prints a list of possible input ports.</p>

<p>-p,--port=client:port,... Sets the sequencer port(s)
from which events are recorded.</p>

<p>A client can be specified by its number, its name, or a
prefix of its name. A port is specified by its number; for
port 0 of a client, the &quot;:0&quot; part of the port
specification can be omitted.</p>

<p>-b,--bpm=beats Sets the musical tempo of the MIDI file,
in beats per minute. The default value is 120 BPM.</p>

<p>-f,--fps=frames Sets the SMPTE resolution, in frames per
second. Possible val- ues are 24, 25, 29.97 (for 30
drop-frame), and 30.</p>

<p>-t,--ticks=ticks Sets the resolution of timestamps
(ticks) in the MIDI file, in ticks per beat (when using
musical tempo) or ticks per frame (when using SMPTE timing).
The default value is 384 ticks/beat or 40 ticks/frame,
respectively.</p>

<p>-s,--split-channels Specifies that the data for each
MIDI channel should be written to a separate track in the
MIDI file. This will result in a &quot;format 1&quot; file.
Otherwise, when there is only one track, arecordmidi will
generate a &quot;format 0&quot; file.</p>

<p>-m,--metronome=client:port Plays a metronome signal on
the specified sequencer port.</p>

<p>Metronome sounds are played on channel 10, MIDI notes 33
&amp; 34 (GM2/GS/XG metronome standard notes), with velocity
100 and duration 1.</p>

<p>-i,--timesig=numerator:denominator Sets the time
signature for the MIDI file and metronome.</p>

<p>The time signature is specified as usual with two
numbers, rep- resenting the numerator and denominator of the
time signature as it would be notated. The denominator must
be a power of two. Both numbers should be separated by a
colon. The time signature is 4:4 by default.</p>
