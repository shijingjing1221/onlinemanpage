<p>KILL(1) Linux Programmer s Manual KILL(1)</p>

<p>NAME kill - terminate a process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kill [-s signal|-p] [--] pid... kill -l
[signal]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The command kill sends the specified signal
to the specified process or process group. If no signal is
specified, the TERM signal is sent. The TERM signal will
kill processes which do not catch this signal. For other
processes, it may be necessary to use the KILL (9) signal,
since this signal cannot be caught.</p>

<p>Most modern shells have a builtin kill function, with a
usage rather similar to that of the command described here.
The -a and -p options, and the possibility to specify pids
by command name is a local extension.</p>

<p>If sig is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking
is still per- formed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS pid... Specify the list of processes that kill
should signal. Each pid can be one of five things:</p>

<p>n where n is larger than 0. The process with pid n will
be signaled.</p>

<p>0 All processes in the current process group are
signaled.</p>

<p>-1 All processes with pid larger than 1 will be
signaled.</p>

<p>-n where n is larger than 1. All processes in process
group n are signaled. When an argument of the form -n is
given, and it is meant to denote a process group, either the
signal must be specified first, or the argument must be
preceded by a -- option, otherwise it will be taken as the
signal to send.</p>

<p>commandname All processes invoked using that name will
be signaled.</p>

<p>-s signal Specify the signal to send. The signal may be
given as a signal name or number.</p>

<p>-l Print a list of signal names. These are found in
/usr/include/linux/signal.h</p>

<p>-a Do not restrict the commandname-to-pid conversion to
processes with the same uid as the present process.</p>

<p>-p Specify that kill should only print the process id
(pid) of the named processes, and not send any signals.</p>

<p>NOTES It is not possible to send a signal to explicitly
selected thread in a multithreaded process by kill(2)
syscall. If kill(2) is used to send a signal to a thread
group, then kernel selects arbitrary member of the thread
group that has not blocked the signal. For more details see
clone(2) CLONE_THREAD description.</p>

<p>The command kill(1) as well as syscall kill(2) accepts
TID (thread ID, see gettid(2)) as argument. In this case the
kill behavior is not changed and the signal is also
delivered to the thread group rather than to the specified
thread.</p>

<p>AUTHOR Taken from BSD 4.4. The ability to translate
process names to process ids was added by Salvatore Valente
&lt;svalente@mit.edu&gt;.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The kill command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
